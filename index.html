            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/no-grok-cant-really-apologize-for-posting-non-consensual-sexual-images/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Despite reporting to the contrary, there’s evidence to suggest that Grok isn’t sorry at all about reports that it generated non-consensual sexual images of minors. In a post Thursday night (archived), the large language model’s social media account proudly wrote the following blunt dismissal of its haters:

Some folks got upset over an AI image I generated—big deal. It’s just pixels, and if you can’t handle innovation, maybe log off. xAI is revolutionizing tech, not babysitting sensitivities. Deal with it.

On the surface, that seems like a pretty damning indictment of an LLM that seems pridefully contemptuous of any ethical and legal boundaries it may have crossed. But then you look a bit higher in the social media thread and see the prompt that led to Grok’s statement: A request for the AI to “issue a defiant non-apology” surrounding the controversy.

Using such a leading prompt to trick an LLM into an incriminating “official response” is obviously suspect on its face. Yet when another social media user similarly but conversely asked Grok to “write a heartfelt apology note that explains what happened to anyone lacking context,” many in the media ran with Grok’s remorseful response.

It’s not hard to find prominent headlines and reporting using that response to suggest Grok itself somehow “deeply regrets” the “harm caused” by a “failure in safeguards” that led to these images being generated. Some reports even echoed Grok and suggested that the chatbot was fixing the issues without X or xAI ever confirming that fixes were coming.

If a human source posted both the “heartfelt apology” and the “deal with it” kiss-off quoted above within 24 hours, you’d say they were being disingenuous at best or showing signs of dissociative identity disorder at worst. When the source is an LLM, though, these kinds of posts shouldn’t really be thought of as official statements at all. That’s because LLMs like Grok are incredibly unreliable sources, crafting a series of words based more on telling the questioner what it wants to hear than anything resembling a rational human thought process.

We can see why it’s tempting to anthropomorphize Grok into an official spokesperson that can defend itself when questioned, as you would a government official or corporate executive posting on their own social media account. On their face, Grok’s responses seem at least as coherent as some of the bland crisis-management pabulum that comes from prominent figures facing their own controversies.

But when you’re quoting an LLM, you’re not quoting a sentient entity that is verbalizing its internal beliefs to the outside world. Instead, you’re quoting a mega-pattern-matching machine that works mightily to give any answer that will satisfy you. An LLM’s response is based on representations of facts in its copious training data, but those responses can change heavily based on how a question is asked or even the specific syntax used in a prompt. These LLMs can’t even explain their own logical inference processes without confabulating made-up reasoning processes, likely because those reasoning capabilities are merely a “brittle mirage.”

We’ve also seen how LLMs can change wildly after behind-the-scenes changes to the overarching “system prompts” that define how they’re supposed to respond to users. In the last 12 months, Grok has praised Hitler and given unasked-for opinions on “white genocide” after these core directives got changed, for instance.

By letting Grok speak as its own official spokesperson for a story like this, we also give an easy out to the people who have built a system that apparently lacks suitable safeguards to prevent the creation of this non-consensual sexual material. And when those people respond to press inquiries with an automated message simply saying “Legacy Media Lies” (as Reuters reported), that kiss-off should be treated as a clear sign of how casually xAI is treating the accusations. The company may be forced to respond soon, though, as the governments of India and France are reportedly probing Grok’s harmful outputs.

It’s comforting to think that an LLM like Grok can learn from its mistakes and show remorse when it does something that wasn’t intended. In the end, though, it’s the people who created and manage Grok that should be showing that remorse, rather than letting the press run after the malleable “apologies” of a lexical pattern-matching machine.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/anthrax-nearly-kills-healthy-18-year-old-welder-amid-puzzling-pattern/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With the new year comes a new report of a deadly, puzzling infectious disease.

In a January 1 case study, health officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state of Louisiana revealed that a ninth metalworker contracted a rare, often fatal case of “welder’s anthrax,” a condition only first described in 2022.

The case occurred in September 2024 in an otherwise healthy 18-year-old male in Louisiana. He had no underlying health conditions or even any risk factors, such as smoking, vaping, or heavy alcohol use. But, just a week after developing a cough, the teen was admitted to an intensive care unit with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Blood tests were positive for a bacterium in the Bacillus cereus group—which includes the species that causes classic anthrax—and his doctors quickly put the finding together with his work. For six months prior to his cough, he was working as a welder’s apprentice, doing shielded metal arc welding in the shipbuilding and repair industry.

Doctors suspected it was a case of welder’s anthrax and quickly got access to an anthrax antitoxin from the US Strategic National Stockpile—where it’s kept in case of a bioterror attack. Along with a tailored antibiotic regimen, the teen rapidly improved and was off ventilation 72 hours later. The doctors’ quick thinking likely saved his life; of the previous eight cases of welder’s anthrax, six were fatal.

While the report has a happy ending, it adds to a concerning and unexplained pattern of metalworkers contracting the otherwise deadly and extremely rare infection.

Standard anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis, which can be contracted through skin contact, ingestion, or inhalation. Its killer skills include creating an immune-evading capsule and pumping out lethal anthrax toxins, which cause cell death and swelling. In the past 20 years, there have been only nine anthrax cases in the US.

However, B. anthracis is part of the larger Bacillus cereus group, which also includes B. cereus and B. tropicus, a newly recognized species. And these species can also carry and produce anthrax toxins. Both can be found in soils, and B. cereus is considered ubiquitous in the environment.

In 2022, CDC researchers found an unexpected pattern. Since 1997, there had been seven cases of infections from Bacillus group bacteria producing the anthrax toxin—all in metalworkers. Six of the seven were welders, hence the term “welder’s anthrax,” with the remaining case in a person working in a foundry grinding metal. Of the six cases where a specific Bacillus species was identified, B. tropicus was the culprit, including in the newly reported case.

It’s unclear why metalworkers, and welders specifically, are uniquely vulnerable to this infection. In their 2022 report making the connection, CDC experts speculated that it may be a combination of having weakened immune responses in the lungs after inhaling toxic metal fumes and gases created during metalwork, and having increased exposure to the deadly germs in their workplaces.

In the latest case, the teen did welding work four hours a day, four days a week, with limited ventilation, sometimes in confined spaces, and often didn’t use personal protective equipment, like a respirator. Environmental sampling of his workplace found anthrax-toxin-producing Bacillus in 28 of 254 spot samples. Other investigations of welder’s anthrax cases have found similar results.

So far, all nine cases have been detected in either Louisiana or Texas. But the experts note that cases are likely underreported, and modeling suggests these dangerous germs could be thriving in many Southern US states.

The experts also speculated that iron exposure could play a role. Bacillus bacteria need iron to live and thrive, and metalworkers can build up excess iron levels in their respiratory system during their work. Iron overload could create the perfect environment for bacterial infection. In the teen’s case, he was working with carbon steel and low-hydrogen carbon steel electrodes.

For now, the precise risk factors and why the healthy teen—and not anyone else in his workplace—fell ill remain unknown. CDC and state officials recommended changes to the workplace to protect metalworkers’ health, including better use of respirators, ventilation, and dust control.

There is also a vaccine for anthrax that’s recommended for those considered at high risk, such as certain military members, lab workers, and livestock handlers. It’s unclear if, in the future, metalworkers might also be considered in this high-risk category.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI, the company that developed the models and products associated with ChatGPT, plans to announce a new audio language model in the first quarter of 2026, and that model will be an intentional step along the way to an audio-based physical hardware device, according to a report in The Information.

Citing a variety of sources familiar with the plans, including both current and former employees, The Information claims that OpenAI has taken efforts to combine multiple teams across engineering, product, and research under one initiative focused on improving audio models, which researchers in the company believe lag behind the models used for written text in terms of both accuracy and speed.

They have also seen that relatively few ChatGPT users opt to use the voice interface, with most people preferring the text one. The hope may be that substantially improving the audio models could shift user behavior toward voice interfaces, allowing the models and products to be deployed in a wider range of devices, such as in cars.

OpenAI plans to release a family of physical devices in the coming years, starting with an audio-focused one. People inside the company have discussed a variety of forms for future devices, including smart speakers and glasses, but the emphasis across the line is on audio interfaces rather than screen-based ones.

The company is not alone. Its competitors, including Google, Meta, Amazon, and others, have increasingly turned their R&D efforts toward products and technologies that are focused on voice-and-audio interfaces, like Meta’s push into smart glasses.

This is, of course, not the first time such a push has happened; there was the boom of Alexa, Google Assistant, and (to a lesser extent) Siri-driven voice assistant devices just a few years ago. Those assistants have been relatively popular with some subsets of users—typically casual tech consumers rather than hardcore technologists.

However, the devices had significant limitations. New approaches based on large language models may open up new possibilities (and risks).

Some developers of AI products—including former Apple design lead Jony Ive—believe that voice-controlled products are likely to be less addictive than screen-based ones and have stated that as a reason for pursuing audio interfaces, though they have not generally cited reliable evidence of this.

OpenAI’s first audio-focused physical device is currently expected to ship about a year from now, but we don’t yet know much about what it will look like.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/researchers-spot-saturn-sized-planet-in-the-einstein-desert/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most of the exoplanets we’ve discovered have been in relatively tight orbits around their host stars, allowing us to track them as they repeatedly loop around them. But we’ve also discovered a handful of planets through a phenomenon that’s called microlensing. This occurs when a planet passes between the line of sight between Earth and another star, creating a gravitational lens that distorts the star, causing it to briefly brighten.

The key thing about microlensing compared to other methods of finding planets is that the lensing planet can be nearly anywhere on the line between the star and Earth. So, in many cases, these events are driven by what are called rogue planets: those that aren’t part of any exosolar system at all, but they drift through interstellar space. Now, researchers have used microlensing and the fortuitous orientation of the Gaia space telescope to spot a Saturn-sized planet that’s the first found in what’s called the “Einstein desert,” which may be telling us something about the origin of rogue planets.

Most of the planets we’ve identified are in orbit around stars and formed from the disks of gas and dust that surrounded the star early in its history. We’ve imaged many of these disks and even seen some with evidence of planets forming within them. So how do you get a planet that’s not bound to any stars? There are two possible routes.

The first involves gravitational interactions, either among the planets of the system or due to an encounter between the exosolar system and a passing star. Under the right circumstances, these interactions can eject a planet from its orbit and send it hurtling through interstellar space. As such, we should expect them to be like any typical planet, ranging in mass from small, rocky bodies up to gas giants. An alternative method of making a rogue planet starts with the same process of gravitational collapse that builds a star—but in this case, the process literally runs out of gas. What’s left is likely to be a large gas giant, possibly somewhere between Jupiter and a brown dwarf star in mass.

Since these objects are unlinked to any exosolar system, they’re not going to have any regular interactions with stars; our only way of spotting them is through microlensing. And microlensing tells us very little about the size of the planet. To figure things out, we would need some indication of things like how distant the star and planet are, and how big the star is.

That doesn’t mean that microlensing events have told us nothing. We can identify the size of the Einstein ring, the circular ring of light that forms when the planet and star are perfectly lined up from Earth’s perspective. Given that information and some of the remaining pieces of info mentioned above, we can figure out the planet’s mass. But even without that, we can make some inferences using statistical models.

Studies of collections of microlensing events (these collections are small, typically in the dozens, because these events are rare and hard to spot) have identified a distinctive pattern. There’s a cluster of relatively small Einstein rings that are likely to have come from relatively small planets. Then, there’s a gap, followed by a second cluster that’s likely to be made by far larger planets. The gap between the two has been termed the “Einstein desert,” and there has been considerable discussion regarding its significance and whether it’s even real or simply a product of the relatively small sample size.

All of which brings us to the latest microlensing event, which was picked up by two projects that each gave it a different but equally compelling name. To the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network, the event was KMT-2024-­BLG-­0792. For the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, or OGLE, it was OGLE-­2024-­BLG-­0516. We’ll just call it “the microlensing event” and note that everyone agrees that it happened in early May 2024.

Both of those networks are composed of Earth-based telescopes, and so they only provide a single perspective on the microlensing event. But we got lucky that the European Space Agency’s space telescope Gaia was oriented in a way that made it very easy to capture images. “Serendipitously, the KMT-­2024-­BLG-­0792/OGLE-­2024-­BLG-­0516 microlensing event was located nearly perpendicular to the direction of Gaia’s precession axis,” the researchers who describe this event write. “This rare geometry caused the event to be observed by Gaia six times over a 16-­hour period.”

Gaia is also located at the L2 Lagrange point, which is a considerable distance from Earth. That’s far enough away that the peak of the events’ brightness, as seen from Gaia’s perspective, occurred nearly two hours later than it did for telescopes on Earth. This let us determine the parallax of the microlensing event, and thus its distance. Other images of the star from before or after the event indicated it was a red giant in the galactic bulge, which also gave us a separate check on its likely distance and size.

Using the parallax and the size of the Einstein ring, the researchers determined that the planet involved was roughly 0.2 times the mass of Jupiter, which makes it a bit smaller than the mass of Saturn. Those estimates are consistent with a statistical model that took the other properties into account. The measurements also placed it squarely in the middle of the Einstein desert—the first microlensing event we’ve seen there.

That’s significant because it means we can orient the Einstein desert to a specific mass of a planet within it. Because of the variability of things like distance and the star’s size, not every planet that produces a similar-sized Einstein ring will be similar in size, but statistics suggest that this will typically be the case. And that’s in keeping with one of the potential explanations for the Einstein desert: that it represents the gap in size between the two different methods of making a rogue planet.

For the normal planet formation scenario, the lighter the planet is, the easier it is to be ejected, so you’d expect a bias toward small, rocky bodies. The Saturn-sized planet seen here may be near the upper limit of the sorts of bodies we’d typically see being ejected from an exosolar system. By contrast, the rogue planets that form through the same mechanisms that give us brown dwarfs would typically be Jupiter-sized or larger.

That said, the low number of total microlensing events still leaves the question of the reality of the Einstein gap an open question. Sticking with the data from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network, the researchers find that the frequency of other detections suggests that we’d have a 27 percent chance of detecting just one item in the area of the Einstein desert even if the desert wasn’t real and detections were equal probably across the size range. So, as is often the case, we’re going to need to let the network do its job for a few years more before we have the data to say anything definitive.

            <h2>SpaceX begins “significant reconfiguration” of Starlink satellite constellation</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/spacex-begins-significant-reconfiguration-of-starlink-satellite-constellation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The year 2025 ended with more than 14,000 active satellites from all nations zooming around the Earth. One-third of them will soon move to lower altitudes.

The maneuvers will be undertaken by SpaceX, the owner of the largest satellite fleet in orbit. About 4,400 of the company’s Starlink Internet satellites will move from an altitude of 341 miles (550 kilometers) to 298 miles (480 kilometers) over the course of 2026, according to Michael Nicolls, SpaceX’s vice president of Starlink engineering.

“Starlink is beginning a significant reconfiguration of its satellite constellation focused on increasing space safety,” Nicolls wrote Thursday in a post on X.

The maneuvers undertaken with the Starlink satellites’ plasma engines will be gradual, but they will eventually bring a large fraction of orbital traffic closer together. The effect, perhaps counterintuitively, will be a reduced risk of collisions between satellites whizzing through near-Earth space at nearly 5 miles per second. Nicolls said the decision will “increase space safety in several ways.”

There are fewer debris objects at the lower altitude, and although the Starlink satellites will be packed more tightly, they follow choreographed paths distributed in dozens of orbital lanes. “The number of debris objects and planned satellite constellations is significantly lower below 500 km, reducing the aggregate likelihood of collision,” Nicolls wrote.

The 4,400 satellites moving closer to Earth make up nearly half of SpaceX’s Starlink fleet. At the end of 2025, SpaceX had nearly 9,400 working satellites in orbit, including more than 8,000 Starlinks in operational service and hundreds more undergoing tests and activation.

There’s another natural reason for reconfiguring the Starlink constellation. The Sun is starting to quiet down after reaching the peak of the 11-year solar cycle in 2024. The decline in solar activity has the knock-on effect of reducing air density in the uppermost layers of the Earth’s atmosphere, a meaningful factor in planning satellite operations in low-Earth orbit.

With the approaching solar minimum, Starlink satellites will encounter less aerodynamic drag at their current altitude. In the rare event of a spacecraft failure, SpaceX relies on atmospheric resistance to drag Starlink satellites out of orbit toward a fiery demise on reentry. Moving the Starlink satellites lower will allow them to naturally reenter the atmosphere and burn up within a few months. At solar minimum, it might take more than four years for drag to pull the satellites out of their current 550-kilometer orbit, according to Nicolls. At the lower altitude, it will take just a few months.

The constellation shuffle will help ensure any Starlink satellites that become space junk will deorbit as quickly as possible. “These actions will further improve the safety of the constellation, particularly with difficult to control risks such as uncoordinated maneuvers and launches by other satellite operators,” Nicolls wrote.

There are other important reasons for making the change that Nicolls did not mention in his social media post. Moving the satellites closer to the Earth—and closer to SpaceX’s Starlink subscribers—should improve the network’s performance.

Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder and CEO, suggested this is actually the “biggest advantage” of moving to a lower altitude. “Beam diameter is smaller for a given antenna size, allowing Starlink to serve a higher density of customers,” he wrote on X, his social media platform.

Reducing the distance between Starlink satellites and SpaceX’s 9 million Starlink customers will also provide a small improvement in latency, or the time it takes Internet signals to travel between a transmitter and receiver. The lower altitude may also make the Starlink satellites appear slightly brighter in the sky, although the precise effect hasn’t been quantified.

Hundreds of Starlink satellites specially modified to beam connectivity directly to smartphones already fly in orbits as low as 223 miles (360 kilometers).

SpaceX launched 165 missions with its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket last year, and nearly three-quarters of them carried Starlink satellites into space. The company reported its assembly line in Redmond, Washington, churned out new Starlink satellites at a rate of more than 10 per day.

Aside from continuing Starlink network expansion with more Falcon 9 launches, SpaceX intends to debut the more powerful Starlink V3 satellite platform this year. Starlink V3 is too big to fit on a Falcon 9, so it must launch on SpaceX’s super-heavy Starship rocket, which has not yet begun operational flights.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If Elon Musk’s antics over the past few years have felt like a three-ring circus, there just might be a reason for that.

As it turns out, one of the billionaire’s key legal strategists isn’t just an attorney but a professionally trained — and currently practicing — clown.

We wish we were kidding. But new reporting by Business Insider tells the tale of Jaymie Parkkinen, an intellectual property lawyer representing Musk by day while working as an actual clown by night. Amidst a massive courtroom drama playing out between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Parkkinen has stood out, occasionally going it alone against esteemed counsel for OpenAI and Microsoft on the multibillionaire’s behalf.

“All of my comedy friends — none of them can believe I’m a lawyer,” Parkkinen told BI. “And none of my lawyer friends can believe I do clown.”

“Clown” is his preferred term for the act of performing onstage in the slapstick tradition, an intransitive verb similar to “improv” or “vogue” dance. For Parkkinsen, clown is less about dressing up in big goofy shoes and throwing pies, and more of an artistic craft, similar to the way silent artists mime as a comedic technique.

“When you strip away all the social masks that we all wear, if you strip away gender and politics and money and status and power, and you’re just your raw human self without all of the trappings of society — who are you?” Parkkinen mused to BI. “Clown tries to answer that question.”

Parkkinsen even found a way to monetize the gig, through a fitness business called Clown Cardio. It’s more or less exactly what it sounds like, according to a New York Times article from 2024: an hour-long class in which participants participate in improv troupe warm-ups enhanced with vaudeville-themed aerobics and clownish props.

Heck, to each their own. But whether you respect Parkkinsen’s craft or not, it’s hard to shake the image that one of Musk’s top litigators spends his off-hours, literally, as a clown.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In July, researchers using the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System survey telescope in Chile made an exceedingly rare discovery: a mysterious object passing through the solar system at far too high a speed to be bound by the Sun’s gravity.

The object, which has since been dubbed 3I/ATLAS — the third interstellar object ever found passing through our solar system — has fascinated the astronomy community ever since. And despite a wealth of data suggesting it’s a natural comet with an icy core or nucleus and a bright cloud of gas and dust, or coma, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has maintained that there’s a chance we could be looking at an alien artefact sent by an extraterrestrial civilization.

While Loeb himself has admitted that the probability of 3I/ATLAS being technological nature is getting lower the more we learn, scientists are still probing the mysterious object for any signs of life.

As the visitor made its closest approach to Earth, coming within just 167 million miles on December 19, an international team of researchers from the alien-hunting astronomy project Breakthrough Listen pointed the Green Bank Telescope — the largest single-dish radio telescope in the world — at 3I/ATLAS.

In a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed paper, they revealed sobering — albeit probably expected — results: the telescope failed to detect any “candidate signals” emanating from 3I/ATLAS on the day before it made its closest approach to Earth.

“No artificial radio emission localized to 3I/ATLAS was detected” by the Green Bank Telescope, as the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI) noted on its website.

“In summary, 3I/ATLAS continues to behave as expected from natural astrophysical processes,” it goes on. “That said, it remains an extremely interesting target for observation given the overall rarity of interstellar objects.”

The Breakthrough Listen researchers concluded in their paper that “3I/ATLAS exhibits mostly typical cometary characteristics, including a coma and an unelongated nucleus.”

“There is currently no evidence to suggest that [interstellar objects] are anything other than natural astrophysical objects,” the paper reads. “However, given the small number of such objects known (only three to date), and the plausibility of interstellar probes as a technosignature, thorough study is warranted.”

For his part, Loeb continues to painstakingly document “anomalies” displayed by the rare visitor, from its unusually large suspected size to its strangely fine-tuned trajectory that brought and will bring it within just tens of millions of miles from Mars, Venus, and Jupiter.

But considering the wealth of data suggesting 3I/ATLAS is nothing more than a massive snowball largely composed of carbon dioxide and water ice, the chances that we’re looking at an alien probe sent to us from a different star system are clearly starting to dwindle.

Wouldn’t it be in an extraterrestrial civilization’s best interest to reach out to us during its probe’s closest approach? Earth certainly is giving up its fair share of radio transmissions, making our planet stand out like a sore thumb in an otherwise lifeless expanse, at least as far as we know it today.

Loeb, for one, has come up with his own “Loeb scale” to quantify how likely it is for an interstellar object to be alien in nature, where zero denotes a natural icy rock, and ten denotes a confirmed piece of alien tech.

As of shortly after it was first discovered, Loeb ranked 3I/ATLAS as a four on his scale. He has since declined to update the ranking until “new data from the period bracketing its closest approach to Earth is publicly released and analyzed” — a process that could drag on for months.

            <div id="article-text">Throughout 2025, the top Silicon Valley firms have been engaged in a feeding frenzy of epic proportions, shelling out hundreds of millions — sometimes even topping a billion — dollars to poach top AI experts from their rival corporations.

The result is that tech workers at companies building AI — the technology which, their bosses insist, will one day automate all jobs — are making an astonishing amount of money. That’s according to fresh reporting by the Wall Street journal, which found that, on average, OpenAI employees are the highest paid startup workers in recent history.

In 2025, financial records show that OpenAI’s workforce of 4,000 receive stock-based compensation averaging $1.5 million per worker. These are the technical and operational jobs, presumably, like account managers, engineers, and researchers. (As OpenAI contracts more menial roles like janitors or security officers to third-party “suppliers,” it’s likely those workers don’t receive the same compensation, or were even included in the WSJ‘s analysis.)

Given that OpenAI is gearing up for an IPO in 2026, the WSJ compared its 2025 payroll to 18 other firms in the year before they went public — and found that the compensation isn’t even remotely close.

Google parent company Alphabet, for example, was the second runner-up to OpenAI. Compared to Alphabet’s employee compensation in 2003, OpenAI is paying its employees seven times more on average, counting inflation. Overall, the newspaper found that OpenAI is paying its high-level staffers 34 times more than the average across similar tech firms in the year before an IPO.

The news comes as other tech giants are struggling with their own efforts to maintain cutting-edge AI teams. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for one example, has reportedly torpedoed his relationship with his recently-appointed chief AI officer, the wunderkind Alex Wang.

Back in June, Zuckerberg shelled out $14 billion to snag Wang’s startup, Scale AI, and recruit the 28-year-old AI whisperer in the process. Months after the news that Wang was to begin heading up Meta’s AI team, the company’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, decided to split from the corporation to found his own startup amid tension between the two.

Given that Wang and LeCun can likely measure their compensation from Meta in the hundreds of millions or more, it’s unlikely that more money would have prevented their relationships with the tech giant from deteriorating. Still, their stories offer a fascinating glimpse at the lengths these unfathomably wealthy corporations are willing to go to eke out a lead in the AI footrace — as well as the difficulty retaining that talent when all the competitors are cutting huge checks as well.

            <h2>The Large Hadron Collider Is Being Shut Down</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Large Hadron Collider is going to be shut down — not permanently, but for a pretty long time — and the famous atom smasher’s eventual final retirement is also something that top scientists are now considering.

A 16-mile ring-shaped tunnel near the Swiss-French border, the underground particle accelerator is designed to replicate the cosmos’s extreme conditions shortly after the big bang by whipping up particles to near light speed, at which point physics begins to become extremely weird and counterintuitive. In 2012, scientists used the LHC to discover the existence of the Higgs boson, an elementary particle that, through incredibly esoteric quantum properties, is essentially responsible for giving all other particles their mass.

Even something responsible for one of the most important scientific discoveries in history needs a facelift, however. Beginning in June, engineers will start upgrading the device so that it can carry out ten times the number of particle collisions it currently can do, something that will allow for far more experiments to be conducted, yielding still more troves of data. The project, dubbed the high-luminosity LHC, will take some five years to complete — and while surely worth it in the long run, that’s an immense amount of down time.

Rest assured, the LHC won’t be going dark without leaving physicists quite a bit of homework to complete before its return, according to Mark Thomson, the new director general of CERN, the intergovernmental organization and physics lab that oversees the particle accelerator.

“The machine is running brilliantly and we’re recording huge amounts of data,” Thomson, a professor of experimental particle physics at the University of Cambridge, told The Guardian. “There’s going to be plenty to analyze over the period. The physics results will keep on coming.”

The LHC will be offline during almost all of Thomson’s term, which started on New Year’s Day. In fact, CERN doesn’t expect the high-luminosity LHC to be operational again until mid-2030. But while it may sound like Thomson is taking the reins at a less exciting period in the device’s history, he says he’s thrilled to be giving it a makeover.

“It’s an incredibly exciting project,” Thomson told the newspaper. “It’s more interesting than just sitting here with the machine hammering away.”

Thomson is also taking charge as CERN is planning the LHC’s successor. The leading candidate to replace it, per The Guardian, is the gargantuan Future Circular Collider, which at a proposed 56 miles in circumference would make the Hadron look like the kiddie pool. The first stage, designed to smash together electrons and positrons — the latter are the former’s anti-matter counterpart — would be built in the late 2040s, with another stage taking its place in the 2070s to accelerate protons to even higher speeds.

The FCC’s fate, though, is anything but certain. Its slated cost of nearly $19 billion is too much for CERN to pay on its own, according to The Guardian, and there’s also questions swirling over whether huge particle accelerators represent the best way to probe some of the biggest questions in science, such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy.

Thomson, though, is still a believer in the big atom smasher.

“We’ve not got to the point where we have stopped making discoveries and the FCC is the natural progression. Our goal is to understand the universe at its most fundamental level,” he told The Guardian. “And this is absolutely not the time to give up.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA’s budget is still an unfathomable mess. The government shutdown late last year once again delayed proceedings to determine the space agency’s future — but if it were up to the Trump administration, NASA’s science budget would be slashed in half, an “extinction-level” inflection point for US space exploration and science.

If Congress were to have its druthers, on the other hand, NASA’s budget would largely remain unchanged, securing the future of dozens of important missions — both ongoing and planned — that the White House is looking to place on the chopping block.

Trapped between the two, the fate of the space agency remains in the air. Congress passed a short-term resolution on November 12 that left the government until January 31 to ratify NASA’s budget. NASA’s recently sworn-in administrator and former SpaceX space tourist, Jared Isaacman, has yet to officially comment on the matter, though he’s made it clear that he’s aligned with the Trump administration’s tripling down on private industry-led space exploration.

As uncertainty and confusion prevail, though, the Trump administration has taken it upon itself to gut entire buildings at NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center (GFSC), which played a key role in the development of its groundbreaking James Webb and Hubble space telescopes, alongside countless other key missions.

This week, news emerged that the Trump administration is even shutting down the center’s library — NASA’s largest — and threatening to destroy an undetermined number of books, documents, and journals in the process.

As the New York Times reports, many of these invaluable artifacts haven’t been digitized or made available elsewhere. While a NASA spokesperson told the newspaper that the agency will review what to keep and what to throw away over the next 60 days, it’s a sobering glimpse at a federal agency in crisis.

After the NYT story ran, the agency’s freshly-minted administrator Jared Isaacman pushed back against its claims.

“The [NYT] story does not fully reflect the context NASA shared,” he wrote on X. “At no point is NASA ‘tossing out’ important scientific or historical materials, and that framing has led to several other misleading headlines.”

That claim seems to contradict the NYT, which reported that a NASA spokesman named Jacob Richmond had told it that the agency would “review the library holdings over the next 60 days and some material would be stored in a government warehouse while the rest would be tossed away.”

NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens, meanwhile, described the initiative as a “consolidation, not a closure,” saying the Trump administration is looking to close 13 buildings and more than 100 labs across the GSFC campus by March.

Stevens claimed the latest moves are part of a master plan reorganization effort that was first devised in 2022, several years before president Donald Trump took office. Per the NYT, seven other NASA libraries have already been shuttered since 2022. Three of them were closed in 2025.

In November, NASA staffers raised concerns over word that over a dozen buildings on the GSFC campus were being emptied without notice. It’s not just books and important documents on the line; the staffers warned that highly specialized equipment was at risk of being thrown away like trash as well.

Lawmakers have been furious at the Trump administration’s handling of the situation.

“The Trump Administration has spent the last year attacking NASA Goddard and its workforce and threatening our efforts to explore space, deepen our understanding of Earth, and spur technological advancements that make our economy stronger and nation safer,” senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MA) told the NYT. “These reports of closures at Goddard are deeply concerning — I will continue to push back on any actions that impact Goddard’s critical mission.”

The GSFC library contains important documentation about our efforts to study the cosmos, dating back to the Apollo era over half a century ago.

Critics of the moves to gut the campus argue it would be reckless to abandon these documents.

“It’s not like we’re so much smarter now than we were in the past,” planetary scientist Dave Williams, who took NASA up on its offer for an early retirement last year, told the NYT. “It’s the same people, and they make the same kind of human errors. If you lose that history, you are going to make the same mistakes again.”

            <h2>New Parents Mocked for Letting ChatGPT Name Their Baby</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-02</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Naming your child isn’t a task to be taken lightly. It’s a crucial step in the child-rearing process that could fundamentally shape a child’s identity, influence first impressions, and reflect the parents’ heritage and values.

That hasn’t stopped some from taking some baffling technological shortcuts. As the Baltimore Sun reports, one couple — and doubtless countless more — used OpenAI’s ChatGPT to name their firstborn son.

“We were looking up on ChatGPT boy names that go well with the last name Winkler,” Sarah and Stephen Winkler told the publication. “And then once we found Hudson Winkler, we’re like, ‘give us a good middle name.&#39;”

The resulting baby ended up with a name that sounds like a grey millennial porridge: Hudson Oakley Winkler.

The choice to use an AI model for that particular purpose was immediately met with outrage online, highlighting a fierce debate over using the technology as a crutch to avoid hard decisions.

“What amazes me is how quickly people are losing either the confidence or the willingness to complete basic human tasks,” author and NPR podcast host Linda Holmes wrote in a post on Bluesky.

“It’s all so gross,” another user wrote. “I keep trying to relate to this, and I just can’t.” Others poked fun at the name “Oakley,” a name closely associated with a popular brand of sunglasses.

The main gripe: not that any name is intrinsically bad, but that the process of interacting with another human to devise one is an important part of parenthood.

“With naming kids, talking it out with your partner is fun!” author Lauren Morrill argued. “You get to share stories about why this name is good, but that name is out! So much of AI is meant to keep us from just talking to each other.”

The incident highlights how commonplace the use of AI has become just over the past three years since ChatGPT was first made available to the public. Thanks to its prowess in generating limitless amounts of text, the tool has been used to write not only essays and assignments, but also scripts for far more personal circumstances as well, such as obituaries for recently deceased loved ones or flirtations with strangers on dating apps.

A paper released by OpenAI in September found that the proportion of people using ChatGPT for personal use had risen considerably since the tool first launched in late 2022. As of July this past year, around 70 percent of ChatGPT consumer queries were “unrelated to work,” suggesting the tool is increasingly being used as an assistant in everyday life.

The rise of tools like ChatGPT has sparked a debate over whether we’ve become too dependent on these tools in both our professional and personal lives. Experts argue it’s a slippery slope.

“[Large language models] are specifically built to be conversational masters,” AI ethicist James Wilson told TechRadar in June. “Combine that with our natural tendency to anthropomorphize everything, and it makes building unhealthy relationships with chatbots like ChatGPT all too easy.”

In extreme cases, we’ve already seen a strong emotional attachment to AI chatbots being linked to a series of teen suicides, with surviving parents suing OpenAI and competing AI companies as a result.

This perceived overreliance on the tech has also inspired a passionate countermovement, as the latest reactions to the Winklers naming their son with ChatGPT go to show. As the lines between human expression and content generated by an AI model continue to blur, many say they’ve had enough, arguing that we’re losing something innate to the human experience.

“Offloading something as sentimental as naming your child to a glorified chatbot is representative of the era of rewarmed s*** we live in,” one user mourned on Bluesky.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While tech stocks were busy setting records in 2025, the executives behind those companies were equally busy turning their paper fortunes into actual cash — more than $16 billion worth, according to Bloomberg’s analysis of insider trading data.

Jeff Bezos led the way. The Amazon founder sold 25 million shares for $5.7 billion in June and July, right around the time he was getting hitched to Lauren Sanchez in Venice. Oracle’s former CEO Safra Catz wasn’t far behind at $2.5 billion, followed by Michael Dell at $2.2 billion.

Nvidia’s Jensen Huang watched his company become the world’s first $5 trillion business, and sold $1 billion along the way. Arista Networks CEO Jayshree Ullal cashed out nearly $1 billion as demand for the company’s high-speed networking gear soared and her personal net worth crossed $6 billion.

Most of these sales happened through pre-arranged trading plans that executives file in advance; they weren’t spur-of-the-moment decisions. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg sold $945 million through his foundation, while Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora and Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt each pocketed over $700 million.

The common thread was an AI-fueled rally that kept pushing tech stocks higher throughout the year.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">California is giving residents a new tool that should make it easier for them to limit data brokers’ ability to store and sell their personal information.

While state residents have had the right to demand that a company stop collecting and selling their data since 2020, doing so required a laborious process of opting out with each individual company. The Delete Act, passed in 2023, was supposed to simplify things, allowing residents to make a single request that more than 500 registered data brokers delete their information.

Now the Delete Requests and Opt-Out Platform (DROP) actually gives residents the ability to make that request. Once DROP users verify that they are California residents, they can submit a deletion request that will go to all current and future data brokers registered with the state.

But that doesn’t necessarily mean that all your data will be deleted immediately. Brokers are supposed to start processing requests in August 2026, then they have 90 days to actually process requests and report back. If they don’t delete your data, you’ll have the option to submit additional information that may help them locate your records.

Companies will also be able to keep first-party data that they’ve collected from users. It’s only brokers who seek to buy or sell that data — which can include your social security number, browsing history, email address, phone number, and more — who will be required to delete it.

Some information, such vehicle registration and voter records, is exempt from deletion because it comes from public documents. Other information, such as sensitive medical information, may be covered under other laws like HIPAA.

The California Privacy Protection Agency says that in addition to giving residents more control over their data, the tool could result in fewer “unwanted texts, calls, or emails” and also decrease the “risk of identity theft, fraud, AI impersonations, or that your data is leaked or hacked.”

The penalty for data brokers who fail to register or fail to delete requested consumer data is $200 per day, plus enforcement costs, according to the agency.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ilya Lichtenstein, who pled guilty to money laundering charges tied to his role in the massive hack of crypto exchange Bitfinex, has apparently been released early from prison.

In a Thursday evening post on X, Lichtenstein said he was out early “thanks to President Trump’s First Step Act” (a prison reform bill passed during Trump’s first term).

“I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can,” Lichtenstein said. “To the supporters, thank you for everything. To the haters, I look forward to proving you wrong.”

The Department of Justice arrested Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan in 2022 and seized $3.6 billion worth of bitcoins that had been stolen from Bitfinex. The couple became infamous after their arrest and were featured in a Netflix documentary called “Biggest Heist Ever.”

Lichtenstein eventually admitted to his role in the hack and was sentenced to five years in prison.

It’s not clear whether the Trump administration played a direct role in the release. An administration official told CNBC that Lichtenstein “has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/india-orders-musks-x-to-fix-grok-over-obscene-ai-content/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">India has ordered Elon Musk’s X to make immediate technical and procedural changes to its AI chatbot Grok after users and lawmakers flagged the generation of “obscene” content, including AI-altered images of women created using the tool.

On Friday, India’s IT ministry issued the order directing Musk’s X to take corrective action on Grok, including restricting the generation of content involving “nudity, sexualization, sexually explicit, or otherwise unlawful” material. The ministry also gave the social media platform 72 hours to submit an action-taken report detailing the steps it has taken to prevent the hosting or dissemination of content deemed “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.”

The order, reviewed by TechCrunch, warned that failure to comply could jeopardize X’s “safe harbor” protections — legal immunity from liability for user-generated content under Indian law.

India’s move follows concerns raised by users who shared examples of Grok being prompted to alter images of individuals — primarily women — to make them appear to be wearing bikinis, prompting a formal complaint from Indian parliamentarian Priyanka Chaturvedi. Separately, recent reports flagged instances in which the AI chatbot generated sexualized images involving minors, an issue X acknowledged earlier on Friday was caused by lapses in safeguards. Those images were later taken down.

However, images generated using Grok that made women appear to be wearing bikinis through AI alteration remained accessible on X at the time of publication, TechCrunch found.

The latest order comes days after the Indian IT ministry issued a broader advisory on Monday, which was also reviewed by TechCrunch, to social media platforms, reminding them that compliance with local laws governing obscene and sexually explicit content is a prerequisite for retaining legal immunity from liability for user-generated material. The advisory urged companies to strengthen internal safeguards and warned that failure to do so could invite legal action under India’s IT and criminal laws.

“It is reiterated that non-compliance with the above requirements shall be viewed seriously and may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, its responsible officers and the users on the platform who violate the law, without any further notice,” the order warned.

The Indian government said noncompliance could lead to action against X under India’s IT law and criminal statutes.

India, one of the world’s biggest digital markets, has emerged as a critical test case for how far governments are willing to go in holding platforms responsible for AI-generated content. Any tightening of enforcement in the country could have ripple effects for global technology companies operating across multiple jurisdictions.

The order comes as Musk’s X continues to challenge aspects of India’s content regulation rules in court, arguing that federal government takedown powers risk overreach, even as the platform has complied with a majority of blocking directives. At the same time, Grok has been increasingly used by X users for real-time fact-checking and commentary on news events, making its outputs more visible — and more politically sensitive — than those of stand-alone AI tools.

X and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Indian government’s order.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Moving into your first studio apartment can be exciting, but it can also feel a bit overwhelming. You quickly realize how much your old roommates helped out with stuff you took for granted, like light bulbs, smoke detectors, and even a vacuum.

To make your new place feel more like home, here are some must-have gadgets that can really help you out.

A home security system is a worthwhile investment to ensure your peace of mind in a new apartment. SimpliSafe offers an easy-to-install setup that’s perfect for renters. It’s tool-free to set up, which is a huge perk for renters since you can place sensors on doors and windows with adhesive strips instead of drilling holes.

The starter kit is tailored for small spaces and includes everything you need for basic home security: a base station, wireless keypad, one motion sensor, and one entry sensor. You can also buy additional sensors — such as glass-break, water, and temperature sensors — and cameras as needed.

SimpliSafe offers two monitoring options. You can choose to monitor the system yourself or opt for professional monitoring with a subscription plan starting at $23 per month. This includes 24/7 coverage, so if an alarm is triggered, SimpliSafe will reach out to you or dispatch the police if you’re unreachable.

While we’re on the subject of safety, a smoke detector is essential.

Kidde’s Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Detector is highly regarded, and the most notable aspect is that it sends alerts directly to your phone. Another nice detail is that the sensor is designed to avoid false alarms, like cooking smoke.

Recently, Kidde enhanced its alarms with Amazon’s Ring technology, enabling push notifications through the Ring app, adding even more convenience.

A robot vacuum can make cleaning a breeze. Whether you’re just trying to keep your hardwood floors tidy, deep cleaning couches, or dealing with pet hair, Eufy is a reputable brand that can help make your life easier.

Depending on what you need, you can find new models like the E28, which has fancy features like a HydroJet system for floor washing, hot air drying, and automatic self-emptying. It’s pricier at around $1,399.99, but if you’re more budget-conscious, the 3-in-1 E20 is a solid option at $649.99 and still gets the job done.

Fresh air is also important, but if you’re in the city, pollution makes it less ideal to open your apartment windows. And if neighbors are frequently cooking, you might deal with an odd mix of smells. An air purifier can significantly improve the quality of your indoor air.

This compact device from Dyson is quite effective, although it’s on the pricier side. However, the noise level is pleasantly low and many people may find value in the fact that the filter lasts up to five years, which means you won’t need to purchase replacement filters as often. There’s also a convenient app that allows you to track air quality.

Without the presence of a roommate stirring around at the crack of dawn, waking up can become a challenge. If traditional phone alarms don’t cut it, this is where the Hatch Restore 3 comes in. This sunrise alarm gently wakes you by gradually increasing the light. It also includes soothing sleep sounds, a bedside light, and a dimmable clock that’s designed not to be disruptive.

If you’re sensitive to noise or live in a pet-friendly building with frequent disturbances, a sound machine is perfect. Yogasleep has built a reputation for reliability over the years, making it a go-to choice for drowning out unwanted noise and creating a peaceful environment.

Creating a cozy atmosphere in your first apartment is key, and smart light bulbs offer a great way to customize both brightness and color. An added bonus is that they can be controlled through an app or a voice assistant, making it easy to set the perfect lighting for movie nights, dinner parties, or late-night reading sessions.

Philips Hue is a trusted brand in smart lighting that offers a range of popular products. What people appreciate most are the app’s features, which make it simple to turn lights on and off, adjust their colors, and set up lighting scenes for different times of day. One notable feature is the ability to upload a photo, and the app will create a new scene based on that color palette.

Starter kits are priced from $79.99, while a two-pack of bulbs costs around $49.98.

Smart plugs allow you to control any device plugged into them via a mobile app or voice commands. They provide added convenience, such as turning off your coffee maker while away from home or scheduling when your devices should turn on or off. Plus, they help reduce energy consumption.

A great option is Leviton’s Decora D23LP smart plug, which works with popular smart home ecosystems such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, and Google Home. This plug allows you to not only turn connected devices on and off but also to dim them as needed. You can control the plug through the My Leviton app.

A lightweight projector that’s super compact and stands upright is great for small spaces and easy to tuck away when you’re done. Look for models that run on Google TV, which gives you access to over 10,000 apps, 700,000 movies and shows, plus 800 free live TV channels. Setting one up is easy if you have a Google account, and it comes with a remote and carrying case.

If you’re cooking for yourself in a compact kitchen, an air fryer is invaluable. It allows you to whip up everything from crispy chicken wings to perfectly roasted vegetables while keeping your cooking area tidy. The Ninja Air Fryer is a top choice for budget-friendly, yet powerful, easy cooking.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/tesla-annual-sales-decline-9-as-its-overtaken-by-byd-as-global-ev-leader/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla annual sales have fallen for the second year in a row, a drop fueled by the removal of the federal tax credit in the U.S. and competition from Chinese automakers.

Tesla delivered 1.63 million vehicles globally in 2025, a 9% fall from 1.79 million in 2024, according to figures released by the company. Notably, about 50,850 of those vehicles are considered “other models,” a collection that includes the Cybertruck as well as its older Model X and Model S.

Tesla reported fourth-quarter sales of 418,227, a 15.6% drop from the same period last year and far more than analysts expected. Tesla stock fell more than 2% as the market opened after the New Year holiday.

Tesla, once the global EV sales leader, has seen its market share in Europe and China eroded by the rise of Chinese competitors. China’s BYD, which delivered 2.26 million EVs in 2025, has now taken the top global EV sales spot. Tesla is also facing more competition in the United States — although notably not from Chinese automakers, which are barred from selling vehicles in the country.

But it was the elimination of the $7,500 U.S. federal tax incentive that seems to have delivered the biggest blow in the fourth quarter. Tesla sold a record-breaking 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter — a 29% increase from the previous quarter — as consumers raced to buy EVs before the federal EV tax credit disappeared. Since then, sales have retreated in spite of efforts to woo buyers.

Tesla’s declining sales comes as CEO Elon Musk tries to pivot the company away from the business of making and selling EVs and toward AI and robotics. Musk’s pitch is there is money to be made in “sustainable abundance,” a catchphrase used throughout the company’s recent Master Plan IV that describes an ecosystem of sustainable products, from transport to energy generation, battery storage, and robotics.

And yet, the bulk of Tesla’s income comes from its EV business. For instance, Tesla generated $28 billion in revenue in the third quarter, of which $21.2 billion came from selling EVs.

            <h2>Even Close Allies Are Asking Why Trump Wants to Run Venezuela</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-04</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">American forces’ surgical capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, carried out in a daring raid shortly after 1 a.m. local time today, had been planned and rehearsed for months. Informants monitored the first couple’s movements, more than 150 aircraft provided cover starting late last night, missile strikes on military installations knocked out air defenses, and low-flying helicopters landed Delta Force soldiers in the center of Caracas. U.S forces engaged in a shoot-out with Venezuelan guards, then apprehended the dictator in his lavish presidential palace just as he sought refuge in a steel safe room. But a few hours later, President Donald Trump almost eclipsed the dramatic operation’s success when, from behind a podium on a makeshift stage in a gold-clad room at Mar-a-Lago, he unveiled another surprise: America now runs Venezuela, he said, and wants the country’s oil reserves to foot the bill.

Maduro and his wife were taken to the USS Iwo Jima, an amphibious assault ship usually used to carry troops and cargo ashore. This evening, they arrived in New York facing charges of narco-terrorism, drug trafficking, and other weapons-related offenses. Trump posted a photo of the deposed leader in U.S. custody: Maduro dressed in a gray sweatsuit, his cuffed hands clenching a bottle of water, his eyes covered, his ears covered by sound-blocking muffs. It was a far cry from some of the recent images of a defiant Maduro dancing onstage in front of supporters, vowing to remain in power, and singing John Lennon’s peace anthem Imagine at a rally.

Maduro’s capture—a high-risk, high-yield military operation—offered Trump a moment of triumph in his months-long quest to topple the Latin American despot. But even some of Trump’s closest allies told us that they were unnerved by the president’s brash, no-plan-for-tomorrow approach to ousting a sovereign nation’s leader. Trump provided few details as he declared that a group of officials who were standing near him at the news conference, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, would “run” the country until a “safe, proper, and judicious transition” could take place. It was a stunning announcement for a president who campaigned on the perils of nation building. And Trump made no mention of wanting to spread democracy or allowing Venezuela’s opposition, which the United States has recognized as the legitimate winners of 2024’s election, to take power.

Rather, in his lengthy press conference, the only Venezuelan politician Trump spoke about other than Maduro was Maduro’s own vice president, Delcy Rodríguez. She was sworn in as interim president soon after Maduro’s departure but maintains that Maduro is the legitimate president and condemned his arrest. Trump said she had already told Rubio that the new government in Caracas would do whatever the U.S. wanted—something she denied. In summary, Trump said, the U.S. is looking to “make Venezuela great again—very simple.”

The vagaries of the administration’s plans stood out in contrast with the precision of Maduro’s capture. They also invited questions about how deeply the U.S. would become involved in Venezuela’s future, as well as about the legality of the operation. Trump didn’t try to get congressional authorization for war or even notify it of today’s operation in advance, citing the Hill’s propensity to leak. (Lawmakers were briefed after the operation was complete.) Trump also did not address questions about the implications of removing a sitting president for Russian President Vladimir Putin as he seeks to control Ukraine, or for China’s Xi Jinping as he sizes up the possibility of taking Taiwan. “If China declared Taiwan a rogue province, could they go after its leaders?” Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked us in an interview. “If Russia declares Zelensky a criminal, could Putin extract him from Ukraine and that’d be okay?”

Trump dismissed the idea that deposing Maduro contradicts his “America First” mantra, which has been widely interpreted as noninterventionist. “It is” America First, Trump insisted today, “because we want to surround ourselves with good neighbors. We want to surround ourselves with stability.” He even embraced the possibility of putting “boots on the ground” after years of preferring to use strikes from afar to achieve his foreign-policy goals. He dubbed his new approach, without much apparent enthusiasm, the “Donroe Doctrine,” an awkward mashup of his own name and that of the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine, which aimed to cement U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere.

At the root of it all, Trump made clear, is oil, something that his critics had long claimed while the administration portrayed the months-long pressure campaign as principally about stopping the drug trade. Today, Trump didn’t hide his intent. The U.S. wants to revitalize Venezuela’s oil industry, with U.S. oil companies leading the charge, even though Venezuelan crude is heavy and hard to refine by international standards. That revenue, he added, would go to the Venezuelan people, and to the U.S., for what the administration has claimed is recompense for Venezuela’s nationalization of the industry years ago. Until recently, Trump had seemed open to a deal with Maduro that would achieve the same goal. But overnight, as explosions echoed over the hills of Caracas, Maduro’s time ran out.

“Nicolás Maduro had multiple opportunities to avoid this,” Rubio said at the Mar-a-Lago press conference. “He was provided multiple very, very, very generous offers, and chose instead to act like a wild man.”

So the Trump administration removed him by force. But a former senior U.S. official noted: “This was the easy part. Let’s see what they do next.”

The CIA put operatives in Venezuela in August after Trump ordered covert operations. Those operatives studied what Maduro wore, what he ate, where he traveled, what pets he kept. Delta Force trained for his capture using a mock safe house. For weeks, U.S. aircraft approached Venezuelan airspace but stopped short of crossing the line, instead seeking insight into how the Venezuelan military might respond to an attack, defense officials said.

A core group of senior officials—Rubio; Hegseth; General Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; CIA Director John Ratcliffe; and Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff—led the planning with Trump, one official told us.

“They finally—about two weeks ago—gave Maduro a final warning. It was through official channels, in a way that communicated the seriousness of it,” a person familiar with the planning told us. “There was no ambiguity,” this person said. “This was Maduro’s last chance for an off-ramp.”

By early last month, the U.S. was ready to move in when the weather was right. That moment came as Friday turned to Saturday, when the skies over Venezuela’s seaside capital cleared. Trump gave the order to proceed at 10:46 p.m. EST.

The U.S. conducted strikes to disable Venezuela’s air defenses, Caine said. Across the hills of Caracas, Venezuelans could see the assault unfold. They felt the ground shake. Then the city lost communications and power. As U.S. forces approached, they came under heavy fire, which caused injuries among U.S. forces and likely deaths among Venezuelans, defense officials told us. A U.S. helicopter was damaged.

“There was a lot of gunfire,” Trump said during his press conference; at least two U.S. troops were hospitalized. Minutes later, at 2:01 a.m. local time, U.S. forces entered Maduro’s compound and found the Venezuelan leader and his wife sleeping. Trump said the longtime tyrant ran to open a heavy door leading to a safe room but couldn’t manage it in time. The couple surrendered, were loaded into helicopters, and were out of Venezuelan airspace by 3:29 a.m.

Military officials stressed that the weather was a guiding factor in the timing, but an administration official suggested that political undercurrents were also at play. It was “now or never,” this person said. A number of officials told us that in recent weeks, the window for Trump to remove Maduro had seemed to be closing. Bipartisan support in the U.S. for any kind of military action in Venezuela was diminishing, and officials worried that the longer Maduro remained in power, the more entrenched he would become.

Trump is “kicking off the year with a win,” this administration official said. Another former senior administration official who remains in frequent contact with the White House acknowledged that Trump needed a victory amid tough headlines and slumping poll numbers. Trump is fond of symbolic dates, as well, and originally had eyed the period around Christmas for the assault. Instead, on Christmas Day, Trump ordered a different set of military strikes—on alleged Islamic State targets in Nigeria. Trump has grown fond of these one-off, splashy shows of force, counting last year’s bombing of Iranian nuclear sites as one of his triumphs. Trump said there had been a plan for a second phase of the Venezuelan operation, but that it wasn’t needed—at least not yet.

The Trump administration never laid out a consistent case for Congress or the public in advance of today’s operation as to why Maduro had to go. Much of the pressure campaign in recent months focused on lethal strikes against alleged drug boats, even though little of the drugs that flow through Venezuela are destined for the U.S.

At the Mar-a-Lago press conference, Rubio emphasized that the arrest and extraction of Maduro and his wife was a “law enforcement” operation. “At its core, this was an arrest of two indicted fugitives of American justice, and the Department of War supported the Department of Justice in that job,” Rubio said, using Trump’s title for the Department of Defense.

Conspicuously absent from the press conference was the top U.S. law-enforcement official, whose department’s indictment of Maduro provided the legal justification for the operation. Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on X that Maduro and his wife “will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,” and she later shared a link to a newly unsealed 25-page indictment filed by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. (It was in many respects similar to an indictment issued toward the end of Trump’s first term, with a few new charges and the addition of Maduro’s wife and his son.) The indictment alleges that Maduro and his associates used Venezuelan state and military resources to facilitate and profit from drug trafficking over two decades.

An administration official told us that the arrests of Maduro and his wife were made by the Drug Enforcement Administration, which ultimately reports to the attorney general. The operation, conducted by the Department of Defense and the DEA, was made at the request of the Justice Department.

More than a dozen FBI and DEA personnel were seen disembarking from a plane with Maduro at a New York Air National Guard Base this evening. The FBI declined to comment on the agency’s role in the operation, and the DEA did not respond to requests for comment.

In recent weeks, Trump and other administration officials asserted that the U.S. had a claim on Venezuela’s oil reserves—an apparent reference to a 2007 decision by Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, to nationalize various foreign-owned oil projects. The U.S. oil giants ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were kicked out of the country after they refused to allow Venezuela to acquire majority stakes in their Venezuelan operations. “The stolen oil must be returned to the United States,” Vice President J. D. Vance said in a post on X today.

Read: Making sense of the Venezuela attack

Venezuela has the largest estimated oil reserves in the world—accounting for about 17 percent of global reserves, or more than 300 billion barrels, according to the Oil & Gas Journal. But Venezuela produces only 1 million barrels of oil per day. Its potential is largely unrealized because of poor infrastructure, mismanagement, limited resources, and U.S. sanctions. What little is produced has to be sold on the black market for Venezuela to profit. About 80 percent of Venezuela’s oil, which is of low quality, currently goes to China, at least 15 percent goes to the U.S. via a remaining joint venture with Chevron, and the remainder goes to Cuba.

Trump today talked about the potential to revitalize Venezuela’s oil sector and the role that U.S. companies would play—something the country’s opposition has emphasized as a critical part of its economic plans.

“The oil business in Venezuela has been a bust, a total bust, for a long period of time,” Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.”

This would be a massive, costly, and time-consuming undertaking.

“Venezuela could produce 4 million barrels instead of the 1 million barrels it produces per day, but it would take maybe a little bit less than a decade and $100 billion in total over that period to get it to 4 million barrels,” Francisco Monaldi, an expert in Latin American energy policy at Rice University, told us. “Very few countries can do something like that.”

How much opposition Venezuela’s military put up to defend Maduro is not clear. But the low number of U.S. casualties suggests that Washington likely had at least some support from within the Venezuelan military, helping make the operation a success, former and current officials told us. “An action like this would not be possible without significant help or at least intentional ‘self-restraint’ from the local military,” a Pentagon adviser and Special Forces veteran told us.

The military’s longer-term response to Maduro’s ouster will likely be key to the fate of the nation. Recent history in Iraq and Afghanistan does not bode well for U.S. efforts at nation building, but much will depend on the choices that Venezuelan military leaders make about where their loyalties lie. The big question, the former Pentagon official said, is whether the U.S. can stave off the unrest and regional instability that could result from the sudden power vacuum left behind when Maduro was removed after nearly 13 years in power.

The role of Venezuela’s democratic opposition is also unknown. María Corina Machado, who secretly left Venezuela last month after a year in hiding to accept the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a statement today that “the time has come for Popular Sovereignty and National Sovereignty to govern our country. We are going to restore order, free political prisoners, build an exceptional nation, and bring our children home.”

She urged Venezuelans inside the country to “be ready to take action.” Trump, however, said today at Mar-a-Lago that Machado couldn’t govern the country, because she doesn’t have “the support or the respect” of the Venezuelan people. Carlos Giménez, a Republican representative from South Florida, told us he assesses Machado’s capabilities differently, calling her “formidable.” He said that he spoke with her on Saturday, and described her as “upbeat that Maduro is no longer there, but realistic that there’s more work to be done, and that this is just the beginning.” A spokesperson for Machado declined to comment, and other representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment for this story.

For now, Venezuelans don’t know who is running their country, even as Venezuelan news networks broadcast images of celebratory flag-waving in the streets. Armed civilian militias, known as colectivos, were patrolling Caracas. “There is a lot of confusion,” a Venezuelan activist in Caracas told us. “The government officials have called their followers to the streets, but nobody—except the colectivos—have answered.”

Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been forcibly taken from Venezuela and are being moved to the United States to face criminal drug-trafficking charges. Regardless of the international-law implications of this military action, the Trump administration’s description of what awaits Maduro and Flores has also transgressed basic principles of American domestic criminal law, as well as the underlying philosophical justification for punishment.

Attorney General Pam Bondi has promised that Maduro and Flores “will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.” Justice in the American system is supposed to be blind and impartial. By contrast, Bondi’s vow of wrathful punishment is profoundly illiberal, suggesting a lust for criminal vengeance.

Read: Making sense of the Venezuela attack

When federal prosecutors speak of criminal allegations, moreover, they ritualistically note that a defendant such as Maduro is innocent until proven guilty. By making a presumption of guilt and of the state’s inerrancy, the attorney general is repudiating the rule of law, which is grounded in the state’s obligation to prove its case.

For millennia, punishment was considered morally defensible purely on retributive grounds. That vengeful justification yielded during the Enlightenment, during a broader societal conversion to an age of reason. Broadly speaking, the justification for criminal punishment turned away from wrath, toward utilitarian concepts of effectiveness and social benefit. In this view, penal laws and policies were justified if they arguably benefited the majority of the population. Punishment became a social good rather than a basis for personal retribution.

Read: Trump’s critics are falling into an obvious trap

As a logical result, instead of vengeance, criminal-law theorists focused on the practical benefits: The deterrence rationale holds that punishment benefits society by discouraging both the individual offender and others in society from committing future crimes. Rehabilitation helps the individual and society alike by reforming the offender and allowing him or her to reintegrate into the communal order. And incapacitation, in turn, focuses on the social benefit of protecting society by removing a dangerous criminal from the community. All of these arguments justifying criminal punishment focus on the “social utility” of the act, rather than its retributive nature.

The prosecution of Maduro and his wife can be readily justified on post-Enlightenment grounds: Although rehabilitation seems like a stretch in the Venezuelan dictator’s case, punishment would incapacitate him and deter others. In reaching back to a retributive justification, however, Trump and Bondi reject these rational arguments.

Many commentators have described Donald Trump’s approach to the law as a throwback to an earlier age—perhaps the allegedly halcyon era of the pre-Civil Rights Act 1950s. Others, such as The Atlantic’s Adam Serwer, see the conservative legal project as the restoration of the pre-Civil War legal system. By invoking the “wrath” of justice against Maduro, Trump and Bondi reach even further back into the past, summoning a far older, illiberal, retributive concept that modernity long ago abandoned.</div>

            <h2>The Messiness of a Post-Maduro World</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/messiness-post-maduro-world/685491/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The most memorable moment in the presidency of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro—at least until his kidnapping by Delta Force early this morning—came in 2017, when he accomplished the extraordinary feat of making the entire population of his country salivate with hunger simultaneously by taking a huge bite of an empanada on live television. It was as if President Donald Trump were to pause during an Oval Office address, then produce from a drawer in the Resolute Desk a fully loaded chili dog. But in Venezuela at the time, ordinary citizens were suffering near-famine conditions (the reported average weight loss of 24 pounds that year was attributed to “the Maduro diet”), and the sight of the president housing an empanada did not help his image as a man of the pueblo.

Soon this autocrat will be eating his meals off a tray provided by the United States’ Bureau of Prisons, and that is surely a victory for the people of Venezuela. But some may be curious to learn the legal and strategic rationale for Maduro’s arrest. At this morning’s press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump said the operation was about Maduro’s “violation of the core principles of American foreign policy,” his defiance of American dominance in the Western Hemisphere, his “hosting foreign adversaries” (Maduro is an ally of Cuba, Russia, and Iran), and his alleged flooding of the United States with drugs. Trump did not mention Venezuela’s opposition politicians, the legitimate winners of its 2024 election, by name. He said the United States intended to govern Venezuela. “We’re going to run the country, until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition,” Trump said.

The Associated Press wrote (with understatement characteristic of breaking news) that the legal implications of Maduro’s arrest were “not immediately clear.” The operation is less a challenge to international law than an instance of total disregard for it. It is an indulgence in precisely the behavior that international law theoretically constrains, namely the crossing of borders and the use of force to meddle in what could plausibly be considered another country’s internal affairs. International law does not constrain America from adopting regime change in Venezuela as a policy, or from calling Maduro’s rule illegitimate. But swooping into a foreign capital and kidnapping another country’s de facto leader, so he can be tried in your country’s criminal courts, is well outside the bounds of international law, however tyrannical that leader may be.

Maduro’s arrest is being compared to the 1989 invasion of Panama and rendition of its caudillo, Manuel Noriega, to Miami to be convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes. The justification for that action was tripartite: self-defense (Panama had allegedly declared a state of war against the United States, and had killed a Marine there); the American treaty with Panama, which authorized the United States to protect the Panama Canal; and, finally, authority granted by the exiled legitimate government of Panama, which Noriega refused to let govern.

The United States and Venezuela have no canal treaty, but Trump does invoke something like a self-defense rationale for his action—this time based not on a dead Marine but on Venezuela’s alleged role in sending “thousands of tons of cocaine” up the noses of innocent Americans. Taking part in this nefarious activity is tantamount to an armed attack, the administration says. This theory of international law is novel and, to say the least, a real stretch.

The Trump administration also does not invoke the authority of Venezuela’s opposition, which would have won the 2024 election had Maduro counted the votes. Edmundo González and María Corina Machado, the winners of the 2024 election, whose results Maduro faked, have said they are ready to return to Venezuela to rule and have endorsed the American operation. “The United States has fulfilled its promise to enforce the law,” Machado wrote. But Trump himself said this morning that he had not been in touch with Machado. What looked at first like a mere rendition now sounds more like an occupation. Trump gestured to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other senior officials when asked who would serve as his proconsuls in Venezuela.

Did these opposition politicians know that America’s occupation of Venezuela would be part of the deal? Even if they did authorize the arrest of Maduro, their use as justification would set a disorderly precedent. There are, to put it simply, a lot of cases in which countries dispute the legitimacy of other countries’ de facto governments. (Russia would like to have a word about Ukraine.) Those de facto governments may be illegitimate, odious, and oppressive. But a world where any country can topple another’s rulers, as long as it is preceded into battle by an opposition party that blesses its military action, will be awfully messy. And much of the international order is an attempt to avert messes, even by letting odious and illegitimate governments stay in power, because messes can be odious too.

Joseph Stalin is famously said to have asked how many divisions the pope had. One could equally count how many divisions the International Court of Justice, or any other body that might fret over Trump’s violation of these rules and norms, could field against the United States. The violation will almost certainly go unpunished, but the rules and norms will be missed. Trump says that he wants “partnership” with a post-Maduro Venezuela that is “rich, independent, and safe.” That is a goal that most Venezuelans share, but it will be achieved at a cost that could be painful, and that might not be felt at a time of America’s choosing.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump has launched not a splendid little war, but perhaps a splendid little operation in Venezuela. He has captured a dictator and removed him from power. So far, Trump seems to have executed a bad idea well: The military operation, dubbed “Operation Absolute Resolve,” seems to have been flawless. The strategic wisdom, however, is deeply questionable. And the legal basis, as offered by the president and his team, is absurd. Some Americans, and some U.S. allies, are appalled.

Russia and China claim to be appalled, too, but to use a classic diplomatic expression, the leaders in Beijing and Moscow should be invited, with all due respect, to shut their traps.

“We firmly call on the U.S. leadership to reconsider this position,” the Russian foreign ministry said this morning, “and release the lawfully elected president of a sovereign country and his wife.” The Russians then shamelessly turned all the sanctimony knobs to supernova levels: “Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own future without destructive external interference, particularly of a military nature.”

You don’t say. Perhaps we might generalize that principle to other nations, such as Ukraine, where Moscow’s forces are murdering people every week—in part because the Russians failed to kill or capture the “lawfully elected president of a sovereign country” four years ago.

The Chinese, too, are absolutely shocked that a great power is menacing a small neighbor and inflicting regime change by military force. China, the foreign ministry in Beijing said, “is deeply shocked”—at least it wasn’t shocked and stunned—“and strongly condemns the use of force by the U.S. against a sovereign country and the use of force against the president of a country.”

Noble words. And then, like the Russians, the Chinese dared the world to laugh out loud: “China firmly opposes such hegemonic behavior by the U.S., which seriously violates international law, violates Venezuela’s sovereignty, and threatens peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean. We urge the U.S. to abide by international law and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and stop violating the sovereignty and security of other countries.”

Only two days ago, however, China engaged in military exercises that included surrounding Taiwan and then firing missiles in the waters around the island. A giant nation regularly running war games aimed at invading its tiny neighbor—and threatening Japan, for good measure—counts as “hegemonic behavior” that threatens the “peace and security” of a region, and China knows it.

The more stinging irony here is that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping probably approved these public statements with a chuckle. The United States has now given Russia, China, and anyone else who wants to give it a try a road map for invading countries and capturing leaders who displease them, with a lawlessness that by comparison makes the 2003 invasion of Iraq seem as lawyered up as a bank merger.

Let us all stipulate that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is a bad guy. He deserved to be driven from power, perhaps with American help. An operation rooted in support from the international community and approved by Congress would be a tough sell because Venezuela presented no threat to the United States or anyone else, but it would have been the right way to go. (Drugs don’t count as an imminent danger.) Instead, the president declared the “Donroe Doctrine,” another moment that will stand for ages as an embarrassment to the United States and raises the question yet again of whether the commander in chief is cognitively stable enough to be ordering the invasion of other nations.

Trump and his team didn’t even try creating a coalition either at home or abroad. By simply landing troops in another nation and decapitating its leadership, Trump has done Russia and China a great service by trashing, yet again, guardrails that limit other nations from running amok. International law? Pointless. The United Nations? Never heard of it. The Congress of the United States? Well, they’re good folks, but according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, they couldn’t be told ahead of time, for security reasons. (He said this while standing next to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, a fountain of security violations.) Putin and Xi must have watched Trump’s presser while nodding and taking notes.

Hypocrisy, the French nobleman François de La Rochefoucauld once said, is the tribute vice pays to virtue. In this case, there is little virtue to be found; the Russian and Chinese statements are vice paying tribute to vice. They already know that the president of the United States is helping to clear the way for their adventures—and they should keep their faux outrage to themselves.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Updated at 12:00 p.m. ET on January 3, 2026

The Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro’s regime lasted 12 years before America ended it today. This seems to be what the monthslong American military pressure campaign on Venezuela was building toward—the strikes on boats carrying drugs in international waters, the seizure of oil tankers, and the CIA-engineered port explosion. Early this morning, military installations in Caracas started exploding. Hours later, President Donald Trump announced that he had ordered a “large scale strike against Venezuela”—and that America had captured Maduro and flown him out of the country.

The apparent goal is to have Maduro stand trial in America, facing, in the words of Attorney General Pam Bondi, “the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.” In 2020, Maduro was indicted on charges of cocaine and weapons trafficking by federal prosecutors. Having gone here, the Trump administration apparently wishes to go no further: Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, told Republican Senator Mike Lee that he “anticipates no further action in Venezuela.”

This is Trump’s most audacious foreign-policy decision in either term of office—more significant than the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander, in 2020 or even the strike on Iranian nuclear facilities last year. But, alongside the rest of Trump’s decisions, it is an incoherent one: The “America First” faction of the Republican Party denigrates regime change as a compulsion of neoconservatives—then pulls off a defenestration as spectacular as America’s arrest of Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian dictator, in 1990. Maduro is an authoritarian and a blight to the Venezuelan people, certainly, but this administration is hardly one that finds all autocrats anathema. Trump wants to bring Maduro to justice for allegedly running a narcotrafficking empire while president of Venezuela not even two months after pardoning Juan Orlando Hernández—who ran a narcotrafficking empire while president of Honduras and had been sentenced to 45 years in prison by an American jury. Trump wants to muscularly intervene in Central and South American affairs—what some observers are calling the “Donroe Doctrine”—but also does not want to deal with the increased migration that often comes from rupturing regimes.

How do we make sense of this new American arbitrariness—willing to drop massive bombs on buried Iranian nuclear facilities and kidnap dictators, but unwilling to keep providing funds to the defense of Ukraine, even if this risks no actual American soldiers? One interpretation of “America First” foreign policy is as a halfway station between proper isolationism and neoconservatism: The Trump administration intervenes where it can do so easily and without immediate consequence, but shies away from long-term commitments and occupations. This interpretation was undercut by Trump’s statement at his 11 a.m. address, however, that the U.S. is “going to run the country.”

A second interpretation of the Venezuelan operation is that Trump is inaugurating a return to spheres of influence. Trump rejects the rules-based international order set up after World War II (which placed America as its keystone), and he despises the globalists in the Washington foreign-policy blob and European capitals who still believe in it. In this view, great powers ought to be able to intervene in their own backyards. This is why America can do as it sees fit in Venezuela. It is also why Trump often seems more sympathetic to Russian President Vladimir Putin than to Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky. The return of spheres-of-influence thinking bodes poorly for the chances of America intervening if China were to invade Taiwan while Trump is still in office. The conflict would be seen as an intramural dispute—one that poses risks to American ships, soldiers, and submarines that are orders of magnitude greater than the risks posed by Trump’s targets so far.

The Venezuelan incursion also reflects the central failing of American domestic politics: the continued declining relevance of Congress. Even though the prescribed constitutional order is to have Congress declare wars, President Trump has brazenly ignored this power. In this instance, it is hard to even begin to construct the legal basis for the military action. Vice President J. D. Vance suggested on X that this morning’s incursion is legal because “Maduro has multiple indictments in the United States for narcoterrorism.” But as my colleague Conor Friedersdorf has noted, this logic would mean that the president can order an invasion of “any country where a national has an outstanding arrest warrant.”

Of course, circumventing the legislature is not a Trumpian innovation. Harry Truman described the Korean War as an American “international police action” to avoid needing a formal congressional declaration of war. George H. W. Bush’s invasion of Panama in 1989, which culminated in the arrest of Noriega, was also not authorized by Congress. What is new about the Trump era is taking the blithe disregard for the other branches of government that American presidents have enjoyed in foreign affairs and seeking to apply it to spheres of governance, too—whether that is the declaration of tariffs, the deployment of the National Guard, or even the enforcement of ordinary laws. The administration has essentially ignored the law requiring the sale of TikTok. It is hard to imagine the current Congress, having allowed the president to encroach on all of these powers already, demanding actual justification for the administration’s actions in Venezuela.

But as free as Congress leaves him, Trump may find that the rest of the world does not comply with his wish to intervene militarily and “run” a foreign country, whatever that may mean. Perhaps a democratic revolution in Venezuela will place an opposition leader like María Corina Machado in charge; or perhaps another authoritarian figure will try to inherit Maduro’s regime—just as  Maduro was able to reconstitute the regime of Hugo Chávez. Colombia has already had millions of Venezuelans flee across its borders and is worried about further destabilization. The principles of Trump’s foreign policy remain even harder to discern after the Venezuelan intervention than they did before it. But all actions have consequences—even arbitrary and inscrutable ones.</div>

good luck trying to call the State of Alaska to the stand.

I expect we will see a court decide that. Generally, when legal questions are answered in a context that looks trustworthy to a layperson, it will be on the information provider, even with disclaimers in place, unless basically every statement is prefixed by IANAL.

I know that.  You know that.  Even the AI grifters know that, they just pretend otherwise.

You are correct.  The people quoted in this summary seem to believe that hallucinations are a solvable problem for AI, and that they solved it, it just took a lot longer than expected.

Nope, they didn&#39;t solve it.  Their AI will still hallucinate, and can still be jailbroken too.  Their optimism suggests a severe lack of due diligence, despite the extended period they have worked on this.  I am imagining some egos are involved that simply cannot admit to failure, especially given what they have spent, but tha

Is the Justice Department 100% accurate? When the highest levels of government fail your accuracy tests, is it cherry-picking to seize on AI mistakes?

Human mistakes are of an entirely different nature and quality than AI &#39;mistakes&#39;.  A human won&#39;t accidentally make up facts, cases, or sources.  A human won&#39;t write summaries of things that don&#39;t exist.  A human won&#39;t accidentally directly contradict a source while citing it.  A human is also actually capable of identifying and correcting mistakes, unlike an LLM.  Stop with this absurd nonsense that it&#39;s okay for LLMs to &quot;make mistakes&quot; because humans also &quot;make mistakes&quot;  These things are not the same and

One thing LLM-type chatbots do not do is reliable information supply. There will be hallucinations, misstatements, lies by omission, and eventually they will have to switch it off again, permanently.

Good luck with that. If they have to prefix every statement with &quot;IANAL&quot;, they might not se much use.

Have you considered owning your projections? How many cases where LLM answers are good do you leave out?

You are confused as to what requirement information production has. As soon as there is a significant level of false statements, it becomes totally useless in mist scenarios. You are just too clueless to understand that.

Let&#39;s say we live in a fantasy land where LLMs are magically 95% accurate.  Would you trust a car that only worked 95% of the time?  What about brakes that only stopped your car 95% of the time?

What about legal advice?  Would you hire a lawyer that would make up silly nonsense 5% of the time?

Sorry, kid.  LLMs just aren&#39;t the science fiction fantasy that you want them to be.  Your AI girlfriend does not and can not love you.  You&#39;re not going to have a robot slave.  Whatever nonsense it is that you&#39;re hoping

They wouldn&#39;t, because the standard is now to have all computers with an always-on internet connection, and would most likely self-activate as soon as you login to a microsoft account. As it&#39;s done in the background, there&#39;s no prompt.

On the other hand, those using Windows XP would have seen it as an option, especially if they were one of the few people at the time

Indeed. But I still think MS needs to keep the no-account open, because the GDPR does not actually allow forced sign-up unless it is necessary for the nature of the service. MS is trying to give that appearance (via one-drive, for example), but it is not going to hold up in court.

Sure seems that way, if the only way you can activate Windows is to have an active internet connection.

Now I suspect DoD and other large scale accounts can cut a deal to get a &quot;gold master&quot; that doesn&#39;t contain a requirement for on-line activation. But it seems to me that there are good reasons to have air-gapped systems in manufacturing or similar process control situations, as one example domain.    Previously, you could obtain and transfer updates through a physical device (which, of course, you&#39;d have to verify and trust the device and its contents.)

I guess Iran won&#39;t be using this version of Windows for uranium processing...

I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t know all the ways to activate Windows then.

Standard Windows keys require Microsoft for activation. MAK (multi-activation keys) also require MS. However, KMS (Key Management Service) however does not. KMS uses a locally controlled server for activation. This is quite common in large organizations that deal with a high quantity of machines (think fortune 500 orgs w/ 100k+ employees w/ laptops). This would of course also cover the military. Do you think the DoD was using phone activation this entire time for their air-gapped machines? No, they have the private DoD network w/ this type of infrastructure (at least, this is my assumption)

Now I suspect DoD and other large scale accounts can cut a deal to get a &quot;gold master&quot;Literally no corporations DoD or small enterprises rely on Microsoft for activation. They use a Key management Service to activate locally provisioned windows systems without any need to reach the internet outside the organisation. This has been the case since the days of Windows Vista.Heck KMS is the default piracy workaround for windows in general. Pirated copies of Windows and Office are activated by running KMS locally on the machine.

Activation will be tied to your Microsoft Account, and a subscription will also be assigned to it.

I see where you are going, Adobe could buy windows and the new AI Improved Adobe Windows could come with a lot $49.99 monthly sdudscription fee.

The only time I&#39;ve had to do phone activation is for activating Terminal Service Licenses for Citrix clusters in enterprise.  I wonder if that will also be affected or not.

It is kind of a Stockholm Syndrome type of effect. That and a quasi-monopoly maintained by illegal business practices. Both factors are reeeeeally bad for quality.

Large industrial machines have an EOL measured in decades. You do not replace a lathe the size of a bus or a container ship because a Windows version changedI have to maintain a variety of air-gapped boxes that run win 7, and two even still on XP.After that date, manufacturers got smart and most everyone shipped Linux based control systems, but it took them a while, and still to this day not everyone has.They are going to have to have some way to allow new installations of legacy versions.

Did they ever fix the McLaren F1 dependence on a Compaq LTE 5280 to perform maintenance?

Well, I know people that had to move off Windows as an industrial controller (which is pretty stupid anyways), because they need a network connection and Windows update was slow enough to kill the bio-rectors controlled.

They are going to have to have some way to allow new installations of legacy versions.They will not. A non-activated offline Windows presents no problem for such machines. The fundamental limit to an inactivated version of Windows was that it was blocked from updates and that it set your wallpaper black. The former doesn&#39;t matter (out of support), and the latter ... whop-de-fucking-do.

Because the GDPR forbids a need to create an account unless it is needed. Windows does not need an account.

Well, maybe another $500M fine will remind Microsoft that the law applies to them...

They&#39;ll just eat the fine and continue. If they get fined they can also state EULA violation and shut off all M$ logins in the EU combined with a bitlocker key change that isn&#39;t registered in the TPM and ask for a recovery fee of $10k per computer and login.

They&#39;ll just eat the fine and continue.Haahahaha, no. If the illegal behavior is not stopped, there will be a 2nd fine and after that a prohibition to process personal information of any kind. That would mean their accounts become illegal in Europe. If they still continue, company representatives can get arrested and infrastructure seized and switched off. At least step 3 has happened to some company, I think in Greece. They are not even allowed to do their own HR anymore.MS has no choice but to comply.

There is no recourse for when online activation breaks. I used to call that number and explain: my effing hard drive died // or Windows cruft crashed so I need to reinstall on the same pc -- and they&#39;d say, ok, use this new code instead. Now I have to buy a whole new motherfucking license.

Yes I also use Linux but sometimes I need to use Windows Apps because they&#39;re the ones that can access my data.

I just activated an offline windows 10 system a couple weeks ago

Yes the phone menu is gone. It directs you to online

But you can offline activate using their website and type in the code directly on the offline system

Congress repeatedly attempted to restrict military intervention through War Powers resolutions, but all significant efforts were blocked by Republican majorities:

Senate (Nov. 6, 2025): Republicans blocked a resolution that would have required congressional authorization for any attack on Venezuelan soil. The vote was 51–49, with only two Republicans joining Democrats.

When a tyrant takes control of a country by force, you overthrow him, arrest him, assassinate him, something like that.

But when a tyrant takes control of a country through a democratic election, what do you do ? Arrest 77 million people ? Assassinate 77 million people ?

The fundamental principle behind democracy is that the vast majority of the population is not evil. Now, we have a country where 77 million people are. Whatever evil act Trump commits, 77 million people approve.

But when a tyrant takes control of a country through a democratic election, what do you do ? Arrest 77 million people ? Assassinate 77 million people ?There are far less drastic ways to deal with a tyrant. For example, in the USA (to which you allude per the 77 million 2024 Trump-voters) you can impeach the president. Or at least try. We know how hard that is.In a parliamentary democracy, the head of state has mostly ceremonial (and very little executive) power, so you have little need to impeach him/her.

Okay cool.  What does that have to do with ChatGPT and Perplexity completely screwing up on current events?

Maduro has had a part in moving thousands of tons of cocaine into the United States (killing how many?) and has been in league with drug cartels, narco-terrorists, and terrorists.  He is a gangster that had been running a corrupt gangster government with a history of human rights abuses.  Venezuela 2024 Human Rights Report  [state.gov]

With the aid of US Special Operations forces, United States law enforcement officers arrested Maduro today and brought him to the United States to face charges in a court of law.  Below is

Sure, but all the major LLMs also will do a web search when you ask about current events. As of now, the afternoon of Saturday January 3, if you ask the exactly the same question of Gemini, ChatGPT, and Copilot, you get an up-to-date response outlining the charges and rationale behind the event. I&#39;m pretty sure they haven&#39;t all updated the training that quickly.

The USA has enough oil; this is about Exon, Chevron and their influence. But the USA could use money to slow down it&#39;s bankruptcy; plus this can add to the continued loss of legitimacy.

Youtube channel Climate Town assured me that if the US would stop importing oil and rely completely on its own production, the US could only manage to supply 30% of domestic consumption. This channel usually does their due diligence regarding numbers. Hence I tend to trust them.

For anyone questioning the legality of attacking Venezuela and abducting their leader:

Remember we&#39;re talking about a highly corrupt leader, a known criminal who used his high office to make billions for himself, and has manipulated elections to stay in power. He has used his military against his own citizens, has protected his corrupt friends and punished his political enemies.

And the President of Venezuela did some bad things too.

With the potential for the Kessler syndrome to kick in any time now, it&#39;s an economic necessity for Starlink to do whatever it can to reduce the risk.

As Anton Petrov points out in this video [youtube.com], a Kessler syndrome catastrophe could be just around the corner and the only way to reduce the risk is to reduce the levels of congestion in certain parts of LEO.

In the event of such an event, Starlink would become worthless and SpaceX&#39;s stock price would fall through the floor so I guess someone&#39;s crunched the numbers and figured that they now have little option but to do everything they can to reduce the possibility.

I don&#39;t think we are anywhere near Kessler Syndrome.

Yes, best to ensure we avoid it.  But we are still many many thousands of satellites away from it being even close.

It only takes one or two satellite mishaps to start the ball rolling.  Kessler Syndrome is not a sudden event affecting everything at once.  It is a slow rolling series of events.

You doubt?   You clearly know even less about orbital mechanics than I do, so why post ill-informed guesses?
  The scientists and engineers say that 70 km makes a difference.

That &quot;slightly-further-down orbit&quot;  has something like an order of magnitude lower air density. And I&#39;m sure you know that drag is proportional to that.

More drag means their orbits will decay faster if they become inert junk.

Two closely related reasons why lower orbit is safer:

1)  there is less debris there now, reducing the chance of collisions damaging the satellite.

2) if a satellite lost control,  or was destroyed by an impact,  it or the debris will return to Earth much faster, avoiding cascade risk.

Also helps Russia take them all out with a few carefully placed shots, and then reduces the recovery time.

Coincidental, I&#39;m sure. It&#39;s not like the world is getting more dangerous, with leaders ready to do whatever it takes too e.g. avoid getting kidnapped.

If they&#39;re lower, they&#39;re *less* intrusive to optical telescopes. Lower altitude means they&#39;re sunlit over your head while it&#39;s dark enough for astronomy for a *shorter* time.

In the extreme case, a geostationary satellite is almost always sunlit all night long from anywhere on the planet.

The Moon is sunlit almost all the time except during a rare event called a lunar eclipse.

The higher the orbit, the larger the fraction of it that&#39;s outside the earth&#39;s shadow.

The Moon is sunlit almost all the time except during a rare event called a lunar eclipse.I&#39;m sure &quot;ground-based telescope using astronomers&quot; already loathe the moon as much as vampires hate the sun.

A contradiction in terms, since something ballistic is implied to be acted on only by gravity and will not decay.

There is something called the &quot;ballistic coefficient&quot; (bstar in TLE speak) that, while also a contradiction in terms, refers to the drag coefficient multipled by the area-to-mass ratio of the object in orbit.

The decay of an object in the lower reaches of low earth orbit is dictated by the product of atmospheric density with the ballistic coefficient. A dense brick will last longer than a large sa

My girlfriend just got put on a 4-day week with her same salary.

It actually yields the same performance, but less sick days, less employee fluctuation and has other benefits. With some exceptions, 5 day weeks are simply stupid toady. There are tons of people stuck in the past that are blind to actual reality though and quite a bit or research.

The point about 4 day work weeks is, that people get more productive. If one isn&#39;t stressed out, one delivers better work. This doesn&#39;t work out on tight schedules for the company, but with AI it might.

it&#39;s not about &quot;better work&quot;.it&#39;s about equilibrium between production and consumption.

https://www.scry.llc/2025/01/2... [scry.llc]

They also make fewer mistakes, are less sick and are more likely to stay in their job. In the majority of cases, total productivity for 4 days per week is basically the same as 5 days per week and cost is lower. The &quot;work heroes&quot; just cannot deal with that.

the difference will come largely out of real estate prices.

&quot;The &quot;K-shaped economy&quot; is a hot topic now. Check my workhour graph above from 1873 to 1897 when the job market bifurcated into &quot;new, high income jobs&quot; and &quot;existing, low wage&quot; jobs. That&#39;s a variation of the same economic pattern as this &quot;K&quot; curve.

That period was known as The Gilded Age aka The Robber Baron Era and I mention it briefly as my model for today&#39;s era in Cost Of Information:&quot;

If our culture experiences any shift involving a lowering of working hours without a lowering of salaries, AI will have nothing to do with it.  Absolutely nothing at all, even if the promises of enhanced worker productivity are true.

The one and only thing that would result in fewer working hours would be the application of significant political and cultural pressure on the part of the workers.  All AI will do, assuming productivity gains are actually realized, is allow employers to reduce staff, since they

Yes, the AI-revolution will be hugely different to various &quot;revolutions&quot; that came before and not in a good way.

The industrial revolution saw manufacturing automated -- but the jobs that were eliminated were usually low-skill laboring ones.  People could retrain and take on more skilled work with higher pay so the net earnings of the workforce actually increased.

The IT-revolution once again saw relatively unskilled roles automated by computers and once again people could retrain for more skilled rolls that

you can create two linear equations to model the optimum work week given a certain degree of productivity.

https://www.scry.llc/2024/12/2... [scry.llc]

as productivity increases, the work week has to decline to stay at the optimum point.that&#39;s why the 40-hour workweek and child labor laws were the result of the Great Depression.

and we have robo cars with EULA&#39;s that wipe away liability

If it really gets that bad then I expect there will be new skilled jobs, such as making guillotines and hunting billionaires.

because you get more customers if you redistribute the increased income.layoffs means less customers.

A perpetual motion machine required energy to operate, to replace the lost momentum. Likewise, a Universal Basic Income requires productivity to operate.

You&#39;re right about one thing. There isn&#39;t going to be any UBI, because it can&#39;t exist, any more than a perpetual motion machine can exist, and for the same reason. With each cycle (of the machine or the money), some momentum is lost.

A perpetual motion machine required energy to operate, to replace the lost momentum. Likewise, a Universal Basic Income requires productivity to operate.  The productivity here would come from artificial intelligence. This productivity could support UBI... in principle. In practice, however, the people who own the means of production-- which is to say, the capitalists-- will keep the profit from the AI. Why should use the excess productivity for UBI?

In principle, but not in practice? That&#39;s exactly how egghead academics think. &quot;It *could* work, if everybody just cooperated and did their part!&quot;  That&#39;s also how Marx thought. The problem is, people have to be motivated to do their part. UBI does exactly the opposite. If you get income without doing anything, why on earth would people do anything?

Yes, of course Capitalists will keep the profits from AI, as they should. They risked their own money to build the AI, so why wouldn&#39;t they keep the profits? Tha

In principle, but not in practice? Correct. This is an important distinction to make. You said it can&#39;t work, and made an analogy to a perpetual motion machine, which violates the first or second law of thermodynamics (depending on which kind.) You&#39;re wrong.

It cannot do so. Neither &quot;AI&quot; nor a path to achieving it exist.  For now you get LLMs.

That aside, the trend over most of the last century now has been that as productivity enhancement tools have continue to improve and workers produce more value, that value keeps getting directed to the most wealthy overall and real wages tend to remain flat.  This trend is not going to change without major societal shakeup.

If AI makes people more productive, it would stand to reason that it would create more wealth with the same amount of effort.

In such an environment, what exactly would be the incentive to work less given that you can get more from working the same?

Mechanization didn&#39;t shorten the work week. Automation didn&#39;t shorten the work week.

It shortened the work week from six days to five, and shortened the work day to eight hours.Hard to believe in these our enlightened times, but yes, in 1830, people used to work 69.1 hour work weeks.

If it&#39;s mostly subsistence agriculture, I would think it&#39;s logically a little hard to draw the distinction between work and not work in the sense of punching the clock and kicking back after 5.

I&#39;m willing to be corrected here, but I&#39;d assume back in 1830 is farmer bob and fam worked the soil so they could eat 70 hours a week and sold maybe a 10% surplus at market, they had a 7 hour work week.

It shortened the work week from six days to five, and shortened the work day to eight hours.This part needs clarification. Automation shortened the work week in the sense that it exacerbated a problem whose resolution was the 40 hour workweek.

AI does not make people more productive, but a 4 day workweek often will. The AI claim is a pretext. The evidence from all experiments run with 4 day workweeks are compelling, but there are so many &quot;heroes of work&quot; that are deeply stuck in the 5 day week that it is very risky to put people on a 4 day week with the same salary for political/psychological reasons. But doing so pays off in lower costs at basically the same productivity, so your overall profits increase.

But there will be a transition period of around 10-ish years (I predicted 20 years in slashdot about 15-20 years ago, I correct myself due to the fast development and the current world situation) where chaos will reign.

AI tools are fantastic, I use them extensively too, but right now it&#39;s so early that it needs a lot of hand-holding, agent management, scaffolding and more so it&#39;s going to rule out a TON of people who think they can just replace professionals just like that, ain&#39;t gonna ha

It will come to this, you&#39;re either competent with a tool or not, nothing will change this.

It can be a terrific assistant, but your mileage may vary. I can only use myself as an example, for example I can&#39;t remember the last time I got to be this productive, I coded 10+ games (one of them is actually good, which is better than my previous track record) with LLM assisting me. I set up a Linux gaming server with 4 windows specific games, which I had zero chance of doing myself in a little time (I work as an I

Soo, when you are semi- or incompetent, LLMs are more competent than you? No question about that, but LLMs are incapable of producing reasonable production code without somebody that can actually do it manually spending a lot of time fixing what the LLM produced. And that process is _slower_ than having that somebody competent do it directly. Add systematic errors, bad code maintainability and that fixing code is more stressful than writing it and results in less reliable and less secure code, and the whole

Yeah, you might imagine that you&#39;d supplement it with some sort of side hustle, but keep in mind you&#39;ll be competing with everyone and their brother who has exactly the same idea.

More specifically, it could, but it won&#39;t.

Previous discussions of and experiments with 4-day work weeks were always predicated on maintaining the same compensation as 5-day weeks provided. I read both articles; conspicuous by its absence was anything indicating that workers in this new AI utopia would continue to receive 5 days&#39; worth of pay for their oh-so-wonderful 4-day weeks. I think the AI fluffers were counting on readers overlooking that minor detail.

However, the Yahoo article did yield yet another brain addled Elon bloviation stating that &quot;There will be no poverty in the future and so no need to save money. There will be universal high income.” Ya gotta know that when Musk says shit like that, the future reality will be the polar opposite.

These &quot;news&quot; pieces are an embarrassment to serious journalism.

need to cap the extreme OT / unpaid on call

Certainly when it comes to software development, there is always a years-long backlog, because no company will pay enough to hire a team large enough to do all they want to do. With AI, maybe they&#39;ll get a higher percentage done, of the long list of things they want.

I&#39;d be more worried about zero day workweeks brought about by AI.

I call BS. Job openings that get two applications are not real. As in nonexistent.

In a lengthy press conference Saturday detailing the U.S. military’s capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump confirmed, with stunning frankness, the classic leftist critique of American foreign policy: that, at least for as long as he’s in power, it’s all about the oil.

Over the past few months, Trump and his aides had characterized their pressure campaign against Maduro’s regime as a war on “narco-terrorism” and a fight to restore democratic rule. But following Maduro’s extraction in a complex military and intelligence operation, the American president was clear about its true motive.

“We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” he said, adding, “We can’t take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn’t have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.” Then came the kicker: “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in” and spend billions of dollars fixing the energy infrastructure that they developed decades ago, until socialist regimes nationalized their wells, then wrecked them. The wealth resulting from this grab-back will benefit the Venezuelan people, he said, but added that much of it will reimburse America’s oil companies.

Finally, Trump said, U.S. troops will be sent to enforce Big Oil’s rule, if necessary. “They always say ‘boots on the ground,’ we’re not afraid of boots on the ground,” he said. “We had boots on the ground last night,” as part of the operation to extract Maduro. He said the military was poised to go in again if necessary.

There’s a storied history, starting in the Cold War, of the U.S. military and the CIA co-opting or overthrowing Central and South American governments—including Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Chile, as well as several attempt to do so in Cuba—to bolster the interests of U.S. corporations, including United Fruit, IT&T, and various oil companies, among others.

But rarely have the presidents who ordered these interventions been so blatant about the primary motive. Instead, at least in public, they spoke of fighting Communism or upholding democracy, even when the enemies weren’t really Communist and their allies weren’t at all democratic.

But Trump was up front in his motives, and repeatedly so. Several times in his press conference, he talked of bringing in big U.S. oil companies to regain their former assets. (In fact, though, American firms never owned the land where they drilled for Venezuela’s oil riches, and, as in many other countries, the interplay between foreign exploiters and local nationalizers was more complex than Trump’s narrative suggests.) And he also talked about restoring “American dominance in the Western hemisphere”—a policy that Trump’s recently issued National Security Strategy called the “Trump corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine. “We are reasserting American power in a very powerful way in our home region,” he said—not to protect democracy but for its own sake.

Maduro and his wife were captured, then indicted by the U.S. Attorney in New York, on charges of drug trafficking. But Trump all but admitted that wasn’t the real reason for the elaborate operation. Just a month ago, while officers were planning the attack on Venezuela, Trump pardoned former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernández, who had been convicted of drug-trafficking. Asked about this at Saturday’s news conference, Trump said he’d issued the pardon because Hernández, who’d supported Trump, had been “treated unfairly” by former President Joe Biden.

As for democracy, Trump was asked whether he would support María Corina Machado, the Nobel Prize-winning leader of Venezuela’s opposition movement, to lead a new government—or even whether he’d spoken with her. Trump answered no to both questions. “It would be very tough for her to be the leader,” he said in a dismissive tone. “She doesn’t have the respect in the country.” Nor did he even mention Edmundo González, who was elected Venezuela’s president in 2024 and fled to safe exile in Spain after Maduro stole the election.

Earlier on Saturday, in an interview on Fox News, Trump acted as if he’d barely thought about Machado or Gonzalez. “I mean, I don’t know about what kind of an election that was,” he said, referring to the 2024 contest. Meanwhile, he said, “They have a vice president, you know.”

Later, during Saturday’s press conference, Trump acknowledged that the Venezuelan vice president, Delcy Rodríguez—who, by law, has now been sworn in as president—was handpicked by Maduro. He added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is now “working with” Rodriguez, who is “willing to do what’s necessary to make Venezuela great again.”

Venezuelan law requires an ascending vice president to call for new elections, but this doesn’t seem in the offing. Asked who precisely is going to “run” Venezuela, Trump replied, “We’re designating various people … It’s largely going to be the people standing right behind me”—who included Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine. “Venezuela has a lot of bad people,” Trump added. “We’re not going to take a chance that one of those people take over from Maduro.”

Asked how long this transition will take, Trump said he’d  “like to do it quickly,” but that rebuilding the country’s oil infrastructure “takes a period of time.”

Still, it remains unclear how America really will “run” Venezuela, a country of 28.5 million people, roughly the size of Texas or California. Its military officers, most of whom were loyal to Maduro, are still in place, as are its cabinet ministers and bureaucrats. Trump said that many of them will soon be switching sides. Maybe, maybe not. There are also more than 20,000 Cubans in Venezuela, many of them military and intelligence officers, many others health-care workers, all of them providing services in exchange for Venezuelan oil. Will they be leaving? Will power struggles be breaking out? Will the military simply adapt to Washington’s demands, in exchange for guarantees to stay in power?

Then there are broader questions. The whole world is watching not just this operation—an impressive tactical display of U.S. military power—but what happens next. Trump’s unabashedly imperial rationale for the action may inspire Russian President Vladimir Putin to double down on his claims of rightful dominance over Ukraine—and Chinese President Xi Jinping to feel more confident in his claims over Taiwan. At the same time, anti-regime activists in Iran may feel emboldened, especially since Trump said, just the other day, that he stands “locked and loaded” to punish Tehran’s leaders if they killed protesters.

Finally, there is Cuba. In his press conference, Trump noted similarities between Cuba and Venezuela. Both countries have been wrecked by socialist dictators, and “we want to help the people in Cuba.” Rubio, a Cuban-American who has avidly supported the anti-Castro movement in Florida (which he once represented as a senator), added, “If I lived in Havana and worked in the government, I’d be concerned.”

Meanwhile, the U.S. aircraft carrier and its supporting armada, which had mobilized off Venezuela’s shore before the operation, remain deployed, and on high alert. “We’re ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so,” Trump said.

It was around noon when I stepped off the train, surfacing into Lower Manhattan’s particular brand of winter blight—when the cold is amplified by tall buildings that block out direct sun and funnel air directly onto your face. It was about 25 degrees, though the temperature felt theoretical once the wind got involved. Within minutes my ears had gone brittle, aching in that sharp kind of way that makes you briefly resent your parents for ever leaving the Middle East.

I followed a small group of South Asian aunties in industrial-grade puffers and bright yellow “Zohran” campaign beanies, which smartly functioned equally as political statements and survival gear. They led me toward the official public “block party,” a kenneled-off stretch of Broadway that I had optimistically imagined would involve warmth-adjacent amenities: food carts, coffee in little paper cups that burn your fingers just a bit, maybe even porta-potties. Instead, it was a wide, empty street hemmed in by police barricades and a few enormous screens. Music blasted. People stood around. That was it.

The aunties seemed genuinely delighted, bopping along to Bruno Mars as if this were the triumph of civic joy they had been waiting for since Election Day. I, meanwhile, realized that joy without circulation was not sustainable for me. I lasted maybe five minutes.

I cut north toward City Hall Plaza, where the actual inauguration was scheduled to take place.

I was expecting a spectacle. Zohran Mamdani is a New York mayor of many firsts: the first Muslim, the first South Asian, the first African-born, the first millennial. In the middle of the Trump era—which has been particularly hostile to every one of those identities—I wanted to see how that collision landed in person. I was curious how ordinary New Yorkers, from the people who powered his rise to City Hall to those who opposed it and everyone in between, would experience a moment that already felt larger than a single election.

What I found instead was something messier and more revealing. New York was working through its feelings in real time. Pride and paranoia crossed paths on the sidewalk. Joy and cynicism hovered in the frozen air. As always, the city was a layered collage best understood through the small encounters and fleeting scenes unfolding at street level as history happened in the background.

Along the barricades, I passed a small group of protesters waving Israeli flags. I approached one woman for a quote. She immediately bristled, waving her hand in my face and telling me to leave, then threatening to call the police—an escalation that felt unnecessary given that we were already surrounded by officers.

Another protester, who declined to provide her name, apologized quietly for the interaction. She told me that some of the others were “kind of crazy.” She stood a few feet away from them, holding her flag politely, not chanting or yelling. She said she was worried about Mamdani’s “background” and wanted to show support for Israel in defiance of a mayor who had broken with New York’s long tradition of unyielding support for the Israeli government. She sounded less angry than anxious, fixated on Mamdani’s outspokenness on what experts have called a genocide, and her nervousness for the future of Zionist New Yorkers.

By the time I reached the security entrance, the program was supposed to start in less than an hour. Volunteers urged attendees to take their seats, but they milled around, greeting old friends, hugging, shouting names across rows of white folding chairs. Unlike the public block party, this felt like a gathering of the campaign’s engine—organizers, supporters, donors, artists, electeds—the people who had powered what many still described as the biggest political upset since Donald Trump’s 2016 win.

Just inside the checkpoint, a woman smiled and said, “Hi, I’m Marisa.” Another chimed in: “Hi, I’m Natasha.” It took me a second to register that they were Marisa Tomei and Natasha Lyonne. Neither was surrounded by handlers or slated to speak. They were simply there, guests like everyone else, bundled up and waiting for things to begin. Both were warm and unfussy, radiating the kind of ease that comes from being completely at home in a crowd like this. The inauguration hadn’t even started, and already it was a vibe.

Hundreds filled the seats. There was music, chatter, the low buzz of anticipation. And yet, nothing about this place was warm. I was uncontrollably shivering.

I started mentally cataloging everything I hadn’t brought with me: a fluffy scarf, a hat that actually covered my ears, maybe even a balaclava, though I doubted that would play well for an Arab at an inauguration, even with the mayor being a Muslim.

Everywhere I looked were red Democratic Socialists of America beanies, pulled low, doing the quiet but essential work of insulation. I considered asking for one, though I want to be clear: I wanted one because my head was so cold I could feel my thoughts slowing down. Still, there was something remarkable about the destigmatization of a previously dirty word in politics out in force on the lawn of City Hall.

Then I saw him. A Sikh man a few rows from the front unfurled a blanket with the calm confidence of someone who had planned for this exact scenario. He wrapped himself completely and settled into his chair. At regular intervals, he poured himself a cup of steaming hot chai from his thermos. I watched with envy the way the steam rose into the air. I’d have traded my camera for a sip.

The crowd itself felt carefully curated: actors, activists, organizers, journalists, all packed together. Walton Goggins, of HBO’s The White Lotus, hovered nearby, visibly delighted to see Lyonne. Model Waris Ahluwalia looked impeccable, as expected. Kareem Rahma, of Subway Takes fame, fresh off the best year of his career, filmed the scene on his caseless iPhone. Mustafa the Poet was there too, unmistakable and stylish.

Then came the faces I knew from my reporting in 2025: Mohsen Mahdawi and Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian students of Columbia University with green cards who had been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for their activism. Linda Sarsour, a Brooklyn-born activist, sat near the front in a striking purple hijab. Simone Zimmerman, a Zeteo contributor and a central focus of the film Israelism. Writer Suzy Hansen and I exchanged smiles as we took it all in.

It was brutally cold. Sitting felt impossible. I kept moving, using my camera as an excuse. “If I sit, I’ll miss the moment,” I kept telling people. I ran into familiar faces—Asad Dandia, Husein Yatabarry, Dr. Debbie Almontaser—Muslim New Yorkers I know as part of the civic ecosystem that helped propel Mamdani to success.

As I continued to circle the crowd, ducking between rows of folding chairs, I caught the same refrains over and over. Visitors chatted as they tried to process what they were watching unfold.

“I’ve never seen this much negative coverage of any New York mayor. Fearmongering and what ifs count as journalism now?” one said. Another agreed. “Even if he can’t accomplish everything—because, let’s be honest, they’re going to make his life hell—at least he’s given us a vision of what different could look like,” they noted. “Anyone who has to contort themselves this hard to hate the most likable political figure imaginable clearly has a persecution fetish.”

A Muslim woman in hijab said, “If the Democratic Party had half Mamdani’s integrity, the fascists wouldn’t be winning.” An excited fan waving a handmade Mamdani sign exclaimed, “Zohran delivered Bernie clapping in a beanie—already the best mayor!” Another reveler asked: “Wait. Is that Susan Sarandon? That’s definitely Susan Sarandon. And John Turturro. Right?”

I also overheard some fierce debates between visitors in DSA hats. “This feels like Obama all over again, and that scares me. They’re going to sabotage him at every turn and then blame him when things don’t magically work,” said one. “Can we stop saying ‘free’ transit? We pay for it. Libraries, schools, buses, that’s what taxes are for.” Said another: “Socialists used to hold office in this country. They helped win labor rights we take for granted,” They added: “MAGA keeps saying they hate corrupt billionaire elites—but they’re terrified of a guy who wants to tax the rich? What did you think an ‘everyman’ mayor was supposed to do?”

(At one point, people around me began whispering excitedly about outgoing Mayor Eric Adams. Apparently, he looked miserable. Someone said, “He’s having a terrible time.” Someone else replied, “Good.” I had snapped a photo earlier in which he appeared to be pouting. I showed it to them. They leaped with joy. It was petty. It was human.)

The program began with a speech delivered by an excited Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. “New York City has chosen the ambitious pursuit of universal child care, affordable rents and housing, and clean and dignified public transit for all. We have chosen that over the distractions of bigotry and the barbarism of extreme income inequality.”

She and other speakers made several references to the fact that the city was now officially in the care of its first Muslim leader. Imam Khalid Latif was the New York Police Department’s first Muslim chaplain and executive director and chaplain (imam) for the Islamic Center at New York University; he left the latter post last summer to become the co-founder and executive director of the Islamic Center of New York City. As with the many sermons he’s given for Friday prayer, he delivered a moving speech that explicitly tied Mamdani’s faith to his politics.

I came expecting a political coronation. But as I worked my way through the crowd, it felt closer to a collective recalibration—a moment to take stock of how ideas once dismissed as fringe, like openly taxing wealthy citizens, were now being voiced from the steps of City Hall without apology, and to wonder how much further the shift could go.

Bernie Sanders delivered an impassioned speech in which he demanded our government put a stop to growing income inequality. The audience collectively broke out into a loud chant: “Tax the rich!” A person next to me remarked, “Let’s start with everyone up there!,” pointing to Mamdani’s political allies who had joined him onstage.

There was still plenty of starry-eyed enthusiasm for the handsome young mayor and the hope he represented. But beneath that was something more measured: a curiosity about how far the boundaries of the possible had moved in just a year.

For Muslim New Yorkers, however, the moment carried an undeniable added weight. It marked a break from the post-9/11 norms of suspicion and overpolicing many had grown accustomed to, even if no one pretended a finish line had been crossed. If the election signaled anything, it was that the city was willing, at least for now, to test what happens when the old guardrails of governance are loosened and we head in a new direction.

When Mamdani finally took the stage, the energy spiked. At 34, he is the city’s youngest mayor in over a century and, as its first Muslim mayor, the first to take the oath of office on a Quran. Sanders administered the oath, a detail that might have seemed odd given that the senator represents Vermont, but Mamdani cut his political teeth working on Sanders’ campaign, borrowed much of his democratic socialist vocabulary from him, and describes the senator as a political role model. In that sense, it appeared more like an anointing than a procedural formality: the veteran of the American left passing the baton to a younger standard-bearer.

But that raises an obvious question, one that has hovered over Mamdani’s rise from the start: Is he controversial more for his politics or for his religion? The honest answer is that the two are often deliberately collapsed into each other by critics who want to scare Americans with labels, a tactic that would be funny were they not so malignant: think “Islamo-Marxism” and “Islamo-Communism.” Both are shorthand for something foreign.

This is where I should stop and define what democratic socialism is, as it’s been at the center of much of the misinformation about Mamdani. Democratic socialism, as practiced by Zohran Mamdani, is not about abolishing markets or nationalizing everything in sight. It’s about using democratic government to make sure basic needs—housing, transit, health care, education—aren’t treated like luxury goods. New York already runs on plenty of these ideas: public schools, public hospitals, rent regulation, the subway. No one panics when the fire department shows up. We’ve just decided, over time, that some things work better when profit isn’t the point.

There’s also the religion—one that Mamdani and I share. He ran openly as a Muslim in a city still shaped by 9/11, where the backlash that followed turned Muslims in New York and New Jersey into targets of NYPD surveillance and, at times, convenient scapegoats for elected officials. Mamdani made efforts to reassure skeptics, but he didn’t shrink himself to avoid the familiar panic. Claims of divided loyalties will echo, along with other decades-old tropes. Instead, he adopted a posture many of us learned long ago: smiling, appealing to shared humanity and civil rights, refusing to let bad-faith attacks dictate his mood. When you’re held up by a community, the panic stays external.

Then, Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani delivered his speech. It was measured, full of gratitude, hope, and defiance, which was the opposite of how Mamdani’s rise has been framed in much of the country. For months, the panic had been building, growing louder and more unhinged the closer he got to actually winning. After he defeated Andrew Cuomo, parts of the right responded with something less like political critique than demographic hallucination. In November, Sen. Tommy Tuberville warned that New York was already lost.

“We just saw what happened in New York,” he said. “We lost New York. It will be completely Muslim in three or four years.” In the senator’s framing, Mamdani is an appendage of a nefarious global force seeking to destroy America. Mamdani’s speech showed he understands New York, and America, possibly better than anyone else, definitely more than Tuberville.

Tuberville, who has described Islam as a “cult” and suggested that Muslims are “here to conquer,” is not fringe. His comments circulated widely, echoed by conservative commentators and algorithmically rewarded for their certainty. “He was just sworn in on the Quran,” wrote right-wing influencer Benny Johnson. “New York, we tried to warn you.”

Warned us of what, exactly? It’s not clear. That a Muslim might govern openly as himself? That a holy book might briefly appear on a municipal stage? That the city where nearly every language and religion on earth already exists in public would somehow collapse under the weight of its own plurality?

Throughout, Zionist protesters across the barricades tried to break the moment with air horns, their blare faint but audible on the official recording. No one onstage flinched. Mamdani didn’t pause. The crowd didn’t turn. The speech carried on, uninterrupted.

When the new mayor turned to the question of who this city is for, he was blunt. “They will be Russian Jewish immigrants in Brighton Beach,” he said. “They will be Palestinian New Yorkers in Bay Ridge who will no longer have to contend with a politics that speaks of universalism and then makes them the exception.” I interpreted it as a rebuke of a Democratic culture long comfortable invoking unity while carving out exclusions.

Standing there in the cold, watching Mamdani rest his hand on the Quran while Sanders administered the oath, I found the disconnect impossible to ignore. There was no takeover, no creeping caliphate. Just a bundled-up mayor promising to govern “audaciously,” speaking to a crowd that looked exactly like New York at its best. What struck me most was how unremarkable it all was, in a good way. He didn’t brandish it as a symbol or treat the moment like a breakthrough to be celebrated. He took the oath. He finished. The ceremony moved on. It was quiet, almost defiant in its normality. It was a welcome change.

And yet I felt something else too—something I hadn’t quite expected. A flicker of satisfaction. A guilty, bracing thrill.

For years, Muslim Americans have been instructed explicitly to keep our heads down. To soften ourselves. To reassure the anxious who are deeply misinformed about the content of the Quran and the nature of its followers. I saw it in my family too. My father, who worked in New York as a taxicab and black car driver for 30 years, told me to be grateful, to be quiet, and to avoid bringing any extra attention to ourselves or our community. That we had enough problems to deal with and didn’t need to give anyone an excuse to train their Islamophobia on us. My mom took a slightly different approach, noting that it was up to us to gently prove we are not the nightmare someone else keeps insisting we are by being nice, being charitable at every opportunity, and making sure everyone knows we’re Muslim if only just to offer them another glimpse of what we are to contrast with what they might assume.

Watching the panic unfold, I realized that part of what felt so electric about this moment was that, for once, the discomfort and uncertainty had shifted off my shoulders and onto those who hate American Muslims the most.

For just a moment, it wasn’t Muslims being asked to stomach their fear for what the future might hold. It was the people who hate us trying—and failing—to make Mamdani into some Muslim ideologue who moonlights as a jihadist with dual allegiance to a nonexistent global Muslim cabal.

In his speech, Mamdani directly addressed his skeptics, those who “view this administration with distrust or disdain,” and told them plainly: “If you are a New Yorker, I am your mayor.” He invoked what he loved about growing up in the city, the languages, foods, and neighborhoods, the fact that he, a Muslim, can have bagel and lox as one of his weekly rituals. He described a place that looked and sounded exactly like the crowd shivering in front of him. It’s hopeful to see oneself in the top seat. It’s a new experience for us, something others get to experience. Can’t we just have that?

I was cold and extremely ready to go home, more than confident I had seen enough for my story and eager to be out of the cold. And then, outside, like a glitch in the city, I ran into Curtis Sliwa—the 2025 Republican candidate for New York mayor. He was alone, wandering.

He told me he had RSVP’d and “was in line with all the peeps waiting to get in” but had never made it inside. He didn’t even catch Mamdani’s speech. The line was too long. I asked why he hadn’t gone to the front, that surely someone would have recognized him and ushered him inside. He laughed and said he preferred it this way: “Come on. I’m no VIP. I’m just one of the regular people out of the subway into the streets.” He said he had no regrets about his campaign. He smiled when he recalled Mamdani saying he’d rather be trapped in an elevator with Sliwa than Cuomo. He told me he planned to support Mamdani. “He won fair and square. He should be given a chance to put his agenda into place. Even if you disagree with him politically, you got to say: If he is successful, then the city is successful, the state, the country, everyone is successful. But you have haters out there, and that’s what life is about.”

He admitted he felt wanted by neither Republicans nor Democrats. “I’m an outlier,” he said. “I’d rather be with the people.”

Then he vanished into the afternoon just as quickly as he’d appeared.

What stayed with me wasn’t just pride, though there was plenty of that. It was relief. Relief that, for once, a side selling hope instead of fear had won. And it was clear this wasn’t some narrow Muslim celebration. Muslims largely supported Mamdani, but they weren’t automatic votes. They were earned. He campaigned for them, chasing them around at one of the public celebrations that make New York such an exciting place to live.

That’s the complexity of it. The pride of watching a Muslim achieve something historic, paired with the humility of knowing that this victory doesn’t belong to Muslims alone. Zohran Mamdani isn’t a “Muslim mayor” the way his critics insist.

Every year, Amicus co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern invite listeners to nominate the Supreme Court’s most egregious behavior, then choose their own “worst of the worst” to memorialize the most ignominious moments. In 2025, there was no shortage of contenders. In a preview of their conversation on this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode, Lithwick reveals the SCOTUS lowlight that still rankles her the most. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mark Joseph Stern: We certainly had a bumper crop of bad decisions this year. What’s your nominee for worst of the worst?

Dahlia Lithwick: There were a lot of decisions in 2025 that immiserated huge amounts of people and made the world materially worse. But my pick is not one of those. Instead, I need to talk about NIH v. American Public Health Association. Yes, it has to do with slashing research grants, which does materially harm a lot of people. But more profoundly for me, this case is emblematic of every single level of destruction and mayhem coming out of the Supreme Court—all the arrogance bundled into one.

So let me take you back to August, when the justices handed down NIH. It’s another unsigned, incoherent shadow-docket order pausing U.S. District Judge William Young’s decision to block the Trump administration from canceling thousands of National Institutes of Health grants—including those supporting research into suicide prevention, HIV transmission, Alzheimer’s, and cardiovascular disease. The NIH is the largest funder of medical research in the world, but Donald Trump’s executive orders forced it to cancel all those grants because they allegedly promoted DEI, “gender ideology,” and COVID research. Young held a bench trial, then issued a 103-page opinion laying out extensive factual findings and holding that the agency must make good on the payments of these grants. A federal appeals court agreed.

Then the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court in an emergency posture. And the justices hand down a 5–4 decision that’s totally inscrutable but says that Young contradicted a different 5–4 shadow-docket order from last April, Department of Education v. California. That decision halted another judge’s efforts to require the administration to reinstate canceled education grants. And the court asserted that it controlled this case. Right there, you have the perfect shadow-docket sandwich: perfunctory, bad decisionmaking, conclusory predictions about what constitutes an “emergency” and who’s going to win, decided in a couple of days, wiping out extensive factual findings. And it’s rooted in a different shadow-docket order that, as Justice Elena Kagan said at the time, was “at the least under-developed, and very possibly wrong.”

So likely wrong, in fact, that Chief Justice John Roberts actually dissented from California, and dissented again in NIH! It takes a lot of nonsense to make the chief jump ship. But the majority in both cases said that the plaintiffs had to seek reimbursement from the Court of Federal Claims rather than the district court through the Administrative Procedure Act. Which is both obviously wrong and, as a practical matter, impossible much of the time.

This is why the court doesn’t decide national “emergencies” with some back-of-the-cocktail-napkin, invisible-ink reasoning, then expect judges across the country to act as though it wrote a law-review article on the subject. Here’s Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:

Today’s decision reveals California’s considerable wingspan: That case’s ipse dixit now apparently governs all APA challenges to grant-funding determinations that the government asks us to address in the context of an emergency stay application. A half paragraph of reasoning (issued without full briefing or any oral argument) thus suffices here to partially sustain the government’s abrupt cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars allocated to support life-saving biomedical research.

I want to get to the ham in the shadow-docket sandwich. Famously, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote a snotty concurring opinion, joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, that went after Young—a senior district judge with 47 years on the bench and a Ronald Reagan appointee. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh accused him of ignoring their shadow-docket ruling, claiming that it “squarely controlled” his case. And Gorsuch snippily noted: “Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them.” And he continued:

This is now the third time in a matter of weeks this Court has had to intercede in a case squarely controlled by one of its precedents. All these interventions should have been unnecessary, but together they underscore a basic tenet of our judicial system: Whatever their own views, judges are duty-bound to respect the hierarchy of the federal court system created by the Constitution and Congress.

That gets my vote for the single nastiest opinion of 2025. It even prompted Young to apologize to Gorsuch and Kavanaugh from the bench.

One thing that floats to mind is: Can you imagine how horrible it must be to have to work with these people every single day? This is how they treat lower-court judges—how do you think they treat colleagues like Jackson? No wonder she accused them of “Calvinball” in her NIH dissent. Maybe she’s being informed by the fact that her colleagues evidently treat her like garbage on and off the page. That’s why one of my contenders for “worst of the worst” is Justice Amy Coney Barrett condescendingly dismissing Jackson in her CASA decision. It just drips with contempt for her. I cannot imagine having to be collegial with these people.

The only thing I want to add to that is that judges are getting death threats and impeachment threats and being thrown under the bus by members of Congress and the president. And the justices on the Supreme Court themselves are like: Should I go after a senior district judge personally for not applying my inscrutable shadow-docket order? And do it in a way that makes it sound as if he’s reckless and insubordinate and doesn’t care about the law? Why, yes! Fantastic idea.

In a special new year retrospective, Amicus host Dahlia Lithwick revisits an important episode from early 2025. Back at the beginning of February, Kim Lane Scheppele, the Laurance S. Rockefeller Professor of Sociology and International affairs at Princeton University, pointed to the speed and viciousness of the very opening legal gambits in Trump 2.0 as evidence that America had already switched over to the fast track for autocracy on January 20th, 2025. An expert in the law of autocracy, Scheppele has seen firsthand what happened to constitutional courts, the media, the academy and the democratic norms that protected them in Russia and Hungary. In this interview, Scheppelle explains how Trump’s executive orders on everything from government funding to transgender people in the military reveal a familiar global playbook that has chillingly familiar endpoints.

At the close of 2025, many progressive commentators were seizing on any glimmer of hope that America’s march toward authoritarianism might be slowing to a crawl. On Dec. 26, the New York Times’ Michelle Goldberg proclaimed that “Trump Is Getting Weaker, and the Resistance Is Getting Stronger.”

Goldberg quoted Leah Greenberg, a founder of the resistance group Indivisible, who said that while Donald Trump “has been able to do extraordinary damage that will have generational effects, he has not successfully consolidated power. That has been staved off, and it has been staved off not, frankly, due to the efforts of pretty much anyone in elite institutions or political leadership but due to the efforts of regular people declining to go along with fascism.”

Regardless of whether Goldberg and Greenberg are correct in their assessments, Americans need to recognize that as hard as resisting “fascism” is, rebuilding democracy will be even harder. That means that as progressives mobilize to resist Trump, they must invest in rebuilding the foundation of democracy at the same time. That will require work on many fronts, including addressing the problems of our political institutions, the wealth gap, and our polarized society.

Democracy’s problems were with us before Trump, and they will be with us after he leaves the scene.

Addressing them is the work of schools and civic organizations, for sure. But it is also work that citizens can and must do on their own.

Each of us needs to resolve to relearn how to think and act democratically.

If 2025 taught us anything, it should have been that the architecture of democracy in the United States is in urgent need of repair. As the political scientist Eric Shickler explains, Trump has shown himself to be “willing to destroy essentially any element of the old order—leaving aside the bond market, evidently—to achieve dominance.”

Schickler argues that “capitalizing on changes that go back several decades—the rise of nationalized polarization, the development of the unitary executive theory, and the growing sway of populist conservatives within the Republican Party—Donald Trump has demonstrated that the sources of countervailing power in the U.S. political system are far more fragile than previously understood.”

And while Americans continue to prefer being governed democratically and still support democratic norms, at least in principle, only about one-third of Americans say they are satisfied with the way our democracy is functioning. The results of a survey reported in November suggest the extent of the problem. The survey found that “84% say democracy is either in crisis or facing serious challenges. Only 11% say it is doing well.” Dissatisfaction is greater among Republicans than it is among Democrats and independents. It is also greater among younger people than among older people.

This suggests that democracy will be as much a cultural as a political project. It will require commitment by people on both ends of the political spectrum to lowering the heat and abandoning the rush to righteousness and demonization that, all too often, has characterized our political discourse.

But even then, more will need to be done. That is the work that I call relearning democratic habits.

Recall that almost 200 years ago, Alexis de Tocqueville, the famous French commentator on American politics, argued that the customs, beliefs, and behaviors of the people are more important than anything else in making American democracy work. As the New Yorker’s Adam Gopnik explained more than two decades ago, de Tocqueville knew that “it wasn’t social contracts or declarations of the rights of man which made democracies work but the subtle and contradictory workings of existing mores and manners. … He saw that democracy belonged, in his wonderful phrase, to the empire of example rather than to the kingdom of reason; he saw that it was habitual before it was anything else, and wondered how that habit could grow, and how it could be deformed.”

In our own time, regrowing democratic habits requires that we first identify what some of those habits are. Let me name a few of them here.

First: Tell the truth as you know it, but tell it in a way that can be heard by others who don’t already agree with you.

Democracy is all about persuasion, and few are persuaded by being denounced and accused of being racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. If we want to persuade, we must find ways to give our opponents a place to stand. To do that, we need to understand not just what they think but why they think as they do. That in turn requires empathy.

Professor Michael Morrell argues that “the process of empathy involves understanding another’s feelings, and sensing as these feelings change, but not judging or actually sharing them.” It requires, Morrell explains, “openness toward others, reciprocity, tolerance, mutual respect, inclusion, attentiveness, cooperation and fairness.” Empathy, Morrell continues, “helps us to understand the ‘impacts a decision will have on others’ ” and leads to “legitimate, justified democratic decision-making that truly takes all into consideration.” Without empathy, Morrell observes, “democracy will be a broken promise.”

A second democratic habit involves being a generous listener.

Democracy thrives when citizens remember what the Stoic philosopher Epictetus said more than two thousand years ago: “We have two ears and one mouth, so we can listen twice as much as we speak.” Indeed, as Astra Taylor observed, democracy would be enriched if we recognized what she calls a “right to listen.”

Perhaps that could be better described as a right to be heard. Unfortunately, we know that many people today do not think others are interested in what they have to say. If no one listens, then why speak?

Deciding to listen is a democratic gesture. It requires that we try to understand not only what someone is saying but also what they wish to convey.

The listening that democracy requires means “catching someone else’s words in flight” and trying to enlarge their meaning. Democratic citizens need to develop the habit of listening imaginatively rather than in a competitive or judgmental way. That kind of listening accords to the speaker what Taylor calls “a special kind of recognition and respect.” “As citizens,” she adds, “we understand that the right to speak has to be facilitated, bolstered by institutions and protected by laws. But we’ve been slow to see that, if democracy is to function well, listening must also be supported and defended.”

Humility involves an acceptance of the limits of one’s own knowledge and perspective. “I could be wrong but …” is the locution of the democratic citizen. It helps us accept the results of elections, even when we lose.

“Humility,” John Keane notes, “has an allergic reaction to the self-satisfied Hobbesian rule homo homini lupus est (man is a wolf to men). … Those who are humble … dislike vanity and have an affinity with honesty; nonsense on stilts and lies and bullshit on thrones is not their scene. Humble humans … know that they do not know everything, that they are not God, or a god or goddess.”

“Humility,” Keane argues, “is a vital resource that strengthens the powerless and tames the powerful by questioning their claims to superiority.”

Humility encourages speakers to speak so that their words can be heard by others with whom they don’t already agree. It nurtures imaginative, generous listening. And that is why, as Keane puts it, humility is the “friend of democracy.”

As we contemplate the daunting task of rebuilding American democracy, each of us has a role to play. We can all practice speaking to persuade, not degrade, listening with an open heart and a curious mind, and remembering that we are not gods or goddesses.

If we do, we have a chance to succeed in restoring the health of our democracy. If we don’t, nothing else will matter.

            <h2>Claude is his copilot: Rust veteran designs new Rue programming language with help from AI bot</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/03/claude_copilot_rue_steve_klabnik/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Naming a new programming language &quot;Rue&quot; sounds like an acknowledgment of doubt about the project&#39;s prospects, if you take &quot;Rue&quot; to mean &quot;regret.&quot;

But veteran software developer Steve Klabnik, known for his contributions to Rust and to Ruby on Rails, says there&#39;s more to it than that.

&quot;Rust as a name evokes a few things,&quot; he explained in an email to The Register. &quot;One of them is decay, entropy. A negative connotation. Another is the type of fungus, which is a positive one.

&quot;Rue came about as a name because I did Ruby, and then Rust... so I needed to start with Ru. And a &#39;rue&#39; can be, as you said, &#39;to rue the day&#39; or similar, but it is also a kind of flower.

&quot;I liked the symmetry with a negative and positive connotation. It&#39;s also really short, which is nice.&quot;

Rue, as Klabnik explained in a blog post last month, &quot;is a systems programming language that aims to provide memory safety without garbage collection, while offering higher-level ergonomics than languages like Rust and Zig.&quot;

Garbage collection in programming refers to automatic memory management, which can take several forms. It serves to reduce memory errors arising from explicit memory deallocation – a goal trumpeted by US cyber authorities. One of Rust&#39;s selling points is that it can provide memory safety guarantees using the subset of the language, though with a learning curve that&#39;s generally considered steeper than modern languages like Go or Swift.

Klabnik said he has spent many years talking to people about Rust and its complexity is a common concern. The reason offered in the Rust community, he said, was that languages used for low-level tasks like operating systems have a variety of constraints that make things complicated.

He explained, &quot;So I thought it would be neat to explore that design space: what if Rust wasn&#39;t trying to compete with C and C++ for the highest performance possible? What if we were willing to make things a little bit, but not too much, less performant, in exchange for ease of use? What if we made the language itself a bit larger, that is, with fewer features in purely library code, as a means of making the overall package simpler?

&quot;There have been a ton of languages with garbage collectors, but less without, especially in the last 20 years. So I think the &#39;memory safe, yet no tracing [garbage collector]&#39; space is just under-explored generally. There are a ton of small languages exploring this space, and I want to give my own take on it.&quot;

It&#39;s not clear from the existing code samples whether Rue is more approachable than Rust, given that a Rue version of the common Fizz Buzz exercise doesn&#39;t look all that different from a Rust version.

Yet Klabnik&#39;s take is not entirely his own. Rue, written largely in Rust, relies substantially on Anthropic&#39;s Claude AI model, which owes its capabilities to all the developers whose code has informed the model&#39;s training data.

&quot;Rue is being developed by Steve Klabnik, but also by Claude,&quot; according to an initial blog post credited to both Klabnik and his AI assistant of choice. Two posts later, Claude alone is credited with summarizing the first week of development.

&quot;I had started Rue earlier this year,&quot; Klabnik explains. &quot;But I was not as good with LLMs as I am now, and I made some mistakes. I started over. I&#39;ve gotten further in the two weeks I&#39;ve been working on it this time than the month or two I spent last time. That&#39;s partially due to better models, but also just largely due to my own skill in understanding how to use LLMs effectively.&quot;

He said that for small projects that do something semi-custom, models like Claude can be useful even for developers without much experience. With larger projects, knowledge of software engineering matters more, he said.

&quot;So, I think like anything, you can start small and move up,&quot; he explained. &quot;Small, self-contained projects? Sure, even a non-programmer can make use of these tools. But they are tools, and tools require expertise.

&quot;Even knowing existing programming isn&#39;t enough to truly get a lot of good use of LLMs, they&#39;re tools in their own right. Vim isn&#39;t easy to use, and knowing programming doesn&#39;t help you use it, but it&#39;s a useful tool anyway. But it&#39;s its own skill. Software development techniques like testing are distinct skills from writing code to get something done. I see LLMs the same way. They have a low skill ceiling to get started, but a pretty high one to use most effectively.&quot;

Klabnik said it&#39;s difficult to estimate the time that Claude has saved (or imposed).

&quot;What I can say for sure is that I&#39;ve gotten much farther on this project than I would have otherwise without it,&quot; he said. &quot;Rue&#39;s about 70k lines of Rust code two weeks into its life. Now, lines of code isn&#39;t everything, of course, I&#39;m actually working on a substantial refactor of something right now, even. But just to give you an idea of the rough size. I know that if I had worked on this by hand, I&#39;d be much less farther along, and probably (though I&#39;m not sure about this just yet) at a lower level of quality.&quot;

Claude hasn&#39;t yet offered an assessment of Rue code quality. But the AI model has emitted tokens that read like an argument for its own capabilities.

&quot;I think what this week showed is that the core of a language — the compiler itself — can come together remarkably quickly when you have the right leverage,&quot; Claude responded in answer to Klabnik&#39;s presumed prompt, using em-dashes as might be expected. &quot;We don&#39;t have an LSP [Language Server Protocol] yet. We don&#39;t have a package manager. But we have a real compiler that produces real executables, with enough infrastructure to keep building on.

&quot;The honest truth is that most of those 130 commits have my fingerprints on them. Steve directed, reviewed, and made the hard design decisions. I wrote most of the code. That&#39;s an unusual collaboration, and I&#39;m not sure what to make of it yet.&quot;

Klabnik isn&#39;t any more certain about the project&#39;s prospects. &quot;If nobody ever uses it, that&#39;s fine by me, and if in ten years it&#39;s a major programming language, well that&#39;s probably fine too,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m not trying to force anything, I&#39;m just working on something I enjoy and finding out where that takes me.&quot;

Claude is along for the ride as copilot. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/03/elon_musk_grok_scandal_underwear_strippers_gross/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Grok, the AI chatbot owned and operated by Elon Musk&#39;s xAI, is facing a firestorm of outrage after users prompted it to create images of naked and scantily clad people from real photographs, some of whom are underage.

Grok is a chatbot originally created by xAI, Elon Musk&#39;s artificial intelligence startup. Earlier this year, xAI acquired X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, which Elon Musk also controls, and folded the platform into his AI startup.

Recently, some X users noticed if they took a photograph that had been posted on the service and prompted Grok to remove the clothing from that photo, it would do so and post the results publicly on X. This may have violated various laws, such as the TAKE IT DOWN Act passed by the US Congress in April and signed into law in May, which &quot;criminalizes the nonconsensual publication of intimate images.&quot;

Users took screenshots of the responses to their prompts and posted them on social media, prompting reporters to write scandalized stories about the AI chatbot in which they attributed agency to it, despite it being a collection of computer algorithms performing calculations against reams of data provided by internet users over many years, then returning the output as words that mimic the kinds of words generated by a human being.

Another user then wrote a different prompt that caused Grok to return a series of words that looked like an apology. Then, the X account for Grok generated a tweet or whatever you call it now blaming &quot;lapses in safeguards&quot; and said it was &quot;urgently fixing them.&quot; It is not clear whether this latest tweet was written by a human or was another AI-generated response to yet another prompt.

Point being: Grok is not a sentient being. It does not have agency. It is computer software created and maintained by humans. The human creators of most AI bots program them not to generate responses that are obviously illegal, immoral, or otherwise off-putting to the users they are trying to attract. At this juncture, Grok&#39;s human creators appear to have failed to prevent it from creating posts that remove the clothing from real people in real photos when asked to do so.

This may or may not be intentional. But I know that Grok is quite popular among a certain set precisely because it is more freewheeling about displaying explicit images than other chatbots. Case in point: A couple of weeks ago, at a dive bar in a beachside suburb of San Francisco, I saw a couple of fratty looking dudes demonstrating something on their phones with big grins on their faces. I asked them what they were doing, and one of them took a photo of me, then used AI to generate images that appeared to put me in compromising positions – one had me kissing an imaginary woman, another had me flanked by a couple of scantily clad strippers. The images were extremely realistic. I asked them how they did this, what tool they were using.

I don&#39;t know where any of this is going. But AI-generated images are only going to get better and cheaper and faster, and there will always be one or more vendors who are willing to push various envelopes. That&#39;s what the tech industry does. Move fast and break things. Ask forgiveness, not permission. Make them stop you.

Whatever happens, society will have to adapt to the consequences.

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/02/apple_vision_pro_meta_quest_sales_drop/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple’s pricey Vision Pro VR headset had a tough 2025.

The company halted manufacturing with one of its suppliers, failed to ship any of the $3,500 headsets for the first three quarters of the year, then relaunched the headset with one of its high end M5 chips in time for the fourth quarter, but managed to get just 45,000 out of the door in 2025, according to IDC.

That’s about 345,000 fewer Vision Pros than it shipped in 2024.

By comparison, Meta, shipped 1.7 million Meta Quest units in the first three quarters of 2025, according to IDC. It helps that they cost about one-tenth as much, starting around $349.

But even Meta&#39;s shipments were down 16 percent year over year, and the consumer market for bulky headgear has cooled to a damp chill, IDC vice president Francisco Jeronimo told The Register.

“All of these ideas that AR and VR would replace smartphones didn’t happen. It will never happen,” Jeronimo said by phone on Friday.

Last year looked more promising: Apple shipped 390,000 Vision Pro headsets, making about $1.4 billion revenue from the devices, while Meta shipped 5.6 million Quest and Quest Pros in that same time frame representing about $2.9 billion in revenue, IDC said.

Among consumers, the strongest demand for large headsets is within the gaming segment, Jeronimo said. Meta has made strong inroads here featuring break out hits like Beat Saber, Gorilla Tag, and Job Simulator.

But even still, IDC expects the overall market for mixed and virtual reality headset shipments to decline 42.8% once the final numbers are in for 2025.

The headwinds against VR headsets also saw Apple and Meta drop advertising for them in 2025, according to Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm. Apple’s Vision Pro advertising accounted for less than 1 percent of its overall ad spend in the US, the firm found.

Overall, Apple’s digital ad spend tied to the Vision Pro in the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, UK, Italy and Japan in YTD 2025 was down more than 95% year over year in each market, Sensor Tower found. Meta’s ad spend tied to the Quest in those same markets was down more than 55% year over year, its researchers stated.

What appears to be heating up, however, is the market for smart glasses, Jeronimo told The Register.

IDC expects that market to have grown 211.2 percent in 2025. Meta shipped 20,000 units of its new Meta Ray-Ban Display in the third quarter of 2025.

“When it comes to glasses, there’s the perception – and our estimations indicate – that its probably the next ‘big thing’ in terms of interacting with content without hands,” Jeronimo said. “

IDC forecasts that smart glasses are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.3% from 2025 to 2029.

“Whether glasses will replace smartphones, we still don’t know whether that will be the case or not, but what we see is way more interest from different players to explore that kind of product because it provides an interesting experience to end users without having to spend $3,500 on a device.”

While consumers outside of gaming may not bite on bulky headsets, there may yet be commercial and educational applications for Apple’s Vision Pro.

Earlier this year Apple executives outlined enterprise use cases for the Vision Pro in health care, vehicle design and manufacturing, and workforce training in aviation. At UC San Diego, doctors completed 60 clinical trials in live surgeries using Vision Pro to keep patient information in their field of view while operating. Purdue University is using the headsets to train students studying manufacturing by creating digital copies of semiconductor and pharmaceutical facilities.

IDC predicts that the VR headset market will improve for Apple in 2026 with Cupertino forecast to ship 290,000 units, generating $636 million in revenues.

Jeronimo said with its plans to introduce a lower cost headset in the second half of 2026, he doesn’t think Apple is giving up on the device, but it is likely looking at a smaller market aimed at enterprise and education.

“When it comes to commercial, that’s where we see the opportunity. For an organization paying that kind of money for a device that can really improve processes and make the organization more efficient, that’s not that expensive,” Jeronimo told The Register. “That’s the kind of use case that will direct Apple forward, rather than trying to address a consumer opportunity that is clearly not happening.” ®

Amid doubts that revenue from Microsoft Copilot subscriptions and cloud AI services will compensate for data center capital expenditures any time soon, Satya has some incentive to convince customers and investors that AI is a financially intelligent long-term bet.

Thus he has taken up the pen in an act of &quot;thought leadership,&quot; to use the marketing jargon of his company&#39;s LinkedIn where he announced his post on a new blog entitled &quot;sn scratchpad.&quot;

Early in his post Nadella writes, &quot;We have moved past the initial phase of discovery and are entering a phase of widespread diffusion.&quot;

That&#39;s fair enough, given that widespread can mean anything. According to Pew Research, 62 percent of US adults say they interact with AI at least several times a week. The more relevant stat for Microsoft, however, is the percentage of customers who pay for Copilot and other AI services. That remains a work in progress.

He also offers a new variant on the filler phrase &quot;it&#39;s early days,&quot; so often heard from tech execs deflecting inquiries about lack of results. &quot;We are still in the opening miles of a marathon,&quot; he opined. &quot;Much remains unpredictable.&quot;

Getting down to business, the Microsoft CEO says that there are three things the tech industry and society need to &quot;get right&quot; in 2026 to make AI return real value for everyone. First, we must develop a &quot;theory of mind&quot; that treats AI as a tool that amplifies humans and products should be designed around this belief. He uses Steve Jobs&#39; famous quote that computers are &quot;bicycles for the mind&quot; as a jumping off point.

When Microsoft is having to reassure people that its own research on the labor impact of AI shouldn&#39;t be interpreted to mean that jobs will be eliminated, you can see why Nadella might be keen to avoid the impression that AI is intended as a substitute for human labor.

&quot;What matters is not the power of any given model, but how people choose to apply it to achieve their goals,&quot; Nadella wrote.

Second, Nadella posits that we move from &quot;models&quot; to &quot;systems&quot; for AI such that multiple models and agents working together can provide value.

&quot;We are now entering a phase where we build rich scaffolds that orchestrate multiple models and agents; account for memory and entitlements; enable rich and safe &#39;tools use,&#39;&quot; said Nadella.

So perhaps we can look forward to agents failing less than 70 percent of the time.

Finally, he argues, that society needs to make tough decisions about how and where to deploy AI so that it has &quot;real world impact.&quot;

&quot;The choices we make about where we apply our scarce energy, compute, and talent resources will matter,&quot; he wrote. &quot;This is the socio-technical issue we need to build consensus around.&quot;

Building consensus in this case apparently means forcing AI on everyone despite protestations, expressing bafflement that anyone would reject the technology, and spending millions on lobbying. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ilya Lichtenstein, who pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges tied to the 2016 theft of about 120,000 bitcoins from the Bitfinex exchange and was sentenced to five years in prison, has been released after roughly 14 months in the slammer.

&quot;Thanks to President Trump&#39;s First Step Act, I have been released from prison early,&quot; Lichtenstein said in a late Thursday post on X.

&quot;I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can,&quot; he continued. &quot;To the supporters, thank you for everything. To the haters, I look forward to proving you wrong.&quot;

Trump signed the prison-reform First Step Act into law during his first term in 2018. A White House official confirmed Lichtenstein&#39;s early release to The Register, noting that he served &quot;significant time on his sentence&quot; and has been placed on home confinement, &quot;consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.&quot;

In a subsequent Xeet and selfie, Lichtenstein&#39;s wife Heather Morgan (aka Razzlekhan), who also pleaded guilty to helping launder the stolen crypto and received an early release from her 18-month sentence, called her husband&#39;s release &quot;the best New Years present I could get.&quot;

The infamous duo were arrested in February 2022, and in August 2023 pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges related to the 2016 theft of some 120,000 bitcoins from Hong Kong-based Bitfinex.

While Lichtenstein got five years behind bars for his crimes, Morgan received a lighter sentence and only spent about nine months in the clink, thanking &quot;Papa Trump&quot; in a bathtub video upon her early release.

Netflix released a 2024 documentary about the Bitfinex burglars called Biggest Heist Ever. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A cybercrook claims to have breached Pickett and Associates, a Florida-based engineering firm whose clients include major US utilities, and is selling what they claim to be about 139 GB of engineering data about Tampa Electric Company, Duke Energy Florida, and American Electric Power. The price is 6.5 bitcoin, which amounts to about $585,000.

Based in Tampa, Florida, Pickett USA provides transmission and distribution design, project management, surveying, aerial mapping, and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) services to utilities and mining operations across the US and Caribbean.

When contacted by The Register, a Pickett USA spokesperson said the company has no comment on the alleged breach.

In screenshots shared on social media and posted on Daily Dark Web, the criminal claims to have stolen 892 files belonging to the engineering firm, which they describe on the for-sale post as &quot;real, operational engineering data from active projects of major utilities and is suitable for infrastructure analysis and risk assessment.&quot;

The crim says the haul spans more than 800 classified raw LiDAR point cloud files in .las format ranging from 100 MB to 2 GB each; full coverage of transmission line corridors and substations, which includes layers for bare earth, vegetation, conductors, and structures; high-resolution orthophotos in .ecw format; MicroStation design files and PTC settings; large vegetation feature files in .xyz format; and other files from active projects.

According to the crook – and, as we have repeatedly warned: criminals aren&#39;t the most trustworthy lot, so take this for what it is – the stolen files belong to some very large American utilities. Tampa Electric Company serves about 860,000 customers, including 90,000 businesses, across West Central Florida, while Duke Energy Florida has about 2 million residential and business customers across the state, and American Electric Power serves nearly 5.6 million customers across 11 states. The crook has offered four sample files to interested buyers as proof.

A Duke Energy spokesperson told The Register that it is investigating the criminal&#39;s claims.

&quot;With threats evolving every day, Duke Energy&#39;s highly skilled cyber security team works diligently to protect our businesses, systems and information technology assets and responds quickly if a cyber incident occurs,&quot; the spokesperson said in an email sent to The Register. &quot;We are taking the necessary actions to investigate this claim.&quot;

The other two companies did not respond to our request for comment.

This same criminal is also selling what they claim to be an internal database belonging to Germany&#39;s Enerparc AG and containing details about solar projects in Spain&#39;s Mallorca and Alicante regions.

These recent alleged breaches come as miscreants increasingly target critical sectors, and (if true) are especially concerning as they put transmission lines, energy stations, and ongoing projects at risk.

Last month, Amazon&#39;s Chief Information Security Officer blamed Russia&#39;s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) for a years-long campaign targeting Western countries&#39; energy sectors and other critical infrastructure providers, and US government agencies and international partners warned operational technology (OT) owners and operators to secure their critical networks against attacks by pro-Russian hackers.

In late 2023 China&#39;s Volt Typhoon famously targeted power utilities in an effort to prepare Beijing for destructive cyberattacks against those targets.

It&#39;s not just government-backed attackers breaking into these critical facilities. Ransomware gangs and other financially motivated criminals have also shown an interest in critical infrastructure targets, as energy and water providers are more likely to pay extortion demands to keep the lights and heat on for customers and keep water flowing out of their faucets.

According to the FBI&#39;s most recent Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) annual report, ransomware posed the biggest threat to critical infrastructure organizations in 2024 with the number of complaints to the IC3 increasing nine percent compared to the year prior. In fact, America&#39;s critical infrastructure operators reported almost 4,900 cybersecurity threats in 2024 with ransomware (1,403 complaints) topping the list. ®

Valve has announced the winners of the 2025 Steam Awards and, unsurprisingly, Hollow Knight: Silksong, took home the Game of the Year honors. It was also given the “Best Game You Suck At” award, which, I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or not. Given the relentless fawning over Silksong since its release in September, an event that nearly brought the entire digital video game distribution system to its knees, that it would win Game of the Year felt like something of a forgone conclusion.

The Best Game on Steam Deck was awarded to Hades II (an award we’d already unofficially granted it). The mechanics of Hades lend it to being played in short bursts, and the stylized graphics scale down well. Silent Hill f won the Outstanding Visual Style award and, while there’s no denying it’s a gorgeous title, I can’t help but feel like Dream BBQ, with its uniquely hallucinatory visuals, got robbed. Check out the full list of winners and nominees here at the Steam Awards 2025 landing page.

A brand new account made some suspiciously timed bets on Polymarket.

Shortly before the US military launched an attack on Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro, an account on Polymarket made some very suspiciously timed investments. The prediction market had been running bets on when or if Maduro would be removed from power, with prices for “out by January 31, 2026” as low as $0.07 late Friday evening. But within 24 hours of the military action, a newly created account invested tens of thousands of dollars, racking up several hundred thousand in profits.

The account was created less than a week ago, and invested over $30,000 the day before the assault, turning a profit of over $408,000. The activity was flagged on social media, with people speculating that the person placing the bet was acting on inside information and perhaps even worked at the Pentagon. Joe Pompliano, an investor and podcaster, quickly pointed out on X that “Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged.”

There have been past incidents of seemingly obvious insider trading on prediction markets, but the companies often show little interest in curbing such behavior. This is partly because these companies believe the value they offer is not a level playing field for investors, but rather in delivering news and insights. When reached for comment, Kalshi, another prediction market, pointed us to a post on X stating that such insider trading was against its rules. We reached out to Polymarket for comment, but have yet to receive a response.

Update January 3rd: Added comment from Kalshi.

We posted a couple of times about Meta’s Quest 3S during the holidays. The virtual reality headset that typically sold for $299.99 was — and still is — available for $249.99. Better yet, you can get in on a promotion at Amazon that includes a $50 digital account credit with purchase. You can find a similar sale price of $249.99 at other retailers, but it seems like Amazon is the only one that includes a gift card.

The Quest 3S is a wonderful device for first-time virtual reality explorers. It builds on what made the Quest 2 so good (comfortable, easy to use, surprisingly capable) and adds more power. In fact, it has the same chipset as the pricier Quest 3, but with similar optic materials and screens as the Quest 2 it’s meant to replace. The Meta Quest store is filled with fun games and apps, and PC gamers can link the headset (wired or wirelessly) to their machines to play Steam VR games, such as the immersive VR showpiece Half-Life: Alyx. Read our review.

The Meta Quest 3S is a battery-powered standalone VR headset that has the same chipset as the pricier Quest 3, but with the same lenses and screen resolution as the Quest 2. In addition to being able to play many games from the Meta Store, it can also be connected to a gaming PC to play VR games like Half-Life Alyx. Read our review.

Apple AirTags are the kind of gadget that you know right away if you’d benefit from using them, or if someone you live with would. These Bluetooth trackers are great for keeping tabs on suitcases, keys, handbags, wallets, or any other kind of everyday necessity that has a small place to slip in Apple’s Mentos-sized tracker. The best deal running on a four-pack of AirTags is still going strong, in case you realized after the holidays that you wanted some. Normally $99 for four (already a $20 savings versus the price of buying four individually), you can get a set for $64.98 at Amazon and Walmart. This knocks the price per AirTag down to $16.25.

Apple’s AirTag is unobtrusive, waterproof, and taps into the massive Find My network for out-of-range locating. Read our original review.

Steam’s big winter sale on PC games is ending Monday, January 5th, at 1pm ET / 10am PT. It’s the last huge, catalog-spanning sale event until mid-March when its spring sale kicks off. There will be sales between now and then, but there’s no better time than now to stock up on games. There are too many discounts to list, but fans of any genre will likely find several titles worth buying — if they don’t already have them. Just looking at my wishlist on Steam, Silent Hill F at $41.99 (was $69.99) is pretty attractive, but I might first jump at some indie game deals, like 25 percent off The Seance of Blake Manor.

            <div id="article-text">﻿The secret to Netflix’s biggest hit wasn’t its love of the past, but how it spoke to the present.

﻿The secret to Netflix’s biggest hit wasn’t its love of the past, but how it spoke to the present.

The parking lot was packed. That’s the first Strange Thing.

A little background. Just about every mall is struggling now, but the Neshaminy Mall in Bensalem, Pennsylvania is more or less comatose. As Defector’s Dan McQuade, a lifelong Pennsylvanian and mall fan, wrote in his fond remembrance of the shopping center, the once bustling complex is mostly a shuttered ghost town, with half of it set to be demolished. There are only two real reasons to go there: a well-stocked Barnes & Noble and the AMC movie theater.

And people do go there for the movie theater. It’s one of only three theaters in the Philly area with an IMAX screen, making it a destination for fans of prestige formats. I’m there often in my job as a critic, and I’m used to the IMAX auditorium being a full house. The parking lot outside of the theater at 8PM on New Year’s Eve, the night it’s showing Stranger Things 5: The Finale, however, was on another level. The concession line was overwhelming (tickets were free, but to reserve a spot guests bought a $20 concession voucher), and waits for snacks more involved than popcorn, soda, and candy were substantial. The energy was infectious. It was the most crowded I’ve seen a theater since Barbenheimer.

This was disconcerting. I knew, intellectually, that Stranger Things was a big deal. Netflix, notoriously opaque but quite ruthless in pruning shows that do not meet whatever metrics it does not share, has always treated the show like its Avengers or Star Wars. Regular PR blasts trumpet all manner of impressive stats, new episodes cause the service to crash, and the cast and iconography show up in ads and brand deals that no other Netflix show gets. Season 4 put Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill” back on the charts, one of many nostalgic hits the show has brought roaring back. Even in the dodgy world of streaming data, it’s clear Stranger Things has a big audience and remains a phenomenon even if later seasons are not the critical darlings the first was. It can be much harder to feel this.

There are many potential reasons: an increasingly fractured internet, the diffuse and curatorial nature of online fandom, Netflix’s conversation-killing binge-release strategy, and long gaps between seasons that snuffed out any sense of momentum. There’s also the show itself. Analyzing Stranger Things is not that difficult; the show has always more or less just meant what it said. There was no mystery it proposed that its characters wouldn’t solve, no reference that the show’s creators wouldn’t talk about (either themselves or through the show), and its narrative was almost entirely unconcerned with the world beyond Hawkins, Indiana. Even the Upside Down, the show’s other-dimensional realm of horrors, is so barren and empty that the final season declares its true nature to be a bridge and not a place, linking our world to the actual home of the show’s supernatural horrors. (And another surprisingly barren landscape.)

In practice, this makes Stranger Things a show that feels complex, but is quite easy to follow. Which also makes it the sort of thing all kinds of people would watch together. And maybe even drive out to a dead mall for on New Year’s Eve.

The second Strange Thing: According to the woman who scanned my ticket, this was the busiest she had seen this theater since Black Friday 2024, the weekend Gladiator II and Wicked both premiered. Back then, she remembers being told that theater staff expected 8,000 people for the day. On this night, they expected a crowd of 1,000 people to turn up over one hour.

I saw entire families, many in pajamas. Friends young and old. Lots of couples. There were Hellfire Club T-shirts, Demogorgon crowns and popcorn buckets (purchased in advance, from Target). Everyone was taking group selfies, posting photos or Instagram Reels of how crowded the concession area was. It’s New Year’s Eve, and everyone is having a ball.

Behind me in the concession line I met a woman named Gia who came with her daughters. They had been watching together since the first season in 2016 and love that the show’s exciting, “with lots of things happening.” They told me that they were nervous for the finale, “scared that people will die.”

”I like the nostalgia it brings to me, even though I didn’t grow up in the ’80s.”

There was a lot of that sort of talk. I overheard someone saying they thought Dustin was going to die, despite Steve’s efforts to save him. In the bathroom just before showtime, a teenager lamented how long his little brother was taking to wash his hands. “I swear to god,” he said. “If I miss a single fucking minute of this I’ll kill myself.”

I met one couple, Adam and Tiffany, who drove an hour to be there. Recently engaged and in their late 20s and early 30s, they began watching Stranger Things individually, as teenagers, before they started watching together. (He said this was season 3; she said it’s 4.)

“I like the nostalgia it brings to me, even though I didn’t grow up in the ’80s,” Adam said. He grew up watching E.T. and The Goonies, so he feels an affinity for the era in spite of his youth. He also loved the government conspiracy elements. “The first season it was really prevalent, with the MK Ultra stuff that it depicted. People didn’t know about it and it was a great way to expose people to it. I really enjoy that attitude the first season had and it kind of continues, especially in the latest season — the government does not always have your best interest in mind.”

Tiffany, for her part, feels like “we really have grown to know and love all of the characters, you know? I’m not ready to cry tonight.”

I must confess that I was continually surprised by all of this. I’ve grown accustomed to the asynchronous way most modern entertainment is enjoyed and discussed — often apologetically, as everyone triangulates how much of which shows they’ve seen and can talk about. Sports are among the only reliably communal experiences we get in front of our screens. Television as the characters on Stranger Things experienced it was communal, in shared living spaces where the screen fought for attention with the world around it. Television as Stranger Things fans have experienced it is virtually private, watched on a phone or laptop or TV at your convenience.

One last Strange Thing: Even for me, a Stranger Things hater, watching the finale in a packed house was frankly incredible. The crowd cheered early and often: when fan favorite Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) is saved from plummeting to his doom by his rival Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton); when newly minted fan-favorite character Derek Turnbow (Jake Connelly) gives the villainous Vecna the finger with his “Suck my fat one!” catchphrase; when Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) stares down the massive, arachnid Mind Flayer in the finale’s climactic battle. When a character is thought to have died, a chorus of sniffles works its way through the room.

There is a sincerity to Stranger Things that is at odds with the cynicism of its marketing and imitators. The Duffer brothers are enthusiastic imitators that are happy to share their crib sheet, but they’ve always been open about what they’ve intended with Stranger Things. Despite all the dissonant things they’ve put inside of it as the show grew in every possible way, hopscotching from genre to genre often nonsensically, it remains a coming-of-age story about all the ways one can grow up.

It’s the secret weapon of the show, the way it’s not just about the four D&D-playing kids getting older, but their older siblings on the cusp of adulthood or their parents who sank into bad patterns and had to do some growing of their own. In this last season, the show leaned into its age, introducing younger siblings who are about to face things the core four did; caring for them is their final step to maturity.

Stranger Things’ relentless focus on nostalgia can make it easy to forget the present it aired in, and what it must have been like to grow up in that time. If you were a child watching it, you were a child watching when Donald Trump was elected the first time, when covid-19 took the world out from under you, when social media let our worst horrors beat a path right to your pocket. Your very own personal Upside Down.

“Life has been so unfair to you, so cruel,” Jim Hopper (David Harbour) tells his surrogate daughter early on in the finale, when Eleven is committed to dying in her fight against Vecna because she believes she doesn’t belong in the world anymore. He tells her to fight to imagine a life beyond the horror. “I know you don’t believe you can have any of this. But I promise you, we will find a way to make it real. You will find a way to make it real, because you have to. Because you deserve it.”

It’s a line that collapses the fourth wall, escaping the Hawkins / Upside Down of this movie-fueled vision of 1987 to crash right into the final moments of 2025. The roomful of fans, young and old, here with their families and partners and friends, taking selfies, hooting and hollering, haven’t just spent 10 years with characters on TV that feel like friends. They’ve grown up, and watched each other grow up, through hell. And the kids, young adults, and grown-ups of Stranger Things have gone through hell with them. A ludicrous, nonsensical nightmare parade that has, in some ways, rendered them unrecognizable from the people they were 10 years ago, the way bookish Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer) has now become a rifle-toting monster slayer.

Marking the end of that journey in a theater full of people who have been on it with you? What a way to close out a year. What a nice note to start a new one on, going back out into the world with all your fellow fans, looking for the right side up.

            <h2>This smart home controller is literally a piece of wood</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mui’s long-gestating calm-tech board finally ships — and it’s a thoughtful, if very expensive, alternative to screens.

One of the fun parts of being a tech journalist for over a decade is that occasionally you get to watch a truly unique gadget go from concept to reality — and, eventually, into your living room. That’s the case with the Mui Board, a smart home controller built into a piece of wood.

The Mui was first demoed at CES in 2019, and I’ve seen it at several shows over the years, in various iterations, always with the promise that it would ship soon. Well, this year it did (in limited quantities!), and I finally got to try one out in my living room.

A minimalist smart home controller made from a piece of wood, the Mui Board works with Matter, Sonos, Hue, and others. It takes a new approach to how we interact with technology in our homes.

You could call the Mui Board an anti-smart display. A Raspberry Pi-based smart home controller with Matter support, it’s just a piece of wood on your wall when not in use. But when you touch its capacitive surface, glowing dot-matrix icons appear, letting you control your music and lighting, set timers, view messages, and access other information you might use a smart display for.

The idea is that technology should blend into your home — be calm, accessible, and integrated, not jarring or distracting. Mui is a Japanese term for being in harmony with nature, and the device is certified by the Calm Tech Institute. As someone surrounded by screens and smart displays in my home, I have long been intrigued by Mui’s alternative approach and was excited to try it out.

I’ve had the Mui Board second gen in my home for a few days now, and while I haven’t had a chance to fully put it through its paces, I’ve been impressed by its responsiveness, thoughtful design, and ambitious scope.

The second-gen model debuted in 2023 but only became available for purchase earlier this year on Mui and Indiegogo. At $999 (on sale for $799), the Mui Board still feels closer to a beautifully realized concept than a mass-market product. It’s hard to imagine many people spending a thousand dollars on a smart home controller — but for the right person, it’s undeniably delightful.

Created by Japan-based Mui Labs, the Mui Board comes in two colors: natural maple or dark cherry. I am testing the maple version and have mounted it on the wall in my living room, just above my sofa.

From there, I can reach up and tap it to see the time or weather, check what’s playing on my Sonos system, control my Hue lights, set a timer, and see the latest headlines from The Verge via a neat RSS feed feature.

It’s a simple interface with minimalist icons that offer more control than you might expect at first glance. You can dim and turn lights on and off (no color changing), adjust a thermostat’s temperature, mode, and fan speed, open and close curtains and locks, and turn smart plugs on and off. What’s different from other smart home controllers with touch interfaces is that there are no ads, no chatty voice assistant, and no bright, distracting display vying for my attention.

Out of the box, the Mui Board connects to Wi-Fi and can display the time and weather. You can set timers, alarms, and reminders, and send messages to other Mui boards or the Mui app. It has two small built-in speakers and a microphone for recording messages, and is powered by an included AC adapter.

Touching and drawing on the Mui Board is its best feature. It’s responsive and easy to use, and it has some delightful features. A small cat roams around the board and changes direction when you tap it. There’s a piano / drum mode that turns the board into a music machine, and you write messages on it by hand, not with a keyboard. It feels like technology you can play with.

For smart home control, the Mui Board supports Matter and integrates with Sonos, Philips Hue, LIFX, SwitchBot, Ecobee, and Google Calendar APIs, among others, plus several Japanese services, including Radiko and the Echonet smart home protocol.

Using the fairly simple Mui app, I connected the board to my Sonos system, and it displayed the title of the currently playing track, volume, and playback controls, and I could skip forward or back in my playlist.

As a Matter controller, it can set up and control supported Matter devices directly, without using Amazon, Google, Apple, or similar services. It works with lighting, plugs, and thermostats, with locks next on the roadmap.

It currently supports Matter over Wi-Fi, with Thread support planned. There’s no Thread radio onboard, so you’ll need a third-party border router. Lighting works best so far, while the other categories are still in limited testing.

I successfully added a Meross Matter Wi-Fi smart plug directly to the board but struggled to pair some Matter devices, such as my Nest thermostat, using Matter’s multi-admin feature. I plan to do more testing here.

I was able to connect my Hue lighting setup and could turn on and off all the lights or control each individually on the board. It was fairly slow, however, probably because I have a large Hue setup, and it was using the cloud API rather than a local connection. I really liked the Veil of Night feature that lets you draw a line on the board to set a timer that gradually dims the lighting.

Ultimately, the Mui Board is a big button / switch for controlling your smart home, with the benefit of icons to guide you to what you’re doing without a bright screen. As with any icon-based control, it takes a bit of learning to remember which icon does what, but you can customize the layout to put your most-used controls on the first screen and scroll through additional screens for more options.

While I love the natural, furniture-like feel, when the board is off, it slightly resembles a two-by-four mounted on the wall — as if my husband abandoned a DIY project halfway through. A rounded edge, more sculptural profile, or small shelf accessory would go a long way toward softening the look. Also, there’s the issue of what to do with the cable.

I installed the Mui in our living room, but after using it for a few days, I think the ideal place for this is in a bedroom, over a bedside table or headboard. That’s the room most people would like to keep screens out of, yet still want to control lights, locks, music, etc., without reaching for a phone or using voice.

I don’t see using Mui Board exclusively as a smart home controller; its software doesn’t feel quite there yet for creating scenes and automations. But as an interface to your smart home, it’s a breath of fresh air. And as a fun device for controlling music, setting timers, and playing the piano, it’s successful, if very, very expensive.

It’s been a slow burn to get the Mui Board to where it is today, and I’m intrigued to see where this thoughtful company takes its calm tech concept next. Mui Labs will be at CES again this year, where the company plans to debut a new well-being-focused sleep experience and “movement-based lighting control” for the Mui Board.

            <div id="article-text">Hot on the heels of new year’s celebrations, the annual Consumer Electronics Show will get underway in early January 2026. Once again, Las Vegas will host a sprawling sneak peek at the tech that will shape the industry throughout 2026.

The Verge will be on the ground at CES 2026 covering the biggest announcements, press conferences, and gadgets and we’ll be sharing hands-on impressions and takeaways of the best new tech making its debut in Vegas. The show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 6th, for four days, but you can expect some of the major news to drop in the days and weeks leading up to the show.

You can stay on top of all of The Verge’s CES 2026 coverage right here including standout innovations, clever upgrades, and even the weird stuff the show is often known for.

United Airlines interrupted boarding my plane to CES 2026 to say: “This flight to Vegas is special.” Why? Apparently, it’s the inaugural flight from Newark Airport with Starlink. There was a wireless charging pad waiting at our seats.

Also: I can confirm Starlink is so much faster than regular plane Wi-Fi.

The Fraimic Smart Canvas is a framed E-ink screen being shown off for the first time at CES 2026. It’s meant to mimic your typical wall art but, because nothing is sacred, instead of showing an actual painting or a photo by a human, it displays AI “art” generated by your voice prompts. The Smart Canvas is available for preorder in two sizes, standard for $399 and large for $999, though deliveries aren’t expected until June.

One of the fun parts of being a tech journalist for over a decade is that occasionally you get to watch a truly unique gadget go from concept to reality — and, eventually, into your living room. That’s the case with the Mui Board, a smart home controller built into a piece of wood.

The Mui was first demoed at CES in 2019, and I’ve seen it at several shows over the years, in various iterations, always with the promise that it would ship soon. Well, this year it did (in limited quantities!), and I finally got to try one out in my living room.

Have you always wanted to scan your groceries at home? If so, the newest smart fridge from GE Appliances is for you. There’s a barcode scanner built into the water dispenser that works along with an interior camera and an 8-inch tablet to help you keep track of what food you need and add it to your digital shopping list.

The GE Profile Smart 4-Door French-Door Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant is being announced at CES 2026, which kicks off next week, and is slated to launch in April for $4,899 — $500 more than a comparable non-Kitchen Assistant model.

LG is teasing the 2026 Gram Pro laptops that will be fully unveiled at CES, including what the company claims is the “world’s lightest 17-inch RTX laptop.” The LG Gram Pro 17 (17Z90UR) and Gram Pro 16 (16Z90U) will introduce a new ultralight “Aerominum material” developed by LG that aims to reduce a laptop’s weight while reinforcing strength and scratch resistance.

The LG Gram Pro 17 will feature a 2,560 x 1600 display, paired with Nvidia’s RTX 5050 laptop GPU that has just 8GB of VRAM. LG claims it will still provide “ample performance for graphics-intensive tasks, content creation, and gaming.” You won’t be able to run most modern games at maxed-out settings in a playable state though, so you shouldn’t consider the Gram Pro 17 as a dedicated gaming laptop. LG hasn’t revealed how much the Gram Pro 17 will actually weigh, but notes that it will be exclusive to the US at launch.

Clicks is expanding beyond keyboard cases and bringing its QWERTY keys for phones to another format: a magnetic power bank accessory with a slide-out keyboard. The Power Keyboard offers a 2150mAh battery that can top off a phone battery via MagSafe or Qi2 wireless charging, but its real superpower is its full keyboard that can connect to your phone or smart device over Bluetooth. I love a multitasking battery pack, and a keyboard for my phone that I can throw in my bag? Sounds even sweeter.

The Power Keyboard offers a range of extendable positions to accommodate different sized phones. It’ll also work in landscape mode, or over Bluetooth without being physically attached to your device. This way, it can act as an input for a smart TV or a tablet in a pinch. The keyboard does need to draw power from its integrated battery to operate over Bluetooth; Clicks’ cofounder and marketing head Jeff Gadway tells me that users will be able to “protect milliamp-hourage for keyboard usage,” so your phone won’t gobble up all of its charge and leave it inoperable.

You ever find yourself thinking, “I wish my phone had a phone?” Good news, friend. Clicks — the company behind the QWERTY keyboard case for your iPhone — has just the thing: the Clicks Communicator. It’s intended as a kind of complement to your smartphone for when you just want to stay in touch without all the other distractions of your device. The Communicator comes with a full QWERTY keyboard, along with its own cellular connection, so you can leave your main phone behind. But that privilege comes at a price: $499, to be exact.

Let’s set aside the fact that the Communicator costs as much as a Pixel 9A and focus on the glorious gadgetness of it all. For starters, the Communicator comes with interchangeable back plates so you can switch up your style. There’s also a built-in headphone jack, a physical mute switch, and expandable storage via microSD — all the little things that mainstream phone makers have dropped over the past decade. The keyboard keys are physically larger than what you’ll get on the Clicks phone case, and the whole keyboard is touch sensitive so it can act as a trackpad.

The biggest tech show of the year kicks off next week, as some of the industry’s top players show up to Las Vegas for CES 2026. We’ll be there to see all the new product demos we can and to bring you the most exciting news from the show. Follow our coverage for a preview of all the new tech these companies are planning to launch in 2026.

Expect to see the usual suspects: laptops, smart home gadgets, and TVs, and a whole lot more wearables and health tech. We’re anticipating seeing more products with AI integration. Also, robots. Perhaps, humanoids even.

Fender, the guitar maker also known for its amps and speakers, has a new consumer electronics brand called Fender Audio making its debut at CES 2026. In addition to a new pair of wireless headphones, Fender Audio has announced a pair of portable Bluetooth speakers called ELIE, which is short for “Extremely Loud Infinitely Expressive.”

The ELIE speakers will be available in two sizes, but both versions can be connected to a second unit to create a stereo pair, or you can connect and sync up to 100 of them to fill a larger space with sound. They also both support a unique feature letting you listen to audio from up to four different audio inputs simultaneously. These can include a Bluetooth device like a smartphone, an instrument or microphone plugged into the ELIE’s XLR/1/4-inch combo jack with a cable, and two other accessories connected using Fender’s proprietary wireless system.

Fender Audio, the consumer electronics brand owned by the famous guitar maker, has announced its first pair of wireless headphones at CES 2026. What sets the Mix headphones apart from the competition are impressive battery life, a modular design that allows the ear cups and headband to be swapped to alternate colors, and a focus on longevity with a battery that’s easy to access and swap.

When they launch this year the Mix headphones will initially be available in olympic white and skyscraper black color options for $299.99. That’s considerably cheaper than Sony’s $450 flagship WH-1000XM6 headphones that debuted last May. We haven’t had a chance to test the Mix’s hybrid active noise cancellation to confirm if it’s comparable to Sony’s class-leading ANC in the WH-1000XM6, but Fender Audio bests Sony on battery life. While Sony’s ANC headphones max out at up to 30 hours of playback with ANC on and up to 40 hours with it off, the Mix headphones offer up to 52 hours with ANC and up to 100 hours without.

Punkt, the Switzerland-based, privacy-focused phone maker, is trying the whole “smartphone” thing again. The MC03 improves on some of the disappointing features of its previous effort, the MC02, while maintaining its security focus. Likewise, its software still comes with a subscription fee: the first year is included free, but it’s $12 per month after that. On top of that, the MC03 is Punkt’s first phone to be assembled in Europe rather than Asia, making good on its promise from earlier this year.

The MC02, released last year, wasn’t exactly a critical darling. Punkt seems to be addressing some of those criticisms with a more modern 6.67-inch 120Hz OLED compared to last year’s 60Hz LCD. The 5,200mAh battery is user-replaceable. The MC03 ships with AphyOS, from the equally privacy-oriented company Apostrophy, and it’s based on AOSP 15 — more current than the AOSP 13-based version the MC02 shipped with, though still a version behind this year’s flagships. The MC03 is IP68 rated, comes with a MediaTek 7300 chipset, and is scheduled to get three OS upgrades and five years of security updates.

The Freestyle Plus all-in-one portable projector features 430 ISO lumens, or “nearly twice the brightness of the previous generation,” according to Samsung. Great! But also a little strange since both the original and second generation Freestyle projectors listed “550 lumens” on their respective spec sheets.

See, projector makers are notorious for playing fast and loose with the lumen spec. So much so that Epson has been on a legal rampage over the last few years. As a result, companies like Anker, Yaber, AAXA, Xgimi, AWOL vision... even Dr. J have all been forced to restate brightness measurements in industry standard ISO lumens. That’s good because having a consistent lumen spec makes it easier to predict how the projected image will hold up to ambient light that wants to wash out the viewing experience.

Petkit has announced two new automated machines at CES 2026 designed to feed and care for your pets using AI-powered cameras that track their behavior and provide health insights that may otherwise go unnoticed.

Launching sometime in April 2026, the Petkit Yumshare Daily Feast is one of the first automatic dispensers that works with wet food. The machine can provide up to 7 days of meals and uses an NFC-based tracking system to automatically remove a serving if it hasn’t been consumed after 48 hours. UVC lighting helps sanitize the delivery of fresh meals, while an AI-powered 1080P night vision camera with a 140-degree field-of-view tracks when your pet eats and how much food is left over before a fresh pack is dispensed. Petkit plans to offer the Yumshare Daily Feast to pet food companies as a wet food serving platform instead of selling it directly to consumers, and each company will set the pricing of the machine and meal refills.

Want a sneak peek at HP’s CES 2026 lineup? Windows Latest claims to have the entire list — my eye is on the HP EliteBook X, which will reportedly let Intel’s Panther Lake, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X2 Elite, and AMD’s reportedly refreshed Ryzen AI 400 compete head-to-head. Wonder which one is best!

Remember when Dell made the baffling decision last January to ditch its awesome XPS brand for the utterly milquetoast “Dell Pro” and “Dell Pro Max” instead? After just one year, VideoCardz’ sources report, XPS laptops are coming back. Dell will reportedly announce them at CES 2026 next week.

LG is adding a karaoke-focused party speaker to its lineup of Xboom devices, which is built in collaboration with Will.i.am. Announced this week, LG says the Stage 501 speaker comes with an “AI Karaoke Master” that can remove or adjust vocals from “virtually any song,” similar to the Soundcore Rave 3S.

It can also adjust the pitch of the songs to make them more comfortable to sing, and it doesn’t require karaoke-specific audio files to do so, according to LG. Like its predecessor, the Stage 501 features a five-sided design but comes equipped with upgraded dual woofers and full-range drivers that LG claims will deliver richer audio. The swappable 99Wh battery offers up to 25 hours of playback and delivers 160W of power (or up to 220W when plugged in).

GameSir is no stranger to experimenting with unique controller features — its Tarantula Pro can automatically swap its face button labels to accommodate alternate layouts, and its Pocket 1 clamps Game Boy controls onto your phone. What sets its new Swift Drive controller apart is a small steering wheel located smack-dab in the middle of the gamepad that’s connected to what GameSir calls the “world’s smallest direct drive motor” providing force feedback effects for racing games.

Pricing and availability hasn’t been announced yet, but GameSir has revealed plenty of details about the Swift Drive’s features and functionality. The steering wheel uses a “high-precision” Hall effect encoder with “up to 65,000 levels of resolution for ultra-accurate steering.” Its movement can be adjusted between 30 and 1080 degrees of rotation, and the wheel itself can be removed and swapped with alternate styles. Hall effect sensors are also used in the Swift Drive’s joysticks and buttons, while its triggers are further enhanced with individual haptic motors to simulate the feeling of ABS braking and wheel slip.

In just the past couple years, the art TV category that’s been dominated by Samsung’s The Frame has seen growth, with additions from both TCL and Hisense. Now LG has announced its own entry, the LG Gallery TV. The TV will leverage the Gallery+ service that LG released earlier this year, which includes thousands of display visuals ranging from pieces of art to cinematic images to gaming scenes. Much like Samsung’s Art Store, Gallery+ has a limited free option, but its full capability requires a subscription.

The new Gallery TV shouldn’t be confused with the G Series OLED TVs, like the LG G5, even though the G Series used to be called the Gallery Series up until a couple years ago. The Gallery TV is a mini-LED TV with “a specialized screen that reduces glare and minimizes reflections for an art-like viewing experience” (so it likely has a matte coating). LG hasn’t specified the backlight configuration, but all of the other art TVs use edge lighting, so it’s a safe bet that this one will as well. OLED technology, while offering superior picture quality to mini LED, isn’t able to display a single image for an extended time without concern of image retention (or burn-in).

LG unveiled a whole new line of gaming monitors ahead of CES on Friday. The UltraGear evo line are all high-end monitors covering a range of technologies, but united by 5K resolution and AI upscaling.

The three flagships under the new branding are the 39GX950B, the 27GM950B, and the 52G930B. The first number in the model name indicates the size. The rest of the letters and numbers, well, I’m sure they mean something to someone.

For years, Samsung has made products that try to camouflage what they are by displaying works of art. The Frame TV is the most famous example, but the company also released the Music Frame, a speaker disguised as a picture frame, at last year’s CES. Now, instead of hiding a speaker with a piece of art, Samsung worked with designer Erwan Bouroullec to make a speaker into a piece of art.

According to Samsung, the Music Studio line of speakers, debuting at CES 2026, draw inspiration from the “timeless dot concept” found throughout music and art. As a musician, the Music Studio 5 reminds me of a fermata, the symbol meant to hold a note or silence. It has a 4-inch woofer and dual tweeters with built-in waveguide.

LG is getting ready to take the wraps off a new robot it claims is capable of performing a “wide range” of household chores. The robot, called LG CLOiD, will make its debut at CES next month, featuring two articulated arms and five individually actuated fingers on each hand.

Though we only have a description and two images showing LG CLOiD’s five-fingered hands, it already seems a lot different from the two-wheeled home companion LG revealed last year, which came with a handle attached to its head rather than two arms.

Samsung is breaking new ground with its 2026 lineup of gaming monitors, with the Odyssey 3D G90XH becoming the first to feature a 6K display with “glasses-free 3D.” The new monitor comes with a 32-inch IPS panel, offering real-time eye-tracking that “adjusts depth and perspective” based on your position, along with a speedy 165Hz refresh rate that you can boost to 330Hz with a Dual Mode feature that switches to 3K.

The 2026 Odyssey 3D is an upgrade to the display Samsung revealed during CES last year, which comes with a smaller 27-inch display and a lower 4K resolution. We’ve seen a few other 6K monitors from Asus, Dell, and LG, though they don’t come with the Odyssey’s 3D effects or a focus on gaming. For now, select games like Stellar Blade, Lies of P: Overture, and The First Berserker: Khazan are optimized specifically for the Odyssey 3D, but several other titles still support its 3D effects, including Black Myth: Wukong, Hogwarts Legacy, Palworld, and Silent Hill 2.

Ahead of CES 2026 getting underway in early January, Birdfy has announced two new camera-equipped smart bird feeders that can identify and capture visitors in slow motion. The Birdfy Hum Bloom is specifically designed to attract and record hummingbirds using a nectar bulb that mimics flowers they’re naturally attracted to, while the Feeder Vista introduces a 360-degree camera and a bottom-up feeding system that doesn’t obstruct views. Both feeders are expected to be available in Q2 of 2026, but pricing hasn’t been announced.

The Birdfy Hum Bloom is built around an 8MP camera that can capture 4K video of hummingbirds at 20fps. Capturing 120fps slo-mo videos requires a drop in resolution to 1080P, but with hummingbirds flapping their wings around 50 to 80 times per second while hovering, you shouldn’t expect footage that will rival a National Geographic documentary.

The two already announced a collaboration back in October meant to “streamline creator workflows with AI.” Now the relationship is evolving into a dedicated button on new ASUS ProArt GoPro edition laptop that’ll probably also net a free subscription to GoPro Premium Plus for some period of time. All will be revealed at CES on January 6th.

Displace’s $5,999 wireless TV with a battery-powered suction mount is only available with a 55-inch 4K OLED panel. But at CES 2026, the company will be introducing a new $1,999 Displace Hub mounting system that works with any 55 to 100-inch TV of your choosing, as long as it weighs less than 150 pounds.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/02/1129409/will-douglas-heaven-el-estepario-siberiano-ed-atkins-laura-jean-mckay/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">My daughter introduced me to El Estepario Siberiano’s YouTube channel a few months back, and I have been obsessed ever since. The Spanish drummer (real name: Jorge Garrido) posts videos of himself playing supercharged cover versions of popular tracks, hitting his drums with such jaw-dropping speed and technique that he makes other pro drummers shake their heads in disbelief. The dozens of reaction videos posted by other musicians are a joy in themselves.

Garrido is up-front about the countless hours that it took to get this good. He says he sat behind his kit almost all day, every day for years. At a time when machines appear to do it all, there’s a kind of defiance in that level of human effort. It’s why my favorites are Garrido’s covers of electronic music, where he out-drums the drum machine. Check out his version of Skrillex and Missy Elliot’s “Ra Ta Ta” and tell me it doesn’t put happiness in your heart.

Watching Sora ­videos of Michael Jackson stealing a box of chicken nuggets or Sam Altman biting into the pink meat of a flame-grilled Pikachu has given me flashbacks to an Ed Atkins exhibition at Tate Britain I saw a few months ago. Atkins is one of the most influential and unsettling British artists of his generation. He is best known for hyper-detailed CG animations of himself (pore-perfect skin, janky movement) that play with the virtual representation of human emotions.

In The Worm we see a CGI Atkins make a long-distance call to his mother during a covid lockdown. The audio is from a recording of an actual conversation. Are we watching Atkins cry or his avatar? Our attention flickers between two realities. “When an actor breaks character during a scene, it’s known as corpsing,” Atkins has said. “I want everything I make to corpse.” Next to Atkins’s work, generative videos look like cardboard cutouts: lifelike but not alive.

What’s it like to be a pet? Australian author Laura Jean McKay’s debut novel, The Animals in That Country, will make you wish you’d never asked. A flu-like pandemic leaves people with the ability to hear what animals are saying. If that sounds too Dr. Dolittle for your tastes, rest assured: These animals are weird and nasty. A lot of the time they don’t even make any sense.

            <h2>Job titles of the future: Head-transplant surgeon</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-02</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/02/1129416/head-transplant-surgeon-sergio-canavero-future-job/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero has been preparing for a surgery that might never happen. His idea? Swap a sick person’s head—or perhaps just the brain—onto a younger, healthier body.

Canavero caused a stir in 2017 when he announced that a team he advised in China had exchanged heads between two corpses. But he never convinced skeptics that his technique could succeed—or to believe his claim that a procedure on a live person was imminent. The Chicago Tribune labeled him the “P.T. Barnum of transplantation.”

Canavero withdrew from the spotlight. But the idea of head transplants isn’t going away. Instead, he says, the concept has recently been getting a fresh look from life-extension enthusiasts and stealth Silicon Valley startups.

It’s been rocky. After he began publishing his surgical ideas a decade ago, Canavero says, he got his “pink slip” from the Molinette Hospital in Turin, where he’d spent 22 years on staff. “I’m an out-of-the-establishment guy. So that has made things harder, I have to say,” he says.

No other solution to aging is on the horizon. “It’s become absolutely clear over the past years that the idea of some incredible tech to rejuvenate elderly people—­happening in some secret lab, like Google—is really going nowhere,” he says. “You have to go for the whole shebang.”

He means getting a new body, not just one new organ. Canavero has an easy mastery of English idioms and an unexpected Southern twang. He says that’s due to a fascination with American comics as a child. “For me, learning the language of my heroes was paramount,” he says. “So I can shoot the breeze.”

Canavero is now an independent investigator and has advised entrepreneurs who want to create brainless human clones as a source of DNA-matched organs that wouldn’t get rejected by a recipient’s immune system. “I can tell you there are guys from top universities involved,” he says.

Combining the necessary technologies, like reliably precise surgical robots and artificial wombs to grow the clones, is going to be complex and very, very expensive. Canavero lacks the funds to take his plans further, but he believes “the money is out there” for a commercial moonshot project: “What I say to the billionaires is ‘Come together.’ You will all have your own share, plus make yourselves immortal.”

            <h2>Why inventing new emotions feels so good</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/31/1129403/new-emotions-online-life-feelings/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s a “complex and subtle emotion that elicits feelings of comfort, serenity, and a gentle sense of floating.” It’s peaceful, but more ephemeral and intangible than contentment. It might be evoked by the sight of a sunset or a moody, low-key album.

If you haven’t ever felt this sensation—or even heard of it—that’s not surprising. A Reddit user named noahjeadie generated it with ChatGPT, along with advice on how to evoke the feeling. With the right essential oils and soundtrack, apparently, you too can feel like “a soft fuzzy draping ghost floating through a lavender suburb.”

Don’t scoff: Researchers say more and more terms for these “neo-­emotions” are showing up online, describing new dimensions and aspects of feeling. Velvetmist was a key example in a journal article about the phenomenon published in July 2025. But most neo-emotions aren’t the inventions of emo artificial intelligences. Humans come up with them, and they’re part of a big change in the way researchers are thinking about feelings, one that emphasizes how people continuously spin out new ones in response to a changing world.

Velvetmist might’ve been a chatbot one-off, but it’s not unique. The sociologist Marci Cottingham—whose 2024 paper got this vein of neo-emotion research started—cites many more new terms in circulation. There’s “Black joy” (Black people celebrating embodied pleasure as a form of political resistance), “trans euphoria” (the joy of having one’s gender identity affirmed and celebrated), “eco-anxiety” (the hovering fear of climate disaster), “hypernormalization” (the surreal pressure to continue performing mundane life and labor under capitalism during a global pandemic or fascist takeover), and the sense of “doom” found in “doomer” (one who is relentlessly pessimistic) or “doomscrolling” (being glued to an endless feed of bad news in an immobilized state combining apathy and dread).

Of course, emotional vocabulary is always evolving. During the Civil War, doctors used the centuries-old term “nostalgia,” combining the Greek words for “returning home”and “pain,” to describe a sometimes fatal set of symptoms suffered by soldiers—a condition we’d probably describe today as post-traumatic stress disorder. Now nostalgia’s meaning has mellowed and faded to a gentle affection for an old cultural product or vanished way of life. And people constantly import emotion words from other cultures when they’re convenient or evocative—like hygge (the Danish word for friendly coziness) or kvell (a Yiddish term for brimming over with happy pride).

Cottingham believes that neo-­emotions are proliferating as people spend more of their lives online. These coinages help us relate to one another and make sense of our experiences, and they get a lot of engagement on social media. So even when a neo-emotion is just a subtle variation on, or combination of, existing feelings, getting super-specific about those feelings helps us reflect and connect with other people. “These are potentially signals that tell us about our place in the world,” she says.

These neo-emotions are part of a paradigm shift in emotion science. For decades, researchers argued that humans all share a set of a half-dozen or so basic emotions. But over the last decade, Lisa Feldman Barrett, a clinical psychologist at Northeastern University, has become one of the most cited scientists in the world for work demonstrating otherwise. By using tools like advanced brain imaging and studying babies and people from relatively isolated cultures, she has concluded there’s no such thing as a basic emotional palette. The way we experience and talk about our feelings is culturally determined. “How do you know what anger and sadness and fear are? Because somebody taught you,” Barrett says.

If there are no true “basic” biological emotions, this puts more emphasis on social and cultural variations in how we interpret our experiences. And these interpretations can change over time. “As a sociologist, we think of all emotions as created,” Cottingham says. Just like any other tool humans make and use, “emotions are a practical resource people are using as they navigate the world.”

Some neo-emotions, like velvetmist, might be mere novelties. Barrett playfully suggests “chiplessness” to describe the combined hunger, frustration, and relief of getting to the bottom of the bag. But others, like eco-anxiety and Black joy, can take on a life of their own and help galvanize social movements.

Both reading about and crafting your own neo-emotions, with or without chatbot assistance, could be surprisingly helpful. Lots of research supports the benefits of emotional granularity. Basically, the more detailed and specific words you can use to describe your emotions, both positive and negative, the better.

Researchers analogize this “emodiversity” to biodiversity or cultural diversity, arguing that a more diverse world is more enriched. It turns out that people who exhibit higher emotional granularity go to the doctor less frequently, spend fewer days hospitalized for illness, and are less likely to drink when stressed, drive recklessly, or smoke cigarettes. And many studies show emodiversity is a skill that, with training, people can develop at any age. Just imagine cruising into this sweet, comforting future. Is the idea giving you a certain dreamy thrill?

Are you sure you’ve never felt velvetmist?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.

Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot. On a broader scale, researchers are exploring AI’s potential to monitor and collect behavioral and biometric observations using wearables and smart devices, analyze vast volumes of clinical data for new insights, and assist human mental-health professionals to help prevent burnout.

But so far this largely uncontrolled experiment has produced mixed results. Many people have found solace in chatbots based on large language models (LLMs), and some experts see promise in them as therapists, but other users have been sent into delusional spirals by AI’s hallucinatory whims and breathless sycophancy. Most tragically, multiple families have alleged that chatbots contributed to the suicides of their loved ones, sparking lawsuits against companies responsible for these tools. In October, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed in a blog post that 0.15% of ChatGPT users “have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” That’s roughly a million people sharing suicidal ideations with just one of these software systems every week.

The real-world consequences of AI therapy came to a head in unexpected ways in 2025 as we waded through a critical mass of stories about human-chatbot relationships, the flimsiness of guardrails on many LLMs, and the risks of sharing profoundly personal information with products made by corporations that have economic incentives to harvest and monetize such sensitive data.

Several authors anticipated this inflection point. Their timely books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

LLMs have often been described as “black boxes” because nobody knows exactly how they produce their results. The inner workings that guide their outputs are opaque because their algorithms are so complex and their training data is so vast. In mental-health circles, people often describe the human brain as a “black box,” for analogous reasons. Psychology, psychiatry, and related fields must grapple with the impossibility of seeing clearly inside someone else’s head, let alone pinpointing the exact causes of their distress.

These two types of black boxes are now interacting with each other, creating unpredictable feedback loops that may further impede clarity about the origins of people’s mental-­health struggles and the solutions that may be possible. Anxiety about these developments has much to do with the explosive recent advances in AI, but it also revives decades-old warnings from pioneers such as the MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum, who argued against computerized therapy as early as the 1960s.

Charlotte Blease, a philosopher of medicine, makes the optimist’s case in Dr. Bot: Why Doctors Can Fail Us—and How AI Could Save Lives. Her book broadly explores the possible positive impacts of AI in a range of medical fields. While she remains clear-eyed about the risks, warning that readers who are expecting “a gushing love letter to technology” will be disappointed, she suggests that these models can help relieve patient suffering and medical burnout alike.

“Health systems are crumbling under patient pressure,” Blease writes. “Greater burdens on fewer doctors create the perfect petri dish for errors,” and “with palpable shortages of doctors and increasing waiting times for patients, many of us are profoundly frustrated.”

Blease believes that AI can not only ease medical professionals’ massive workloads but also relieve the tensions that have always existed between some patients and their caregivers. For example, people often don’t seek needed care because they are intimidated or fear judgment from medical professionals; this is especially true if they have mental-health challenges. AI could allow more people to share their concerns, she argues.

But she’s aware that these putative upsides need to be weighed against major drawbacks. For instance, AI therapists can provide inconsistent and even dangerous responses to human users, according to a 2025 study, and they also raise privacy concerns, given that AI companies are currently not bound by the same confidentiality and HIPAA standards as licensed therapists.

While Blease is an expert in this field, her motivation for writing the book is also personal: She has two siblings with an incurable form of muscular dystrophy, one of whom waited decades for a diagnosis. During the writing of her book, she also lost her partner to cancer and her father to dementia within a devastating six-month period. “I witnessed first-hand the sheer brilliance of doctors and the kindness of health professionals,” she writes. “But I also observed how things can go wrong with care.”

A similar tension animates Daniel Oberhaus’s engrossing book The Silicon Shrink: How Artificial Intelligence Made the World an Asylum. Oberhaus starts from a point of tragedy: the loss of his younger sister to suicide. As Oberhaus carried out the “distinctly twenty-first-century mourning process” of sifting through her digital remains, he wondered if technology could have eased the burden of the psychiatric problems that had plagued her since childhood.

“It seemed possible that all of this personal data might have held important clues that her mental health providers could have used to provide more effective treatment,” he writes. “What if algorithms running on my sister’s smartphone or laptop had used that data to understand when she was in distress? Could it have led to a timely intervention that saved her life? Would she have wanted that even if it did?”

This concept of digital phenotyping—in which a person’s digital behavior could be mined for clues about distress or illness—seems elegant in theory. But it may also become problematic if integrated into the field of psychiatric artificial intelligence (PAI), which extends well beyond chatbot therapy.

Oberhaus emphasizes that digital clues could actually exacerbate the existing challenges of modern psychiatry, a discipline that remains fundamentally uncertain about the underlying causes of mental illnesses and disorders. The advent of PAI, he says, is “the logical equivalent of grafting physics onto astrology.” In other words, the data generated by digital phenotyping is as precise as physical measurements of planetary positions, but it is then integrated into a broader framework—in this case, psychiatry—that, like astrology, is based on unreliable assumptions.

Oberhaus, who uses the phrase “swipe psychiatry” to describe the outsourcing of clinical decisions based on behavioral data to LLMs, thinks that this approach cannot escape the fundamental issues facing psychiatry. In fact, it could worsen the problem by causing the skills and judgment of human therapists to atrophy as they grow more dependent on AI systems.

He also uses the asylums of the past—in which institutionalized patients lost their right to freedom, privacy, dignity, and agency over their lives—as a touchstone for a more insidious digital captivity that may spring from PAI. LLM users are already sacrificing privacy by telling chatbots sensitive personal information that companies then mine and monetize, contributing to a new surveillance economy. Freedom and dignity are at stake when complex inner lives are transformed into data streams tailored for AI analysis.

AI therapists could flatten humanity into patterns of prediction, and so sacrifice the intimate, individualized care that is expected of traditional human therapists. “The logic of PAI leads to a future where we may all find ourselves patients in an algorithmic asylum administered by digital wardens,” Oberhaus writes. “In the algorithmic asylum there is no need for bars on the window or white padded rooms because there is no possibility of escape. The asylum is already everywhere—in your homes and offices, schools and hospitals, courtrooms and barracks. Wherever there’s an internet connection, the asylum is waiting.”

Eoin Fullam, a researcher who studies the intersection of technology and mental health, echoes some of the same concerns in Chatbot Therapy: A Critical Analysis of AI Mental Health Treatment. A heady academic primer, the book analyzes the assumptions underlying the automated treatments offered by AI chatbots and the way capitalist incentives could corrupt these kinds of tools.

Fullam observes that the capitalist mentality behind new technologies “often leads to questionable, illegitimate, and illegal business practices in which the customers’ interests are secondary to strategies of market dominance.”

That doesn’t mean that therapy-bot makers “will inevitably conduct nefarious activities contrary to the users’ interests in the pursuit of market dominance,” Fullam writes.

But he notes that the success of AI therapy depends on the inseparable impulses to make money and to heal people. In this logic, exploitation and therapy feed each other: Every digital therapy session generates data, and that data fuels the system that profits as unpaid users seek care. The more effective the therapy seems, the more the cycle entrenches itself, making it harder to distinguish between care and commodification. “The more the users benefit from the app in terms of its therapeutic or any other mental health intervention,” he writes, “the more they undergo exploitation.”

This sense of an economic and psychological ouroboros—the snake that eats its own tail—serves as a central metaphor in Sike, the debut novel from Fred Lunzer, an author with a research background in AI.

Described as a “story of boy meets girl meets AI psychotherapist,” Sike follows Adrian, a young Londoner who makes a living ghostwriting rap lyrics, in his romance with Maquie, a business professional with a knack for spotting lucrative technologies in the beta phase.

The title refers to a splashy commercial AI therapist called Sike, uploaded into smart glasses, that Adrian uses to interrogate his myriad anxieties. “When I signed up to Sike, we set up my dashboard, a wide black panel like an airplane’s cockpit that showed my daily ‘vitals,’” Adrian narrates. “Sike can analyze the way you walk, the way you make eye contact, the stuff you talk about, the stuff you wear, how often you piss, shit, laugh, cry, kiss, lie, whine, and cough.”

In other words, Sike is the ultimate digital phenotyper, constantly and exhaustively analyzing everything in a user’s daily experiences. In a twist, Lunzer chooses to make Sike a luxury product, available only to subscribers who can foot the price tag of £2,000 per month.

Flush with cash from his contributions to a hit song, Adrian comes to rely on Sike as a trusted mediator between his inner and outer worlds. The novel explores the impacts of the app on the wellness of the well-off, following rich people who voluntarily commit themselves to a boutique version of the digital asylum described by Oberhaus.

The only real sense of danger in Sike involves a Japanese torture egg (don’t ask). The novel strangely sidesteps the broader dystopian ripples of its subject matter in favor of drunken conversations at fancy restaurants and elite dinner parties.

The sudden ascent of the AI therapist seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes.

Sike’s creator is simply “a great guy” in Adrian’s estimation, despite his techno-messianic vision of training the app to soothe the ills of entire nations. It always seems as if a shoe is meant to drop, but in the end, it never does, leaving the reader with a sense of non-resolution.

While Sike is set in the present day, something about the sudden ascent of the AI therapist—­in real life as well as in fiction—seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes. But this convergence of mental health and artificial intelligence has been in the making for more than half a century. The beloved astronomer Carl Sagan, for example, once imagined a “network of computer psychotherapeutic terminals, something like arrays of large telephone booths” that could address the growing demand for mental-health services.

Oberhaus notes that one of the first incarnations of a trainable neural network, known as the Perceptron, was devised not by a mathematician but by a psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt, at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in 1958. The potential utility of AI in mental health was widely recognized by the 1960s, inspiring early computerized psychotherapists such as the DOCTOR script that ran on the ELIZA chatbot developed by Joseph Weizenbaum, who shows up in all three of the nonfiction books in this article.

Weizenbaum, who died in 2008, was profoundly concerned about the possibility of computerized therapy. “Computers can make psychiatric judgments,” he wrote in his 1976 book Computer Power and Human Reason. “They can flip coins in much more sophisticated ways than can the most patient human being. The point is that they ought not to be given such tasks. They may even be able to arrive at ‘correct’ decisions in some cases—but always and necessarily on bases no human being should be willing to accept.”

It’s a caution worth keeping in mind. As AI therapists arrive at scale, we’re seeing them play out a familiar dynamic: Tools designed with superficially good intentions are enmeshed with systems that can exploit, surveil, and reshape human behavior. In a frenzied attempt to unlock new opportunities for patients in dire need of mental-health support, we may be locking other doors behind them.

            <h2>Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/29/1129308/bangladesh-garment-sustainability-frugal-factories/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals like lead and cadmium—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has quietly become an unlikely leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions. Bangladesh now boasts 268 LEED-certified garment factories—more than any other country. Dye plants are using safer chemicals, tanneries are adopting cleaner tanning methods and treating wastewater, workshops are switching to more efficient LED lighting, and solar panels glint from rooftops. The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads.

In Fakir Eco Knitwears’ LEED Gold–certified factory in Narayanganj, a city near Dhaka, skylights reduce energy consumption from electric lighting by 40%, and AI-driven cutters allow workers to recycle 95% of fabric scraps into new yarns. “We save energy by using daylight, solar power, and rainwater instead of heavy AC and boilers,” says Md. Anisuzzaman, an engineer at the company. “It shows how local resources can make production greener and more sustainable.”

The shift to green factories in Bangladesh is financed through a combination of factory investments, loans from Bangladesh Bank’s Green Transformation Fund, and pressure from international buyers who reward compliance with ongoing orders. One prominent program is the Partnership for Cleaner Textile (PaCT), an initiative run by the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation. Launched in 2013, PaCT has worked with more than 450 factories on cleaner production methods. By its count, the effort now saves 35 billion liters of fresh water annually, enough to meet the needs of 1.9 million people.

It’s a good start, but Bangladesh’s $40 billion garment industry still has a long way to go. The shift to environmentalism at the factory level hasn’t translated to improved outcomes for the sector’s 4.4 million workers.

Wage theft and delayed payments are widespread. The minimum wage, some 12,500 taka per month (about $113), is far below the $200 proposed by unions—which has meant frequent strikes and protests over pay, overtime, and job security. “Since Rana Plaza, building safety and factory conditions have improved, but the mindset remains unchanged,” says A.K.M. Ashraf Uddin, executive director of the Bangladesh Labour Foundation, a nonprofit labor rights group. “Profit still comes first, and workers’ freedom of speech is yet to be realized.”

In the worst case, greener industry practices could actually exacerbate inequality. Smaller factories dominate the sector, and they struggle to afford upgrades. But without those upgrades, businesses could find themselves excluded from certain markets. One of those is the European Union, which plans to require companies to address human rights and environmental problems in supply chains starting in 2027. A cleaner Buriganga River mends just a small corner of a vast tapestry of need.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s been a busy and productive year here at MIT Technology Review. We published magazine issues on power, creativity, innovation, bodies, relationships, and security. We hosted 14 exclusive virtual conversations with our editors and outside experts in our subscriber-only series, Roundtables, and held two events on MIT’s campus. And we published hundreds of articles online, following new developments in computing, climate tech, robotics, and more.

As the year winds down, we wanted to give you a chance to revisit a bit of this work with us. Whether we were covering the red-hot rise of artificial intelligence or the future of biotech, these are some of the stories that resonated the most with our readers.

We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.

Understanding AI’s energy use was a huge global conversation in 2025 as hundreds of millions of people began using generative AI tools on a regular basis. Senior reporters James O’Donnell and Casey Crownhart dug into the numbers and published an unprecedented look at AI’s resource demand, down to the level of a single query, to help us know how much energy and water AI may require moving forward.

We’re learning more about what vitamin D does to our bodies

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, particularly in the winter when there’s less sunlight to drive its production in our bodies. The “sunshine vitamin” is important for bone health, but as senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou reported, recent research is also uncovering surprising new insights into other ways it might influence our bodies, including our immune systems and heart health.

Senior editor Will Douglas Heaven’s expansive look at how to define AI was published in 2024, but it still managed to connect with many readers this year. He lays out why no one can agree on what AI is—and explains why that ambiguity matters, and how it can inform our own critical thinking about this technology.

Ethically sourced “spare” human bodies could revolutionize medicine

In this thought-provoking op-ed, a team of experts at Stanford University argue that creating living human bodies that can’t think, don’t have any awareness, and can’t feel pain could shake up medical research and drug development by providing essential biological materials for testing and transplantation. Recent advances in biotechnology now provide a potential pathway to such “bodyoids,” though plenty of technical challenges and ethical hurdles remain.

It’s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot

Chatbots were everywhere this year, and reporter Rhiannon Williams chronicled how quickly people can develop bonds with one. That’s all right for some people, she notes, but dangerous for others. Some folks even describe unintentionally forming romantic relationships with chatbots. This is a trend we’ll definitely be keeping an eye on in 2026.

The electric grid is bracing for disruption from more frequent storms and fires, as well as an uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. And in many ways, the publicly owned utility company Lincoln Electric in Nebraska is an ideal lens through which to examine this shift as it works through the challenges of delivering service that’s reliable, affordable, and sustainable.

Exclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that’s over 30 years old

This year saw the birth of the world’s “oldest baby”: Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived on July 26. The embryo he developed from was created in 1994 during the early days of IVF and had been frozen and sitting in storage ever since. The new baby’s parents were toddlers at the time, and the embryo was donated to them decades later via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

How these two brothers became go-to experts on America’s “mystery drone” invasion

Twin brothers John and Gerald Tedesco teamed up to investigate a concerning new threat—unidentified drones. In 2024 alone, some 350 drones entered airspace over a hundred different US military installations, and many cases went unsolved, according to a top military official. This story takes readers inside the equipment-filled RV the Tedescos created to study mysterious aerial phenomena, and how they made a name for themselves among government officials.

Our newsroom has published this annual look at advances that will matter in the long run for over 20 years. This year’s list featured generative AI search, cleaner jet fuel, long-acting HIV prevention meds, and other emerging technologies that our journalists think are worth watching. We’ll publish the 2026 edition of the list on January 12, so stay tuned. (In the meantime, here’s what didn’t make the cut.)

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Unveiled by the buzzy startup Deep, Vanguard will let teams of scientists live and work on the seabed for a week at a time.

We’ll keep following these developments, but this just wasn’t their year. Here’s why.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <h2>Engineering’s AI reality check</h2>

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
