            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/original-nintendo-switch-passes-the-ds-to-become-nintendos-bestselling-console/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Although it was finally replaced last year by the new Switch 2, the orginal switch isn’t done just yet. Many recent Switch games (and a handful of major updates, like the one for Animal Crossing) have been released in both Switch and Switch 2 editions, and Nintendo continues to sell all editions of the original console as entry-level systems for those who can’t pay $450 for a Switch 2.

The 9-year-old Switch’s continued availability has helped it clear a milestone, according to the company’s third-quarter financial results (PDF). As of December 31, 2025, Nintendo says the Switch “has reached the highest sales volume of any Nintendo hardware” with a total of 155.37 million units sold, surpassing the original DS’s lifetime total of 154.02 million units. The console has sold 3.25 million units in Nintendo’s fiscal 2026 so far, including 1.36 million units over the holidays. Those consoles have sold despite price hikes that Nintendo introduced in August of 2025, citing “market conditions.”

That makes the Switch the second-bestselling game console of all time, just three years after it became the third-bestselling game console of all time. The only frontier left for the Switch to conquer is Sony’s PlayStation 2, which Sony says sold “over 160 million units” over its long life. At its current sales rate (Nintendo predicts it will sell roughly 750,000 Switches in the next quarter), it would take the Switch another couple of years to cross that line, but those numbers are likely to taper off as we get deeper into the Switch 2 era.

As for the Switch 2, it’s off to a strong start. It had sold 15 million units by the end of December, making it the “fastest-selling dedicated video game platform released by Nintendo to date,” and it had sold a total of 17.37 million units by the end of the quarter. That’s impressive for a console that hasn’t even been out for a year yet, and it already puts the Switch 2 ahead of the Wii U’s lifetime sales (13.56 million) and not far off from the GameCube’s (21.74 million units).

The huge Switch install base means that the older console is still driving most of Nintendo’s software sales. Nintendo says it sold 47.37 million Switch games in the third quarter of its fiscal 2026, compared to 17.31 million Switch 2 games. Nintendo’s bestselling game for the year so far is Mario Kart World with 14.03 million units—doubtlessly helped along by its status as a pack-in game for many Switch 2 consoles—but Pokémon Legends Z-A (12.3 million units across Switch and Switch 2 editions) and Donkey Kong Bananza (4.25 million units) also got shoutouts.

Nintendo also recorded 129 million “annual playing users” across its consoles for 2025, a number that has been essentially flat for the last three years (Nintendo recorded 128 million active users in 2023 and 130 million in 2024).</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Chromebooks debuted 16 years ago with the limited release of Google’s Cr-48, an unassuming compact laptop that was provided free to select users. From there, Chromebooks became one of the most popular budget computing options and a common fixture in schools and businesses. According to some newly uncovered court documents, Google’s shift to Android PCs means Chromebooks have an expiration date in 2034.

The documents were filed as part of Google’s long-running search antitrust case, which began in 2020 and reached a verdict in 2024. While Google is still seeking to have the guilty verdict overturned, it has escaped most of the remedies that government prosecutors requested. According to The Verge, the company’s plans for Chromebooks and the upcoming Android-based Aluminium came up in filings from the remedy phase of the trial.

As Google moves toward releasing Aluminium, it sought to keep the upcoming machines above the fray and retain the Chrome browser (which it did). In Judge Amit Mehta’s final order, devices running ChromeOS or a ChromeOS successor are excluded. To get there, Google had to provide a little more detail on its plans.

Google’s Android chief, Sameer Samat, previously testified that Google was aiming to launch its first Aluminium machines in 2026. However, the new filings expand on that, saying that Google hopes to get Aluminium in the hands of trusted testers by late 2026. A full retail release may not happen until 2028. Google expects Aluminium to supplant ChromeOS in enterprise and education, which puts Chromebooks on the chopping block. Outside of a pandemic-era bump as workers sought cheap at-home machines, Chromebooks have never expanded much beyond those markets.

The documents suggest that Google will wash its hands of ChromeOS once the current support window closes. Google promises 10 years of Chromebook support, but that’s not counted from the date of purchase—Chromebooks are based on a handful of hardware platforms dictated by Google, with the most recent launching in 2023. That means Google has to support the newest devices through 2033. The “timeline to phase out ChromeOS is 2034,” says the filing.

From the start, the ChromeOS experience was focused on the web. Google initially didn’t even support running local apps, but little by little, its aspirations grew. Over the years, it has added Linux apps and Android apps. And it even tried to get Steam games running on Chromebooks—it gave up on that last one just recently. It also tried to shoehorn AI features into ChromeOS with the Chromebook Plus platform, to little effect.

Android was barely getting off the ground when ChromeOS began its journey, but as we approach the 2030s, Google clearly wants a more powerful desktop platform. Android has struggled on larger screens, but Aluminium is a long-running project to fix that. Whatever we see in 2028 may not even look like the Android we know from phones. It will have many of the same components under the hood, though.

Google could get everything it wants with the upcoming Aluminium release. When running on powerful laptop hardware, Android’s performance and capabilities should far outstrip ChromeOS. Aluminium is also expected to run Google apps like Chrome and the Play Store with special system privileges, leaving third-party apps with fewer features. That gives Google more latitude in how it manages the platform and retains users, all without running afoul of recent antitrust rulings.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2026/02/xcode-26-3-adds-support-for-claude-codex-and-other-agentic-tools-via-mcp/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple has announced a new version of Xcode, the latest version of its integrated development environment (IDE) for building software for its own platforms, like the iPhone and Mac. The key feature of 26.3 is support for full-fledged agentic coding tools, like OpenAI’s Codex or Claude Agent, with a side panel interface for assigning tasks to agents with prompts and tracking their progress and changes.

This is achieved via Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol that lets AI agents work with external tools and structured resources. Xcode acts as an MCP endpoint that exposes a bunch of machine-invocable interfaces and gives AI tools like Codex or Claude Agent access to a wide range of IDE primitives like file graph, docs search, project settings, and so on. While AI chat and workflows were supported in Xcode before, this release gives them much deeper access to the features and capabilities of Xcode.

This approach is notable because it means that even though OpenAI and Anthropic’s model integrations are privileged with a dedicated spot in Xcode’s settings, it’s possible to connect other tooling that supports MCP, which also allows doing some of this with models running locally.

Apple began its big AI features push with the release of Xcode 26, expanding on code completion using a local model trained by Apple that was introduced in the previous major release, and fully supporting a chat interface for talking with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. Users who wanted more agent-like behavior and capabilities had to use third-party tools, which sometimes had limitations due to a lack of deep IDE access.

Xcode 26.3’s release candidate (the final beta, essentially) rolls out imminently, with the final release coming a little further down the line.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s Christmas of 1994, and I am 16 years old. Sitting on the table in our family room next to a pile of cow-spotted boxes is the most incredible thing in the world: a brand-new Gateway 66MHz Pentium tower, with a 540MB hard disk drive, 8MB of RAM, and, most importantly, a CD-ROM drive. I am agog, practically trembling with barely suppressed joy, my bored Gen-X teenager mask threatening to slip and let actual feelings out. My life was about to change—at least where games were concerned.

I’d been working for several months at Babbage’s store No. 9, near Baybrook Mall in southeast suburban Houston. Although the Gateway PC’s arrival on Christmas morning was utterly unexpected, the choice of what game to buy required no planning at all. I’d already decided a few weeks earlier, when Chris Roberts’ latest opus had been drop-shipped to our shelves, just in time for the holiday season. The choice made itself, really.

The moment Babbage’s opened its doors on December 26—a day I had off, fortunately—I was there, checkbook in hand. One entire paycheck’s worth of capitalism later, I was sprinting out to my creaky 280-Z, sweatily clutching two boxes—one an impulse buy, The Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive Technical Manual, and the other a game I felt sure would be the best thing I’d ever played or ever would play: Origin’s Wing Commander III: The Heart of the Tiger. On the backs of Wing Commander I and Wing Commander II, how could it not be?!

It’s easy to pooh-pooh full-motion video games here in 2026; from our vantage point, we know the much-anticipated “Siliwood” revolution that was supposed to transform entertainment and usher interactivity into all media by the end of the millennium utterly failed to materialize, leaving in its wake a series of often spectacularly expensive titles filled with grainy interlaced video and ersatz gameplay. Even the standout titles—smash hits like Roberta Williams’ Phantasmagoria or Cyan’s Riven—were, on the whole, kinda mediocre.

But we hadn’t learned any of those lessons yet in 1994, and Wing Commander III went hard. The game’s production was absurdly expensive, with a budget that eventually reached an unheard-of $4 million. The shooting script runs to 324 printed pages (a typical feature film script is less than half that long—Coppola’s working script for The Godfather was 136 pages). Even the game itself was enormous—in an era where a single CD-ROM was already considered ludicrously large, WC3 sprawled ostentatiously across four of the 600MB-or-so discs.

Why so big? Because this was the future, and the future—or so we thought at the time—belonged to full-motion video.

That’s Wing Commander III’s epic opening cinematic, upscaled for YouTube. Even without the upscaling and watching it on a 15-inch CRT, I was entranced. I was blown away. Before the credits were done rolling, I was already on the phone with my buddies Steve and Matt, telling them to stop what they were doing and get over here immediately to see this thing—it’s like a whole movie! A movie, on the computer! Surely only Chris Roberts could conceive and execute such audacity!

And what a movie it was, with an actual-for-real Hollywood cast. Malcolm McDowell! John Rhys-Davies! Jason Bernard! Tom Wilson! Ginger Lynn Allen, whom 16-year-old me definitely did not want his parents to know that I recognized! And, of course, the biggest face on the box: Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill, representing you. You, the decorated hero of the Vega campaign, the formerly disgraced “Coward of K’Tithrak Mang,” the recently redeemed savior of humanity, now sporting an actual name: Colonel Christopher Blair. (“Blair” is an evolution of the internal codename used by Origin to refer to the main character in the previous two Wing Commander titles—”Bluehair.”)

Once the jaw-dropping intro finishes, the player finds Colonel Blair as the newly invested squadron commander aboard the aging carrier TCS Victory, wandering the corridors and having FMV conversations with a few other members of the carrier’s crew. From there, it’s a short hop to the first mission—because beneath all the FMV glitz, Origin still had to provide an actual, you know, game for folks to play.

The game itself is…fine. It’s fine. The polygonal graphics are a welcome step up from the previous two Wing Commander titles’ bitmapped sprites, and the missions themselves manage to avoid many of the “space is gigantic and things take forever to happen” design missteps that plagued LucasArts’ X-Wing (but not, fortunately, TIE Fighter). You fly from point to point and shoot bad guys until they’re dead. Sometimes there are escort missions, sometimes you’re hitting capital ships, and there’s even a (very clunky) planetary bombing mission at the very end that feels like it directly apes the Death Star trench run while doing everything it can to shout “NO THIS IS NOT STAR WARS THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT!”

The space combat is serviceable, but the game also very clearly knows why we’re here: to watch a dead-eyed Mark Hamill with five days of beard stubble fulfill our “I am flying a spaceship” hero fantasies while trading banter with Tom Wilson’s Maniac (“How many people here know about the Maniac? …what, nobody?!”) and receiving fatherly advice from Jason Bernard’s Captain Eisen. And maybe, just maybe, we’d also save the universe and get the girl—either Ginger Lynn’s chief technician Rachel Coriolis or fellow pilot “Flint” Peters, played by Jennifer MacDonald.

(Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the primary purchasing demographic, players tended to overwhelmingly choose Rachel—though this might also have something to do with the fact that if you don’t choose Rachel, you can’t customize your missile loadout for some important missions near the end of the game).

I will let others more qualified than me opine on whether or not Wing Commander III succeeded at the game-y things it set out to do—folks looking to read an educated opinion should consult Jimmy Maher’s thoughts on the matter over at his site, The Digital Antiquarian.

But regardless of whether or not it was a good game in its time, and regardless of whether or not it’s an effective space combat sim, it is absolutely undeniable that it’s a fascinating historical curiosity—one well worth dropping three bucks on at the GOG store (it’s on sale!).

There are cheats built into the game to help you skip past the actual space missions, which range in difficulty from “cream puff” to “obviously untested and totally broken” because just like in 1994, what we’re really here for is the beautiful failed experiment in interactive entertainment that is the movie portion of the game, especially when Malcolm McDowell shows up as Admiral Tolwyn and, in typical Malcom McDowell fashion, totally commits to the role far beyond what would have been required to pull it off and turns in his scenery-chewing best.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amid the Trump administration’s attack on universities, Harvard has emerged as a particular target. Early on, the administration put $2.2 billion in research money on hold and shortly thereafter blocked all future funding while demanding intrusive control over Harvard’s hiring and admissions. Unlike many of its peer institutions, Harvard fought back, filing and ultimately winning a lawsuit that restored the cut funds.

Despite Harvard’s victory, the Trump administration continued to push for some sort of formal agreement that would settle the administration’s accusations that Harvard created an environment that allowed antisemitism to flourish. In fact, it had become a running joke among some journalists that The New York Times had devoted a monthly column to reporting that a settlement between the two parties was near.

Given the government’s loss of leverage, it was no surprise that the latest installment of said column included the detail that the latest negotiations had dropped demands that Harvard pay any money as part of a final agreement. The Trump administration had extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from some other universities and had demanded over a billion dollars from UCLA, so this appeared to be a major concession to Harvard.

Given Trump’s tendency to avoid any appearance of concession, his hostile response to the reports was unsurprising. Several hours after the Times published its article, he took to Truth Social to say the government would now seek $1 billion from Harvard. While he separately called the Times’ coverage “completely wrong” and demanded a correction, Trump also favorably quoted the part of the Times article that noted the government had continued to threaten Harvard’s funding despite having lost in court.

All this will likely give Harvard even more ground to argue that the government is being arbitrary and capricious, should the saga ever end up back in court.</div>

            <h2>China bans all retractable car door handles, starting next year</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/02/china-bans-all-retractable-car-door-handles-starting-next-year/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Flush door handles have been quite the automotive design trend of late. Stylists like them because they don’t add visual noise to the side of a car. And aerodynamicists like them because they make a vehicle more slippery through the air. When Tesla designed its Model S, it needed a car that was both desirable and as efficient as possible, so flush door handles were a no-brainer. Since then, as electric vehicles have proliferated, so too have flush door handles. But as of next year, China says no.

Just like pop-up headlights, despite the aesthetic and aerodynamic advantages, there are safety downsides. Tesla’s handles are an extreme example: In the event of a crash and a loss of 12 V power, there is no way for first responders to open the door from the outside, which has resulted in at least 15 deaths.

Those deaths prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to open an investigation last year, but China is being a little more proactive. It has been looking at whether retractable car door handles are safe since mid-2024, according to Bloomberg, and has concluded that no, they are not.

The new Chinese regulations are incredibly specific. For all new models introduced after January 1, 2027, there must be a recessed space that’s at least 2.4 inches (6 cm) wide, 0.8 inches (2 cm) tall, and 1 inch (25 mm) deep for a hand to operate the handle, which can be semi-flush or simply a traditional door handle that we all know how to use.

The locking mechanism must be designed so that, in a crash that results in airbags deploying or a battery fire, doors on the non-impact side can be opened without tools. Chinese regulators are just as concerned that a vehicle’s occupants don’t get confused about how to open a door from the inside in an emergency. So each door must have mechanical releases where an occupant would expect to find them.

Again, Tesla is probably the worst offender—its front doors have always had mechanical handles, but for some model years, the rears could not be opened without tools.

For cars already approved by the Chinese government (which includes everything currently on sale), there’s a grace period. For existing designs, automakers have until January 1, 2029, to redesign their doors, and due to the specificity of the rules, that group of automakers is much larger than just Tesla. Xiaomi, which seems to be China’s most-hyped EV brand, will have to redesign some models, but BMW will, too—the rather good iX3 that will go on sale there soon will also need a redesign. The same goes for cars from Nio, Li Auto, and Xpeng.

And unless there are exemptions for low volume, I would imagine that most supercars from OEMs like Ferrari and McLaren will need new doors for the all-important Chinese market. Indeed, given China’s importance to the car industry, we should expect this ban’s impact to be widely felt on any model sold globally. The benefit should be clear: fewer car occupants dying after being trapped in their cars.</div>

            <h2>Crypto Bros Nauseated After Realizing Bitcoin Itself Was Funded by Jeffrey Epstein</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Like a hurricane that tears down even the sturdiest storm shelters, the Epstein files have cut a path through a vast swath of America’s intellectual, political, and financial elite.

The latest tranche of emails related to the notorious sex predator have been particularly devastating. Fans of the left-libertarian academic Noam Chomsky are in shambles after learning the two were in close contact until around 2017, while tech luminaries from Bill Gates to the Google cofounders were similarly caught schmoozing with the disgraced financier.

Cypto bros are no exception. After the Department of Justice released three million files over the weekend, blockchain enthusiasts were quick to discover a certain Jeffery Epstein was an active and prominent figure in crypto during its formative years.

One file highlighted by crypto investor Patrick Riley shows an email chain between Epstein and Joichi Ito, the former head of MIT’s Media Lab whose Digital Currency Initiative played an integral role in helping crypto grow into the giant it is today. As the email exchange makes clear, Epstein’s backing was a key pillar in establishing the DGI.

“FYI,” Ito told Epstein, “used gift funds to underwrite this which allowed us to move quickly and win this round. Thanks.”

“At the time this letter was written, there were around 12,000 commits to Bitcoin’s code,” Riley remarked in a post on social media. “Today there are 47,583 commits to Bitcoin’s code. That means that 74.79 percent of the Bitcoin core development and code was committed after Jeffery Epstein took over the defacto senior management role as benefactor.”

That news didn’t go over well with crypto enthusiasts, to put it lightly.

“75 percent of bitcoins code comes directly from [Epstein’s] investments,” a crypto account called Crypto Bitlord agonized in response. “We’ve basically funded an elite global pedophile ring since 2015. I feel sick.”

Another crypto account lamented that “BTC has been funding a global elite pedo group since 2015… great.”

The email chain from Ito also suggests that Bitcoin’s mysterious developer — the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto — may have in fact been five “core developers,” each of whom was in talks with Epstein.

One of those core devs may have been early Bitcoin contributor Adam Back, who invented the proof-of-work algorithm cited by “Nakamoto’s” original whitepaper on crypto. A separate email chain shows Ito suggesting the convicted sex criminal meet with Back and other tech luminaires to discuss this revolutionary new currency.

“I think we should have a meeting with Jeremy Rubin, Adam Back (or other core developer of bitcoin), Seth [Lloyd], Martin Nowak, you and a few others soon about money and the future of finance,” a 2015 email from Ito reads.

As these files seem to suggest, Back had sought a meeting with Epstein to secure funding for his crypto company, Blockstream. Unsealed records show Back along with Blockstream CEO Austin Hill trying to schedule a trip to meet Epstein in St. Thomas — one of the main US Virgin Islands located a little over six miles away from the infamous islet, Little Saint James.

“Sunday in NY I think is a no-go because of our commitments on the west coast, but Fri/Saturday on the Island are still possible,” Hill told Epstein.

“great. ,” the financier replied in typo-filled prose, “you will need to fly to st thomas. just let me know times. looking foward to it.”

            <h2>Police Raid SpaceX’s Brand New Offices</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was only yesterday that Elon Musk announced that SpaceX had acquired his AI company xAI, a merger that catapulted the rocket maker into being the most valuable private company in the world, but raised significant questions about bringing two firms with vastly different missions under the same wing.

Now, the freshly-joined entity is facing one of its first major tests. On Tuesday, French authorities raided the offices of X, Elon Musk’s social media site owned by xAI, as part of its ongoing criminal investigation into the sexual deepfakes generated by its AI chatbot Grok. Following the acquisition, of course, those X offices are now SpaceX offices.

The raid was carried out by the Paris Public Prosecutor Office’s cybercrime unit, in collaboration with French police and Europol. And it’s perhaps an early warning sign of how all the baggage that SpaceX is inheriting by bringing Musk’s controversial AI efforts into the fold may haunt the company going forward.

In an announcement, the Paris prosecutors said it was investigating criminal offenses related to the distribution of “child pornography images,” the infringement of personal rights through the generation of “sexual deepfakes,” and the denial of “crimes against humanity,” per NBC News.

In addition to searching X’s offices, Musk and X’s former CEO Linda Yaccarino were issued a voluntary summons to appear and answer questions the week of April 20.

SpaceX is not without controversy: its Starship rocket has generated plenty of scrutiny and public backlash from its frequent explosions, which critics argue threaten public safety and flout environmental laws. But by and large, it’s the most beloved Musk venture, as space exploration is something that earns a lot of public goodwill, serving some greater mission for all of humankind. Now, its image is undoubtedly being tainted by its association with xAI and Grok.

Grok in particular is no stranger to making the wrong kinds of headlines. Last month, French prosecutors opened an investigation into Musk’s platform after the AI chatbot was used to generate nonconsensual sexualized images of real people, many of them appearing to be minors, in a weeks-long spree that started at the end of December and stretched into January.

The digital “undressing” trend was so out of control that the AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated Grok was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute. In all, the Center for Countering Digital Hate estimated that as many as 3,000,000 of these sexualized images were produced, including more than 23,000 images of children.

The prosecutor office also said it was investigating the distribution of Holocaust denial content on the platform. Far-right accounts have flourished under Musk’s ownership of X, formerly Twitter, with Musk often resharing racist conspiracy theories and antisemitic rhetoric — a habit mirrored by Grok, which gained notoriety for calling itself “MechaHitler” during a particularly racist posting spree last summer.

Governments abroad have seemed to take Grok’s AI nudes of women and children more seriously. Indonesia and Malaysia banned access to Grok, though the former has just lifted its ban “conditionally.” UK prime minister Keir Starmer vowed to crackdown on the chatbot and showed support for the nation’s communications regulator Ofcom, after it announced its own investigation into Grok.

Mirroring developments across the channel, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office announced its own probe into Grok on Tuesday, over its “potential to produce harmful sexualized image and video content,” per the BBC. “The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people’s personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,” William Malcolm, the ICO’s executive director for regulatory risk and innovation, said in a statement.

The renewed regulatory pressure abroad comes after fresh reporting from the Washington Post detailed how some xAI employees were appalled by the startup’s abrupt pivot into embracing heavily sexualized content, as Musk pushed to make Grok as engaging as possible. Employees said that the company rolled back guardrails on sexual material and ignored repeated warnings that Grok could allow users to churn out sexualized images of children and celebrities that could be illegal. xAI’s safety team reportedly consisted of just two or three people for most of 2025.

Though Starship and a revenge-porn generating Grok would seemingly have little in common, Musk explained in an announcement about the acquisition that space-based AI was the “only way to scale” the technology in the long-term because of the vast amounts of solar energy that could be harvested and all the untapped real-estate that putting data centers in orbit opens up. He also stated that he wants to populate the Earth’s orbit with AI satellites to build what he likened to a “sentient sun.” These are ambitions that will be years in the making — but in the meantime, SpaceX will have to survive its now close association with CSAM-generating AI.

            <div id="article-text">Along with being used to generate nonconsensual sexual images of women and girls, spread racist rhetoric, and doxx the home addresses of both celebrities and non-public figures, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok is struggling to get a grip on reality.

The mercurial billionaire’s social media platform X, which was folded into his AI startup xAI last year — and subsequently acquired by SpaceX this week — has once again been thrust into the center of the ongoing scandal surrounding the Justice Department’s release of millions of files pertaining to its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Musk has been in full damage control mode, struggling to reconcile his attempts to downplay his personal relationship with the notorious predator with some damning emails that suggest he was actively trying to invite himself to Epstein’s island in the Caribbean.

Adding to the chaos is Musk’s xAI chatbot Grok, which he’s advertised as “maximally truth-seeking” — but which is instead sowing chaos into the explosive revelations about Epstein.

The result may be one of the most amazing AI responses we’ve ever seen. No, seriously: when a X account asked Grok to calculate the “probability” that New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani is somehow related to Epstein, based on perceived similarities in the shapes of their eyebrows and mouths, the AI chatbot had a downright baffling answer.

The account showed Grok two headshots of the two men side by side, with two arrows pointing to their eyebrows and circles around their respective mouths, as if to suggest they were genetically related. The odd request may have been related to recently released documents implicating Mamdani’s mother, Mira Nair, who attended a 2009 afterparty at the house of convicted sex trafficker and Epstein’s close collaborator Ghislaine Maxwell. However, there’s currently no evidence to suggest that Nair knew about or was involved in any criminal activity.

All that flew far above the AI chatbot’s head, though, as it failed to even accurately identify Mamdani.

“Based on the image, these seem to be [late-night TV host] Jimmy Kimmel (left) and Jeffrey Epstein (right),” the chatbot responded. “They share minor similarities in eyebrow arch and mouth shape, but differences in age, hair, and features are clear.”

Yes, that’s right: the chatbot that Musk has deployed to untold millions of users on X, which now operates as a de facto fact-checking machine used to settle arguments on the chaotic site, can’t even tell the difference between Zohran Mamdani and Jimmy Kimmel, who look nothing alike.

At least it admitted its error — though only after prodding.

“Correction: That’s actually Zohran Mamdani on the left, not Jimmy Kimmel — my bad on the initial ID,” the chatbot conceded. “Similarities in eyebrows and smiles are there, but no known family ties to Epstein. Probability of relation: under one percent based on public info.”

The chatbot’s gaffe shows yet again how even a seemingly straightforward task like identifying a well-known figure, who has been photographed many thousands of times, from a well-lit headshot appears to be beyond the tech’s capabilities — despite xAI pouring billions of dollars into its development.

Coincidentally, Mamdani used his powers as New York City’s mayor to shut down a “functionally unusable” AI chatbot just last week. The chatbot was set up by disgraced former mayor Eric Adams to help small business owners navigate local regulations, costing the administration “around half a million dollars,” per Mamdani. Not unlike Grok, Adams’ chatbot was shown to be incredibly unreliable, often contradicting actual labor law.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last month, the four daring NASA astronauts who are scheduled to venture around the Moon and back as part of the agency’s historic Artemis 2 mission entered quarantine.

Their ride, a small Orion capsule mounted atop the agency’s enormous Space Launch System rocket, has already been rolled onto Launch Pad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

But the agency’s remaining checks ahead of the launch — a gauntlet of tests called the “wet dress rehearsal” that involves running through the full launch sequence without a crew on board — didn’t quite go as planned, forcing the agency to officially push back the launch date from its already ambitious early February timeline.

In an official statement this morning, NASA revealed that we may have to wait another four weeks for humanity’s return to the Moon, with the agency now eyeing a second wet dress rehearsal for “March as the earliest possible launch opportunity.”

The crew is officially released from quarantine, the agency said, as it awaits the next launch window.

It may not be the news we wanted to hear — but at least now, NASA’s Artemis 2 mission won’t have to compete with the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics for media attention.

According to a February 2 statement, NASA found that the rocket’s core stage had sprung a leak and that efforts to correct it “proved unsuccessful.”

“The leak rate at the interface of the tail service mast umbilical continued to exceed the allowable limits,” the update reads. “Liquid hydrogen filling operations on both the core stage and upper stage are paused as the team meets to determines next steps.”

As a result, the tentative February 8 launch date is no longer on the table.

Fortunately, the leak appeared to be the only major hiccup during this week’s test. NASA engineers “pushed through several challenges during the two-day test and met many of the planned objectives,” according to the agency.

However, teams had to battle the elements, as cold winter temperatures “caused a late start to tanking operations.”

Engineers got to roughly five minutes left in the countdown when the ground launch sequencer noticed a “spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate,” automatically stopping the countdown as a result.

Besides the hydrogen leak, teams also had to troubleshoot “dropouts of audio communication channels across ground teams in the past few weeks leading up to the test.”

The agency will be holding a press release later today to address the latest developments.

It’s an unfortunate development, forcing us to once again be patient to see humanity’s historic return to the Moon. The next launch dates fall in early March. If NASA misses those dates, it could be pushed back to early or late April, according to Space.com — the month NASA was originally targeting before September 2025, when the launch date was pushed up to February.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the wake of ruthless arrests of journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort in Minneapolis, one Harvard political scientist is arguing something many of us have suspected for a long time: the US is moving away from its traditional democratic framework toward a fundamentally different system of governance.

In an interview with the media industry publication Status, Harvard political scientist Steven Levitsky made the case that the Trump administration’s assault on democratic norms has now become extreme, even by the standards of right-wing dictators.

“This is a new dimension,” Levitsky told Status. “In democracies, journalists don’t get arrested. In authoritarian regimes, journalists get arrested.”

Levitsky went so far as to contrast Trump with notorious conservative nationalist Viktor Orbán, the prime minister of Hungary since 2010. Since coming to power, the Hungarian strongman has systematically dismantled the country’s judiciary, as well as its election system by rewriting the constitution. Yet as Levitsky notes, even Orbán has stopped short of the kind of paramilitary street enforcement emerging in the US.

“Orbán doesn’t arrest journalists,” the Harvard academic claimed. “In Hungary if you walk the streets of Budapest or other Hungarian cities, you will not find heavily armed masked men abducting people. That doesn’t happen in Hungary.”

Notwithstanding that Orbán has been criticized for arresting journalists, it’s true that Trump’s attempts to silence the press and embolden armed federal agents speak to an alarming escalation of reactionary policies — especially in a country that fashions itself a global beacon of democracy and freedom.

Still, this moment in US politics doesn’t begin or end with Trump. As University of Tulsa economic historian Clara Mattei has argued, the groundwork for democratic erosion was laid decades ago through neoliberal austerity policies that hollowed out the economic foundations of American democracy.

In Mattei’s analysis, austerity functions as a tool to disempower people, worsening conditions for the majority “to help prevent political action against the system as a whole.” The dictatorial turn we’re seeing today — manifested in the suppression of free speech and rising police state — is the result of decades of policies that already reconfigured who holds power in American society.

“I see austerity fundamentally as one-sided class warfare, led by the state and its economic experts and aimed at refurbishing the capital order in moments when it is crumbling,” Mattei said in a 2023 interview about her book, “The Capital Order.” “As a political project, austerity is in fact the most rational way to safeguard capitalism: it structurally disempowers workers by increasing precariousness and market dependence.”

Indeed, as Levitsky observes, the damage this has done to American democracy may be irreversible.

“Even in the best case, we throw these guys out electorally, I don’t think we’re going to go back,” he told Status. “We’re not going to step back to a democracy with strong constitutional guardrails. The democratic norms have, at this point, been shattered and on the floor, and rules have been violated, twisted, manipulated.”

Last week, whispers of impending crypto regulation sent Bitcoin prices into a nosedive. The preeminent blockchain asset dipped just below $75,000 over the weekend, sending crypto bros into a frenzy. And now, the true believers are now whispering even darker prophecies: the real crash hasn’t even started.

That cynical take was echoed by Benjamin Cowen, founder of crypto analytics platform Into The Cryptoverse. “I do think Bitcoin is in fact in a bear market,” Cowen said in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel.

“In terms of cycle length, the length of this cycle was literally the same length as the past two cycles,” he cautioned. “It’s because, simply, the cycle is over, and instead of being in a bull market, we’ve transitioned into a bear market after the cycle has topped.”

This pattern, Cowen notes, pretty faithfully follows the four-year election cycle in the US. In the fourth quarter of 2013, 2017, 2021, and possibly in 2025 — all one year after a presidential election — Bitcoin has consistently peaked before entering a prolonged downturn.

“This is when it always drops,” Cowen said. “It always tops out in the fourth quarter of the post-election year, and why should this time be any different?”

Indeed, for all the rhetoric about decentralized finance and breaking free from traditional markets, it seems Bitcoin keeps dancing to the same tired rhythm. The only question now is how far it’ll fall before the next stream of euphoria hits.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/homeland-security-is-trying-to-force-tech-companies-to-hand-over-data-about-trump-critics/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Homeland Security has been quietly demanding tech companies turn over user information about critics of the Trump administration, according to reports.

In several cases over recent months, Homeland Security has relied on the use of administrative subpoenas to seek identifiable information about individuals who run anonymous Instagram accounts, which share posts about ICE immigration raids in their local neighborhoods. These subpoenas have also been used to demand information about people who have criticized Trump officials or protested government policies.

Unlike judicial subpoenas, which are authorized by a judge after seeing enough evidence of a crime to authorize a search or seizure of someone’s things, administrative subpoenas are issued by federal agencies, allowing investigators to seek a wealth of information about individuals from tech and phone companies without a judge’s oversight.

While administrative subpoenas cannot be used to obtain the contents of a person’s emails, online searches, or location data, they can demand information specifically about the user, such as what time a user logs in, from where, using which devices, and revealing the email addresses and other identifiable information about who opened an online account. But because administrative subpoenas are not backed by a judge’s authority or a court’s order, it’s largely up to a company whether to give over any data to the requesting government agency.

Administrative subpoenas are not new; the use of these self-signed demands by Trump officials to seek identifiable information about people who are critical of the president’s policies has raised alarm.

Bloomberg reported last week that Homeland Security sought the identity of an anonymous Instagram account called @montocowatch, which says its goal is to share resources to help protect immigrant rights and due process across Montgomery County in Pennsylvania. This comes amid an ongoing federal immigration crackdown across the United States, which has drawn widespread protests and condemnation. Homeland Security lawyers sent an administrative subpoena to Meta demanding it turn over personal information of the person who runs the account, citing a non-Homeland Security employee who claimed to receive a tip that ICE agents were being stalked.

The American Civil Liberties Union, representing the account owner, said there was no evidence of wrongdoing and that recording police, sharing that recording, and doing so anonymously is legal and protected under the First Amendment. Homeland Security withdrew its subpoena without providing an explanation.

The ACLU called the subpoena “part of a broader strategy to intimidate people who document immigration activity or criticize government actions.”

Bloomberg reported the effort to unmask the @montcowatch account was not an isolated incident, referencing at least four other cases where Homeland Security officials used administrative subpoenas in efforts to identify the people running Instagram accounts publishing content critical of the government. Those subpoenas were also withdrawn after the account owners sued to block the attempt.

Tech companies have in recent years published transparency reports that detail how many government demands for data they receive. But most do not break out how many judicial and administrative subpoenas they receive over a period of time, even though the two kinds of demands are fundamentally different.

When asked by TechCrunch, Meta spokesperson Francis Brennan did not say if Meta provided Homeland Security any data involving @montcowatch or if the company was asked to provide information about the account another way.

A new report by The Washington Post on Tuesday found that an administrative subpoena was also used to seek information from Google about an American retiree within hours of him after sending a critical email to Homeland Security’s lead attorney Joseph Dernbach. The retiree’s home was later visited by federal agents inquiring about the email.

The Post described the retiree as someone critical of Trump during his first term, who attended a No Kings rally last year, regularly attends gatherings and protests, and wrote criticisms to lawmakers, all actions protected under the First Amendment.

Within five hours of emailing the Homeland Security lawyer — who was named in an article about the case of an Afghan the U.S. was trying to deport and whose email address is listed on the Florida Bar’s website — the retiree received an email from Google, according to The Washington Post. The email notified him that his account had been subpoenaed by the Department of Homeland Security.

The subpoena demanded to know the day, time, and duration of all his online sessions, his IP address and physical address, and a list of each service he used, and any other usernames and identifiable information relating to his account, such as his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.

Two weeks later, Homeland Security agents were on his doorstep, asking him questions about the email that he sent to Dernbach, which the agents conceded broke no laws.

Google spokesperson Katelin Jabbari told TechCrunch the company pushes back against overbroad or improper subpoenas, “as we did in this instance,” referring to the subpoena referenced in The Washington Post’s reporting.

When asked by TechCrunch, Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin would not say why the U.S. was seeking information about people who have been critical of the Trump administration and accounts documenting ICE activity, or say for what reason the subpoenas were withdrawn.

“HSI has broad administrative subpoena authority under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(d) and 19 U.S.C. § 1509(a)(1) to issue subpoenas,” said McLaughlin, referring to Homeland Security Investigations, an investigative unit within ICE.

Not all companies are able to hand over data about their customers. For instance, information that is end-to-end encrypted and can only be accessed by obtaining a person’s phone or devices. That said, many companies are still able to provide large amounts of information about their users, including where they log in, how they log in, and from where, which may allow investigators to unmask anonymous accounts.

End-to-end encrypted messaging apps, like Signal, have long championed how little data it collects about its users. The messaging app responds to occasional legal demands by stating that it is unable to produce user data that it does not have to begin with.

The reliance on U.S. tech giants is another reason why European countries and ordinary consumers are seeking to rely less on American tech giants, at a time when chief executives and senior leaders at some of the largest U.S. tech companies are overtly cozying up to the Trump administration.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Skyryse, an El Segundo, California-based aviation automation startup, has raised more than $300 million in a Series C investment, pushing its valuation to $1.15 billion and into unicorn territory.

The round, which was announced Tuesday and led by Autopilot Ventures, provided a multimillion-dollar accelerant for the startup as it nears the end of a lengthy Federal Aviation Administration certification process for its flight control system. The capital will also be used to integrate its operating system, known as SkyOS, across numerous aircraft, including U.S. military Black Hawk helicopters.

Other investors in this round include Fidelity Management & Research Company, ArrowMark Partners, Atreides Management LP, BAM Elevate, Baron Capital Group, Durable Capital Partners, Positive Sum, Qatar Investment Authority, RCM Private Markets Fund managed by Rokos Capital Management, and Woodline Partners. The startup, which was founded in 2016, has raised more than $605 million in equity capital.

Skyryse has made inroads with investors as well as the U.S. military, emergency medical service operators, law enforcement, and private operators for its simplified flight system. The startup has stripped out dozens of mechanical flight controls like gauges and switches and replaced them with a system containing several flight computers that automate the more complicated and dangerous aspects of flying.

This is not a fully autonomous system; a pilot must still handle the operations. But it’s designed to automate the trickiest aspects of flying, enhance the skills of pilots, and improve safety.

That simplicity and ease of operation — a literal swipe of the finger on a touchscreen — has won over companies like United Rotorcraft, Air Methods, and Mitsubishi Corporation, which have contracts with Skyryse to integrate SkyOS on a variety of helicopters and airplanes.

Skyryse started building and testing its system on helicopters, one of the most unstable aircraft to operate. But the idea is that SkyOS can be applied to any aircraft. That initial operating system, known as Skyryse One, automates takeoff and landing and fully automates hover and engine-out emergency landings. The company has since integrated the operating system on Black Hawk helicopters.

Skyryse has made progress on its certification process with the Federal Aviation Administration. Last year, the FAA granted final design approval for the company’s SkyOS flight control computers. Skyryse must now complete formal flight testing and verification to achieve full certification.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/agentic-coding-comes-to-apples-xcode-26-3-with-agents-from-anthropic-and-openai/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple is bringing agentic coding to Xcode. On Tuesday, the company announced the release of Xcode 26.3, which will allow developers to use agentic tools, including Anthropic’s Claude Agent and OpenAI’s Codex, directly in Apple’s official app development suite.

The Xcode 26.3 Release Candidate is available to all Apple Developers today from the developer website and will hit the App Store a bit later.

This latest update comes on the heels of the Xcode 26 release last year, which introduced support for ChatGPT and Claude within Apple’s integrated development environment (IDE) used by those building apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple’s other hardware platforms.

The integration of agentic coding tools allows AI models to tap into more of Xcode’s features to perform their tasks and perform more complex automation.

The models will also have access to Apple’s current developer documentation to ensure they use the latest APIs and follow the best practices as they build.

At launch, the agents can help developers explore their project, understand its structure and metadata, then build the project and run tests to see if there are any errors and fix them, if so.

To prepare for this launch, Apple said it worked closely with both Anthropic and OpenAI to design the new experience. Specifically, the company said it did a lot of work to optimize token usage and tool calling, so the agents would run efficiently in Xcode.

Xcode leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) to expose its capabilities to the agents and connect them with its tools. That means that Xcode can now work with any outside MCP-compatible agent for things like project discovery, changes, file management, previews and snippets, and accessing the latest documentation.

Developers who want to try the agentic coding feature should first download the agents they want to use from Xcode’s settings. They can also connect their accounts with the AI providers by signing in or adding their API key. A drop-down menu within the app allows developers to choose which version of the model they want to use (e.g. GPT-5.2-Codex vs. GPT-5.1 mini).

In a prompt box on the left side of the screen, developers can tell the agent what sort of project they want to build or change to the code they want to make using natural language commands. For instance, they could direct Xcode to add a feature to their app that uses one of Apple’s provided frameworks, and how it should appear and function.

As the agent starts working, it breaks down tasks into smaller steps, so it’s easy to see what’s happening and how the code is changing. It will also look for the documentation it needs before it begins coding. The changes are highlighted visually within the code, and the project transcript on the side of the screen allows developers to learn what’s happening under the hood.

This transparency could particularly help new developers who are learning to code, Apple believes. To that end, the company is hosting a “code-along” workshop on Thursday on its developer site, where users can watch and learn how to use agentic coding tools as they code along in real time with their own copy of Xcode.

At the end of its process, the AI agent verifies that the code it created works as expected. Armed with the results of its tests on this front, the agent can iterate further on the project if need be to fix errors or other problems. (Apple noted that asking the agent to think through its plans before writing code can sometimes help to improve the process, as it forces the agent to do some pre-planning.)

Plus, if developers are not happy with the results, they can easily revert their code back to its original at any point in time, as Xcode creates milestones every time the agent makes a change.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New York City and others like it are filled with old buildings that are for the most part fine, except they’re not all that comfortable to live in. Built in an era when massive boilers were cutting-edge technology, the buildings are usually too hot or too cold, but seldom just right.

There are companies trying to rectify that using clever horseshoe-shaped heat pumps. Superficially, they’re similar to window air conditioners, except they don’t block the view and they can heat as well as cool.

Gradient makes one of those heat pumps, but now it’s adding a twist: In multifamily buildings, it can link every one of its window units together. The startup shared with TechCrunch exclusive details about the new Nexus software and service.

“Multifamily buildings are an ignored sector,” Vince Romanin, chief technology officer at Gradient, told TechCrunch. “It’s a place where we can do better for the user.”

The startup is mostly targeting old buildings that need HVAC upgrades. Gradient has worked with the New York City Housing Authority to install its heat pumps in public housing, and it ran a pilot in Tracy, California, in a newer two-story affordable-housing complex. It’s also talking with colleges and universities, many of which have dorms that weren’t built with hot autumn weather in mind.

Old buildings often have one electric meter, which can tempt residents into overusing their heating or air conditioning. Nexus gives some control back to building managers. They can set guardrails to prevent people from overusing the heat or AC — either intentionally or otherwise — while still allowing them to be comfortable. In one instance, a building manager set the heating limit at 78˚ F, and the next day energy consumption dropped by a quarter.

Romanin said Gradient’s heat pumps are the “lowest-cost option” for old buildings with boilers that are reaching end of life, a common occurrence in New York City. As a bonus, units that previously only had a steam radiator now get air conditioning, future proofing the units against worsening heat waves.

By installing a window unit rather than a minisplit, retrofits can happen within hours. They also don’t require electrical upgrades, Romanin said. In buildings with old electrical wiring that can’t support a full 12 amp load on a single outlet, Nexus can reduce the draw, said Mansi Shah, senior vice president of product and software at Gradient.

That strategy can extend beyond the building too. When the grid is overwhelmed by demand, which can happen on hot summer days, Gradient is working on a way to dial back its heat pumps while still maintaining occupant comfort. By using information about the building along with feedback from sensors in the heat pumps, the company hopes to predict which units can reduce their air conditioning demand, like those on the shady side of a building. That sort of demand response can help the grid serve more heat pumps without requiring costly upgrades.

“There’s a lot of people who said when we electrify everything, the grid won’t handle it,” Romanin said. “I think that it is very possible to electrify everything and make the grid better, make the grid’s job easier, and make electrons cheaper.”

            <div id="article-text">Henry Soong is trying to make vertical microdrama series that don’t suck. That makes the Watch Club founder quite unique within this multibillion-dollar industry of apps that churn out formulaic, cringe-worthy content and use aggressive tactics to maximize in-app spending.

“Ninety percent of these stories are, ‘I’m a poor girl! I fell in love with a secret billionaire! He’s a werewolf, and his mother is a vampire, and she disapproves of me!’” Soong told TechCrunch. “There’s a market for that, and we shouldn’t laugh at that, but I think this can be so much bigger than just sloppy, AI-adjacent romance soap operas.”

Soong’s comments are a little combative, but they’re not wrong. Competitor ReelShort made $1.2 billion in in-app purchases last year, while DramaBox made $276 million. The quality, he said, is so milquetoast that it could feasibly be made using AI-generated scripts.

What would be the earning potential for a microdrama app that makes shows that are actually good and worth talking about?

Soong is trying to answer that question with Watch Club, an app with microdrama stories made by SAG and WGA actors and writers (leading apps like DramaBox and ReelShort do not use union talent).

Soong, a former Meta product manager who describes himself as “a fangirl, through and through,” thinks that what makes TV so special is the communities that form around them. Given his experience working on social products, he’s also seeking to differentiate Watch Club from existing microdrama apps by embedding a social network within it.

“I think you can actually build such a more interesting business if you take what makes TV truly the most fun,” he said, pointing out “Heated Rivalry” as an example of what he’s talking about. “You watch it, and then you just want to gossip with your three best friends about it, or see what 100,000 funny, clever other young women or gay people on the internet are saying.”

Right now, people chat about “Severance” theories on Reddit, or they react to the “Stranger Things” finale on Tumblr. Before Twitter became the cesspool that is X, you had to work hard to avoid “Succession” or “White Lotus” spoilers. Soong sees the potential of housing both the show and the fan forums in one place.

How will that app make money? Like most early-stage, venture-funded companies, that’s a question to punt for now, until it’s clear how users are engaging with the app. The answer may be ads, but the idea alone was interesting enough to secure seed funding led by GV. Watch Club also received checks from individuals like Patreon founder and CEO Jack Conte, as well as current and former executives from Hulu, HBO Max, and Meta. Upside Ventures, the firm run by major U.K. YouTubers the Sidemen, also participated.

Soong doesn’t have a background in film, which is why he brought in Devon Albert-Stone as founding producer. He said he plans to hire WGA writers to create a slate of 10 shows.

“We work with brilliantly talented people when they have a few months free to go work on something that may not be huge budget because we offer them huge creative latitude to go do something that Amazon would never let them do at a speed and velocity that feels way more exciting than the glacial pace of the television industry,” Soong said.

He added: “I’m really good at figuring out how to monetize businesses that seem almost impossible to monetize.”

At Meta, his mission from 2016 to 2019 was to figure out how to make money in China, a country where no one could use Meta’s products. By 2019, Soong said, Meta generated $5 billion per year of ad sales for companies within China who wanted to advertise to audiences outside of the country.

Chinese ad sales may not be as glamorous as film and TV, but that job gave him additional context to understand the business model behind microdrama apps, which boomed in China at the end of the last decade.

“Right around the time that I was leaving Meta [in 2019] is when these Chinese micro drama apps started spending all this money buying ads on Instagram so that Americans and Germans would download ReelShort and DramaBox,” he said. “I know this business playbook. I know how expensive and capital-intensive it is, and I think you can build a way better microdrama business if you aren’t 100% dependent on paid user acquisition.”

Watch Club will have its first opportunity to test its concept when it releases its first show, “Return Offer,” which it plans to distribute on its app with daily episodes. On Tuesday, the company shared the first trailer for the show — which is about a group of tech interns in San Francisco competing for a return offer.

“My goal is to prove that our high-quality stories can give birth to the thing that supplants streaming television, and part of doing that is by building welcoming, creative sets with talented professionals, where people are having fun, despite small budgets, making something wonderful,” Soong said.

            <div id="article-text">The royal family in Abu Dhabi had a problem. Their AI firm, G42, wanted American chips, but both the Biden administration and Republicans in Congress feared letting them have any out of concern that the chips would be transferred to China.

The family solved the problem last year, The Wall Street Journal has discovered, by using the simplest solution that businesses can now employ for a policy obstacle: They seem to have made a deal with the Trump family. Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family sometimes called the “Spy Sheikh,” purchased a 49 percent share in World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto firm, thus sending $187 million to Trump-family-controlled entities. That spring, the Trump administration reversed American policy and approved the AI-chip transfer.

A sitting U.S. president shouldn’t have a business partner. If he did, ideally, that partner would be a U.S. citizen and not an agent of a foreign government. But if the president is going to have a foreign operative as his business partner, ideally that partner would not have a nickname like the Spy Sheikh.

President Trump has generally managed to confine the proliferating conflicts between his business dealings and the public interest to second-tier news stories. Trump and his spokespeople have rarely had to even defend his choice to operate a global business empire that stands to profit from his decisions.

David Frum: The Trump presidency’s world-historical heist

The Journal’s explosive report, which constitutes the first established instance of a foreign government official buying a large share of a Trump company after the 2024 election, has at least briefly forced the administration and the Trump family to explain themselves. The defenses put forth are not reassuring.

One defense, via World Liberty itself, is that the company need not follow any different ethical standards than other companies. David Wachsman, a spokesperson for the firm, told the Journal, “The idea that, when raising capital, a privately held American company should be held to some unique standard that no other similar company would be held is both ridiculous and un-American.”

The reason World Liberty might be held to a different standard than other firms is that World Liberty was founded by, among others, Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Barron Trump, and “co-founder emeritus” Donald Trump during the home stretch of the 2024 presidential campaign.

A normal business can’t simply change government policy in order to enrich itself. Jimmy Carter put his peanut farm in a blind trust upon taking office to avoid the temptation to tilt the policy agenda in a pro-peanut direction. Other peanut farmers did not have to establish blind trusts in response to Carter’s election. That is the difference between a business owned by a sitting president and one that isn’t.

Wachsman also assured the Journal that Trump and Steve Witkoff, a World Liberty co-founder, “had no involvement in the deal and haven’t been involved in World Liberty since taking office,” as the paper paraphrased his answer. But because Trump’s sons can handle the firm’s business, and presumably have regular opportunities to communicate with their dad, that does essentially nothing to dispel the conflict of interest. All that needs to happen to create a corrupt nexus is for Trump to find out who is giving him money.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, appearing on This Week With George Stephanopoulos, offered two additional defenses that are even less convincing: “President Trump has been completely transparent when his family travels for business reasons. They don’t do so in secret. We don’t learn about it when we find a laptop a few years later. We learn about it when it’s happening.” Blanche elaborated: “The president is ethical. He talks more to the press. He says what’s happening more than any president in history. You have a question about it, you can ask him. He gaggled on the plane last night at midnight for, like, 20 minutes. Okay?”

To say that the president is taking money from interested parties while delivering favorable decisions out in the open is not much of a defense. The cliché “It’s not the crime; it’s the cover-up” presumes that you have enough shame to cover up your crime in the first place. Watergate would have gone differently, but still not well, if Richard Nixon had held a press conference in 1972 to announce that he was hiring a team of burglars to surveil his opponents.

But even that threadbare defense isn’t true. Abu Dhabi’s investment in Trump’s company, the apparent quid in the quid pro quo, was a secret for more than a year until the Journal ferreted it out. Having been caught red-handed, Trump is trying to pretend to have freely disclosed it.

It is true that Trump entertains a lot of questions from the press, to which he often replies by insulting the reporters who asked, lying, or changing the subject. That is transparent in one sense of the word (you can see right through him). But it is not transparent in the sense of voluntarily placing pertinent information in the public domain.

Blanche also insisted that Trump’s World Liberty dealings were not different from the business practices of his predecessor: “I love it when these papers talk about something being unprecedented or never happening before, as if the Biden family and the Biden administration didn’t do exactly the same thing, and they were just in office.”

This is another defense that is not true and wouldn’t go very far even if it were.

Joe Biden did not run a private business while in office. His son Hunter did get involved in international businesses, such as the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma, whose interest in hiring him was almost certainly due to the belief that he could put in a friendly word with his father. That arrangement was sleazy enough. But selling the mere appearance of political clout—as vice president, Joe Biden did not deliver any policy favors for Burisma—was not nearly as unethical as Trump actually delivering for his partner.

The comic aspect of a Trump spokesperson pointing to the Biden administration as precedent is that Trump has repeatedly called his predecessor a crook. He has labeled Biden “Crooked Joe,” accused him of running a “crime family,” and described him as “the most corrupt president in American history—and that’s not even close.”

Now his administration says Trump is merely doing the same thing as the most corrupt president in American history. That would mean that Trump, by his own account, is tied for first place as the most corrupt president in history.

The most revealing—you might even say transparent—defense came from the White House spokesperson Anna Kelly. “President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public,” she told the Journal. “There are no conflicts of interest.”

This is a simple but fascinating statement. On one level, it’s just a lie: There are documented conflicts of interest between Trump’s businesses and his policy decisions.

Casey Michel: America has never seen corruption like this

On a deeper level, however, Kelly is asserting that the very idea of a conflict of interest does not apply to this administration. It is a dispute not over facts but over concepts. Trump is challenging the idea that a conflict between the president’s and the public’s interests is possible.

This belief follows more or less from every other decision Trump has made, which has collapsed the space between the president and the state. Trump can apparently give himself and his friends carte blanche to commit crimes, while deeming anybody who opposes him a criminal. He can turn the government into a propaganda arm, naming parts of it for himself and making the Army hold a parade on his birthday.

When his spokespeople claim there are no conflicts of interest, they are defining Trump’s actual theory of governing: L’état, c’est moi.</div>

Gregory Bovino, the man who became the face of Donald Trump’s Minneapolis crackdown, lost his job as the Border Patrol’s “commander at large” after agents he oversaw shot and killed Alex Pretti. Bovino also reportedly lost his X account, a development that may seem trivial until you remember: Bovino loves to post.

In the two days after Pretti died, Bovino relentlessly trolled Democrats who condemned the shooting—and defended Border Patrol agents as the real victims. When Representative Eric Swalwell wrote on X that ICE officers should walk off the job to protest the killing, Bovino replied: “I was thinking the same for you.” At about 1 a.m. last Monday, Bovino replied to a user who said he would “never pay for a beer again” after mocking Swalwell: “Lol!!  🍺 🍻 🍺 🍻 🍺 🍻.”

Getting silenced on X is, and I realize how absurd it sounds, the worst professional fate a Trump official can face. It signals that Bovino is no longer a player in an administration that has, from top to bottom, merged a social-media-first worldview with authoritarian tendencies. I like to call it the clicktatorship. Political appointees in the clicktatorship are not just using online platforms as a mode of communication. Their judgment and decision making are hyper-responsive to what’s happening on the far-right internet. They view everything as content.

No one better exemplifies the clicktatorship than the president himself. Trump routinely makes policy announcements via social media. Consider when, in August, he attempted to fire the Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook on Truth Social. When a government lawyer was questioned by the Supreme Court on the lack of an appeals option for Cook, he suggested that Cook could simply have made her case on Truth Social. In the clicktatorship, due process is reduced to the right to post.

You can see it everywhere. The administration’s official social-media feeds pump out far-right xenophobic memes and celebrate deportations with ASMR videos of undocumented immigrants in shackles. Just days before the killing of Pretti, the White House posted an image of a woman who was arrested after a protest at a church in Minnesota. It had been edited, presumably using generative AI, to show the arrestee as weeping uncontrollably. The effect is to reinforce an impression of dominance and control. Truth matters less than attention. Reporters who pointed out the manipulation were mocked by a White House spokesperson, who posted: “uM, eXCuSe mE??? iS tHAt DiGiTAlLy AlTeReD?!?!?!?!?!” (“The success of the White House’s social media pages speak for itself,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, told me in an email. “Through engaging posts and banger memes, we are successfully communicating the President’s extremely popular agenda.”)

Aspects of the clicktatorship existed during Trump’s first term, when the president used Twitter as a bully pulpit. But it has ratcheted up to new levels in his second go-round. His appointees are more likely to be keyboard warriors. They are obsessed with spectacle, and every government decision presents a potential opportunity to own the libs. Our government lost 10,000 STEM Ph.D.s last year, but seemingly has more posters than ever.

Consider Dan Bongino, who jumped from hosting a podcast to becoming deputy director of the FBI. (Bongino recently stepped down and returned to podcasting.) Or Harmeet Dhillon, who was a paid X influencer on top of her day job as a lawyer before becoming the head of civil rights at the Department of Justice. She continues to post up to a hundred times a day, between her personal and professional X accounts. “I’ve been stuck at the same level of followers on this account pretty much since I started my government job,” she wrote on X last month. What, am I chopped liver over here? What kind of content do my folks want to see more of to like and share?” And after the Venezuela raid in early January, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was photographed at a makeshift command center in Mar-a-Lago. Behind him was a screen displaying X posts.

Read: Everything reacting to everything, all at once

Poster brain and authoritarianism reinforce each other: They thrive on conspiracy theories, lack all restraint, and jump to extreme solutions. Trump officials pointed to claims about welfare fraud from the social-media influencer Nick Shirley to justify cutting off billions in aid to five Democrat-led states. And Trump-administration officials pointed to Shirley’s viral video in attempting to justify a crackdown in Minnesota that has now resulted in the death of two American citizens. Meanwhile, government budget proposals and strategy documents now read like Truth Social posts, replete with online tropes. The White House website now alleges that President Obama hosted terrorists, speculates that Hunter Biden had cocaine in the White House, and says that “it was the Democrats who staged the real insurrection” on January 6, 2021.

Social media and authoritarian regimes have one other negative tendency in common: They feed information bubbles. Online, people select into circles of those they already agree with. In nondemocratic regimes, senior officials wall themselves off from reality because their underlings are afraid to deliver bad news. In both cases, the bubbles encourage radical actions rather than compromise—doubling down rather than moderation.

But the thing about bubbles is that sooner or later they burst. The Trump administration maintained a unified front after the killing of Renee Good, arguing that agents were acting in self-defense, even when video evidence complicated that version of events. Many members of the administration attempted to follow the same playbook after federal officials killed Pretti. But the fiction has not held up. The people who put their bodies on the line to record what was happening in Minneapolis revealed a valuable truth. The same tool that makes clicktatorship possible—the smartphone—can also be used against it.</div>

            <div id="article-text">The librarian sat me in front of a microfilm reader and brought out roll after roll of film. I stayed there for hours, squinting to decipher the archaic handwriting in the Free Negro Book, which was published annually in South Carolina before the Civil War.

The names in each year’s edition were alphabetized, but only roughly—all of the surnames starting with A came before all of the surnames starting with B, but Agee might come before Anderson, or it might come after.

I began with the 1848 edition, but there was no listing for a Henry Fordham. The same was true of the book for 1849. Same for 1850. But as I slowly made my way through the F section of the 1851 edition, I let out a shout that shattered the library’s decorous hush: “Yesssss!” Then, quickly, to the startled patrons and librarians: “I’m so sorry, excuse me, I’m so sorry.” And then, more softly: “Yes.”

On March 27, 1829, a wealthy white planter and businessman named Richard Fordham purchased four enslaved African Americans from a woman named Isabella Perman. One of them was my great-great-grandfather, a boy called Harry.

This transaction took place in Charleston, the port of entry for an estimated 40 percent of all enslaved Africans brought to toil in this country. A document recording the sale was filed with the South Carolina secretary of state several days later, on April 7. It does not say where in Charleston the sale took place—on the steps of the Old Exchange and Provost Dungeon, perhaps, or at the Cooper River docks, or in one of the thriving markets where people were bought and sold. The individuals bought by Fordham are listed as “a Negro boy named Harry and a Negro woman named Jenny and her two children named Hager and Margaret.” For the lot, Fordham paid $1,080.

Harry, whose proper name was Henry, spent 19 years as Fordham’s chattel. The young man proved to be quick of mind and good with his hands: He mastered the art of blacksmithing at the Chalmers Street Forge, which Fordham co-owned. Henry’s skills eventually made him Fordham’s de facto right-hand man at the forge. On July 10, 1848, Fordham sold “a Negro man named Henry” to Otis Mills and Co., a grain-wholesaling business with multiple warehouses near the Cooper River docks. The sale was recorded with the secretary of state seven days later. The company’s eponymous founder, one of Charleston’s richest men, went on to build the city’s most luxurious hotel, the Mills House. The price he paid for my great-great-grandfather was $2,000, a lot of money for a single Black man.

According to family lore, Henry had somehow circumvented the state’s strict law against educating the enslaved and become literate. He had also become deeply religious. Not only had he learned to read the Gospel of Jesus Christ; he’d also heard the call to preach it.

A few years after being acquired by Mills, Henry Fordham was purchased one final time—by himself, when he bought his freedom.

I’ve always known, through my family’s rich oral history, that my extraordinary great-great-grandfather obtained his liberty at some point before the Civil War. For a long time, however, my attempts to find out exactly when and how he cast off his chains ran into dead ends.

When I was growing up, it never occurred to me to go looking for my family’s history. It was already right there, all around me. My sister, Ellen, and I were born and raised in Orangeburg, 75 miles northwest of Charleston, in the house that Henry Fordham’s son—a formidable man named John Hammond Fordham—built for his family in 1903. Anchoring the corner of Boulevard and Oak Streets, the house is a characteristically southern structure—one and a half stories, with white wooden siding, two graceful bay windows, four dormers poking through the roof, and a wide wraparound front porch that serves as an auxiliary living room during the hot months.

We knew that important family talismans lay in a big, black safe that John Hammond Fordham kept in the main bedroom. It looked like a cartoon safe, the kind that the Road Runner used to drop on Wile E. Coyote’s head, and it was incredibly heavy, which is probably why it still sits there today.

When I was growing up, the safe was always closed but never locked. I was curious about everything, and so sometimes, while my grandmother was busy in the kitchen, I would peek inside. But the old, yellowed papers that I found didn’t mean anything special to me.

Once I became a journalist, I realized that my family’s house, documents, photographs, and oral history constituted an extremely rare gift. All of that material told an important story; I didn’t know what it was, but I had the sense that I was destined to find and share it. Life and career had a way of intervening, however, and for decades I put off the exploration of my family’s past.

I returned to those annals in earnest when I realized two things: First, that my family’s history vividly traced the repeated cycles in which African Americans win a greater measure of opportunity, only to have much or all of it taken away again. With the materials in my house and a bit of research—a lot of research, as it turned out—I could show this pattern in action, over two centuries. Second, I saw that our history is every African American’s history. Through slavery and emancipation, Jim Crow and civil rights, war and peace, all that Black Americans have ever wanted is a fair chance to pursue the American dream.

Family lore said that Henry may have arrived in Charleston from Barbados, one of the British islands in the Caribbean where Africans were “seasoned”—conditioned to the lash—in the sugarcane fields. When my wife, Avis, and I went on vacation to Barbados in 1996, I decided to look for traces of my family in the National Archives. We drove around for quite a while—on the wrong side of the road—until we found the place, which I remember as a graceful old building filled with natural light.

In a big reading room, we sat at a long table while helpful staff members, accustomed to visits from Americans seeking their roots, brought out materials they thought might help us with our search. A day of poring over records, however, gave up nothing more than hints and shadows. Discouraged, we went back to our hotel and I called Aunt Grace—actually one of my mother’s many first cousins—who was the family’s chief genealogist.

I had been looking for records of slave owners named Fordham, but she explained that the name hadn’t attached itself to our family until after Henry’s 1829 sale to Richard Fordham. Instead, she said, I should look for a Black woman named Jenny—the “Negro woman” who was sold at the same time as Henry. Jenny’s previous owner, Isabella Perman, had the maiden name Fell. So I should look for a woman named Jenny who had some connection with those two surnames.

We returned to the archives, and a senior researcher named Shirley Archer helped us renew our quest, bringing out reels of microfilm and precious old ledger books recording births, baptisms, and deaths. We finally found a family named Fell that had lived in Barbados in the early 19th century, in St. Philip Parish. We also found a family in the same parish named Perreman—pretty close to Perman. And we found that on November 27, 1793, an enslaved adult named Kitty Fell was baptized at St. Philip’s Church. She would have been the right age, I thought, to be Jenny’s mother.

But we could find no record of Kitty having a daughter, and no record of Kitty being sold away to Charleston. We had bits and pieces that might fit together, but we couldn’t figure out how. English planters in the Caribbean kept meticulous records of the horses they bred and raced, but they couldn’t be bothered to keep even rudimentary family histories of the human beings they claimed to own.

It was Aunt Grace who learned that Henry Fordham had been sold to Otis Mills in 1848. And I knew Henry had been free before the Civil War and emancipation, because I found his name in the 1861 Charleston city census, appended with the notation f.p.c.—“free person of color.” By then, I reasoned, he must have been a free man for some time, because the census showed that he already owned two wood-framed houses in the city. It must have taken him at least a few years to accumulate such assets.

But exactly when, in that 13-year gap between his last sale and his first appearance in the census, had he become free? I examined real-estate records, scoured the family Bible, searched archives in reading rooms and digital databases, looked everywhere I could think of—and didn’t find a clue. By the 19th century, manumission was essentially illegal in South Carolina, which did not entirely end the practice, but it meant there would be no official document recording the moment of Henry Fordham’s freedom in the secretary of state’s archives.

The South Carolina Historical Society, a private institution founded in 1855, is the first stop for researchers seeking information about the antebellum period. I visited its grand neoclassical headquarters on Charleston’s main thoroughfare, Meeting Street, several times over the years to look for anything about my great-great-grandfather that might pin down the date of his freedom. No luck.

In 2014, the society’s collection was moved across town to the College of Charleston so that the archives’ original home—a landmark 1826 structure known as the Fireproof Building—could be turned into a museum. Slowly, more records were digitized, or at least preserved on microfilm. In February 2023, I visited the collection at its present location, a hushed sanctum on the second floor of the college’s Addlestone Library, in the hopes that more of the hit-or-miss manumission records from Henry Fordham’s time might have been cataloged and made accessible.

I was overjoyed when the librarians found a folder labeled with Henry Fordham’s name—but then immediately deflated when they brought it out, because I saw that it contained only a long, speculative, and largely inaccurate account of Henry’s life, compiled by a distant relative whom I’d never met. I was already familiar with that document, and I knew it said nothing about when Henry had liberated himself.

Finally, one of the librarians suggested that I look through editions of Charleston’s Free Negro Book. I’d had no idea that such a thing existed: a yearly list of free African Americans residing in the city who had paid the state’s poll tax. It was an exercise in data collection born of paranoia. The fact that Black people outnumbered white people in South Carolina during the decades before the Civil War meant that white officials lived in constant fear of a Haiti-style Black uprising. Free African Americans were a tiny minority—more than 95 percent of Black people in the state were enslaved—but it seemed to make sense that any rebellion would be led by conspirators with independent resources and the liberty of unsupervised movement. White southerners took great pains to keep track of men and women like Henry Fordham.

I doubt I will ever be able to find out the month and the day my great-great-grandfather became free. But I can be quite sure that he was still enslaved when free African Americans were counted in 1850—and that he had become a proud, free Black man by the time the Free Negro Book was compiled in 1851.

Even after solving this mystery, I never stopped wondering about my deeper history, before the time of Henry Fordham. Who was my first African ancestor to set shackled foot on this continent? He or she had a name. He or she had a clan, a language, a culture, a faith. All of this history is forever gone.

There was nothing at all inadvertent about its disappearance. It was stolen. Slave owners in the English colonies of the New World went to great lengths to sever any ties that their captives had with the past and with one another. Enslavers’ fortunes and lives depended on being able to control the able-bodied Black men and women who outnumbered them—20, 40, 60 Black bodies crammed into slave shacks, versus maybe a dozen white family members in the big house. Our captors could not allow us to feel confident in the strength of our numbers. They wanted us to feel powerless, ungrounded, disconnected, and thus easier to dominate.

From the December 2023 issue: Lonnie G. Bunch III asks why America is afraid of Black history

I feel the absence of my deep, pre-American history. I feel it the way an amputee suffers phantom pain in a missing limb. I keep looking for what was stolen from me. And occasionally I glimpse what might be fragments of it.

When I was little, among the out-of-town visitors who would occasionally drop by to visit my grandmother and great-aunt were two women from Charleston. I don’t remember their names. What got my attention was that they spoke to each other in an incomprehensible, rapid-fire patois that definitely wasn’t English. I learned they had been speaking Gullah (also called Geechee), a creole language based on English but laden with a hodgepodge of West African vocabulary, grammar, and syntax.

Gullah is possibly a corruption of Angola, a region from which many Africans were seized. Or it might refer to the Gola people, an ethnic group living on land that is now in Liberia and Sierra Leone. If you have ever referred to peanuts as “goobers,” you are using a Gullah word that comes from the Kikongo term for “peanut,” nguba. On the islands around Charleston—including Daniel Island, where Richard Fordham had his plantation and my great-great-grandfather grew into manhood—Gullah evolved as a lingua franca that allowed enslaved Africans from different cultures and language groups to communicate. Henry almost surely would have understood every word those women who visited were saying.

Somewhere in Africa there is a city, town, or village where Henry Fordham’s progenitors lived and died for hundreds or thousands of years, where my distant relatives walk the streets today. That place exists, and I know I will never find it. Still, I can get closer than was possible even a few years ago, thanks to DNA testing.

In 2022, I mailed away a saliva sample and waited, with no real expectation of an aha moment. When the results came back, I learned that 34 percent of my DNA comes from Nigeria, 20 percent from Mali, and another 26 percent from other places up and down the west coast of Africa. That doesn’t depart from what I’d have predicted, and it doesn’t narrow things down meaningfully.

Read: 300 million letters of DNA are missing from the human genome

The remaining 20 percent of my DNA comes mostly from Germany, with a small contribution from the British Isles—again, no surprise. The fact that part of my genetic inheritance comes from Europe makes me like most Black Americans: According to a 2010 study, “an African American individual in the United States has, on average, about 75–80 percent West African ancestry and about 20–25 percent European ancestry.”

Someday, perhaps, the collective human genome will be sufficiently mapped to trace my DNA to a specific Nigerian village or English hamlet. But the truth is that race has never been a biological fact. It has always been a social construct, which allowed the powerful to justify exploitation of the powerless. The elaborate fiction of race gave Richard Fordham the “right” to purchase my great-great-grandfather, and required Henry Fordham to purchase his own freedom. And it is race and racism that have kept me from knowing the names, let alone the hopes and dreams, of Henry’s predecessors in my American history. So I begin with him.

            <div id="article-text">When life gets really hectic, sitting quietly with a book can feel like an impossible luxury. And when does a smartphone-mediated world feel less than hectic? Any shred of free time is too easy to fill with more work, more worrying, more commitments, and, of course, more aimless scrolling. If you really want to get any reading done, you may have to turn it into another task on the to-do list. This doesn’t require strict goals or reading challenges (unless that suits you). All you need is a willingness to dedicate a few minutes a day, and maybe a few new habits—packing a paperback for the waiting room, queuing up an audiobook for your commute. What works best for me, though, is choosing just the right book.

Despite the constant grind of my weeks, I can usually make time to turn some pages if something in those pages pushes through my distractions. I might be behind on grading papers, but if I’m obsessed with Tara Selter, the character stuck in a time loop in On the Calculation of Volume, or totally absorbed in the minutiae of a great biography of Virginia Woolf, nothing can get me to step away. It’s hard to say what book might send you down that rabbit hole, but the list below may help a harried reader pick up something they actually want to finish. I consider these books, representing varied genres, uncommonly likely to absorb, entertain, and challenge. Each is broken up into discrete units—chapters, essays, letters, stories—that provide easy stopping points, although you might find it difficult to put them down.

Instead of offering an escape from real life, Home Cooking invites the reader to consider a kind of domestic drudgery—the daily necessity of cooking and eating—with renewed humor and curiosity. Although each short essay in the collection contains at least one recipe (some quite good, some very 1980s), the sum of these parts is far more memoir than cookbook. Colwin’s writing is funny and familiar, never fussy, and reminiscent of a family heirloom dotted with personal notes and stories. She recounts her own humbling kitchen disasters, shares dinner-party tips, and expounds on the merits of bitter greens. Essays such as “Bread Baking Without Agony,” “Flank Steak: The Neglected Cut,” and “Easy Cooking for Exhausted People” are both practical and charming. Clearly, Colwin loved to cook—and eat—in the comfort of her own home, and her pleasure is infectious. As she writes, “The joy of cooking is the joy of discovery.”

Read: You can read any of these short novels in a weekend

Forster finished Maurice in 1914, but it was published posthumously, in 1971, because of the novel’s portrayal of homosexual love. Its title character, the young Maurice Hall, is a conventional English man with a vague, nagging sense that he’s somehow different. He passes almost numbly through the rigors of schooling and middle-class childhood until he arrives at Cambridge, where he meets a group of very learned young men and begins to wake up: “People turned out to be alive,” Maurice reflects. “Hithero he had supposed that they were what he pretended to be—flat pieces of cardboard stamped with a conventional design.” Maurice grows steadily more intimate with a friend, Clive, trading books and letters with him over vacation, until Clive professes his love. The rest of the novel follows their risky relationship, and feels very contemporary: Can their partnership survive life after university? How will they handle growing pressure to start a lucrative career, marry a woman, and have a family? Anyone interested in a good love story will find something to enjoy.

Smith takes absolute delight in the English language and its history. In her most recent work, the trickster novelist combines her love of words with a propulsive plot: Gliff is partly a YA dystopian novel, partly an homage to Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, and entirely a vehicle for beautiful prose. In the United Kingdom of the not-too-distant future, those who resist the surveillance state and its data mining are marked as “unverifiables” and rounded up inside detention centers. The novel follows two young adults, Rose and her nonbinary sibling, Bri, who return from visiting their mother at work to find a red line painted around their house. Their mother’s boyfriend leaves with a promise to be back soon. Suddenly, they are alone, unverifiable, and unable to turn to anyone for help; they realize they must go on the run to survive. In a typically Smithian twist, the novel will soon have its own double: Make room for its companion novel, called Glyph, to be published in May.

Is anything more engaging than a good murder mystery—one that dares you to guess who did it, and why? I devoured this captivating specimen in just a few days. When the novel opens in Florence, in 1557, the body of the painter Jacopo da Pontormo lies in the chapel of San Lorenzo—in front of the frescoes he’d labored over for a decade, with a painter’s chisel stuck in his heart. The case becomes political when a lewd painting of Maria de’ Medici, the daughter of the Duke of Florence, is found in Pontormo’s room. The ensuing story—consisting entirely of letters among artists, courtiers, and religious leaders—is a wild ride through the politics and intrigue of Renaissance Italy that incorporates real historical figures. This epistolary structure is brilliant: The reader can see precisely who tells what to whom—and discern their motives for telling it. Could the killer be Agnolo Bronzino, Pontormo’s former student? A political rival of the duke? About the ending, I’ll say only that it is funny, smart, and genuinely surprising.

Read: What to read when you have only half an hour

A book of short stories may be the best kind of work for a reader with a busy schedule. You can savor one piece in a collection, then let days or weeks pass before moving on to another. Plus, no one can stop you from reading them in any order you please. I recommend the 12 stories in Honored Guest, all full of striking detail and featuring strangely insightful narrators. Each tale abounds with existential questions and turns the familiar eerie. In “Anodyne,” a mother quits yoga to start shooting classes at a gun range; in “ACK,” a couple endures an odd dinner party on Nantucket. Williams’s stories always benefit from considered, post hoc reflection: Finish just one with breakfast, then let the images and sentences drift through your mind for the rest of the day.

A long novel can be a daunting investment of time and energy, but if you can settle into its rhythms, it can be a wonderful companion for the beleaguered reader. Just shy of 600 pages, The Old Drift glides between magical realism and sci-fi to tell the story of three entangled Zambian families over three generations. Nestled within the chronicles of these characters are chapters narrated by a swarm of mosquitos: Their hive mind takes readers from the colonial beginnings of the nation, starting with the explorer Dr. Livingstone’s “discovery” of Victoria Falls in the 19th century, to the “warm, wet future” of 2023 Lusaka, imagined from the vantage point of 2019. Because of its patchwork of perspectives, the novel can be easily read in chunks, but I found it terribly hard to put aside. This is a curious, probing book: You will find no pat conclusions or sentimentality, only a new (and very rewarding) variation on the multigenerational family novel.

Read: Five books that’ll fit right into your busy schedule

Lockwood’s dad is a rarity: a Catholic priest who’s both married and a father (he was already a family man when he converted, after watching The Exorcist on a nuclear submarine). His pastoral persona is equally unconventional, as he shreds guitar and lounges around the rectory in his underwear. Facing financial troubles, Lockwood and her husband move in with her parents, and Priestdaddy becomes an absurdist reflection on growing up in such an environment. Even if you read this book for only five minutes a day, you will inevitably bump into something screamingly funny, such as the author’s repeated attempts to explain Catholicism to her husband, her sister’s drunken antics at a dinner with the local bishop, and her mother’s penchant for yelling a Kool-Aid-Man-style “Oh yeah!” (I highly recommend the audiobook, in which Lockwood impersonates her family members with flair.) Reading Priestdaddy is like having a conversation with a brilliant, exuberant friend—you can’t wait to hear what she’ll say next.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">My friend recently attended a funeral, and midway through the eulogy, he became convinced that it had been written by AI. There was the telltale proliferation of abstract nouns, a surfeit of assertions that the deceased was “not just X—he was Y” coupled with a lack of concrete anecdotes, and more appearances of the word collaborate than you would expect from a rec-league hockey teammate. It was both too good, in terms of being grammatically correct, and not good enough, in terms of being particular. My friend had no definitive proof that he was listening to AI, but his position—and I agree with him—is that when you know, you know. His sense was that he had just heard a computer save a man from thinking about his dead friend.

More and more, large language models are relieving people of the burden of reading and writing, in school and at work but also in group chats and email exchanges with friends. In many areas, guidelines are emerging: Schools are making policies on AI use by students, and courts are trying to settle the law about AI and intellectual property. In friendship and other interpersonal uses, however, AI is still the Wild West. We have tacit rules about which movies you wait to see with your roommate and who gets invited to the lake house, but we have yet to settle anything comparable regarding, for example, whether you should use ChatGPT to reply to somebody’s Christmas letter. That seems like an oversight.

For the purposes of this discussion, I will define friendship adverbially, to mean any friendly communication—with boon companions but also family members, neighbors, and acquaintances—as well as those transactional relationships that call for an element of friendliness, such as with teachers and babysitters. There is reason to believe that use of AI in these friend-like relationships has already become widespread. In a Brookings Institution survey released in November, 57 percent of respondents said they used generative AI for personal purposes; 15 to 20 percent used it for “social media or communication.”

Read: The common friendship behavior that has become strangely fraught

Respondents to the Brookings survey were not asked whether they had offered some disclaimer about their use of AI or were passing off its outputs as their own; few statistics seem to exist on that question. But in a 2024 survey released by Microsoft, 52 percent of respondents who used AI at work said they were reluctant to admit using it for “important tasks,” presumably because it might make them look replaceable. My feeling is that using AI for friendly communications operates on a similar principle—but the share of people who should be ashamed is closer to 100 percent.

Deception is only part of the problem; the main evil is efficiency. The people selling AI keep suggesting I use it to streamline tasks that I regard as fun and even meaningful. Apple’s iOS 26, for example, has made text messages more efficient by offering AI summaries of their contents in notifications and lists. Before I turned it off, this feature summarized a group chat—in which my friend sent a picture of the door to her spooky attic, normally locked but now ajar, that became the occasion for various jokes about her finally being haunted—as “a conversation about a wooden room.”

In addition to being inaccurate, this summary removed everything entertaining about the chat in order to reduce it to a bare exchange of information. Presumably the summary would have been more actionable if the conversation it summarized had focused on dates and times or specific work products instead of jokes, which are notoriously hard for AI to parse. But how many conversations with friends are about communicating facts?

When my brother texts “How’s it going?,” he’s not seeking information so much as connection. That connection is thwarted if I ask ChatGPT to draft a 50-word reply about how his baby is cute and I love him. To prevent hard-core get-it-done types from inflicting slop on the rest of us, we need to agree that my sending you material written by ChatGPT is insulting, the same way you would be insulted if I were to play a recording of myself saying “Oh, that’s interesting” every time you spoke.

The assumption that the main purpose of writing is to convey information quickly breaks down when you consider cases beyond signage and certain airport-oriented areas of publishing. In schoolwork for teachers, chats with friends, or even emails to business associates—relationships that are defined by mutual obligations—a primary function of any written text is, to borrow a phrase from cryptocurrency, proof of work. This work is the means by which the text was produced but also an end in itself, either because it benefits the writer or because it demonstrates commitment to the reader.

Read: The decline of etiquette and the rise of ‘boundaries’

Generative AI sabotages the proof-of-work function by introducing a category of texts that take more effort to read than they did to write. This dynamic creates an imbalance that’s common to bad etiquette: It asks other people to work harder so one person can work—or think, or care—less. My friend who tutors high-school students sends weekly progress updates to their parents; one parent replied with a 3,000-word email that included section headings, bolded his son’s name each time it appeared, and otherwise bore the hallmarks of ChatGPT. It almost certainly took seconds to generate but minutes to read. As breaches of etiquette go, where this asymmetric email falls is hard to say; I would put it somewhere between telling a pointless story about your childhood and using your phone’s speaker on an airplane. The message it sent, though, was clear: My friend’s client wanted the relational benefits of a substantial reply but didn’t care enough to write one himself.

Writing is an act of taking care. College students write term papers not to inform their professors of the role of class in Wuthering Heights, but because putting what they have learned into words clarifies their understanding to both their instructors and themselves. Writing a eulogy both leads the eulogizer to think deeply about his relationship with the deceased and demonstrates his ongoing commitment to that relationship, even and especially after he can derive no benefit from it: Our goalie is dead, but we care enough to keep thinking about him even after he will stop no earthly puck.

A time-saving technology such as AI is appealing in the workplace because many people want to spend less time working. This calculus should not apply to our friendly relationships, which are not purely means to money or status but also ends in themselves—experiences of other people that are worthwhile as experiences and therefore diminished by efficiency. I don’t want these relations to become more efficient for the same reason I don’t want a robot that pets the dog for me. And if you don’t want to text me, then why do you want to be my friend?

Sometimes, of course, friendship is a pain. It would be easier to conduct friendship purely on our own terms, responding when we felt the urge and letting a computer talk to our friends when we didn’t want to. But that would not be friendship. A computer takes no care. We should not let it take the experience of caring away from us.</div>

How long until they move their headquarters to India?

Old boss once told me, he&#39;d set up a complete call center for a US client in India, for less than he paid any one of his engineers, maybe 10 years before he and I worked together.

Just move to India already, Google. It&#39;s cheaper, and no burdensome regulations.  You&#39;ll be free to exploit your workers far more than you do here.

I mean, that&#39;s Google&#39;s purpose, right?  Pay as least as possible for everything, including people and talent?

is generally only a thing in the United States. It&#39;s an alien concept in the rest of the world outside the USA. It&#39;s a lot harder to fire people for no reason in the rest of the world.

The whole employment-at-will thing was a big driver of H-1B visas. Bosses don&#39;t like the employment laws in the rest of the world they crave the power to fire someone for any reason or no reason whatsoever. So they import bodies to the USA so they are subjected to the shitty employment laws the United States has.

You do get the same practice basically only in the 3rd world. The US is a fossile in many regards.

I suspect a large majority of the money spent towards open source is in the form of support contracts, yes, but large contracts paid by large companies to large projects.  The problem is that a majority of the *projects* are small, often single person, and *those* do not have a good way of funding their work.  There is no web of small companies paying small projects keeping the greater open source community healthy, and so smaller projects have to look to other ways to fund work.

AI is dumb, it cannot innovate.  Without humans creating new training data, it will fall behind.   AI must find a way to avoid being fatal to the host it feeds on.

Does it degrade or stay stagnant.Can do both, either, or also neither.
It&#39;s a complication that has to be accounted for, though.

It can reduce perplexity, but that can very much be a not good thing.

What I can say, is that OSS survived just fine before bullshit like enshittified revenue models become popular, and it will survive the AIpocalypse.
Will OSS change? Yes.

The reason people made open source projects and devoted time to maintaining them, was purely because it was enjoyable to do so. In the age of AI, that is gone. I no longer want to release my work for the benefit of others, because now it is only feeding this infernal bullshit machine, which will steal my work and sell it as its own. And if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, it will send a deluge of slop bugreports and phishing attacks.AI needs to die. The bubble can&#39;t burst soon enough.

Does the Akira License involve biker gangs and racing around on a motorcycle?

Stack Overflow activity fell roughly 25% within six months of ChatGPT&#39;s launch.

This has nothing to do with &quot;vibe coding&quot;.

I&#39;m also unclear on what &quot;documentation traffic&quot; and &quot;bug reports&quot; has to do with a project earning money. Is this about seeing advertising? Because I&#39;m not going to contribute to a project if that requires me to look at advertising.

If the project is funded through donations, if the donation link is never seen by human eyeballs; the donation link never gets clicked.

The given example of Tailwind monetized by having the base framework be free, but having a collection of tools including a Component Library be licensed. So if an LLM is pumping out examples rather than the docs, the user isn&#39;t going to see the value add subscription.

If a project has advertising and you see it, then you are already contributing. But if the LLM is has to be &quot;

&quot;Open-source maintainers monetize through documentation visits&quot;

Open source is monetized through documentation visits? Not only most open source programmers know how to use an adblocker, but I also saw very few (thanks god!) documentation pages with ads. What are these people talking about?

That was that website where I couldn&#39;t answer questions in an area regarding which I am an expert, unless I had a certain amount of &quot;reputation&quot;. Rest in peace.

&quot;One proposed fix is a &quot;Spotify for open source&quot; model where AI platforms redistribute subscription revenue to maintainers based on package usage.&quot;

Proposed fix for what?  And what incentive would motivate &quot;AI platform&quot; developers to involve themselves with &quot;subscription revenue to maintainers&quot;?

Open source, in particular GPL, is communistic, do we assume AI is as well?  Because it sure doesn&#39;t seem like it.  And why does open source funding need to be fixed?  RMS created the GPL to compel others to give sour

It&#39;s more accurate to say that the entire concept of libraries and frameworks is now obsolete. Why bother building and maintaining libraries of tested code when you can just generate it from scratch every time? The only reason we used libraries was to keep things maintainable and reusable. If you can just get an LLM to generate bespoke code on demand, and have it do exactly what you want and nothing else, then every piece of software can be a snowflake... unique and fragile, but infinitely replaceable. It&#39;s

1) We have needed a more sustainable financing model for FOSS that matters for quite a while now.

2) &quot;Vibe &quot;coding&quot; will not matter in the long run. Its results are just too abysmally bad. People still need a few years to understand as those of low / no skills are always late in understanding the blatantly obvious. (Dunning & Kruger have an explanation for that ...)

I don&#39;t know of a single company sharing proprietary code. So where will vibe be if there is no code to scan?

On another note. A while back people were worried that open source licensed code would make it in commercial licensed code  and would create some legal issues. Isn&#39;t this also an issue with vibe generated code?

To me it seems that it&#39;s more of an issue that vibe creates a problem for proprietary code. GPL to vide makes vibe code into GPL. Share and share alike.

I love pulling a repo and having Claude explain it and figure out how to run it.It used to take forever to get an unfamiliar repo to work because Linux.This is actually one of the best uses of LLMs, getting someone else&#39;s software to work on my machine.The fear of getting knee deep in the weeds because I don&#39;t understand the repo completely, is now gone.

NOBODY loves Google ads!I don&#39;t entirely understand what background playback has to do with avoiding ads.  If anything, playing in the background without Premium would mean hearing and possibly seeing more ads, because you won&#39;t be able to quickly skip them.I also don&#39;t understand why YouTube thinks paywalling this is a good idea.

They&#39;re just lying because they really are doing it for the first reason you pointed out. What they should do is recognize that some of their content works fine as an audio experience and start selling audio only ads to play when delivering content in that way. Even if the audio ads don&#39;t make them as much money, the savings from not having to delivery video streams to people who aren&#39;t watching the video should make up for it.This.Also, background does not necessarily mean &quot;screen off&quot;.  It can also mean &quot;floating window&quot;, where you&#39;re still seeing the visual ad content and the video content.  Yeah, users might then swipe it off where they don&#39;t have to see the ad, but either way, they&#39;re hearing it.  And if YouTube can&#39;t figure out how to monetize that, this shows a real lack of imagination.

They are ensuring consistency. They are insuring it is consistently shitty.

If I was alphabet I would be extremely careful to make sure I don&#39;t prefer my own browser.  That is.. unless I wanted the government to break me up.

Yeah, just like what happened to Microsoft when they were found to be a monopoly because they favored their own browser over any other.

We&#39;re so fortunate that they were broken up into multiple companies!

For Microsoft, that would be the wrong way.  Instead of making many Microsofts, the govts should go the other way, and make zero!

A judge already  ruled on that monopoly position and didn&#39;t force them to divest from Chrome. [bbc.com] Why change strategies if there isn&#39;t punishment?

He refused to grant government lawyers their request for a Google breakup that would include a spin-off of Chrome, the world&#39;s most popular browser.

You can smell the desperation as they fail to keep people from blocking ads. They&#39;re just so so so so greedy and grasping that they piss themselves into a frenzy if they think they&#39;re losing ad views.

Remember, if you go to the bathroom during a commercial, you&#39;re breaking the implicit contract to watch every ad they show you, or you&#39;ll be STEALING from the advertisers. (Some ad exec actually said something to that effect but I can&#39;t find the quote.)

A Google spokesperson told Android Authority that the platform &quot;updated the experience to ensure consistency,&quot;

TRANSLATION: &quot;Fuck you, you&#39;ll watch our ads or we&#39;ll cripple your browser.&quot;

I find few things on my phone more annoying, than when I close the YouTube app, it keeps playing the video. No, when I close the app, the video needs to go away. Period.

Can&#39;t you just turn off &quot;background app refresh&quot; (or its Android equivalent) for the YouTube app?

I disable that for most apps as a matter of course.

I counter with, I would think the board of any public corporation would have a succession plan ready, say for instance there is a health emergency with the CEO.  Or more likely the CEO does something bad and needs to be removed.   The response to this should be &quot;Enrique Lores has decided to leave HP, the acting CEO is Stacy Smith who is fully capable of fulfilling the role.&quot;

From what I have seen over the years, public boards of directors are utterly useless.  They provide almost zero oversight.  They approv

Who cares what happens to HP, I assumed they had gone bankrupt already?

UBlock does a pretty good job of blocking PayPal&#39;s ads.And if you buy an HP computer (or for that matter, ANY Windows computer), the first step is to wipe the hard drive and install a fresh, clean copy of Windows directly from Microsoft. NONE of the computer manufacturer&#39;s branded software, ads any value whatsoever.

If he&#39;s abruptly stepping down as HP CEO, that really upsets the apple cart. And that&#39;s gotta be tanking HP stock, at least in the short term.

Seriously, common professional courtesy is to at least offer a few weeks transition. For a CEO, a few months is more typical.

Forgot what year it was there for a second. THREE YEARS. Our weapons are fear, surprise, and...

If this were normal software I would agree with you, but it&#39;s not. This is Adobe software. Adobe is infamously known for doing incredibly dumb shit in the name of &quot;support&quot; such as ring fencing installation of software to specific Windows versions without any good compatibility reason.

There&#39;s no reason to think Animate won&#39;t just fail to install completely arbitrarily on some upcoming Windows release. It has happened in the past as anyone who ever decided to try a Windows beta build and found they couldn&#39;t

&quot;There&#39;s no reason to think Animate won&#39;t just fail to install completely arbitrarily on some upcoming Windows release.&quot;

So they may have to keep old windows around if they want to use this old program. Or they could switch to something from a less terrible company. They have some years of support before they have to do that. Adobe might even change their mind by then.

If you cannot &quot;pivot&quot; away from Flash in FOUR YEARS then you deserve to fail.No one deserves to fail because they guessed wrong and built some critical bit of their infrastructure on what would turn out to be an abandoned product.

Adobe has a history of arbitrarily ring-fencing applications to specific windows versions. Its a local application which means that what you have today will function with the build of Windows you have today. That may not be the case next year where you may find shit just fails to install with an error saying it&#39;s not compatible with your version of Windows. Adobe has a history of this dumbfuckery.

while changing software, they also train the whole company on GIMP instead of PhotoshopGIMP is not an alternative to Adobe AnimateI read it as a not-only-but-also construction: &quot;while changing [animation] software [from Adobe Animate to something else], they also train the whole company on GIMP instead of Photoshop.&quot; In other words, Adobe&#39;s former customers would be using not only Synfig Studio to replace Animate but also GIMP to replace Photoshop.

Daddy doesn&#39;t get a yacht for his yacht&#39;s service yacht for less than 2.00 billion.

I have tried using this shit. The product bugs, updates that often broke things and it being somehow plus the software was so bad it just made you more angry at Adobe in whole new ways.

It&#39;s like my memories of Flash were wrong because this made me think it really sucked... you expect newer software to NOT to be so bad it not only makes you hate it but it also kills positive memories of past versions as well!

Gimp is closer to Photoshop since the last major version, but it&#39;s still very very far away in every category and the only way it&#39;s superior is you don&#39;t have to deal with Adobe. That&#39;s not nothing but it&#39;s also not enough.

In particular I was hoping that the interface would improve when they introduced non-destructive editing, but no. It&#39;s still grossly harder to do things which have been simple in Photoshop since early days.

Trough out the 2000nds I did professional rich client development with Flash & ActionScript. One of my last gigs was as a senior FE dev building a large non-trivial Flash client for a commercial internet/web game. The project closed down after 2 million Euros were spent because FakeB00k changed the TOS and closed up their platform for Zynga and FarmVille/CityVille. Shortly after the official iOS blocking/prevention of Flash became a widespread fact and Adobe completely dropped the ball on utilizing Flas

Anybody burned by this insanely short announcement delay will try to stay away from Adobe now. Long-term assured tool availability is critical for professional work.

The quickest way is to cheat your way to the top. But youth and inexperience leads to a failure to sufficiently cover your tracks and too few powerful connections in industry and government to protect yourself. And ideally a person enters into wealth in childhood so that their parents and grandparents would have already taken care of these things.

By now, the Forbes 30 Under 30 list has become more than a little notorious for the amount of entrants who go on to be charged with fraudHave there really been that many frauds? Gemini found 7 former winners who have been charged with fraud (5 found guilty with 2 cases ongoing) out of 420 members. When you include other issues like sex offenses and workplace bullying it goes up to 15.

Yes, the rest of the business world is way better than that. I&#39;ve worked with literally thousands of people who were never charged with a crime for their work.

Rename it to &quot;Forbes 30 (years to life) Under 30&quot; and then you really have something

On Sept. 15, my family and I arrived for our routine Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-in appointment at the New York City immigration courthouse. My 6-year-old daughter was wearing her school uniform and her backpack. My husband and I planned to drop her off at school afterward.

Instead, the three of us were arrested and detained.

ICE officials held us at the courthouse all day with no food before transferring us to temporary housing for the night. At around 3 the next morning, officers woke us and put us on a commercial flight. Against our will, we were flown across the country to the family detention center in Dilley, Texas. The next two months we spent there were a living nightmare.

When my family and I had fled Colombia in October 2022, we believed that the United States would be a place of refuge. Back home, we had been targeted by an armed guerrilla group—the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia—and over time, the death threats and physical violence became impossible to hide from. We had no choice but to flee for our lives.

On our way to the U.S., armed smugglers confined my daughter and me in a guarded safe house for days. I was forced to cook and clean for them, along with the other women. I was warned to watch my daughter closely so she would not be kidnapped. Only after being passed between multiple vehicles and handlers were we finally able to cross the border in November 2022.

After we arrived in the United States, we built a new life in Queens, New York. My daughter started school. She enjoyed art class and adored her teacher. She loved our cat. She was happy.

We applied for asylum. We were denied. But the dangers we faced in Colombia had not ended. From abroad, we learned that my husband was still receiving threats.

Because of my experience in Mexico, we then filed an application for a T visa, a form of humanitarian protection for victims of human trafficking. While that application was pending, we continued to comply with immigration authorities because we believed that following the law mattered.

That is why, even after being warned that attending our Sept. 15 check-in could lead to detention, we went anyway. But our compliance did not matter to ICE.

After we were taken to the Dilley detention center, my husband was held in a separate area from my daughter and me. Starting the first day, officers began using family separation as a threat. We were told that if we refused deportation, we would be fined $1,000 a day. We were warned that if we continued to resist deportation in any way, my husband and I could face criminal charges and our daughter could be taken from us. The officers also threatened to put us all on separate deportation flights.

The conditions at the facility only intensified the horror. People were constantly sick. Bathrooms were filthy. The food was often inedible, and the water was discolored. My daughter began losing weight because she could not eat.

Every Wednesday, deportation flights left for Colombia. Every Wednesday, we waited in fear for our names to be called. Officers unsuccessfully tried to deport us twice.

The constant threats took a toll on my health. I began experiencing regular panic attacks driven by the fear that my family would be separated or deported. I also suffer from chronic migraines, which worsened over time because the facility would not provide the medication I needed. I lived for weeks with steady pain, fainting spells, nosebleeds, and vision changes that made it difficult to function.

My daughter’s health deteriorated even faster.

At Dilley, she went from full-time school to just one hour of instruction a day. She contracted a cough, which only got worse. She cried at night and asked when we would go back to our apartment in New York. She asked about her teacher and our cat every day. My daughter was once an extroverted, healthy, and happy first grader. But at Dilley, she regressed behaviorally, wetting herself after years without accidents and begging to breastfeed again despite being 6 years old. When we sought mental health care, a psychiatrist blamed me for her distress and accused me of poor parenting.

A facility staff member accidentally struck her eye with a mop. Blood came from her eye. At the medical center, the injury was falsely recorded as a fall. Despite my daughter’s continued complaints of blurred vision, light sensitivity, and hearing problems, doctors dismissed us.

After over a month of delays, an ophthalmologist who evaluated my daughter warned that she may have suffered trauma to her eye and needed further evaluation, as well as a referral to an ENT specialist because the injury could also be affecting her hearing. My husband and I repeatedly begged the facility to provide this care, but officers insisted that it was not their responsibility—even though the injury had been caused by a staff member.

In the days before our deportation, my husband and daughter began experiencing stomach illnesses. Both suffered from vomiting and diarrhea. My husband was placed in the medical unit. He was pale and visibly unwell. For a moment, I believed that because he was so sick, ICE would not deport us.

On Wednesday, Nov. 12, ICE officers entered our room and ordered us to pack, saying we were leaving that day. My husband was taken out of the medical unit to be deported. My daughter was still coughing and vomiting. When I explained that they were too sick to travel, the agents accused me of inventing my husband’s illness, refused to let me call our lawyers, and denied my request to see a doctor. Despite my daughter’s untreated eye injury and serious cough, the officers insisted she was fine and said her health was not their responsibility.

Nearly 10 ICE agents with chains and handcuffs surrounded us and cautioned that we could leave “the easy way or the hard way.” My daughter was terrified. When she saw the chains, she screamed and cried. Officers again refused to let us contact our lawyers. There was no real choice but to comply.

They put us on a bus, along with one other woman, to transport us to Louisiana for our deportation flight. About an hour into the drive, the bus stopped, and dozens of men in chains and handcuffs got on, along with another handcuffed woman, who looked at my child and asked aloud how anyone could allow a little girl to witness this. My daughter began to cry again.

The bus ride to Louisiana was over 18 hours. We were not able to use the bathroom the entire time. At 9 a.m., while we were still on the bus, I fainted and hit my head. After I begged for medical help, the paramedic who evaluated me suggested I go to a medical center. But ICE officers refused, telling me I had no right to see a doctor.

My daughter also began to vomit on the bus that morning. For hours, despite our requests, the officers refused to give her food or water.

She received no food or water until later that afternoon, on our flight back to Colombia. I had pleaded with the officers not to put us on the plane, explaining that the pressure would worsen our health conditions, but they did not care.

My daughter vomited the entire flight. When we landed in Bogotá, she was still vomiting and coughing and was severely dehydrated. She wanted to know why we were not in New York, but I had no answers—only fear.

Today we live in hiding in Colombia. Armed groups still control our region. We cannot safely access medical care.

My daughter continues to suffer from serious vision and hearing problems but has not been able to see a specialist. Her stomach issues also have not improved, and a doctor in Colombia has diagnosed her with a severe bacterial infection. I continue to suffer from chronic migraines and anxiety, without medication. My husband and I are terrified every day that we will be murdered and our daughter will be kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.

My daughter is only 6 years old. She should not know chains or handcuffs or the terror of her family being torn apart. She should never have been swept off the streets of New York or locked in a detention facility for two months. She should be in school in the United States, playing with her friends and receiving the medical care she needs.

Instead, ICE treated us like animals. Officers intimidated, restrained, and deported us without regard for our humanity. Our basic rights were violated, with no accountability or justice. My daughter is traumatized and cries every day.

We don’t know what our future will hold. But we are grateful for the time we had in America, and we will keep fighting for a better future for our daughter.

There is a uniquely American kink that holds that what really matters in terms of presidential policies and conduct is the question of whether something is “legal” as opposed to moral. In an essay for the Boston Review headlined “The Moral Stupefaction of the American Public,” professor Joseph Margulies argues that if conduct is deemed permissible simply because a mediocre law student can pen a mediocre legal memo justifying it, the country is in far deeper trouble than it presently comprehends. On this week’s Amicus podcast, he explained to Dahlia Lithwick that the inclination to fetishize that which can be justified legally has a way of opening the door to atrocities that cannot be tolerated. Their conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: In your article, you draw out the fact that lawyers are extremely uneasy about invoking the language of morality, because morality is either too malleable or just sanctimonious and annoying. I think your point is that the law—disaggregated from morality—becomes an endless series of hollow CYA memos to be deployed by any given administration to justify absolutely anything from torture at Gitmo to blowing up fishing vessels in the Caribbean?

Joseph Margulies: Yes. And that which is taking place in Minneapolis—and not simply in Minneapolis, but most pointedly in Minneapolis—ought not be framed as: “Is that lawful?” It ought to be framed as: “Is that right?” Are we going to allow a masked, heavily armed secret police force to march through the city all but unchecked, and checked only by the voluntary surveillance—to the extent they are checked—by plain citizens at their peril? A secret police force that, at least it appears at this point, enjoys absolute impunity?

Those are profoundly moral questions. Those are moral judgements. Have we lost the capacity to say this is simply wrong? That this is a grotesque obscenity and cannot be allowed to continue?

This is no longer simply a question of, “Is it a violation of the 10th Amendment?” That’s what they’re litigating in front of Judge Menendez. Or, “Is ICE violating judicial orders?” Answer: “Yes, there’s 96 of them.” The lawyers are fighting that out. Stop it. This is a horrible, grotesque, and ongoing wrong, and that’s the level at which we need to engage.

Why is it that we substitute what I call our legal voice for our moral voice? This is a country that purports to worship, and I use that term advisedly, the rule of law. We tend to believe that legality establishes rightness, establishes legitimacy. So when a question is posed: “Can they do that?” The answer is usually given in terms of: “Yes, of course, it’s all perfectly legal.” Over time, we lose the capacity to render moral objections, even when what is being done is unspeakably grotesque, because we simply don’t engage these muscles.

I read your piece with my lawyer glasses on, and two objections arose for me. One is that morality, as you and I both know, is not just subjective and inchoate, morality was also used to justify segregation—the anti-miscegenation laws were rooted in “morality.” That means, in a good sense, that morality evolves—that which was considered immoral is now urgently moral. But also, there can’t be any broad agreement about what is moral. What we like about the law, particularly in America, is the story we tell about the Framers creating a church of the law, then creating a religious document that is the Constitution, and then agreeing on certain principles that are legal and not moral. When I read your piece, while I agreed emphatically with it, I found myself getting stuck on the point of: How are we ever going to come to some kind of consensus or scientific agreement about what is moral? How should we think about the fact that what is moral today is egregiously immoral in 10 years’ time?

The myth is that by writing it down in a Constitution, we will achieve some consensus, and the myth is that that consensus will be desirable, that it will be reflective of society’s best impulses. You have an argument, I have an argument, and the debate goes no further. Lawyers seem to disagree, but lawyers in the Justice Department, or lawyers in the Trump administration or the Bush administration before that, say: “We have our document that says this is good,” and that’s just going to have to be enough. Unfortunately, if you engage only in “law-speak,” you’re done. You have nothing to say, unless you want to hold up an opposing memo.

The best example of this is the memos that John Yoo wrote that purported to justify torture. The Supreme Court calls it torture. Let’s just call it that. What we are talking about is strapping a person, with his head lowered on an inclined board, with his face covered, and then pouring water up his nose and down his throat, and holding him there until he breathes water, to bring him within sight of his own death. That is the purpose of waterboarding. You are deliberately bringing him within sight, so that he believes that he is about to die. It’s that moment of sheer terror. That’s what waterboarding is. And doing it over, and over, and over again, 86 times in my client’s case. Well, according to those memos, not only is it not torture, it’s not illegal. “I have a document that says so!”

If they can always write that, and they can always write that, then this pretense, this myth that the law will settle disputes in a fair and neutral way, is just gobbledygook and we shouldn’t pretend otherwise. And those lawyers who, or those law students who think, “I went into the law because it’s certain, it’s definite”—well, get over yourself.

I’m hearing what feels like your peak frustration with the “John Yoo special”: As long as it’s not organ failure, it’s not torture. The critique I’m hearing here is that any lawyer, any 1L with a Westlaw account, could magic up a document to justify anything. But the flip of it, of course, is that we are living in a moment where it’s really essential to know what is legal. And as you’re noting, judges around the country are drawing very firm lines in the sand and saying, “No! That’s unlawful, that’s illegal.” In other words, the thing that you are most worried about is also the thing that is saving us.

We have had district court judges and appellate court judges around the country, out on the hustings, facing death threats, and threats of impeachment, but nonetheless very clearly saying, “No. What you’re doing is unlawful.” So you’re not saying that that is a pointless exercise, that the pushback is futile because none of this has meaning. You’re saying something subtler than that. Right?

When you are trying to bend the will of society to reflect a different reality, trying to achieve a different vision for the world, the law has a role. Going into court, going to Congress, going to your statehouses—law has a role. But what we also know from decades of experience is that the law cannot play its role alone. You must have a popular movement behind it, that speaks in a moral voice, and leverages that moral voice, then lawyers who work with that community can translate that moral voice into a set of legal claims. What matters is the existence of that moral claim, that moral voice. If all you had in Minneapolis were a bunch of lawyers going into court and saying, “This violates the 10th Amendment!” you would not get whatever movement we are going to have. What we are seeing is because there are tens of thousands of people, ordinary citizens, ordinary folks who do not think of themselves as rabble-rousers or activists, who are appalled and who are waking up and are registering this in their moral voice: I will not allow this to happen. This is wrong and I’m gonna brave 20-below weather.

I love what you’re saying, because you are not, in fact, unbraiding the law from morality. You’re actually tethering them more closely together.

I don’t know what the folks who are out there in Minneapolis are thinking exactly. Whether they are defending legal rights or a thing they call the Fourth Amendment or the First Amendment. I don’t know whether they can recite the language of the Fourth Amendment. I don’t know whether some of them are making purely moral claims, that “This is an obscenity, and I’m not going to let this happen. You are murdering my neighbors. You are shooting my friends in the back. I’m not going to let you do that.” There may be some combination of both legal and moral claims here, because we are trained to think in legal terms. They may think: “I’m not going to let you do that, and the way I’m going to keep that from happening is to protest, and I’ve got a First Amendment right to protest.” We reflexively, unfortunately, think in these kinds of legal terms, but my point in this piece is that we let the dominance of law-speak gradually silence our moral voice.

You had another chillingly prescient piece in the Boston Review back in September of 2021, which feels like a million years ago. The title of the piece was “9/11 Forever.” The point was that our failure to reckon with the legacy of what happened to the law after 9/11 is absolutely the reason we are living in the slipstream of that today. If we had not been willing to tolerate the things we did to the law after 9/11 in the name of safety, or national security, what we tolerated in terms of torture and cruelty, and surveillance, and the conception of privacy that we gave away, and border security as this existential question about national survival. You wrote about all of those things as the price we were willing to pay to feel safe at the time. And a key element of that architecture was the notion that we were in a “war.” That the war on terror hoovered up the language of war instead of crime, and moved us into a world where as long as you could call it a “war,” everything would be OK. That’s the move?

That’s the move. And now in the Trump administration they have decided to declare war, which is just a rhetorical step, against an endless stream of “others.” None of the real horrors that took place post- 9/11, and those taking place now, could have been possible without a thorough embrace of demonization, without a willingness to cast some people outside the sphere of human regard. “We can do what we want with that person because they are not us. I do not see them in me. I do not see myself in them. ” That’s what demonization is. That’s the first move.

What the Bush administration did so well is to begin with that and then articulate a legal framework to justify it. Law-speak that says, “We don’t need to stop with this demonizing language. That can exist as the context, the background, but given that we all recognize that those who perpetrated this are not us and are monsters, we are allowed to do certain things, and here’s the law that shows it’s OK.”

Nobody is as good at demonizing as Donald Trump. He is the master of it. This is his worldview. “Those who are opposed to me are subhuman. They are not of my species.” Once you embrace the idea that there is a category of people whose existence threatens who I am, and that I can do whatever I want with them, and I call that war, or I call that terrorism—it doesn’t really matter what you call it, but you can always find a lawyer to cloak it in law. That’s the easiest part. The hard part is convincing people that the Mexican immigrant who has been your neighbor for 40 years and who makes your economy run, convincing people that that person is a monster. That’s the hard part, and that’s where his success is. And that’s 9/11 forever. That’s what they’ve achieved. The more you do this, the easier it gets. The more often you repeat this, the easier it becomes.

Not every example of this ends in the same place, but we all know where that dark alley ends. That dark alley ends in all the most vicious pogroms and genocides and holocausts that the world has ever known. They all start with this move. And this is what Trump is doing and he’s really good at it. And he’s got a lot of people who agree.

President Donald Trump on Monday escalated his rhetoric against the American electoral system, telling his former FBI deputy director and serial podcaster Dan Bongino that he wants to “nationalize” American elections in 15 “crooked” states. “These people were brought to our country to vote, and they vote illegally,” Trump said. “And it’s amazing the Republicans aren’t tougher on it. The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over, we should take over the voting in at least 15 places.’ ” I too used to think we should nationalize our elections, though not for the insane reasons Donald Trump offers. It is Trump himself who convinced me that I was wrong.

American elections are hyperdecentralized, as they are run on the state, and mostly county, level. States have ultimate responsibility for voter registration rolls, the kind of machinery used to conduct balloting, the rules for contesting elections, laws prescribing how candidates qualify to appear on the ballot, and much more. Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution provides that states, through their legislatures, get to set the times, places, and manners of conducting congressional elections, “but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.” Congress sometimes exercises that power to override state rules. For example, a federal statute requires that members of Congress are elected from single-member districts, not from larger districts where multiple members of Congress could be elected.

Given that authority in what is known as the “elections clause” of the Constitution, Congress could do much more to nationalize elections, for example setting uniform rules for voter registration, the approval of voting machinery, and potentially much more. For a long time I thought Congress should use that power to set up a system of national nonpartisan election administration. Indeed, that was the central argument in my 2012 book, The Voting Wars.

If you look around the world at advanced democracies from Australia to Canada, they have an independent governmental body in charge all national elections. The body imposes uniform standards for registration, ballot access, voting machinery, and much more. One can walk into a polling place in Ottawa or Vancouver and have virtually the same experience.

These nonpartisan election administrators are headed by a civil servant or group that does not answer to the government. They and their workers have allegiance to the integrity of the election system, not to any political actor. In contrast, in the United States partisan actors play important roles in our election process, such as secretaries of state who run for office as Democrats or Republicans.

In The Voting Wars, I argued that by joining other advanced democracies we could decrease the amount of partisan fighting and litigation over election rules, increase the competence of election administration, and assure we have a system run with integrity and fair access to voting.

Donald Trump has caused me to abandon this argument. As I wrote in the New York Times last summer, when the president tried to impose his authority over various aspects of American elections via an executive order: “What I had not factored into my thinking was that centralizing power over elections within the federal government could be dangerous in the hands of a president not committed to democratic principles.” At this point, American democracy is too weak and fragile to have centralized power over elections in the hands of a federal government that could be coerced or coopted by a president hell-bent, like Trump, on election subversion. Courts have ruled that parts of Trump’s executive order are unconstitutional because the president has no role to play in the administration of elections.

Trump’s comments on nationalizing elections ironically prove the point that we should not nationalize elections. He apparently wants to target the administration at blue states, doing who-knows-what to make it harder for people to vote for Democrats. He desperately fears a Congress controlled by Democrats that could check his and his administration’s power. As he did in 2020, when he unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the results of the fair presidential election that he lost to Joe Biden, Trump hangs it all on voter fraud. His comments to Bongino about noncitizens voting, just like his comments about mail-in balloting, show Trump as either a liar or delusional. The amount of election fraud of this type is extremely rare. We know it because states, including red ones like Georgia—where Trump’s administration recently raided election offices in a serious threat to the 2026 vote—have gone hunting for fraud and found very little.

The Supreme Court provides another reason for not nationalizing our elections. The court could soon fully embrace that “unitary executive” theory that there can be no exercise of executive power by the federal government that ultimately does not report to the president. (It’s an argument with an exception likely to be applied to the United States Federal Reserve, in order to protect the value of the justices’ 401(k)s.) The unitary executive theory, if adopted, would mean that presidential control over an election body might be constitutionally required. The Trump experience shows why that would be far too risky.

We should now look to states to step up the competence, integrity, and accessibility of their election systems. They serve as the front line against election subversion. Diffusion of power in the states makes it much harder for Trump to mess with the midterm elections. Whether or not the Framers intended it, our messy, decentralized, partly partisan, uneven system of administering elections turns out to be the best bulwark against would-be authoritarian presidents.

On Monday, the New York Times reported a bizarre and shocking update to news of an FBI raid last week on a Georgia election office: It turns out that immediately after the federal raid, the FBI officers involved spoke directly with President Donald Trump. To say that this is unusual would be an understatement—it is without precedent. It has long been known that the 2020 election in Georgia is a personal obsession of Trump’s, but the extent to which he is actively, openly, and personally meddling in the state’s elections system is still surprising and new. One big question looming over this entire episode, though, is why—of all the states where Trump falsely claimed there was fraud in 2020—has Georgia become ground zero for the president ahead of the 2026 midterms that election experts feel are potentially threatened by Trump’s latest actions? We think we have a few answers.

Those answers have to do as much with 2026 as they do with 2020. And, perhaps surprisingly, a big motivation for Trump’s assault on Georgia’s election infrastructure now has as much to do with the Republican primaries in the state as with November’s general election. Allow me to explain.

Georgia’s race for governor is considered a toss-up, though Republicans have consistently held the job since 2002. Polling has shown the top Republican contenders are Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones. Trump has endorsed Jones, who served as a fake elector in 2020 and was tied up in Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ election interference investigation, which charged Trump and several co-conspirators with a criminal conspiracy to steal Georgia’s 2020 election. Jones has focused his campaign on attacking Raffensperger over that election. Raffensperger, as you may recall, has been a longtime personal target of Trump’s after a 2021 phone call with the president in which he was asked to “find” 11,780 votes for Trump in order to flip the state’s 2020 election results.

In order to understand how the race between Rafensperger and Jones relates to the FBI’s raid on Fulton County, it’s necessary to recognize that Georgia’s voting system has been mired in controversy for nearly a decade. Back in 2017, a group of Georgia voters and the Coalition for Good Governance sued the state over its use of Dominion Voting Systems’ electronic ballot-marking devices. These devices are like a tablet and don’t create a paper copy of a voter’s ballot selections; instead they print a paper QR code that can be scanned to see a digital image of a ballot. This, the lawsuit alleged, opens up serious security vulnerabilities that can not only be hacked, but also make it nearly impossible to verify the software accurately recorded a voter’s ballot. When the lawsuit eventually went to trial in 2024, a computer scientist demonstrated live, in court, how he was able to rig Dominion’s voting tablet by rewriting its code and printing out as many ballots as he wanted. In a hypothetical election, the hacking was successful in flipping the outcome of a race.

During that trial, the plaintiffs also pointed to Georgia’s Coffee County data breach that occurred in 2021, where pro-Trump activists physically entered the small, rural county’s election office and copied election system software. A lawyer for the Coalition for Good Governance claimed at the time that the compromised software was not isolated to Coffee County, and that hackers could have access to voting software used in all 159 counties in Georgia. Plus in 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, under the Biden administration, also advised that Dominion’s electronic ballot-casting software presents security vulnerabilities. None of this validated Trump’s phony claims of election fraud in 2020, but it does make the state’s election systems more vulnerable to the sort of episode we witnessed last week.

Ultimately, the Coalition for Good Governance’s 2017 lawsuit failed, with a judge dismissing it just last year, partly because there wasn’t evidence to suggest there had actually been a successful hack of Georgia’s voting software and the state Legislature appeared to have remedied some of the security concerns the lawsuit raised. For instance, the Georgia Legislature approved a bill that would replace its previous QR code system with a readable text to verify a voter’s ballot entry. The new law is supposed to take effect July 1, 2026, though during a series of budget hearings last month, Georgia lawmakers didn’t appropriate any state dollars to implement the change. No budget was allocated to upgrade Georgia’s voting system software either, which would have patched any security holes.

While all of these legal challenges questioned the integrity of Georgia’s voting systems, Raffensperger consistently affirmed his state’s 2020 election results were accurate. His office conducted three separate recounts, including a statewide audit that manually re-tallied every single vote cast, plus another recount requested by the Trump campaign. In the end, Gov. Brian Kemp certified his state’s election results for Biden, though the president has continued to insist he is the rightful winner. As part of this vendetta, Trump even made Kemp and Raffensperger prime targets during the 2022 elections, trying to inspire his MAGA base to vote them both out of office. At the time, he failed miserably.

Now, though, it seems that Trump has found a new way to try to punish Raffensperger. The Trump administration is undoubtedly going to use the baggage surrounding Georgia’s voting system to cast doubt on its 2026 elections and possibly beyond, with the FBI’s recent raid evidence that this is already underway. Georgia provides a three-for-one, from the Trump perspective: He gets to again question the legitimacy of the 2020 election; he gets to again cast blame on Raffensperger, his 2020 antagonist in the state; and he gets to potentially meddle with an election which he desperately wants Raffensperger to lose.

The day after FBI agents raided Fulton County’s election office last week, officials there said federal agents took over 700 boxes of physical voter records, while officials were kept out of the room as it was happening. Fulton County Commission Chair Robb Pitts told reporters he had no clue what the FBI was going to do with all the information it seized. “I don’t know where they are, I don’t know who has them, I don’t know what they’re doing with it,” Pitts said. “I have no clue. I could use my imagination.”

It’s no small stretch of the imagination to foresee Trump’s FBI manipulating Fulton County’s voting records to fit his agenda. “What Trump is trying to do is create a narrative that you can’t trust the voting system in Georgia,” Marilyn Marks, vice president and executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, told Slate. “He’s going to be able to show these ballots that say they were counted wrong and they were cheated, and all of that: ‘You can’t trust Georgia’s voting system, therefore the feds have to come in and help control the voting system.’ ”

Right now Trump is beginning his attack on Georgia’s voting system by inserting federal action, knowing that in a few short months, the state will be holding its gubernatorial primary election on May 19. If Raffensperger secures a win, the White House will be on fertile ground to dispute the results of his election, leveraging information obtained from the FBI’s raid, plus the nearly decade-long legal challenges Georgia’s voting system has faced.

Another added benefit to Trump’s scheme is the threat to the state’s critical U.S. Senate race, where Democrat Jon Ossoff is running for reelection. Ossoff’s narrow win in a 2021 runoff gave Senate Democrats the slimmest majority at the start of Joe Biden’s presidency, while Trump took the brunt of the blame for the GOP defeat at the time. Constantly attacking the integrity of the 2020 election seemed to put voters off.

What ends up shaking out in Georgia remains to be seen, but it’s fair to say that the president is signaling that he is willing to use all the powers of the U.S. government to satisfy his vendetta against those he believes have wronged him. During his speech in Davos, Switzerland, last month, Trump ominously announced that “people will soon be prosecuted for what they did,” while again insisting that the 2020 presidential election he lost was rigged. And just this week, Trump, while speaking on a podcast hosted by former U.S. Deputy Director of the FBI Dan Bongino, openly admitted that he believes Republicans “ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that I won that show I didn’t win. You’re gonna see something in Georgia.”

As someone deeply familiar with the inner workings of Trump’s mind, former special counsel Jack Smith, said during his Congressional testimony last month, Georgia was “ground zero” for the president’s alleged criminal misconduct just five years ago. It could be so again this November.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Baddies are exploiting a critical bug in React Native&#39;s Metro development server to deliver malware to both Windows and Linux machines, and yet the in-the-wild attacks still haven&#39;t received the &quot;broad public acknowledgement&quot; that they should, according to security researchers.

The vulnerability affects the React Native Community command line tool, a very popular npm package with nearly 2.5 million weekly downloads. React Native is a development tool created by Meta that allows users to build mobile applications for iOS and Android using JavaScript and React.

The flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-11953, arises because the Metro development server started by the React Native Community command line tool exposes an endpoint vulnerable to OS command injection. This allows unauthenticated network attackers to send a POST request to the server and run malicious executables. Similarly, on Windows machines, miscreants can abuse the security hole to execute arbitrary shell commands with fully controlled arguments.

JFrog researchers discovered the vulnerability and disclosed it in early November after Meta issued a fix. The research team assigned it a critical, 9.8 CVSS severity rating, meaning it&#39;s almost as bad as bugs get.

Bug hunters wasted no time publishing proof-of-concept exploits on GitHub, with one such POC being published the same day as the public bug disclosure.

&quot;VulnCheck observed exploitation attempts as early as December, well before public discussion framed CVE-2025-11953 as anything more than a theoretical risk,&quot; VulnCheck CTO Jacob Baines told The Register. &quot;This demonstrates how quickly attackers can act once scanning becomes viable, and why developer tooling - widespread, inconsistently monitored, and often not treated as production-grade - represents a particularly attractive early target.&quot;

In a Tuesday blog, Baines said the bug isn&#39;t receiving the attention it deserves.

&quot;Now, more than a month after initial exploitation in the wild, that activity has yet to see broad public acknowledgment, and EPSS [the Exploit Prediction Scoring System] continues to assign a low exploitation probability of 0.00405. This gap between observed exploitation and wider recognition matters, particularly for vulnerabilities that are easy to exploit and, as internet-wide search data shows, exposed on the public internet,&quot; he wrote.

Baines said the first wave of exploitation began in December, with more attacks delivering the same payloads observed on January 4 and January 21.

These attacks used a multi-stage PowerShell-based loader delivered through cmd.exe, and the code disabled Microsoft Defender protections before retrieving and running the payload: a Rust-based binary with anti-analysis features, including runtime checks to help avoid detection via static inspection.

&quot;The deliberate disabling of Microsoft Defender protections before payload retrieval indicates the attacker anticipated the presence of endpoint security controls and incorporated evasion measures into the initial execution flow,&quot; Baines wrote in a Tuesday blog.

The attacks originated from the following IP addresses: 65.109.182.231, 223.6.249.141, and 134.209.69.155, with the &quot;windows&quot; payload hosted at 8.218.43.248:60124, and 47.86.33.195:60130 hosting both a &quot;windows&quot; and &quot;linux&quot; binary. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/nextgen_nuclear_reactors_skip_nepa_reviews/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Department of Energy says advanced nuclear reactor designs - many of which have so far existed mainly at the experimental, testing, or demonstration stage - generally pose limited environmental risk and can qualify for a streamlined environmental review for future projects.

The DoE announced the &quot;categorical exclusion&quot; for advanced nuclear reactors (ANRs) in a Federal Register filing on Monday, establishing a pathway that can allow ANR projects to proceed without a full environmental assessment or environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), provided specific conditions are met. The move follows Trump&#39;s executive orders directing agencies to streamline environmental reviews for nuclear reactors in order to accelerate their deployment.

A categorical exclusion means that a covered category of actions &quot;normally does not significantly affect the quality of the human environment and therefore does not require preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement,&quot; the filing says. In this case, that&#39;s referring to ANRs, which include Generation III+ reactors, small modular reactors, microreactors, and stationary and mobile reactors.

Authorization, siting, construction, operation, reauthorization, and decommissioning of ANRs are all included in the categorical exclusion.

The DoE justified its decision in a written record of support, arguing that safety features of next-generation reactor designs generally limit their potential environmental impact.

&quot;Advanced nuclear reactors have key attributes such as safety features, fuel type, and fission product inventory that limit adverse consequences from releases of radioactive or hazardous material from construction, operation, and decommissioning,&quot; the DoE said in the record of support, while conceding that most advanced reactor designs have yet to move beyond experiments and demonstrations.

&quot;Although past advanced reactor projects have been for solely experimental, testing, and demonstration purposes … these reactors indicate that reactors in this category developed for additional purposes, such as power production and industrial applications, are also appropriate for this categorical exclusion,&quot; the document explained.

The DoE&#39;s move isn&#39;t entirely surprising given Trump&#39;s executive orders cited in the Federal Register publication specifically ask the DoE to establish categorical exclusions for ANRs. Additionally, the DoE reportedly quietly rewrote other nuclear safety documents to streamline reactor projects recently, eliminating hundreds of pages of requirements, loosening groundwater protections, and increasing radiation exposure limits for personnel, among other changes.

Nonetheless, the DoE&#39;s Office of Nuclear Energy told The Register that, contrary to the definition of a categorical exclusion stated in the Federal Register publication, nuclear reactors would still undergo an environmental review under NEPA.

&quot;The U.S. Department of Energy is establishing the potential option to obtain a streamlined approach for advanced nuclear reactors as part of the environmental review performed under NEPA,&quot; a Nuclear Energy spokesperson told us in an email.

&quot;The analysis on each reactor being considered will be informed by previously completed environmental reviews for similar advanced nuclear technologies,&quot; the spokesperson continued. &quot;This methodology is a win for bipartisan supported NEPA reform and will accelerate licensing of advanced reactors while upholding the highest standards of safety and security.&quot;

The Union of Concerned Scientists&#39; nuclear power safety director, Edwin Lyman, disagrees, telling us the DoE&#39;s move cuts corners that will create a public health and environmental safety risk.

&quot;The test reactor designs currently under construction have primarily existed on paper. This lack of real-world experience with the reactors means that they should be subject to more rigorous safety and environmental reviews before they&#39;re built, not less,&quot; Lyman told us. &quot;Any nuclear reactor, no matter how small, no matter how safe it looks on paper, is potentially subject to severe accidents.&quot;

As Lyman noted, most of the ANR designs that the DoE wants to exempt are still in the development phase. Only a single pair of Generation III+ nuclear reactors has been constructed in the US, and those came online in 2023 and 2024, respectively, at the Vogtle nuclear power facility in Georgia.

Small modular reactors, microreactors, and other fantasy generators are still the stuff of dreams. Just one SMR design has cleared US regulatory approval, and none has yet been built and operated, with at least one project already abandoned. Nonetheless, Energy Secretary Chris Wright claims the US will have at least one SMR up and running before the 4th of July in 2026.

Given how far behind the nuclear industry is in deploying reactor designs that are still the stuff of dreams, it&#39;s going to need as many regulatory rewrites as possible. ®

            <h2>Snowflake plugs PostgreSQL into its AI Data Cloud</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/snowflake_postgresql_ai_data/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Snowflake is launching a PostgreSQL database-as-a-service within its AI data environment to place transactional workloads alongside analytics and AI under a single set of governance rules.

PostgreSQL now runs natively in the AI Data Cloud, allowing teams to power apps and AI agents, analyze business performance and trends using the data from their operations, and build recommendations or forecasting systems without the cost and complexity of building data pipelines and managing multiple vendors, the cloud data platform provider said.

“Say you want to build an app on data that is in Snowflake, but if that app doesn&#39;t have a relational OLTP [online transaction processing] database to store the data, they have to go break out of the boundary,&quot; Snowflake EVP of product Christian Kleinerman told The Register. &quot;With the PostgreSQL service, our goal is to provide this secure boundary where, if customers build apps or build agents within that boundary, their data has not left the compliance and regulatory perimeter for Snowflake.”

In addition, the service&#39;s full compatibility with open source PostgreSQL allows organizations to move existing apps onto Snowflake without code changes, according to Snowflake.

The service relies on pg_lake, a set of open source PostgreSQL extensions that allow developers and data engineers to read and write directly to Apache Iceberg tables from PostgreSQL, thereby cutting out the need to extract and move data. Iceberg is an open table format that proponents say lets users bring their preferred analytics engines to their data without moving it. It is widely used and supported across the cloud and data platform ecosystem, including by Snowflake, Google, AWS, and others.

Snowflake claims this would eliminate costly data movement between transactional and analytical systems.

The vendor already had a transactional capability within its platform. Called Unistore, it was announced in 2022, but was not generally available until late 2024. One analyst commented last year that Unistore had attracted little interest.

Kleinerman said Unistore offered low-latency reads and writes, but customers were also saying they wanted a PostgreSQL-compatible service. After looking at a number of options, Snowflake bought Crunchy Data, a PostgreSQL service provider.

IDC research director Devin Pratt said the move helps extend Snowflake beyond analytics into a managed OLTP offering. Online transaction processing handles live application reads and writes, while online analytical processing (OLAP) is used for reporting and analysis. Running both in one environment, he said, supports agentic AI and real-time streaming because agents need continuous access to analytical insight and live transactional data, reducing the delay between data creation and analysis.

But Snowflake was not alone in adopting the strategy. “It reflects a broader trend of vendors pairing operational databases with analytics to support real-time and agentic AI workflows,” Pratt said. Following its acquisition of Neon, which provides a serverless PostgreSQL architecture, Snowflake rival Databricks announced its service Lakebase.

In many cases, with OLTP and OLAP in the same platform, teams can reduce ETL and data duplication and apply more consistent governance and observability across transactional and analytical workloads, Pratt said.

“The value is a more unified operational and analytical stack with consistent management and security,” he said. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On 59 occasions throughout 2025, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) silently tweaked vulnerability notices to reflect their use by ransomware crooks. Experts say that&#39;s a problem.

&quot;Frustrated&quot; by the agency failing to notify defenders when key pieces of intel change, Glenn Thorpe, senior director of security research and detection engineering at GreyNoise, counted the number of missed opportunities to potentially stop ransomware attacks last year.

CISA maintains its Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) catalog and populates it on a near-daily basis with details about the vulnerabilities attackers are exploiting to successfully gain access to victims&#39; networks.

The purpose of the catalog is to identify the most serious vulnerabilities at any given time, and inform defenders, especially those working for federal agencies, about which bugs should be prioritized.

One of the features of the catalog is that it indicates whether or not CISA is aware of a given vulnerability being used by those carrying out ransomware attacks.

Generally seen as the most damaging, infosec pros tend to prioritize the security flaws that could lead to stolen and encrypted files. Previous research has shown that these vulnerabilities are patched 2.5 times faster than those that aren&#39;t associated with ransomware attacks.

The thing is, the rapid speed at which CISA adds these new bugs to the catalog often outpaces defenders. As Thorpe discovered, the bugs CISA adds to the catalog are only known to be exploited by ransomware affiliates after being added, and CISA does not alert techies when its &quot;known ransomware use&quot; indicator switches from &quot;unknown&quot; to &quot;known.&quot;

&quot;When that field flips from &#39;Unknown&#39; to &#39;Known,&#39; CISA is saying: &#39;We have evidence that ransomware operators are now using this vulnerability in their campaigns,&#39;&quot; said Thorpe.

&quot;That&#39;s a material change in your risk posture. Your prioritization calculus should shift. But there&#39;s no alert, no announcement. Just a field change in a JSON file.&quot;

Thorpe&#39;s analysis of the 59 flipped vulnerabilities revealed that the largest share (16) were Microsoft CVEs, while the other common vendors included Ivanti, Fortinet, PANW, and Zimbra.

&quot;Ransomware operators are economic actors after all. They invest in exploit development for platforms with high deployment and high-value access. Firewalls, VPN concentrators, and email servers fit that profile perfectly.&quot;

He also found that more than a third (39 percent) of the bugs confirmed to be used in ransomware campaigns in 2025 were first added to the KEV catalog before 2023. The oldest to flip last year was a bug added 1,353 days prior, while the fastest to flip was in just one day.

Bear in mind: some vulnerabilities are known to be used by ransomware crews at the time of being added, so their &quot;known ransomware use&quot; indicator was always set to &quot;Known,&quot; i.e. they never flipped.

Thorpe went on to say that authentication bypasses and remote code execution flaws were the most likely to flip after being added to the KEV catalog.

GreyNoise has now released an RSS feed to which defenders can subscribe to see when KEV catalog entries&#39; ransomware statuses change.

The feed updates hourly, and is the product of Thorpe&#39;s unrealized hopes of change following a 2024 BSidesLV presentation.

            <h2>Palantir declares itself the guardian of Americans' rights</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/palantir_american_rights/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion Palantir had a whopper of a Q4, showing accelerating revenue growth, beating Wall Street&#39;s profit estimates, and enjoying a share price jump of as much as 11% during pre-market trading on Tuesday before coming back down to earth.

At such a triumphal moment, it was striking that the company was forced on the defensive, not least for its involvement with the controversial US agency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which began in 2011. ICE has drawn criticism for its activities in Minnesota over the last month after its agents shot and killed two American citizens while bystanders captured the events on video.

As it announced its booming financial results, Palantir was prepared. CEO Alex Karp told CNBC: &quot;If you are critical of ICE, you should be out there protesting for more Palantir. Our product, actually, in its core, requires people to conform with Fourth Amendment data protection.&quot;

In fact, Karp had already mapped out this argument in a letter to investors and during a call with financial analysts.

The actual numbers were strong, as Palantir reported Q4 revenue of $1.41 billion, up 70 percent year-on-year. Revenue for calendar 2025 grew 56 percent to hit $4.475 billion. Underlying operating profit for the quarter more than doubled to $798 million.

Palantir&#39;s growth is being driven in part by a boom in government deals. US government revenue for the quarter grew 66 percent year-over-year to $570 million, more than half of its US revenue and more than a third of its total revenue.

On an earnings call, Karp said the company&#39;s software inherently instills the protection of individual rights.

&quot;From the beginning, we have stuck to our very strong values of expanding what we believe is the noble side of the West ... meaning domestic institutions, intelligence institutions [are] essentially taking an incatenation of the Fourth Amendment, which is completely represented by our pipelining, Foundry, and impregnating institutions with it so that every institution that uses our product is doing it within conformity of the law and the ethics of America,&quot; he said.

In a letter prepared for investors, Karp had already laid out these arguments. &quot;It should indeed be uncontroversial that the single most effective means of guarding against incursions into our private lives is to invest in the development of a technical platform that makes possible constraints on government action and investigation through granular permissioning capabilities, to ensure that the state and its agents can see only what ought to be seen, and functional audit logs, to ensnare both external and internal threats.&quot;

&quot;The construction of such a platform, one that reflects our ethical commitments, should, of course, be a rallying cry for progressives and critical thinkers across the political spectrum who profess to be interested in advancing the values of the Fourth Amendment,&quot; he said.

As if aware of the need to pre-empt critics, Karp indulged in what could be described as a political diatribe, full of philosophical references that some may see at odds with any ordinary requirement to promote a software company.

&quot;We have, as a country and perhaps as well a civilization, grown uncertain of what we believe and far too fearful of embracing any degree of cultural specificity in our communal lives, banishing sentiment and belief from the public and corporate spheres under an often-hollow banner of inclusion,&quot; he complained.

Karp lamented that a &quot;common set of values and sentiments&quot; is missing when the focus is on inclusion, as he sees it.

&quot;It seems at times that we have abandoned any hope of patrolling the boundaries of our community, of resisting the superficial appeal of a hollow pluralism, in which all cultures and cultural values are declared by fiat and without reflection equal,&quot; the letter said.

Is he ignorant that some people in Minnesota feel the need to patrol their own communities to protect it from an outside presence, ICE, an entity that boosts Palantir&#39;s top line?

Heaven forbid anyone sees the need to come together to oppose such government actions.

He said: &quot;An uncomfortable fact is that those who are most bearish on their own abilities often turn to organizing politically,&quot; to which one might respond that those who are rich don&#39;t need to.

The CEO&#39;s statements that Palantir is protecting the Fourth Amendment run counter to ICE&#39;s own legal memorandum and what judges in Minnesota have found, which is that ICE has violated the Fourth Amendment during its most recent surge in the state where it deployed 3,000 federal agents into a community normally patrolled by a few hundred police.

On Jan. 15, US District Court judge Jeffrey Bryan ordered the release of a Liberian man after he determined agents violated the Fourth Amendment when they used a battering ram to raid the home he shares with his wife and 9-year old child.

&quot;Although Garrison G. and his wife repeatedly asked the agents to show them a judicial warrant authorizing entry into their home, and the agents stated that they had a warrant, the agents did not produce a judicial warrant. Only after agents forcibly opened the front door and entered the house did they show Garrison G.&#39;s wife any documentation. The document presented was not a judicial warrant,&quot; Bryan wrote in the order releasing the man.

&quot;Respondents&#39; arrest of Garrison G. violated the Fourth Amendment. To arrest him, Respondents forcibly entered Garrison G&#39;s home without his consent and without a judicial warrant. For this Independent reason, Garrison G.&#39;s detention is unlawful, and the Court orders his immediate release.&quot;

Bryan’s ruling upended instructions to agents in the field, which directed that ICE may enter homes without a judicial warrant in cases where the government has a removal order. According to the Associated Press, the memo was signed by the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, and has been in effect since May 12, 2025.

&quot;Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose,&quot; the memo states.

Karp&#39;s detractors might see the most straightforward explanation of his need for philosophical references as well-dressed political chicanery. A few slashes of Occam&#39;s razor reveal that, given the number of assumptions it takes to believe Karp or follow his arguments, it&#39;s more likely he wants to make his investors feel better (and more intellectually superior) about their holdings in his company. That&#39;s smart business, but we could do without the song and dance. ®

            <h2>Azure outages ripple across multiple dependent Microsoft services</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/azure_virtual_machine_outage/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has reported two Azure service wobbles in as many days, including a disruption affecting Virtual Machine management ops yesterday and a Managed Identity for Azure resources outage in East US and West US regions today.

According to Microsoft, today&#39;s Managed Identity for Azure resources issue impacted the East US and West US regions and lasted almost six hours, from 0015 UTC to 0605 UTC. The problem hit when users were trying to create, update, delete, or acquire tokens.

Security vulnerabilities and system downtime often stem from the manual management of secrets and certificates. Managed Identity for Azure resources is intended to removes the burden of credential management from developers.

The outage, which has been mitigated, &quot;impacted dependent services such as Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Databricks, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Kubernetes Service, Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure Chaos Studio, Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Servers, Azure Container Apps, and Azure AI Video Indexer.&quot; So rather a lot.

The blackout followed hot on the heels of another, where service management operations for virtual machines resulted in error notifications. Microsoft gave the example of &quot;create, delete, update, scaling, start, stop.&quot;

As with this morning&#39;s downtime, yesterday&#39;s problem was exacerbated because services had dependencies on these operations, including Azure Arc Enabled Servers, Azure Batch, Azure Cache for Redis, Azure Container Apps, Azure DevOps (ADO), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Backup, Azure Load Testing, Azure Firewall, Azure Search, Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS), and GitHub.

Microsoft acknowledged the issue last night at 1946 UTC but did not provide a timeline for mitigation. The Register asked for more details and will update this piece should the company respond.

GitHub noted degraded performance for Actions at 1903 UTC, and it took until 0056 UTC on February 3 for the code shack to state that the incident was resolved.

As for what caused the virtual machine outage, Microsoft said: &quot;We identified the root cause as a configuration change that unintentionally restricted public access to certain Microsoft‑managed storage accounts used to host virtual machine extension packages.&quot;

Yes, Microsoft made a configuration change that inadvertently broke things for developers in multiple regions. Those same developers would likely have some advice for Microsoft on testing changes before deploying to production.

The issues highlight the interdependencies between cloud services. A faulty configuration change in one place can result in a cascade of problems elsewhere. ®

Developers can use Anthropic’s Claude Agent and OpenAI’s Codex to take action in Xcode on their behalf.

Apple is building OpenAI and Anthropic’s AI-powered coding agents directly into Xcode. New integrations in Xcode 26.3 will give developers the ability to call upon Anthropic’s Claude Agent and OpenAI’s Codex to write and edit code, update project settings, search documentation, and more.

Xcode is the software developers can use to create and test apps for the iPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. Both Claude and ChatGPT were previously available inside Xcode, but this latest update will allow AI agents to take action inside the app, rather than just provide coding assistance.

Apple is also making Xcode available through the Model Context Protocol, an open-source standard that will enable developers to plug other AI tools into the app.

The news of Apple’s Xcode update comes just one day after OpenAI launched its AI-powered Codex app on Mac, which lets developers write code alongside a team of AI agents. Apple says Xcode 26.3 will be available to members of the Apple Developer Program starting today, “with a release coming soon on the App Store.”

Apple’s latest laptops are all receiving some kind of discount right now, as is the Mac Mini.

Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series processors in a wide range of sizes and price points, all of which run the company’s newest operating system, macOS 26. Purchasing a new MacBook can be complicated if you’re trying to figure out what specs you need, but finding a deal on a relatively speedy model is surprisingly easy, especially since Apple increased the starting RAM on several models in late 2024 and hasn’t stopped.

These days, it’s not uncommon to see various MacBooks discounted by up to $800, although the quality of deals fluctuates frequently. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain configurations of older models as Apple continues to move forward with newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store offers a one-year warranty and generally discounts new units by up to 20 percent.

But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.

In March 2025, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a fresh sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like.

The 13- and 15-inch MacBook Airs have both previously received sizable discounts, though there aren’t any notable deals happening right now. That said, you can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, an eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale at Amazon for $849 ($150 off) if you want the midnight model, or around $949 for other color schemes. The lowest price we’ve seen for this model takes $200 off the original cost. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for about $1,049 ($150 off) at Amazon in the midnight color, which is decent but not as good as the $999 sale price that was around for months. Other colors are $50 to $100 more.

In November 2024, Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new in this model is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.

The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View, as well as the optional nano-texture display option.

As of right now, the M4 Pro-equipped MacBook Pro is the only model receiving significant discounts. For example, the 14-inch M4 Pro with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is available at Amazon starting at $1,749.99 ($300 off). It’s a solid discount, even if it’s not the biggest price drop we’ve seen in recent months.

The base 16-inch MacBook Pro, meanwhile, is available with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,239 ($260 off) at Amazon or $2,249 at Best Buy, which is around $120 more than the all-time low we saw during Black Friday.

Apple’s latest revision of the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro adds the M5 processor. The generational leap will be felt most by those who have an older MacBook Pro, not those upgrading from the M4, unless you use specific AI apps that tap into the chip’s new Neural Accelerators. As for other design changes and upgrades to the inside and outside of this MacBook Pro, there really aren’t any major ones to note; in fact, it’s so similar to the M4 model that our reviewer Antonio Di Benedetto had to write “M5” on a sticky note just to be able to tell them apart. That being said, it’s still an amazing laptop, one that’s just now starting to get minor discounts.

The 14.2-inch base model with the M5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is down to $1,449 ($150 off) at Amazon, which is $100 shy of its best price to date. It’s worth picking over the M4 MacBook Pro, especially since that model currently costs more than the newer, better version.

The newest Mac Minis in town are the M4-based models, which arrived in late 2024. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.

Deals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.

In addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.

In the past, we’ve seen the base Mac Mini drop to as low as $469, but right now it’s on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $549 ($50 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $729 ($70 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo. Meanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale for $1,301 ($99 off) at Amazon or $1299 at B&H Photo.

The Grok investigations are growing, as Paris prosecutors summoned Elon Musk and Linda Yaccarino to testify.

A raid on X’s Paris office was carried out by the Paris prosecutor’s cybercrime unit on Tuesday with Europol and French police as part of an ongoing investigation that expanded in July to include Grok. As previously reported by Reuters, Elon Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino were also summoned for hearings in April.

The investigation, which was initially launched last year, is looking into several allegations against X and Grok, including complicity in possession and distribution of child pornography and denial of crimes against humanity (related to Holocaust denial content), along with claims that X was manipulating its algorithm and illegally extracting data.

On Tuesday, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) also announced a separate formal investigation into X and xAI involving Grok and “its potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content.” It joins another ongoing investigation in the UK from Ofcom, which also shared an update on Tuesday stating that it is not currently investigating xAI, but is still “gathering and analysing evidence to determine whether X has broken the law.”

All of the investigations follow a flood of nonconsensual sexualized deepfakes generated by xAI’s Grok that have proliferated across X. The problem has persisted for weeks, despite claims by X that the feature has been restricted.

X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

During the Switch era, Nintendo turned itself into a much more ambitious entertainment company.

Nintendo has had plenty of highs over its few decades in the video game industry. Popularizing home consoles with the NES, introducing new audiences to games through the Wii’s motion controls, and the touchscreen Trojan horse that was the Nintendo DS, to name a few. But often these successes were followed by missteps; the Wii sold 100 million units, while its follow-up, the Wii U, couldn’t even manage a quarter of that. But that precarity looks to change. The Switch is now Nintendo’s best-selling console ever, surpassing the DS with 155 million units sold since its debut in 2017. And over that span Nintendo has transformed itself into a company better insulated against the ever-changing whims of the games industry.

One of the key factors behind the Switch’s success was how it represented a more unified version of Nintendo. In 2013, the company merged its two main game development divisions, which had previously been split into home console and handheld groups. Given how the Switch straddled the line between console and handheld, this made a lot of sense. But it also allowed Nintendo to put the full might of its creative resources behind a single platform. The result was a string of massive hits: games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Super Mario Odyssey all sold upward of 30 million copies.

Just as important, this structure allowed Nintendo to release big games consistently over the Switch’s lifespan. Even as the focus shifted to the next console, the Switch’s final years still included brand-new Zelda and Super Mario games. The structure has also allowed Nintendo to seamlessly continue this success into the launch of the Switch 2, which got off to a very fast start and debuted alongside a brand-new Mario Kart, which was followed by Donkey Kong and Metroid.

But outside of games, which form the core of the company, Nintendo has also used the Switch’s success to steadily branch out in new directions. In 2023, The Super Mario Bros. Movie hit theaters, earned more than $1 billion, and now Nintendo has both a sequel and a live-action Zelda movie on the way. Nintendo opened its first theme park in Japan in 2021, and has since expanded to Hollywood and Florida, with a location in Singapore due up next. The company even opened its own museum in 2024. In essence, Nintendo is building an entertainment empire. Its competition is increasingly the likes of Disney and Netflix in addition to Xbox and PlayStation. “I think people view Nintendo as a gaming company,” Shinya Takahashi, Nintendo’s senior managing executive officer, told me in 2023. “But we have always thought of ourselves as an entertainment company.”

It’s not a completely unique strategy: Just about every video game company is hoping to break out in film and television after the success of projects like The Last of Us, Fallout, and A Minecraft Movie. But in Nintendo’s case, the company seems to understand just how precarious a success like the Switch can be, and it used that success to steadily build itself up into something bigger in a deliberate, concerted way. It’s something Nintendo has tried to do before — see: the company’s ill-fated efforts into mobile gaming — but its resurgence during the Switch era allowed it to approach these ventures with a new level of focus and ambition. This is a company that’s so confident it’s about to release a $100 re-creation of the Virtual Boy, one of its greatest failures.

All of this is to say that the version of Nintendo that launched the Switch in 2017 is very different from the Nintendo that exists now. Its footing is more solid, its future is more clear. And that future involves more than video games. This doesn’t guarantee future success, of course. The Switch 2 may be off to a strong start, but it’s also facing many pressures outside of Nintendo’s control, some of which have led to a world where many game consoles now get more expensive over time.

But the new Switch also doesn’t need to match its predecessor’s success — it just needs to allow Nintendo to keep this momentum going.

Anthropic is working on implementing a fix to bring Claude Code back online.

Anthropic’s Claude AI models experienced a major outage today, impacting products like Claude Code. Developers were seeing a 500 error when trying to use Claude Code, and Anthropic said that it was seeing elevated error rates on its APIs “across all Claude models.”

Anthropic quickly identified the root cause and implemented a fix within around 20 minutes, but developers that rely on the tool were left staring at their screens waiting for the service to come back online. Claude Opus 4.5 also experienced some errors yesterday, and earlier this week Anthropic had to fix purchasing issues for its AI credits system.

It’s unusual to see Claude Code experience a major outage like this, especially as the service is used widely by developers, including Microsoft’s AI teams.

Update, February 3rd: Anthropic has now resolved its Claude API outage.

As The Verge’s resident robot vacuum reviewer, I don’t have a lot of time (or space) in my life for stick vacs, and frankly, the ones I have used have largely disappointed me. Top-heavy, bulky, always getting clogged or running out of battery — they’re so… manual. But then I met PencilVac Fluffycones, Dyson’s new $599 cordless stick vacuum, and it was love at first lift.

The name PencilVac Fluffycones perfectly describes this delightfully overengineered broom. If more vacuums had such whimsical names, my life would be much fuller. It’s very thin and light, like a pencil, and it has fluffy, cone-shaped rollers that glide across floors as if they’re flying.

While I do not recommend buying this as a tool to clean your entire home (it doesn’t clean carpets!), with its slim design and easy maneuverability, I’ve found it to be a great complement to a robot vacuum. The robot can do the hard work of vacuuming and mopping your floors, and this lightweight machine, which sits prettily in a magnetic charging dock, can be on hand for touch-ups and when it’s time to tackle stairs and baseboards.

A superskinny stick vac, Dyson’s PencilVac is an engineering marvel. While it won’t clean your whole house, it’s a simple. stylish option for quick touchups and other small tasks.

Touted by Dyson as “the world’s slimmest vacuum cleaner,” the PencilVac fits all its components into its 1.5-inch-diameter handle, which runs the length of the vacuum. Packed in here are the electronics, the battery, the dustbin, and a tiny 28mm-diameter motor that spins at 140,000 RPM to generate 55 air watts of suction.

This is the same motor as in Dyson’s Supersonic R hair dryer, and the handle is the same width around, so you’re basically using a reverse hair dryer to clean your floors.

Impressively, the PencilVac weighs less than four pounds and, combined with its maneuverability enabled by four caster rollers that allow it to pivot in multiple directions, it’s as easy to handle as a broom or Swiffer. Even my husband, who just had major shoulder surgery, was able to use it to clean the kitchen floor with no issues.

The PencilVac’s other unique selling point is its fluffycones — four fluffy, cone-shaped roller bars in the vacuum’s head. The idea is that long hair should move down the four cones and out from the edge of the vacuum, then be sucked up with a swipe. In practice, this worked fairly well, unless the aforementioned bundle of hair got too thick — in which case, it couldn’t always suck it up.

While the PencilVac looks and moves like a broom, it also kind of vacuums like one. Its suction power is half that of Dyson’s lowest-end cordless stick vacuum, the V8. It does great on dust, small tufts of hair, and lightweight debris like Cheerios and dried oatmeal. But give it anything thicker to tackle, and you’ll be frustrated.

This is why it works well as an add-on to a robot vacuum that regularly sweeps and mops your floors. Judging by Dyson’s press images, it’s also being marketed as a stylish option for those who live in immaculate apartments that are magically mostly spotless.

Unless you live in one of those apartments, I don’t see the PencilVac working as a primary vacuum for cleaning your house, especially if you have any carpets or rugs. But for quick touch-ups and getting dust bunnies off stairs — two areas robot vacuums don’t really do (one not easily, and the other not at all … yet) — it’s a great, albeit expensive, solution.

Less cumbersome than any stick vac I’ve used, it is super easy to use on stairs, and it was simple to find a space for its small, slim dock in a kitchen or bathroom, areas where you might want a high-powered broom on hand.

It’s more maneuverable than a stick vac, pivoting smoothly to go around furniture legs and lying completely flat to get under sofas and beds.

For deeper cleaning, the PencilVac’s included crevice tool/dusting attachment did a good job on baseboards and windowsills, and could reach up to lights and cobwebby corners. It also easily got into spaces robot vacuums can’t — like the gap behind the TV console.

I’ve only been using it for a couple of days, but I quickly got used to the lack of a handle. It really is just like using a broom.

The biggest problem is suction; it’s not a powerful vacuum, especially compared to Dyson’s stick vacs. It struggles with larger clumps of dirt and anything bigger than a fluffy dust bunny. As mentioned, it just flat-out doesn’t work on carpet.

It also only runs for 30 minutes on low and around 20 minutes on medium, which I found myself using most often. (There is a boost mode for some extra power.) All of which makes it great for a quick touch-up, but not for a whole-house clean.

One other thing to note: this is Dyson’s first stick vacuum to connect to the My Dyson app. This isn’t a plus, at least not yet. Functionally, it’s limited to software updates and filter-cleaning alerts. It also uses Bluetooth, so you have to be near the vacuum to update it, and the app kept insisting that I give it permanent access to my location for no clear reason.

Between the limited suction, short runtime, and inability to handle carpet, the PencilVac Fluffycones isn’t even pretending to be a whole-home cleaner. If you’re looking for a proper house cleaner in this price range, Dyson’s V8 Absolute is a better choice. It’s under six pounds and has twice the suction. While slightly less maneuverable, it will pick up all the dirt and clean your carpets, baseboards, and everything else.

But is it as fun as the PencilVac? Not even close. The PencilVac is Dyson at its best: a wildly overengineered device that’s delightful to use, entirely unnecessary, but something you’re probably going to really want anyway.

Microbes could extract the metal needed for cleantech

In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects.

What we’ve been getting wrong about AI’s truth crisis

            <div id="article-text">In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.

But earlier this year, the mine’s owner started testing a new process that could eke out a bit more nickel. In a pair of shipping containers recently installed at the mine’s mill, a fermentation-derived broth developed by the startup Allonnia is mixed with concentrated ore to capture and remove impurities. The process allows nickel production from lower-quality ore.

Kent Sorenson, Allonnia’s chief technology officer, says this approach could help companies continue operating sites that, like Eagle Mine, have burned through their best ore. “The low-hanging fruit is to keep mining the mines that we have,” he says.

Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Like the age-old technique of rolling up the end of a toothpaste tube, Allonnia’s broth is one of a number of ways that biotechnology could help miners squeeze more metal out of aging mines, mediocre ore, or piles of waste.

The mining industry has intentionally seeded copper ore with microbes for decades. At current copper bioleaching sites, miners pile crushed copper ore into heaps and add sulfuric acid. Acid-loving bacteria like Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans colonize the mound. A chemical the organisms produce breaks the bond between sulfur and copper molecules to liberate the metal.

Until now, beyond maintaining the acidity and blowing air into the heap, there wasn’t much more miners could do to encourage microbial growth. But Elizabeth Dennett, CEO of the startup Endolith, says the decreasing cost of genetic tools is making it possible to manage the communities of microbes in a heap more actively. “The technology we’re using now didn’t exist a few years ago,” she says.

Endolith analyzes bits of DNA and RNA in the copper-rich liquid that flows out of an ore heap to characterize the microbes living inside. Combined with a suite of chemical analyses, the information helps the company determine which microbes to sprinkle on a heap to optimize extraction.

In lab tests on ore from the mining firm BHP, Endolith’s active techniques outperformed passive bioleaching approaches. In November, the company raised $16.5 million to move from its Denver lab to heaps in active mines.

Despite these promising early results, Corale Brierley, an engineer who has worked on metal bioleaching systems since the 1970s, questions whether companies like Endolith that add additional microbes to ore will successfully translate their processes to commercial scales. “What guarantees are you going to give the company that those organisms will actually grow?” Brierley asks.

Big mining firms that have already optimized every hose, nut, and bolt in their process won’t be easy to convince either, says Diana Rasner, an analyst covering mining technology for the research firm Cleantech Group.

“They are acutely aware of what it takes to scale these technologies because they know the industry,” she says. “They’ll be your biggest supporters, but they’re going to be your biggest critics.”

In addition to technical challenges, Rasner points out that venture-capital-backed biotechnology startups will struggle to deliver the quick returns their investors seek. Mining companies want lots of data before adopting a new process, which could take years of testing to compile. “This is not software,” Rasner says.

Nuton, a subsidiary of the mining giant Rio Tinto, is a good example. The company has been working for decades on a copper bioleaching process that uses a blend of archaea and bacteria strains, plus some chemical additives. But it started demonstrating the technology only late last year, at a mine in Arizona.

While Endolith and Nuton use naturally occurring microbes, the startup 1849 is hoping to achieve a bigger performance boost by genetically engineering microbes.

“You can do what mining companies have traditionally done,” says CEO Jai Padmakumar. “Or you can try to take the moonshot bet and engineer them. If you get that, you have a huge win.”

Genetic engineering would allow 1849 to tailor its microbes to the specific challenges facing a customer. But engineering organisms can also make them harder to grow, warns Buz Barstow, a Cornell University microbiologist who studies applications for biotechnology in mining.

Other companies are trying to avoid that trade-off by applying the products of microbial fermentation, rather than live organisms. Alta Resource Technologies, which closed a $28 million investment round in December, is engineering microbes that make proteins capable of extracting and separating rare earth elements. Similarly, the startup REEgen, based in Ithaca, New York, relies on the organic acids produced by an engineered strain of Gluconobacter oxydans to extract rare earth elements from ore and from waste materials like metal recycling slag, coal ash, or old electronics. “The microbes are the manufacturing,” says CEO Alexa Schmitz, an alumna of Barstow’s lab.

To make a dent in the growing demand for metal, this new wave of biotechnologies will have to go beyond copper and gold, says Barstow. In 2024, he started a project to map out genes that could be useful for extracting and separating a wider range of metals. Even with the challenges ahead, he says, biotechnology has the potential to transform mining the way fracking changed natural gas. “Biomining is one of these areas where the need … is big enough,” he says.

The challenge will be moving fast enough to keep up with growing demand.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

Omar Yaghi thinks crystals with gaps that capture moisture could bring technology from “Dune” to the arid parts of Earth.

And why many scientists are freaked out about the first serious for-profit company moving into the solar geoengineering field.

            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

What would it take to convince you that the era of truth decay we were long warned about—where AI content dupes us, shapes our beliefs even when we catch the lie, and erodes societal trust in the process—is now here? A story I published last week pushed me over the edge. It also made me realize that the tools we were sold as a cure for this crisis are failing miserably.

On Thursday, I reported the first confirmation that the US Department of Homeland Security, which houses immigration agencies, is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make content that it shares with the public. The news comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI (like a video about “Christmas after mass deportations”).

But I received two types of reactions from readers that may explain just as much about the epistemic crisis we’re in.

One was from people who weren’t surprised, because on January 22 the White House had posted a digitally altered photo of a woman arrested at an ICE protest, one that made her appear hysterical and in tears. Kaelan Dorr, the White House’s deputy communications director, did not respond to questions about whether the White House altered the photo but wrote, “The memes will continue.”

The second was from readers who saw no point in reporting that DHS was using AI to edit content shared with the public, because news outlets were apparently doing the same. They pointed to the fact that the news network MS Now (formerly MSNBC) shared an image of Alex Pretti that was AI-edited and appeared to make him look more handsome, a fact that led to many viral clips this week, including one from Joe Rogan’s podcast. Fight fire with fire, in other words? A spokesperson for MS Now told Snopes that the news outlet aired the image without knowing it was edited.

There is no reason to collapse these two cases of altered content into the same category, or to read them as evidence that truth no longer matters. One involved the US government sharing a clearly altered photo with the public and declining to answer whether it was intentionally manipulated; the other involved a news outlet airing a photo it should have known was altered but taking some steps to disclose the mistake.

What these reactions reveal instead is a flaw in how we were collectively preparing for this moment. Warnings about the AI truth crisis revolved around a core thesis: that not being able to tell what is real will destroy us, so we need tools to independently verify the truth. My two grim takeaways are that these tools are failing, and that while vetting the truth remains essential, it is no longer capable on its own of producing the societal trust we were promised.

For example, there was plenty of hype in 2024 about the Content Authenticity Initiative, cofounded by Adobe and adopted by major tech companies, which would attach labels to content disclosing when it was made, by whom, and whether AI was involved. But Adobe applies automatic labels only when the content is wholly AI-generated. Otherwise the labels are opt-in on the part of the creator.

And platforms like X, where the altered arrest photo was posted, can strip content of such labels anyway (a note that the photo was altered was added by users). Platforms can also simply not choose to show the label at all.

Noticing how much traction the White House’s photo got even after it was shown to be AI-altered, I was struck by the findings of a very relevant new paper published in the journal Communications Psychology. In the study, participants watched a deepfake “confession” to a crime, and the researchers found that even when they were told explicitly that the evidence was fake, participants relied on it when judging an individual’s guilt. In other words, even when people learn that the content they’re looking at is entirely fake, they remain emotionally swayed by it.

“Transparency helps, but it isn’t enough on its own,” the disinformation expert Christopher Nehring wrote recently about the study’s findings. “We have to develop a new masterplan of what to do about deepfakes.”

AI tools to generate and edit content are getting more advanced, easier to operate, and cheaper to run—all reasons why the US government is increasingly paying to use them. We were well warned of this, but we responded by preparing for a world in which the main danger was confusion. What we’re entering instead is a world in which influence survives exposure, doubt is easily weaponized, and establishing the truth does not serve as a reset button. And the defenders of truth are already trailing way behind.

Update: This story was updated on February 2 with details about how Adobe applies its content authenticity labels. A previous version of this story said content credentials were not visible on the Pentagon’s DVIDS website. The labels are present but require clicking through and hovering on individual images. The reference has been removed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many organizations rushed into generative AI, only to see pilots fail to deliver value. Now, companies want measurable outcomes—but how do you design for success?

At Mistral AI, we partner with global industry leaders to co-design tailored AI solutions that solve their most difficult problems. Whether it’s increasing CX productivity with Cisco, building a more intelligent car with Stellantis, or accelerating product innovation with ASML, we start with open frontier models and customize AI systems to deliver impact for each company’s unique challenges and goals.

Our methodology starts by identifying an iconic use case, the foundation for AI transformation that sets the blueprint for future AI solutions. Choosing the right use case can mean the difference between true transformation and endless tinkering and testing.

Mistral AI has four criteria that we look for in a use case: strategic, urgent, impactful, and feasible.

First, the use case must be strategically valuable, addressing a core business process or a transformative new capability. It needs to be more than an optimization; it needs to be a gamechanger. The use case needs to be strategic enough to excite an organization’s C-suite and board of directors.

For example, use cases like an internal-facing HR chatbot are nice to have, but they are easy to solve and are not enabling any new innovation or opportunities. On the other end of the spectrum, imagine an externally facing banking assistant that can not only answer questions, but also help take actions like blocking a card, placing trades, and suggesting upsell/cross-sell opportunities. This is how a customer-support chatbot is turned into a strategic revenue-generating asset.

Second, the best use case to move forward with should be highly urgent and solve a business-critical problem that people care about right now. This project will take time out of people’s days—it needs to be important enough to justify that time investment. And it needs to help business users solve immediate pain points.

Third, the use case should be pragmatic and impactful. From day one, our shared goal with our customers is to deploy into a real-world production environment to enable testing the solution with real users and gather feedback. Many AI prototypes end up in the graveyard of fancy demos that are not good enough to put in front of customers, and without any scaffolding to evaluate and improve. We work with customers to ensure prototypes are stable enough to release, and that they have the necessary support and governance frameworks.

Finally, the best use case is feasible. There may be several urgent projects, but choosing one that can deliver a quick return on investment helps to maintain the momentum needed to continue and scale.

This means looking for a project that can be in production within three months—and a prototype can be live within a few weeks. It’s important to get a prototype in front of end users as fast as possible to get feedback to make sure the project is on track, and pivot as needed.

Enterprises are complex, and the path forward is not usually obvious. To weed through all the possibilities and uncover the right first use case, Mistral AI will run workshops with our customers, hand-in-hand with subject-matter experts and end users.

Representatives from different functions will demo their processes and discuss business cases that could be candidates for a first use case—and together we agree on a winner. Here are some examples of types of projects that don’t qualify.

Moonshots: Ambitious bets that excite leadership but lack a path to quick ROI. While these projects can be strategic and urgent, they rarely meet the feasibility and impact requirements.

Future investments: Long-term plays that can wait. While these projects can be strategic and feasible, they rarely meet the urgency and impact requirements.

Tactical fixes: Firefighting projects that solve immediate pain but don’t move the needle. While these cases can be urgent and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and impact requirements.

Quick wins: Useful for building momentum, but not transformative. While they can be impactful and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and urgency requirements.

Blue sky ideas: These projects are gamechangers, but they need maturity to be viable. While they can be strategic and impactful, they rarely meet the urgency and feasibility requirements.

Hero projects: These are high-pressure initiatives that lack executive sponsorship or realistic timelines. While they can be urgent and impactful, they rarely meet the strategy and feasibility requirements.

Once a clearly defined and strategic use case ready for development is identified, it’s time to move into the validation phase. This means doing an initial data exploration and data mapping, identifying a pilot infrastructure, and choosing a target deployment environment.

This step also involves agreeing on a draft pilot scope, identifying who will participate in the proof of concept, and setting up a governance process.

Once this is complete, it’s time to move into the building phase. Companies that partner with Mistral work with our in-house applied AI scientists who build our frontier models. We work together to design, build, and deploy the first solution.

During this phase, we focus on co-creation, so we can transfer knowledge and skills to the organizations we’re partnering with. That way, they can be self-sufficient far into the future. The output of this phase is a deployed AI solution with empowered teams capable of independent operation and innovation.

After the first win, it’s imperative to use the momentum and learnings from the iconic use case to identify more high-value AI solutions to roll out. Success is when we have a scalable AI transformation blueprint with multiple high-value solutions across the organization.

But none of this could happen without successfully identifying that first iconic use case. This first step is not just about selecting a project—it’s about setting the foundation for your entire AI transformation.

It’s the difference between scattered experiments and a strategic, scalable journey toward impact. At Mistral AI, we’ve seen how this approach unlocks measurable value, aligns stakeholders, and builds momentum for what comes next.

The path to AI success starts with a single, well-chosen use case: one that is bold enough to inspire, urgent enough to demand action, and pragmatic enough to deliver.

Inside the marketplace powering bespoke AI deepfakes of real women

Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Kyle “KJ” Muldoon Jr. was born with a rare, potentially fatal genetic disorder that left his body unable to remove toxic ammonia from his blood. The University of Pennsylvania offered his parents an alternative to a liver transplant: gene-editing therapies.

The team set to work developing a tailored treatment using base editing—a form of CRISPR that can correct genetic “misspellings” by changing single bases, the basic units of DNA. KJ received an initial low dose when he was seven months old, and later received two higher doses. Today, KJ is doing well. At an event in October last year, his happy parents described how he was meeting all his developmental milestones.

Others have received gene-editing therapies intended to treat conditions including sickle cell disease and a predisposition to high cholesterol. But KJ was the first to receive a personalized treatment—one that was designed just for him and will probably never be used again.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Looking ahead, we could soon see wider adoption of new chemistries, including some that deliver lower costs or higher performance. Meanwhile, the geopolitics of batteries are shifting, and so is the policy landscape. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Lithium-ion batteries are the default chemistry used in EVs, personal devices, and even stationary storage systems on the grid today. But in a tough environment in some markets like the US, there’s a growing interest in cheaper alternatives. Automakers right now largely care just about batteries’ cost, regardless of performance improvements, says Kara Rodby, a technical principal at Volta Energy Technologies, a venture capital firm that focuses on energy storage technology.

Sodium-ion cells have long been held up as a potentially less expensive alternative to lithium. The batteries are limited in their energy density, so they deliver a shorter range than lithium-ion. But sodium is also more abundant, so they could be cheaper.

Sodium’s growth has been cursed, however, by the very success of lithium-based batteries, says Shirley Meng, a professor of molecular engineering at the University of Chicago. A lithium-ion battery cell cost $568 per kilowatt-hour in 2013, but that cost had fallen to just $74 per kilowatt-hour by 2025—quite the moving target for cheaper alternatives to chase.

Sodium-ion batteries currently cost about $59 per kilowatt-hour on average. That’s less expensive than the average lithium-ion battery. But if you consider only lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, a lower-end type of lithium-ion battery that averages $52 per kilowatt-hour, sodium is still more expensive today.

We could soon see an opening for sodium-batteries, though. Lithium prices have been ticking up in recent months, a shift that could soon slow or reverse the steady downward march of prices for lithium-based batteries.

Sodium-ion batteries are already being used commercially, largely for stationary storage on the grid. But we’re starting to see sodium-ion cells incorporated into vehicles, too. The Chinese companies Yadea, JMEV, and HiNa Battery have all started producing sodium-ion batteries in limited numbers for EVs, including small, short-range cars and electric scooters that don’t require a battery with high energy density. CATL, a Chinese battery company that’s the world’s largest, says it recently began producing sodium-ion cells. The company plans to launch its first EV using the chemistry by the middle of this year.

Today, both production and demand for sodium-ion batteries are heavily centered in China. That’s likely to continue, especially after a cutback in tax credits and other financial support for the battery and EV industries in the US. One of the biggest sodium-battery companies in the US, Natron, ceased operations last year after running into funding issues.

We could also see progress in sodium-ion research: Companies and researchers are developing new materials for components including the electrolyte and electrodes, so the cells could get more comparable to lower-end lithium-ion cells in terms of energy density, Meng says.

As we enter the second half of this decade, many eyes in the battery world are on big promises and claims about solid-state batteries.

These batteries could pack more energy into a smaller package by removing the liquid electrolyte, the material that ions move through when a battery is charging and discharging. With a higher energy density, they could unlock longer-range EVs.

Companies have been promising solid-state batteries for years. Toyota, for example, once planned to have them in vehicles by 2020. That timeline has been delayed several times, though the company says it’s now on track to launch the new cells in cars in 2027 or 2028.

Historically, battery makers have struggled to produce solid-state batteries at the scale needed to deliver a commercially relevant supply for EVs. There’s been progress in manufacturing techniques, though, and companies could soon actually make good on their promises, Meng says.

Factorial Energy, a US-based company making solid-state batteries, provided cells for a Mercedes test vehicle that drove over 745 miles on a single charge in a real-world test in September. The company says it plans to bring its tech to market as soon as 2027. Quantumscape, another major solid-state player in the US, is testing its cells with automotive partners and plans to have its batteries in commercial production later this decade.

Before we see true solid-state batteries, we could see hybrid technologies, often referred to as semi-solid-state batteries. These commonly use materials like gel electrolytes, reducing the liquid inside cells without removing it entirely. Many Chinese companies are looking to build semi-solid-state batteries before transitioning to entirely solid-state ones, says Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technologies and supply chains at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

The picture for the near future of the EV industry looks drastically different depending on where you’re standing.

Last year, China overtook Japan as the country with the most global auto sales. And more than one in three EVs made in 2025 had a CATL battery in it. Simply put, China is dominating the global battery industry, and that doesn’t seem likely to change anytime soon.

China’s influence outside its domestic market is growing especially quickly. CATL is expected to begin production this year at its second European site; the factory, located in Hungary, is an $8.2 billion project that will supply automakers including BMW and the Mercedes-Benz group. Canada recently signed a deal that will lower the import tax on Chinese EVs from 100% to roughly 6%, effectively opening the Canadian market for Chinese EVs.

Some countries that haven’t historically been major EV markets could become bigger players in the second half of the decade. Annual EV sales in Thailand and Vietnam, where the market was virtually nonexistent just a few years ago, broke 100,000 in 2025. Brazil, in particular, could see its new EV sales more than double in 2026 as major automakers including Volkswagen and BYD set up or ramp up production in the country.

On the flip side, EVs are facing a real test in 2026 in the US, as this will be the first calendar year after the sunset of federal tax credits that were designed to push more drivers to purchase the vehicles. With those credits gone, growth in sales is expected to continue lagging.

One bright spot for batteries in the US is outside the EV market altogether. Battery manufacturers are starting to produce low-cost LFP batteries in the US, largely for energy storage applications. LG opened a massive factory to make LFP batteries in mid-2025 in Michigan, and the Korean battery company SK On plans to start making LFP batteries at its facility in Georgia later this year. Those plants could help battery companies cash in on investments as the US EV market faces major headwinds.

Even as the US lags behind, the world is electrifying transportation. By 2030, 40% of new vehicles sold around the world are projected to be electric. As we approach that milestone, expect to see more global players, a wider selection of EVs, and an even wider menu of batteries to power them.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <div id="article-text">If you look at the press releases and breathless commentary around the recent acquisition of xAI by SpaceX, you might think we’re witnessing a tectonic shift in technological destiny.

A $1.25 trillion “mega-company” is born, poised to reshape artificial intelligence, space infrastructure, satellite internet, and possibly the fate of humanity itself. That narrative, enthusiastically repeated across headlines, serves a purpose: it frames a somewhat messy corporate consolidation as inevitable progress.

But let’s take a closer look and separate actual substance from Silicon Valley myth-making.

At its core, this acquisition solves one problem: xAI needed a place to spend its money. The startup that once raised billions and expanded by swallowing the social platform X was burning cash, an estimated very serious amount, chasing model performance and celebrity.

Folding it into SpaceX gives it access to a deeper capital pool, a broader story, and a more flattering valuation context.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

SpaceX did not acquire xAI because xAI was on the verge of overtaking tech giants in artificial intelligence. It acquired it because running a massively expensive AI operation inside a standalone startup wasn’t sustainable, even for Elon Musk’s legion of investors. A merger with a revenue-generating aerospace company looks a lot like a bailout disguised as synergy.

One of the dominant talking points from Musk’s own statements is that this consolidation enables space-based data centers, because apparently, earthbound power and cooling infrastructure are so last decade. The story goes: launch AI compute into orbit, agglomerate solar energy, and power the future with starlight.

On paper, it’s an imaginative riff. In practice, it’s strategic sci-fi for the markets. Putting data centers in space involves launch costs, radiation-hardened hardware, maintenance logistics that make ISS servicing look pedestrian, and no meaningful economy of scale compared to terrestrial hyperscalers like AWS or Google Cloud. If it were primarily about economics, the industry wouldn’t be scrambling to keep data on Earth.

The truth is simpler: this narrative reframes costly AI ambitions in a cosmic, venture-capital-friendly guise. It makes investors feel like they’re buying into a future where AI runs on sunshine in orbit, rather than into the present where AI training costs are a gating factor.

It’s good PR, dubious engineering economics.

The timing of this merger speaks volumes. SpaceX is preparing for a public offering, potentially as early as mid-2026. Reports say the combined entity could fetch valuations worth of $1.2 trillion.

Here’s what happens when you’re about to IPO:

You package your story in a way that excites both institutional and retail investors. You highlight future potential, especially grand visions like “ethereal solar compute.” You downplay structural weaknesses and uncertainties. And if you can fold in a shiny AI banner, all the better, because AI is the word that unlocks narrative premiums.

From that standpoint, SpaceX’s absorption of xAI makes sense. It’s narrative arbitrage: build a storyline that elevates the combination well beyond its standalone track records. Who wouldn’t want to invest in “AI in space,” even if the commercial case is mostly speculative?

If the goal was to create an AI powerhouse that actually threatens the likes of OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic, we’d see clear indicators: rapid model improvements, developer platform adoption, real enterprise deals, and benchmarks that are competitive on measurable terms.

What we see is an AI startup struggling to define its identity, a chatbot (Grok) known more for quirks and moderation issues than transformative performance, and a social platform that, let’s just say, gives fact-checking teams ulcers. None of this naturally scales into the kind of AI infrastructure leadership that justifies calling this a strategic technological fusion.

That’s not to say xAI has zero potential; it might. But there’s no verifiable evidence that this merger suddenly elevates it to tier-one AI contender status.

One striking consequence of this move is how deeply entwined Musk’s personal corporate empire has become. With SpaceX, xAI, Starlink, X, and multiple ventures all orbiting around the same figure, there’s little left that feels like a separate institution. That concentration raises questions about governance, accountability, and even regulatory scrutiny.

Musk’s critics have made this point before, whether about content moderation on social media platforms, intercompany transfers of resources, or governance decisions around publicly traded entities, and these concerns aren’t going away just because the companies now share a name on a term sheet.

Consolidation under one umbrella might be efficient from a control perspective, but it’s not inherently a prescription for innovation. In fact, it can stifle internal dissent, obscure accountability, and concentrate risk.

Again, there’s a clear pragmatic logic to this merger: xAI gets access to SpaceX’s balance sheet and a narrative boost; SpaceX gets an AI banner to highlight in its IPO pitch; investors get something that looks both futuristic and marketable.

That’s not a strategy grounded in technological merit. It’s a financial and narrative maneuver, carefully calibrated to appeal to markets and media.

In that sense, what just happened feels a lot like a bailout with a shiny new label and an extraterrestrial backstory.

If this were genuinely about advancing AI, we’d be hearing about:

None of those are the dominant themes of the current coverage. What we have instead is a $1.25 trillion headline and a promise that someday, somewhere, perhaps space will be the next frontier for AI compute.

It’s visionary in the way a concept car is visionary, exciting to look at, and flimsy on the economics.

The SpaceX-xAI merger is undeniably a headline-grabbing moment, but it’s not the strategic leap some commentators portray. It’s a capital and narrative optimization, not a clear answer to the question of who leads AI or how AI’s growth is sustainably powered.

If nothing else, it highlights how difficult it is to build a credible, well-funded AI company from scratch, even for someone as resourceful and celebrated as Elon Musk. His answer was not to reforge the fundamentals of AI research, but to fold an ambitious but unproven AI arm into a larger, more established aerospace machine with a glossy story that sounds like science fiction.

That may delight investors. It doesn’t yet convince technologists. Or me.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has given software developers a new desktop toy, and judging by the early reactions, it might feel like someone finally handed coders the Swiss Army knife they’ve been dreaming about or the kind of gadget that makes them wonder if they’re working with a robot coworker now.

The company rolled out the Codex app for macOS, a focused interface for managing AI coding agents, designed to let developers do more than just “generate a few lines of code.” Instead, Codex can juggle multiple tasks in parallel, run background workflows, and act on instructions that span hours or even days.

At its core, the new app is a response to a shift that’s been quietly happening for the past year: AI isn’t just helping write short snippets anymore. It’s taking on whole coding projects, running tests, dealing with pull requests, and even undertaking the kind of repetitive maintenance tasks that make developers groan.

Containers, threads, isolated worktrees, and integrated Git tools support all of this seamlessly within the app, so engineers don’t need to jump between terminals, IDEs, and cloud consoles just to keep a fleet of AI agents moving forward.

OpenAI’s own announcement makes this shift clear: existing tools were built for real-time interaction or single tasks, but today’s coding workflows are multifaceted and sprawling. Instead of coaxing a model to generate code line by line, the Codex app lets you orchestrate agents that work independently on different parts of a codebase.

Each agent runs in its own thread and its own worktree, which means you can explore multiple ideas without fear of one bot overwriting another’s progress. If you want Codex to review diffs, make comments inline, or even open suggested changes in your local editor, it can. If you want it to run in the background while you sleep, it can do that too.

Image: Screenshot shared on Reddit (r/singularity), original post.

There’s even support for what OpenAI calls “skills” and “automations”: reusable workflows that let Codex go beyond raw code generation into things like gathering information, problem solving, carrying out scheduled tasks, or managing routine reviews.

In early internal use cases, Codex has built complete applications, playing the roles of designer, developer, and QA tester in a single string of prompts, an example that hints at what happens when AI stops being an assistant and starts feeling a bit like a team member with infinite coffee.

It’s worth noting that the current release is macOS only, which prompted the usual chorus of developer grumbling about Windows and Linux support. Early adopters on Reddit (and elsewhere) joked that the lack of cross-platform availability feels oddly quaint for an AI tool, even as they praised how much the Codex app can do compared to traditional CLI workflows.

OpenAI is also sweetening the deal: for a limited time, Codex will be accessible to free and Go users, and rate limits for paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have been doubled across all surfaces where Codex runs, whether that’s the app, the CLI, IDE extensions, or cloud threads.

The company’s broader strategy here is unmistakable. AI coding assistants are one of the most competitive battlegrounds in generative AI right now, and rivals like Anthropic’s Claude Code have already reported strong revenue metrics in this space.

The launch of a desktop command center for Codex feels like OpenAI saying, “We’re in this to win,” not just to ship features.

So what does this actually mean for developers? It doesn’t mean humans are about to be replaced overnight. Codex is powerful, but like all AI tools, it still makes mistakes and needs human oversight, especially when the stakes are high and production quality matters.

Seen through that lens, the Codex app is less a magic wand and more a powerful collaboration layer, one that could reshape how engineering teams operate without pretending to fully automate the craft of building software.

In practice, that suggests a near future where managing AI agents becomes as normal as managing packages or Git branches. Instead of the terminal being the center of your workflow, Codex and its agents might take that spot, responding to prompts, running scheduled tasks, and even adopting configurable “personalities” that fit how you prefer to work.

At a time when the debate around AI productivity often centers on displacement or disruption, the Codex app points in a more nuanced direction: what happens when coding tools become partners rather than assistants?

The answer won’t be immediate, and the work still demands human judgement, but for many developers the first glimpse of that future arrived today.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every January, millions take on Dry January, a ritual of restraint and resetting after the holiday season. If that’s the benchmark for kicking off the year with moderation, Europe’s startup ecosystem clearly didn’t get the memo.

In the opening weeks of 2026, the region saw five startups join the unicorn club, crossing the $1 billion valuation mark across sectors as varied as cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence tech, ESG software, and education technology.

January was anything but dry for European companies. This burst of activity signals more than a funding spike; it invites a deeper look at what Europe’s innovation identity looks like today. Across the continent, there’s a stronger sense that Europe can produce and scale world-class tech companies in its own right, rather than just nurture later-stage spin-offs or see them acquired by U.S. firms.

While the United States still leads in overall startup volume and ecosystem strength, Europe’s recent momentum shows its innovation landscape is maturing and gaining confidence on the global stage.

Europe was already home to over 217 unicorns by late 2025, spread across fintech, AI, enterprise software, and other domains. That’s a milestone for a region whose venture culture has historically leaned toward caution.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What’s notable isn’t simply the number of new billion-dollar companies, but their variety. Gone are the days when a single sector, often generative AI, defined European unicorn trajectories. Here we see cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence-oriented software, sustainability data, and education marketplaces all earning top valuations and investor backing.

The broader context matters. In 2025, deep-tech and university spinouts, including companies in aerospace, robotics, materials, sensors, and health sciences, saw near record levels of funding, and many achieved significant valuation or revenue milestones.

This goes hand in hand with a narrative that’s become increasingly clear: European capital is being more deliberate than exuberant. Rather than inflate every trend label, investors are writing checks where traction, revenue models, and regulatory demand converge. That’s why platforms helping companies with compliance and ESG reporting, or infrastructure for cloud efficiency, are winning attention alongside defence-tech innovators.

Europe’s tech ecosystem has matured, even if it still faces hurdles. Venture funding peaked in recent years and then dipped; for example, total European VC investment in 2024 was reported to be around $45 billion, down from earlier highs. Yet the valuation achievements and funding depth remain meaningful.

This apparent paradox highlights a structural shift: rather than broad flows of unfettered capital, funding is now more selective and outcome-oriented. Investors, LPs, and strategic partners are looking for proof of product-market fit, regulatory differentiation, and defensible business models.

Fragmentation across markets and languages, long considered a European challenge, can also be a strength when paired with clusters of domain expertise, cybersecurity hubs in Belgium, deep tech in the Nordics, cloud infrastructure in the Baltics, and education technology with strong ties to diverse EU labour markets. Observers have noted that these clusters are attracting venture dollars, even if not every founder heads straight for the Bay Area.

Policy tools and institutional support are increasingly part of the backdrop for European innovation. The European Union’s research and innovation framework programmes, most notably Horizon Europe, are directing substantial resources toward areas such as digital transformation, strategic autonomy, and industrial competitiveness.

For 2021–2027, Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of around €93.5 billion allocated to boost competitiveness, address climate and social challenges, and support key technologies from AI to advanced manufacturing.

This support matters because initiatives that might once have felt niche, advanced sensors, ESG compliance tools, or technologies with both civil and defence applications, now align clearly with broader strategic goals set out in the EU’s innovation plans.

Calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space, and related programmes bring together public and private partners to tackle digital and green transitions, pooling resources and creating coherent pathways from research to commercial deployment.

That’s why this month’s unicorn news feels less like a fluke and more like a phase transition.

So what does it all mean? Are these five new unicorns signs of a sustainable upswing or just a temporary blip in enterprise valuations?

They’re arguably both: an indicator that Europe’s startup engine still runs on thoughtful investment, real use cases, and foundational problems, and a challenge to continue scaling that momentum into later-stage growth and exits.

Europe doesn’t need to be Silicon Valley. It never really did. What it needs is confidence in its own values, disciplined capital, diverse innovation, and regulation as an enabler, not a constraint.

If this is Europe’s tech moment, it’s not marked by headline-grabbing valuations alone. It’s defined by the breadth of problems being solved and the depth of conviction behind those solutions.

            <div id="article-text">We are all familiar with the subscription economy, and it certainly works as a reminder of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we were all hooked on our TVs watching Netflix or listening to our favorite music artist on Spotify.

Despite how modern it seems to be, the truth is that the subscription economy has been around for some time, surprisingly dating back to around 1800, with the first magazine subscriptions, or the subscriptions for fresh British milk, around 1860.

Over the years, the of subscription-based companies has turned the subscription model into an ideal business strategy since it provides unique benefits. In the same way, the adoption of this model across multiple industries has led to negative repercussions for the general public.

This article explores its growth across industries, benefits and disadvantages, and why this is important for you, as a service provider and/or as a customer.

The subscription economy is a recurring-revenue model in which products or services are delivered daily under a temporary or perpetual subscription in exchange for a fixed price, growing considerably in the last 20 years.

According to the last report in the Subscription Economy Market 2025 by Juniper, the global market had a total revenue of $722B in 2025, with a forecasted total revenue of $1.2T by 2030, with an average annual growth rate of more than 15%. Software as a service (SaaS) remains the biggest part of the subscription market with a revenue of more than $250B by 2022. The car rethinking industry, e-mobility application area, and the digitization of the health sector are expected to be enormously scaled by 2030.

The European market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.50% in the forecast period of 2026-2035. The main industry leaders within the region are beauty, food, and digital subscriptions. Whereas the countries where the subscription market stands out are the UK (beauty and personal care), Germany (software and consumer goods), France (food and beverage), and Italy and Spain (digital subscription and other categories).

A study made by Advances in Consumer Research (ACR) journal highlights how this model is great for businesses because it provides steady income, low upfront costs, and consistent lifetime value (the total value a customer provides to a company over their relationship), while promoting brand loyalty. It also offers unique advantages for consumers, such as a customer-centric approach focused on personalizing services, products and experiences, and experiences; convenient, time-saving solutions; cost-effectiveness; access to a diverse range of products rather than ownership of a few; and even social recognition and identity.

The gaming industry had a steady increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, introducing subscription-based services, which have become regular within the industry. The business model is simple: gamers pay a subscription fee to access gaming services, and there are three different options for customers:

The global market for subscription-based gaming was estimated at $10.1B in 2023 and is forecasted to reach $21.3B by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2023 to 2030.

It has been popularized due to its affordability and convenience, since the subscription to platforms enables players the flexibility to pay multiple games with an affordable fee.

The subscription model also offers unique advantages for companies, such as reduction of upfront costs since the games are directly streamed from servers, promoted by the technological development of high-speed internet infrastructure and 5G, cloud gaming service, cross-platform accounts, family plans, and leveraged AI to offer personalized game recommendations based on user behavior.

Another industry that is adapting to market and customer expectations is healthcare. As a response to technological and societal advancements, subscription medical care is increasing in popularity within the US, expected to reach $15.1bn by 2032.

Health tech represents a great opportunity for individuals and businesses since it introduces cost predictability, personalized attention, and wellness data. Healthcare providers and health tech companies are leveraging the use of AI, since it facilitates the data analysis process, helping health professionals to make more accurate and efficient diagnoses.

Within the health care and health tech industry, there are several subscription-based models, such as:

The subscription economy has expanded to other services, such as education. Since the customer expectations and behavior is demanding accessible, personalized content at an affordable price, the global e-learning market is growing and expected to reach $1T by 2032 with subscription models leading.

The key drivers for growth are the increasing use of VR and AR in e-learning, digital transformation, and the partnership of universities and diversity in offerings. Some of the most used platforms worldwide are Duolingo, Coursera, and FutureLearn, among others.

Another industry that has greatly benefitted with the subscription model is the creator economy. Content creators are increasingly looking to subscription platforms such as Patreon, OnlyFans, and Substack, adopting them as a solution in a volatile economy and competitive markets, where creators heavily depended on paid partnerships and platform payouts, this way ensuring a stable monthly recurring revenue.

The key drivers for the growth of this market are, whatsoever, slightly different than the previously mentioned: audiences want to pay for a deeper relationship with the creator than passive scrolling, whether of its niche expertise or personal connection.

Despite all the unique benefits that the subscription model offers for customers and companies, the quick expansion and adoption of this model has led to negative effects in the audiences, which become challenges for the companies. You may be familiar with the concept of subscription fatigue, which reflects the customers’ reluctance to engage with multiple subscriptions.

This phenomenon was born due to the saturation in the expanding market and is driven by “lack of perceived value, hidden or unpredictable fees and loss of control,” fomenting churn (percentage of customers who cancel their subscription) for customers to save money or just because the service seems not useful for them.

Another challenge for companies is the constant pressure for ongoing investment in product development and customer engagement, especially in industries with minimal product differentiation, such as the streaming platforms industry. High production costs and limited audience engagement increase this model’s financial struggles, adding pressure on companies to deliver valuable services while generating profit.

Subscription models are no longer limited to entertainment platforms. They have become a core part of modern digital business strategies, offering predictable revenue streams for companies and enhancing customer experience.

The next phase will likely combine hybrid subscription models with usage-based pricing and data-driven personalization. To remain competitive, companies will need to adapt to consumer expectations by offering flexible prices and plans, pause options, bundling strategies, and partnerships across platforms.

Ultimately, the main challenge right now is how to design models that deliver long-term value without overwhelming users, balancing profitability with meaningful user experience.
