            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE released thermal energy roughly equivalent to 100,000 times the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II, spewing molten rock, pumice, and hot ash over Pompeii. Pompeii’s public baths, aqueduct, and water towers were among the preserved structures frozen in time. A new paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences analyzed calcium carbonate deposits from those structures to learn more about the city’s water supply and how it changed over time.

Pompeii was founded in the sixth century BCE. Prior research revealed that, early on, the city relied on rainwater stored in cisterns and wells for its water supply. The public baths used weight-lifting machinery to lift water up well shafts that were as deep as 40 meters. As the city developed, so did the complexity of its water supply system, most notably with the construction of an aqueduct between 27 BCE and 14 CE.

The authors of this latest paper were interested in the calcium carbonate deposits left by water in well shafts as well as the baths and aqueduct. The different layers have “different chemical and isotope composition, calcite crystal size, and shape,” which in turn could reveal information about seasonal changes in temperature, as well as changes over time in the chemical composition of the water. Analyzing those properties would enable them to “reconstruct the history of such systems—particularly public baths—revealing aspects of their maintenance and the adaptations made during their period of use,” the authors wrote.

The authors focused on four distinct time periods: from the second century to 80 BCE; after 80 BCE, when Pompeii became a Roman colony; the reign of Emperor Augustus (31 BCE to 14 CE); and after the earthquake that rocked the city in 62 CE. It was easy enough to collect calcium carbonate samples during field work in 2016 and 2017. The team had to sample present-day groundwater and springs believed to have supplied the aqueduct; however, acknowledging that the properties may have changed significantly, particularly after the 79 CE eruption.

The specific sites studied included the Stabian baths and related structures, which were built after 130 BCE and remained active until the aforementioned eruption; the Republican baths, built around the same period but abandoned around 30 BCE; the Forum baths, built after 80 BCE; and the aqueduct and its 14 water towers, constructed during the Augustan period.

There were variations in the chemical composition of the deposits, indicating the replacement of boilers for heating water and a renewal of water pipes in the infrastructure of Pompeii, particularly during the time period when modifications were being made to the Republican baths. The results for the Republican baths’ heated pools, for instance, showed clear contamination from human activity, specifically human waste (sweat, sebum, urine, or bathing oil), which suggests the water wasn’t changed regularly.

That is consistent with the limitations of supplying water at the time; the water-lifting machines could really only refresh the water about once a day. After the well shaft was enlarged, the carbonate deposits were much thinner, evidence of technological improvements that reduced sloshing as the water was raised. Once the aqueduct had been built, the bathing facilities were expanded with a likely corresponding improvement in hygiene.

On the whole, the aqueduct was a net good for Pompeii. “The changes in the water supply system of Pompeii revealed by carbonate deposits show an evolution from well-based to aqueduct-based supply with an increase in available water volume and in the scale of the bathing facilities, and likely an increase in hygiene,” the authors concluded. Granted, there was evidence of lead contamination in the water, particularly that supplied by the aqueduct, but carbonate deposits in the lead pipes seem to have reduced those levels over time.

The results may also help resolve a scientific debate about the origins of the aqueduct water: Was it water from the town of Avella that connected to the Aqua Augusta aqueduct or from the wells of Pompeii/springs of Vesuvius? Per the authors, the stable isotope composition of carbonate in the aqueduct is inconsistent with carbonate from volcanic rock sources, thus supporting the Avella source hypothesis.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/supreme-court-takes-case-that-could-strip-fcc-of-authority-to-issue-fines/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Supreme Court will hear a case that could invalidate the Federal Communications Commission’s authority to issue fines against companies regulated by the FCC.

AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile challenged the FCC’s ability to punish them after the commission fined the carriers for selling customer location data without their users’ consent. AT&T convinced the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to overturn its fine, while Verizon lost in the 2nd Circuit and T-Mobile lost in the District of Columbia Circuit.

Verizon petitioned the Supreme Court to reverse its loss, while the FCC and Justice Department petitioned the court to overturn AT&T’s victory in the 5th Circuit. The Supreme Court granted both petitions to hear the challenges and consolidated the cases in a list of orders released Friday. Oral arguments will be held.

In 2024, the FCC fined the big three carriers a total of $196 million for location data sales revealed in 2018, saying the companies were punished “for illegally sharing access to customers’ location information without consent and without taking reasonable measures to protect that information against unauthorized disclosure.” Carriers challenged in three appeals courts, arguing that the fines violated their Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.

The carriers’ cases against the FCC rely on the Supreme Court’s June 2024 ruling in Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy, which held that a similar but not identical SEC system for issuing fines violated the right to a jury trial.

The conservative-leaning 5th Circuit appeals court decided that the FCC violated AT&T’s rights while “act[ing] as prosecutor, jury, and judge.” But the 2nd Circuit and District of Columbia Circuit courts found that each carrier could have obtained a jury trial if it simply decided not to pay the fine.

“Verizon could have gotten such a trial” if it had “declined to pay the forfeiture and preserved its opportunity for a de novo jury trial if the government sought to collect,” the 2nd Circuit judges wrote. Instead, Verizon chose to pay the fine “and seek immediate review in our Court.” That option didn’t exist in the SEC v. Jarkesy case because of differences between US telecom law and securities law, the court said.

Verizon’s petition to the Supreme Court seeks a ruling on “whether the Communications Act violates the Seventh Amendment and Article III [of the Constitution] by authorizing the FCC to order the payment of monetary penalties for failing to reasonably safeguard customer data, without guaranteeing the defendant carrier a right to a jury trial.”

Verizon argued that the option of refusing to pay the fine doesn’t satisfy its right to a jury trial:

If a carrier wants to guarantee judicial review, it must pay the penalty and then seek review in a court of appeals, which reviews the agency’s order on the administrative record under the deferential standards of the Administrative Procedure Act. If the carrier wants a jury trial, by contrast, it must defy the FCC’s order and refuse to pay, after which the Department of Justice may, but is not required to, file a lawsuit in district court to collect the unpaid forfeiture. While waiting for that DOJ lawsuit that might never come, the carrier suffers serious practical and reputational harms from the final FCC order.

FCC Chairman Brendan Carr voted against the fines last year, arguing that the Biden-era FCC overstepped its authority. But Carr’s argument was about FCC authority to regulate data privacy practices, not the right to a jury trial, and the FCC has continued to defend its legal process since Carr took over as chairman.

The Trump administration petition in the AT&T case said the 5th Circuit ruling “conflicts with this Court’s precedents and with decisions of two other courts of appeals.” The brief said a Supreme Court precedent from 1899 states that “the Constitution ‘does not prescribe at what stage of an action a trial by jury’ must occur, and that a statute may authorize such a trial ‘for the first time upon appeal’ from an initial decision.”

A 1915 Supreme Court ruling upheld a similar scheme “under which an executive agency could issue initial decisions finding regulated parties liable for money damages, subject to review by a jury in an Article III court,” the government told the Supreme Court. The 5th Circuit ruling “identified no basis for distinguishing this case from those precedents,” and “has serious practical consequences, since it deprives the Commission of one of its most important regulatory remedies and severely impairs the agency’s ability to enforce federal communications law,” the government brief said.

While the Supreme Court is only taking up the AT&T and Verizon cases, the T-Mobile case would be affected by whatever ruling the Supreme Court issues. T-Mobile is seeking a rehearing in the District of Columbia Circuit, an effort that could be boosted or rendered moot by whatever the Supreme Court decides.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/apps-like-grok-are-explicitly-banned-under-googles-rules-why-is-it-still-in-the-play-store/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s xAI recently weakened content guard rails for image generation in the Grok AI bot. This led to a new spate of non-consensual sexual imagery on X, much of it aimed at silencing women on the platform. This, along with the creation of sexualized images of children in the more compliant Grok, has led regulators to begin investigating xAI. In the meantime, Google has rules in place for exactly this eventuality—it’s just not enforcing them.

It really could not be more clear from Google’s publicly available policies that Grok should have been banned yesterday. And yet, it remains in the Play Store. Not only that—it enjoys a T for Teen rating, one notch below the M-rated X app. Apple also still offers the Grok app on its platform, but its rules actually leave more wiggle room.

App content restrictions at Apple and Google have evolved in very different ways. From the start, Apple has been prone to removing apps on a whim, so developers have come to expect that Apple’s guidelines may not mention every possible eventuality. As Google has shifted from a laissez-faire attitude to more hard-nosed control of the Play Store, it has progressively piled on clarifications in the content policy. As a result, Google’s rules are spelled out in no uncertain terms, and Grok runs afoul of them.

Google has a dedicated support page that explains how to interpret its “Inappropriate Content” policy for the Play Store. Like Apple, the rules begin with a ban on apps that contain or promote sexual content including, but not limited to, pornography. That’s where Apple stops, but Google goes on to list more types of content and experiences that it considers against the rules.

“We don’t allow apps that contain or promote content associated with sexually predatory behavior, or distribute non-consensual sexual content,” the Play Store policy reads (emphasis ours). So the policy is taking aim at apps like Grok, but this line on its own could be read as focused on apps featuring “real” sexual content. However, Google is very thorough and has helpfully explained that this rule covers AI.

The detailed policy includes examples of content that violate this rule, which include much of what you’d expect—nothing lewd or profane, no escort services, and no illegal sexual themes. After a spate of rudimentary “nudify” apps in 2020 and 2021, Google added language to this page clarifying that “apps that claim to undress people” are not allowed in Google Play. In 2023, as the AI boom got underway, Google added another line to note that it also would remove apps that contained “non-consensual sexual content created via deepfake or similar technology.”

Taken together, Google’s description of bannable apps describes Grok’s app to a tee. Google made these additions as new threats became apparent, knowing that developers would try to publish AI-undressing apps in the Play Store. The company did not, apparently, think the world’s richest person would be the one pushing digital humiliation tools on its platform. And Google’s response to this situation so far has been to do nothing.

The backlash to xAI’s loosened restrictions prompted the company to limit access to image editing slightly. You can no longer edit images on X without paying for a premium plan. However, the Grok app does not have that limitation. Anyone who downloads Grok can use it to create non-consensual sexual content.

Since the app is cleared for teens, even devices with parental controls enabled will permit 13- to 17-year-olds to download Grok. There is no paywall, and you don’t even have to log in before editing your first image. The app does ask the user to confirm their birth year, but teenagers would never lie about that, right?

This is not xAI’s first problem with non-consensual sexual content. Last year, the AI was widely used to create fake Taylor Swift nudes. However, in that case, users were simply prompting the bot with the singer’s name—Grok can create entirely new images of famous people because the training data includes real images of them. Grok’s newer ability to “edit” images of people is a different and more insidious feature because it can turn anyone into an AI plaything.

Ars has reached out to Google to ask why Grok has not been removed and why it has retained a Teen rating. The company has declined to make a statement at this time. So we’re left with a policy that explicitly bans apps like Grok, but Google is taking no action to enforce those policies, allowing impressionable teenagers and unsavory weirdos to use it to sexualize real people.</div>

            <h2>NASA launches new mission to get the most out of the James Webb Space Telescope</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/nasas-newest-telescope-will-play-an-outsize-role-in-finding-earth-2-0/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Among other things, the James Webb Space Telescope is designed to get us closer to finding habitable worlds around faraway stars. From its perch a million miles from Earth, Webb’s huge gold-coated mirror collects more light than any other telescope put into space.

The Webb telescope, launched in 2021 at a cost of more than $10 billion, has the sensitivity to peer into distant planetary systems and detect the telltale chemical fingerprints of molecules critical to or indicative of potential life, like water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane. Webb can do this while also observing the oldest observable galaxies in the Universe and studying planets, moons, and smaller objects within our own Solar System.

Naturally, astronomers want to get the most out of their big-budget observatory. That’s where NASA’s Pandora mission comes in.

The Pandora satellite rocketed into orbit early Sunday from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. It hitched a ride with around 40 other small payloads aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, launching into a polar Sun-synchronous orbit before deploying at an altitude of roughly 380 miles (613 kilometers).

Over the next few weeks, ground controllers will put Pandora through a series of commissioning and calibration steps before turning its eyes toward deep space. Pandora is a fraction of the size of Webb. Its primary mirror is about the size of the largest consumer-grade amateur telescopes, less than one-tenth the dimension of Webb’s. NASA capped Pandora’s budget at $20 million. The budget to develop Webb was more than 500 times higher.

So what can little Pandora add to Webb’s bleeding-edge science? First, it helps to understand how scientists use Webb to study exoplanets. When a planet passes in front of its parent star, some of the starlight shines through its atmosphere. Webb has the sensitivity to detect the filtered starlight and break it apart into its spectral components, telling astronomers about the composition of clouds and hazes in the planet’s atmosphere. Ultimately, the data is useful in determining whether an exoplanet might be like Earth.

“I liken it often to holding a glass of wine in front of a candle, so that we can see really what’s inside,” said Daniel Apai, a member of Pandora’s science team from the University of Arizona. “We can assess, basically, the quality of the wine. In this case, we use the light that filters through the star’s [atmosphere] through the planetary atmosphere to judge what chemicals, gases in particular, may be present. Water vapor is one that we are the most sensitive to.”

But there’s a catch. Stars shine millions to billions of times brighter than their planetary companions, and starlight isn’t constant. Like the Sun, other stars have spots, flares, and variability over hours, days, or years. Hot spots and cool spots rotate in and out of view. And the star’s own atmospheres can contain some of the same molecules scientists are seeking to find on exoplanets, including water vapor.

Therefore, a star’s spectral signature easily outshines the signal coming from a nearby planet. Astronomers discovered this signal “contamination” when they started looking for potentially habitable worlds, injecting confounding uncertainties into their findings. Were the promising spectra they were seeing coming from the planet or the star?

“One of the ways that this manifests is by making you think that you’re seeing absorption features like water and potentially methane when there may not be any, or, conversely, you’re not seeing the signatures that are there because they’re masked by the stellar signal,” said Tom Barclay, deputy project scientist and technical lead on the Pandora mission at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.

The problem became apparent in the 2010s as astronomers used more powerful telescopes to see the finer details of exoplanets.

“This is something that we always suspected as a community,” Apai told Ars. “We always suspected that stars are not perfect. At some point, it becomes a problem. But it was not recognized how serious a problem that is until, I would say, about 2017 or 2018.”

Scientists quickly got to work looking for a solution, and NASA selected the Pandora mission for development in 2021, just months before the launch of Webb.

“When we’re trying to find water in the atmospheres of these small Earth-like planets, we want to be really sure it’s not coming from the star before we go tell the press and make a big stink about it,” said Elisa Quintana, Pandora’s lead scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “So we designed the Pandora mission specifically to solve this problem.”

From low-Earth orbit, Pandora will observe exoplanets and their stars simultaneously, allowing astronomers to correct their measurements of the planet’s atmospheric composition and structure based on the ever-changing conditions of the host star itself. Webb could theoretically do this work, but scientists already fill every hour of Webb’s schedule. Pandora will point and stare at 20 preselected exoplanets 10 times during its one-year prime mission, collecting 24 hours of visible and infrared observations with each visit. This will capture short-term and longer-term changes in each star’s behavior.

SpaceX launched Pandora into a so-called “twilight orbit” that follows the boundary between day and night on Earth, allowing the satellite to keep its solar panels illuminated by the Sun while performing its observations.

“We can send this small telescope out, sit on a star for a really long time, and sort of map all the star spots, and really disentangle the star and planet signals,” Quintana said in a recent panel discussion at NASA Goddard. “It’s filling a really nice gap in helping us to sort of calibrate all these stars that James Webb is going to look at, so we can be really confident that all of these molecules that we’re detecting in planets are real.”

“I think this is really the most important scientific barrier that we have to break down to fully unlock the potential of Webb and future missions,” Apai said.

Ben Hord, a member of Pandora’s science team at Goddard, singled out one example in a presentation at an American Astronomical Society meeting last year. This planet, named GJ 486 b, is a “super-Earth” discovered in 2021 circling a relatively cool red dwarf star. Hord said astronomers had trouble determining if the planet has a water-rich atmosphere based on Webb’s observations alone.

“We want to know if water is in the atmospheres of these exoplanets, and this stellar contamination from the spots on the star can mask or mimic features like water,” Hord said. “Our hope is that Pandora will help James Webb data be even more precise by providing context and understanding for these host stars and these planetary systems.”

Planets around small dwarf stars are some of the best candidates for finding a true Earth analog. Because these stars put out a fraction of the heat of the Sun, a potentially habitable planet could lurk very close to its host, completing a year in a handful of days. This allows astronomers to see the planet repeatedly as it passes in front of its star, rapidly building a dataset on its size, structure, and environment.

Scientists hope they can extend the lessons learned from Pandora’s observations of a sample of 20 exoplanets to other worlds in our galactic neighborhood. As of late last year, astronomers have confirmed detections of more than 6,000 exoplanets.

“With a well-corrected spectrum, we can say there’s water, there’s nitrogen,” Quintana said. “So with every mission, as we evolve, we’re chipping away and taking bigger and bigger steps toward that question of, ‘OK, we know Earths are out there. We know they’re abundant. We know they have atmospheres. How do we know if they have life on them?’”

A mission like Pandora was not possible until recently, certainly not on the $20 million budget NASA devoted to the project. With Pandora, the agency took advantage of a fast-growing small satellite industry churning out spacecraft at a fraction of what it cost 10 or 15 years ago.

The Pandora spacecraft weighed approximately 716 pounds (325 kilograms) at launch and likely would have required a dedicated rocket to travel to space before SpaceX started offering shared rides on its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket. NASA did not disclose what it paid SpaceX to launch Pandora, but publicly available pricing suggests SpaceX charges a few million dollars to launch a satellite of the same size. Before the rideshare option became available, NASA would have paid tens of millions of dollars for the launch alone.

The Pandora mission is part of NASA’s Astrophysics Pioneers program, an initiative set up to solicit ideas for lower-cost astronomy missions.

“It’s been very, very challenging to try and squeeze this big amount of science into this small cost box, but that’s kind of what makes it fun, right?” Barclay told Ars. “We have to be pretty ruthless in making sure that we only fund the things we need to fund. We accept risk where we need to accept the risk, and at times we need to accept that we may need to give up performance in order to make sure that we hit the schedule and we hit the launch [schedule].”

It helps that Pandora’s 17-inch (45-centimeter) telescope comes from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, which had the technology on the shelf from a national security program. Pandora uses a small satellite platform from Blue Canyon Technologies, a Colorado company.

“There is no way we could have done Pandora 10 years ago,” Barclay said. “The small launch capabilities that come from companies like Rocket Lab and SpaceX and others meant that now the vendors of spacecraft buses and spacecraft instruments are able to push their costs down because they know that there’s a market for small missions out there. Other parts of the government are investing heavily in small spacecraft, and so that allows us on the science side to make use of that economies of scale.”

For comparison, the European Space Agency launched an exoplanet observatory about the same size as Pandora in 2019 at a cost of more than $100 million.

There are companies now looking at how to scale up production of larger satellites, too. Cheaper, heavy satellites could launch on new heavy- and super-heavy rockets like SpaceX’s Starship or Blue Origin’s New Glenn.

“I think it is an amazing capability to have for astrophysicists because science is moving fast,” Apai said. “Exoplanet science is changing. I would say every three or four years, we have breakthroughs. And the product keeps changing. We push the boundaries, and if you ever have to work with 20- or 25-year-long mission lifetimes, that really just limits progress.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2026/01/apple-says-its-new-ai-powered-siri-will-use-googles-gemini-language-models/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The “more intelligent” version of Siri that Apple plans to release later this year will be backed by Google’s Gemini language models, the company announced today. CNBC reports that the deal is part of a “multi-year partnership” between Apple and Google that will allow Apple to use Google’s AI models in its own software.

“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” reads an Apple statement given to CNBC.

Today’s announcement confirms reporting by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman late last year that Apple and Google were nearing a deal. Apple didn’t disclose terms, but Gurman said that Apple would be paying Google “about $1 billion a year” for access to its AI models “following an extensive evaluation period.”

Bloomberg has also reported that the Gemini model would be run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers, “ensuring that user data remains walled off from Google’s infrastructure,” and that Apple still hopes to improve its own in-house language models to the point that they can eventually be used instead of relying on third-party models.

Although Apple’s iPhones and iOS compete with Google’s Android operating system and the many smartphones that use it, the companies still cooperate in plenty of other areas. Google has paid Apple billions of dollars to remain the default search engine in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (though that deal has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years).

Apple’s announcement is a blow to OpenAI and the many versions of its ChatGPT model, which Apple has used elsewhere in iOS and macOS. Bloomberg reports that Apple also tested OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude models before deciding to go with Gemini. ChatGPT came out ahead of Gemini in tests that Ars ran using earlier versions of the models, but Google’s models have apparently improved enough (and amassed enough users) to worry OpenAI; CEO Sam Altman declared a “code red” last month and pushed back several planned ChatGPT features so that the company could better respond to Google’s Gemini 3 release.

Apple originally promised the improved, AI-powered Siri for 2024’s iOS 18 release, but ultimately delayed the feature because it didn’t work reliably enough. The new version of Siri should arrive in an update to iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 Tahoe later this year.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Six and a half years ago—after a failed corporate sale attempt, massive financial losses, and the departure/layoff of many key staff—I wrote about what seemed at the time like the “imminent demise” of GameStop. Now, after five years of meme stock mania that helped prop up the company’s finances a bit, I’ll admit the video game and Funko Pop retailer has lasted much longer as a relevant entity than I anticipated.

GameStop’s surprisingly extended run may be coming to an end, though, with Polygon reporting late last week that GameStop has abruptly shut down 400 stores across the US, with even more closures expected before the end of the month. That comes on top of 590 US stores that were shuttered in fiscal 2024 (which ended in January 2025) and stated plans to close hundreds of remaining international stores across Canada, Australia, and Europe in the coming months, per SEC filings.

GameStop still had just over 3,200 stores worldwide as of February 1, 2025, so even hundreds of new and planned store closures don’t literally mean the immediate end of the company as a going concern. But when you consider that there were still nearly 6,000 GameStop locations worldwide as of 2019—nearly 4,000 of which were in the US—the long-term trend is clear.

The reason for that downward trend has been equally clear for years now: downloadable games. We made note back in 2017 when more than half of Destiny 2’s game sales came via download rather than disc, and things have only accelerated from there. Physical game sales now represent just 3 percent of overall PlayStation revenue, for instance, compared to 20 percent for digital full-game software sales, 17 percent for subscription-based “network services” like PlayStation Plus, and 29 percent for digital “add-on content” like DLC. Some major games are skipping physical releases altogether these days, while Nintendo is selling data-free Switch 2 Game Key Cards that merely act as a key for a downloadable copy of the game.

Just as Tower Records couldn’t continue to exist in a world where almost all music was being downloaded or streamed, a chain devoted to selling games on physical discs can’t sustain itself in a world where the vast majority of game spending is now online.

Seeing the writing on the wall, GameStop has made a number of attempts to rebrand around something other than selling (or re-selling) physical video games. Anyone else remember the chain’s abortive attempt to restructure around “high margin immersive experiential gaming content” like esports? How about the rollout of “GameStop Retro” locations that sell games and hardware dating back to the last century? Or the much-hyped NFT marketplace that GameStop quietly wound down in 2023?

The latest attempt at a GameStop corporate pivot seems to be toward collectible trading cards, via in-store partnerships with card-grading agencies and a “Power Pack” program combining digital and physical card sales in some novel ways. But a world where GameStop is the place to trade in a $30,000 Pokémon card isn’t at all the same as the one where millions of people traded in Madden 09 discs for a couple of bucks of GameStop store credit.

So even though GameStop has lasted longer than I expected, I’m still relatively confident in predicting that the end is coming for the retailer sooner rather than later. Who knows, though, maybe I’ll be writing another article like this in 2033, marveling at how a once-lumbering giant in the world of video game sales is somehow continuing to limp along.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a video posted to social media in November, senator and former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly encouraged members of the military to “refuse illegal orders.”

The 90-second video,which was put together by Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers, was part of a broader objection to controversial US military operations against Venezuela, which have since turned from attacks on individual boats into an invasion, including strikes on the Venezuelan capital of Caracas and the kidnapping of its president Nicolás Maduro.

Defense secretary Pete Hegseth was outraged after the video was published, accusing Kelly of “seditious behavior.” President Donald Trump piled on by warning that such behavior is “punishable by death” and implying that figures like Kelly could be hanged.

While Hegseth has yet to make good on his previous threat of “court-martial proceedings” — which would see Kelly be put into active service to prosecute him in military court, per the Wall Street Journal — he announced last week that Kelly would be demoted and that his retirement pay would be significantly cut as a result.

Now Kelly is fighting back. He filed a lawsuit against Hegseth today, accusing him of violating the US Constitution.

“His unconstitutional crusade against me sends a chilling message to every retired member of the military,” Kelly said in a statement. “If you speak out and say something that the President or Secretary of Defense doesn’t like, you will be censured, threatened with demotion, or even prosecuted.”

Kelly was an aviator for the US Navy for decades and flew 39 combat missions before becoming a NASA astronaut. He flew on three NASA Space Shuttle missions in the early 2000s and retired from the agency after his wife, former Arizona representative Gabby Giffords, was shot and almost killed in a 2011 assassination attempt. Kelly and Giffords have since become outspoken advocates for tougher gun control.

“Pete Hegseth wants our longest-serving military veterans to live with the constant threat that they could be deprived of their rank and pay years or even decades after they leave the military just because he or another Secretary of Defense doesn’t like what they’ve said,” Kelly added. “That’s not the way things work in the United States of America, and I won’t stand for it.”

The original video that kicked off the stand-off was designed to remind soldiers that they didn’t have to follow unconstitutional orders.

“This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,” the Democratic lawmakers said in the video. “Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution.”

After Hegseth called the video “despicable, reckless, and false,” Kelly denied he did anything wrong.

“In combat, I had a missile blow up next to my jet and flew through anti-aircraft fire to drop bombs on enemy targets,” he said in a November statement. “At NASA, I launched on a rocket, commanded the space shuttle, and was part of the recovery mission that brought home the bodies of my astronaut classmates who died on Columbia.”

“I did all of this in service to this country that I love and has given me so much,” he added. “I’ve given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.”

Nobody knows how Kelly’s lawsuit against Hegseth will play out — but considering the stakes involved and Hegseth’s sheer amount of influence in the White House, it could turn into an ugly and drawn-out legal battle.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To push back against AI, some call for blowing up data centers.

If that’s too extreme for your tastes, then you might be interested in another project, which instead advocates for poisoning the resource that the AI industry needs most, in a bid to cut off its power at the source.

Called Poison Fountain, the project aims to trick tech companies’ web crawlers into vacuuming up “poisoned” training data that sabotages AI models.  If pulled off at a large enough scale, it could in theory be a serious thorn in the AI industry’s side — turning their billion dollar machines into malfunctioning messes.

The project, reported on by The Register, launched last week. And strikingly, its members work for major US AI companies, according to The Register’s source, who warns that the “situation is escalating in a way the public is not generally aware of.”

“We agree with Geoffrey Hinton: machine intelligence is a threat to the human species,” reads a statement on the project’s website, referring to the British computer scientist who is considered a godfather of the field, and who has become one of the industry’s most prominent critics. “In response to this threat we want to inflict damage on machine intelligence systems.”

A key tipping point for the modern AI boom wasn’t just the architecture of the AI models themselves, but the revelation that they would need to be trained on vast troves of data that were once thought to be unfeasible to obtain. The explosion of the internet conveniently provided a gold mine of freely available information, which was scraped in unbelievable quantities. Many argue that this practice was not only unethical but illegal, spawning numerous copyright lawsuits.

Generally, an AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. Jumble that data, and you jumble the AI. Some efforts have already tried to foil AI models with this approach, including software used to subtly embed images with disruptive data so artists could ward off AIs copying their work.

Poison Fountain is a call-to-action to pull off something similar, on a huge scale. To do this, it provides links to poisoned data sets that website owners can hide in their web pages to trick AI web crawlers. The links, the project promises, “provide a practically endless stream of poisoned training data.” The project insider explained to The Register that the hazardous data comprises code that contains logic errors and other bugs that can damage large language models trained on it.

It’s a clever way of disrupting the AI industry’s rapid expansion, though it remains to be seen how widely adopted the method will be, or if AI companies will be able to easily sift it out of their scraped data hoards.

Needless to say, it’s also not the only work being done to rein in unbridled AI, with numerous groups advocating for stringent regulation, and a slew of copyright suits that threaten to seriously hinder tech companies’ ability to vacuum up data. But those at Poison Fountain argue that regulation alone isn’t the answer, since AI is already widely available.

“Poisoning attacks compromise the cognitive integrity of the model,” the project insider told The Register. “There’s no way to stop the advance of this technology, now that it is disseminated worldwide. What’s left is weapons. This Poison Fountain is an example of such a weapon.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Economic uncertainty is continuing to have devastating effects on the availability of jobs. Last year, the US labor market reeled from slowing wages, layoffs, and a notable lack of hiring, leading to the highest unemployment rate in the country in four years toward the end of 2025.

And while debate swirls about whether AI is actually replacing jobs in any serious numbers, many tech startups are trying to make it a reality. As the Wall Street Journal reports, a buzzy San Francisco-based AI company called Mercor is hiring desperate job-seekers for a particularly ghoulish task: training AI models to one day do the work they used to do.

It’s a depressing new reality as concerns over AI replacing jobs en masse continue to grow. Late last year, computer scientist and AI “godfather” Geoffrey Hinton predicted that AI would continue to “replace many, many jobs” in 2026 as the tech “gets even better.”

An MIT study also found last year that more than 20 million Americans’ work can be replaced with today’s AI, representing $1.2 trillion in wage value.

Paying those who are already struggling to find work in a disastrous job market to train their future replacements is a twisted new reality in the age of AI, leading to plenty of dark humor.

“I joked with my friends I’m training AI to take my job someday,” 30-year-old video editor Katie Williams, who has been captioning and rating video clips for Mercor for six months, told the WSJ.

Automotive journalist Peter Valdes-Dapena, who was laid off in 2024, has been critiquing AI-generated news articles for Mercor. The irony doesn’t escape him, but he rationalizes it away.

“I didn’t invent AI and I’m not going to uninvent it,” he told the newspaper. “If I were to stop doing this, would that stop it? The answer is no.”

Mercor hired tens of thousands of contractors last year after signing partnerships with AI industry stalwarts including OpenAI and Anthropic. Job security and a stable income appear to be hard to come by, with the company suddenly firing thousands of data labelers last year, for instance — only to hire them back on for a similar project, but for considerably less pay.

As a spokeswoman told the WSJ, contractors need to install time-tracking software on their computers to make sure they aren’t cutting corners. She said that some were even caught using AI to rate AI model outputs.

Some, however, remain skeptical of the tech’s ability to replace human workers wholesale. Lawyer Sara Kubik, who has been supplementing her income by working for Mercor, told the newspaper that the work has “taught me the limitations of AI.”

Indeed, researchers have already found that companies may be massively overestimating what AI can do. For instance, a Carnegie Mellon University study found that even the best AI models available at the time failed to complete real-world office tasks 70 percent of the time.

            <div id="article-text">Using early data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is set to kick off full operations later this spring, an international team of astronomers has discovered an asteroid that spins so fast, it should’ve torn itself apart.

The unusual cosmic lump — dubbed 2025 MN45, 2,300 feet in diameter and located in the Main Asteroid Belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter — completes a full rotation every minute and 53 seconds, as detailed in a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

While that may not sound like all that fast at first blush, it’s an astonishing feat considering the object’s sheer bulk. The centrifugal forces involved should’ve already overcome its estimated structural integrity, the researchers found, especially if it were a “rubble pile” made up of smaller rocks, like many other asteroids in the Main Belt.

It’s an especially surprising finding, considering that most distant asteroids were thought to be spinning at much slower rates, as Science Alert points out.

“For objects in the main asteroid belt, the fast-rotation limit to avoid being fragmented is 2.2 hours; asteroids spinning faster than this must be structurally strong to remain intact,” the paper reads. “The faster an asteroid spins above this limit, and the larger its size, the stronger the material it must be made from.”

The team used data collected during the Rubin Observatory’s commissioning phase in the spring of last year to discover 2025 MN45, one of three “ultrafast rotators” that complete a full rotation in less than five minutes. They also found 16 “superfast” rotators with periods between 13 minutes and 2.2 hours. All 19 are larger in diameter than the length of an American football field.

“Clearly, this asteroid must be made of material that has very high strength in order to keep it in one piece as it spins so rapidly,” said Sarah Greenstreet, study lead and assistant astronomer at the National Science Foundation National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIRLab), in a statement. “We calculate that it would need a cohesive strength similar to that of solid rock.”

“This is somewhat surprising since most asteroids are believed to be what we call ‘rubble pile’ asteroids, which means they are made of many, many small pieces of rock and debris that coalesced under gravity during Solar System formation or subsequent collisions,” she added.

Asteroids beyond the orbit of Mars are very faint and extremely hard to spot. But thanks to the Rubin Observatory’s extremely light-sensitive sensors, the team was able to discover the most distant fast rotators ever spotted.

It’s the first peer-reviewed study that’s based on data from the observatory, and a sure sign that many more discoveries from it are still to come.

“As this study demonstrates, even in early commissioning, Rubin is successfully allowing us to study a population of relatively small, very-rapidly-rotating main-belt asteroids that hadn’t been reachable before,” Greenstreet said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A dead star 730 light years away appears to be forming a powerful structure around itself — and despite their best efforts, astronomers aren’t sure how.

The cosmic corpse, designated RXJ0528+2838, is an incredibly dense stellar remnant known as a white dwarf, with a Sun-like star orbiting around it. This binary arrangement isn’t uncommon throughout the universe, but what is strange is the structure surrounding the former body: a highly energetic and luminescent cloud known as a nebula, even though there doesn’t appear to be anything that could be forming it.

“Our observations reveal a powerful outflow that, according to our current understanding, shouldn’t be there,” said Krystian Iłkiewicz, a researcher at the Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center in Warsaw, Poland, and co-lead author of a new study published in the journal Nature Astronomy, in a statement.

White dwarfs are what’s left over when stars of moderate mass like our Sun exhaust all their fuel, shed their outer layers, and expose a dense core.

In many cases of binary systems, the white dwarf starts stealing material from its stellar companion. As it does so, the stolen matter forms a luminous ring around itself known as an accretion disc. Then, as the star slowly revolves around the galactic center and moves through space, it creates a shock wave in the nebula called a bow shock, which is a “curved arc of material, similar to the wave that builds up in front of a ship,” explained coauthor Noel Castro Segura, a researcher at the University of Warwick in the UK, in the statement.

RXJ0528+2838 defies this common understanding, however, because it doesn’t show any sign of having an accretion disc. Moreover, the team’s images taken with the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope also rules out that it was caused by a thermonuclear explosion called a nova that commonly occurs when enough stolen material accumulates on the white dwarf’s surface and explodes. Adding to the incredible nature, the size of the bow shock suggests that the white dwarf has been producing an outflow for at least 1,000 years, which seems improbable for a dead star.

“The surprise that a supposedly quiet, discless system could drive such a spectacular nebula was one of those rare ‘wow’ moments,”  said co-lead author Simone Scaringi, an associate professor at Durham University in the UK, in the statement.

Everything points to the star siphoning material from its stellar companion but without forming a disc around itself. The researchers’ best guess is that this has something to do with the white dwarf’s powerful magnetic field somehow powering the outflows.

“Our finding shows that even without a disc, these systems can drive powerful outflows, revealing a mechanism we do not yet understand,” Iłkiewicz said. “This discovery challenges the standard picture of how matter moves and interacts in these extreme binary systems.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Despite an economy that’s booming on paper, economists are warning that the middle class is being squeezed as new jobs aren’t materializing fast enough to make up for the ones we’re losing.

It’s a grim economic outlook for those who are already struggling to make ends meet. At the same time, sports betting is taking off, with experts warning of a surge in gambling addiction. And online “prediction market” platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi are taking things even further, allowing practically anybody to bet their hard-earned cash on dubious predictions, like whether the US will invade Venezuela — without any meaningful regulatory oversight to protect them from scams, insider trading, and financial ruin.

Even cable television is embracing the worrying trend. Case in point, CBS‘ 83rd Golden Globes award show showed a live ticker of Polymarket predictions for various awards during its Sunday evening broadcast of the event — actively encouraging viewers to gamble on the platform.

Some predictions turned out totally wrong, with “Sinners” taking a clear front lead on Polymarket for Best Drama, only for “Hamnet” to take the prize. Others triumphed, with the majority of users correctly betting on Paul Thomas Anderson winning Best Director for “One Battle After Another.”

Bets for the evening closed up at 7 am Sunday morning on Polymarket, which means live viewers were unable to get in on the fun. Nonetheless, onlookers were appalled at the pointed inclusion, turning the storied awards show into a glorified gambling ad. Many pointed out that the Golden Globes had already struggled with viewership in recent years, amidst a series of scandals involving corruption, racism, and even sexual assault.

In other words, encouraging crypto-based gambling was the cherry on top.

“‘The Golden Globes Best Podcast odds presented by Polymarket’ is a new low for this humiliating awards show,” tweeted Semafor senior social media editor Josh Billinson.

“The Golden Globes incorporating Polymarket betting ON SCREEN is genuinely disgusting, and we need to push back on these pocket casinos at every opportunity,” online celebrity Matt Bernstein wrote.

“We’re so deep into capitalism that the Golden Globes are showing [P]olymarket betting odds on award winners… we’re so cooked,” another user.

The Golden Globes’ owner, Penske Media Corp., announced the eyebrow-raising pairing-up between the Donald Trump Jr.-funded prediction platform and the Larry Ellison-run broadcaster last week.

“Our partnership with Polymarket unlocks a groundbreaking new frontier, redefining how audiences engage with and connect to the content they love,” said president Craig Perreault in a statement. “Deepening the connection between fans and their favorite films, shows, and actors strengthens the entertainment industry and highlights the award-winning content celebrated at the Golden Globes.”

Penske-owned publications, including Variety,Deadline, and The Hollywood Reporter, breathlessly promoted the partnership, as The Wrap reports, suggesting a troubling degree of editorial influence.

The timing of the partnership couldn’t have been worse. The news comes just days after Polymarket became embroiled in a major insider trading scandal after a mystery trader made more than $400,000 by making incredibly well-timed bets on the United States’ attacks on Venezuela — just hours before the US invaded the South American country.

In a certain sense, the Golden Globes flap is fitting; the awards show has long garnered a reputation for being pay-to-play, giving preferential treatment to those willing to line Penske’s pockets.

To many, directly encouraging users to bet on awards during an awards ceremony is not just irritating; it’s a sign of the times we live in, as gambling becomes a mainstay part of Americans’ everyday lives.

“This is like watching a car crash in real time,” one user lamented.

“Polymarket odds on the telecast of the Golden Globes,” another wrote. “Just push me in front of a bus at this point.”

Others poked fun at Penske achieving a new low.

“Heartfelt congratulations to Penske Media for achieving its highest state of being,” author Mark Harris wrote mockingly on Bluesky.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Smart rings, smart screens, smart TVs, smart pins, smart … ice cube makers? Sure, why not! AI was everywhere at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, where companies large and small were showing off how they’re bringing AI to more devices. For Amazon, CES was a time to show off its newest acquisition in the space: Bee, an AI device that can be worn as a clip-on pin or a bracelet.

Amazon already has an entry in the AI consumer devices space with Alexa, whose upgraded AI-powered version, Alexa+, can run on 97% of the hardware devices Amazon has shipped. However, with Bee, the company is gaining access to a wearable that could extend its reach outside the home.

Largely designed for recording conversations like interviews, meetings, or classes, Bee also works as an AI companion. The AI has access to world knowledge, and it learns more about you from a combination of your recordings and the services you permit it to access like Gmail, Google Calendar, your phone’s contacts, and Apple Health.

Given that Amazon has already tried integrating Alexa into wearables like earbuds and glasses, it could seem like the company is muddying the waters with the addition of another AI companion. However, those earlier Alexa devices have not taken off in the face of competition like Apple’s AirPods and Meta’s Ray Ban AI glasses. Amazon seems to understand this, which is why it’s adding Bee to its lineup.

“We see each other as complementary friends,” says Bee co-founder Maria de Lourdes Zollo of Bee’s relationship with Alexa, in an interview at CES last week. “Bee has the understanding of outside the house, and Alexa has the understanding of inside the house. Of course, there will be a future where these two things come together.”

That future doesn’t yet mean Bee’s AI will be replaced by Alexa. Noted Amazon Alexa VP Daniel Rausch, Amazon thinks what the team at Bee created is an “important and lovable experience.” He describes Bee as a “deeply engaging and personal” AI, but he also agreed that, at some point, Alexa and Bee would come together.

“We know that it will create even more benefit for customers than what [the AI experiences] do on their own,” Rausch explained. “When you have access to the power of these AI experiences with you throughout the day, and they’re continuous — we’re gonna be able to do so much more for customers.”

De Lourdes Zollo said that Bee learns from its users, gaining an understanding of their patterns, insights, and commitments, which can help it to suggest to-do items and follow-ups throughout your day.

Early use cases have included students who record lectures, elderly people who have trouble remembering things, and people who speak for a living and don’t want to always take notes manually.

“They just want a place to have all the summarization of everything they said,” Bee’s co-founder said. “So based on that, we build a really big graph of knowledge [about] you, where you can go chat with Bee, and have an understanding of what happened to you, but also how you’re changing during the course of your life,” de Lourdes Zollo added.

Similar to Alexa, Bee uses a combination of AI models under the hood, but it’s exploring adding Amazon’s AI as one in the mix. After transcribing the conversation, Bee discards the audio, making it impractical for many work-related use cases where you need to play back the conversation to ensure accuracy.

There’s still much ahead for Bee in 2026, de Lourdes Zollo teased, without giving anything away. In addition to recent announcements of new features and functionality — like voice notes, templates, daily insights, and more — the founder said the eight-person team is working on “many new things” out of their HQ in San Francisco, where Amazon already has a large number of hardware and Alexa employees.

“Honestly, it’s endless possibilities now, and that’s one of the reasons why we’re really excited to be part of Amazon,” she said.

            <h2>Mark Zuckerberg says Meta is launching its own AI infrastructure initiative</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Meta announced capital expenditure projections last year, the company made it known that it planned to spend big to build out capacity for its AI business. “We expect that developing leading AI infrastructure will be a core advantage in developing the best AI models and product experiences,” said Susan Li, Meta CFO, during an earnings call last summer.

Now, the tech giant appears to be making good on that promise. On Monday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the launch of Meta Compute, a new initiative designed to bolster the tech giant’s AI infrastructure. Zuckerberg said the company intended to drastically expand its energy footprint in the coming years.

“Meta is planning to build tens of gigawatts this decade, and hundreds of gigawatts or more over time. How we engineer, invest, and partner to build this infrastructure will become a strategic advantage,” Zuckerberg said, in a post on Threads.

For reference, a gigawatt is a measurement of electrical power equivalent to a billion watts. The energy-hungry AI business means that America’s electrical consumption could spike exponentially over the next decade (from 5 GW to 50, according to one estimate).

Zuckerberg has named three executives that he says will be spearheading the new project. One of those people is Santosh Janardhan, the company’s head of global infrastructure. Janardhan, who has been with the company since 2009, will lead work on “technical architecture, software stack, silicon program, developer productivity, and building and operating our global datacenter fleet and network,” Zuckerberg said.

Also involved is Daniel Gross, who joined the company just last year. Gross is the co-founder of Safe Superintelligence, along with former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever. Zuckerberg said that Gross would be leading a new group within Meta that is “responsible for long-term capacity strategy, supplier partnerships, industry analysis, planning, and business modeling.”

Finally, Zuckerberg said that Dina Powell McCormick, a former government official who recently joined Meta as the company’s president and vice chairman, would be responsible for working with governments to help “build, deploy, invest in, and finance Meta’s infrastructure.”

There’s obviously a race to build out genAI-ready cloud environments, and Capex projections announced last year showed most of Meta’s peers had similar ambitions. Microsoft has been busy partnering with AI infrastructure providers wherever it can and, in December, Google parent company Alphabet announced the acquisition of data center firm Intersect. TechCrunch reached out to Meta for more information about the new initiative.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On the heels of OpenAI’s ChatGPT Health reveal, Anthropic announced on Sunday that it’s introducing Claude for Healthcare, a set of tools for providers, payers, and patients.

Like ChatGPT Health, Claude for Healthcare will allow users to sync health data from their phones, smartwatches, and other platforms (both OpenAI and Anthropic have said that their models won’t use this data for training). But Anthropic’s product promises more sophistication than ChatGPT Health, which seems as though it will be more focused on a patient-side chat experience as it rolls out gradually.

Though some industry professionals are concerned about the role of hallucination-prone LLMs in offering clients medical advice, Anthropic’s “agent skills” seem promising.

Claude has added what it calls “connectors” to give the AI access to platforms and databases that can speed up research processes and report generation for payers and providers, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Coverage Database; the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10); the National Provider Identifier Standard; and PubMed.

Anthropic explained in a blog post that Claude for Health could use its connectors to speed up prior authorization review, the process in which a doctor must submit additional information to an insurance provider to see if it will cover a medication or treatment.

“Clinicians often report spending more time on documentation and paperwork than actually seeing patients,” Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger said in a presentation about the product.

For doctors, submitting prior authorization documents is more of an administrative task than something that requires their specialized training and expertise. It’s something that makes more sense to automate than the actual process of administering medical advice … though Claude will do that as well.

People are already relying on LLMs for medical advice. OpenAI said that 230 million people talk about their health with ChatGPT each week, and there’s no doubt that Anthropic is observing that use case as well.

Of course, both Anthropic and OpenAI warn consumers that they should see healthcare professionals for more reliable, tailored guidance.

            <h2>Pebble founder says his new company is ‘not a startup’</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/pebble-founder-says-his-new-company-is-not-a-startup/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pebble’s founder, Eric Migicovsky, is doing things differently with his reboot of the Pebble smartwatch brand and an AI ring. The team is small, inventory isn’t being manufactured before it’s sold, and there’s no outside funding.

Most importantly, he says, the new company, Core Devices, is “not a startup.”

“We’ve structured this entire business around being a sustainable, profitable, and hopefully, long-running enterprise, but not a startup,” Migicovsky told TechCrunch on the sidelines of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week.

“Startups are good for the world,” he clarified. “You need to have money in order to build really new ideas and create something. But this is not a new idea,” Migicovsky said, referring to the smartwatch reboot. “This is an old idea. We’re just bringing it back.”

The Pebble founder said he’s learned a lot from his earlier efforts at building a hardware device maker, including what not to do.

Pebble, the original company that Migicovsky started, was sold to Fitbit in 2016 for around $40 million; Fitbit was later acquired by Google for $2.1 billion.

Just before its exit, Migicovsky’s team had been scrambling. Christmas 2015 had put Pebble into a tailspin, as the company had bought too much inventory.

“Hardware is different from software. You have to predict ahead of time how much you’re going to sell, because you need to build the hardware,” Migicovsky explained, reminiscing on the time when things went wrong.

Pebble’s team then had estimated they would do $102 million in sales that year, but they did “only” $82 million. While that number is impressive for a smartwatch brand (particularly one that’s not Apple, Google, or Samsung), the company was left with unsold inventory that had to be sold at a discount.

Retail partners were also upset because discounted sales meant reduced margins. Meanwhile, Pebble didn’t have enough money to finish developing its new products. To make ends meet, the company had to do rapid layoffs and reorganize. And ultimately, it had to find an exit.

“I think I lost sight of the vision of why I was building Pebble,” Migicovsky admitted. “At the beginning, it was very clear. We had a Kickstarter. We posted on the web: here’s exactly what Pebble does, here’s what the features are, here’s who should be interested in it. And then we kind of meandered a bit. We tried to do health tracking. We tried to do stuff that didn’t feel like us,” he said.

This time around, Migicovsky aims to take a different path. The new Pebble smartwatches aren’t meant to be for everyone, he says. They’re meant to be for people like himself: a self-described “bit of a nerd,” who just likes hacking, building, and creating things. Nor are they for fitness junkies or those who want a smartphone on their wrist.

“I want a companion to my phone, rather than a replacement for my phone. I want it to be more like a Swatch than a Rolex. I want it to be a little bit more fun, casual, playful, and plasticky.” Plus, he added, with the reboot of Pebble, he’s now okay with a watch that doesn’t try to do it all.

“I’m okay with a limited vision and a limited scope of what we’re trying to accomplish,” Migicovsky said.

Under the new company, Core Devices, the team has announced the Pebble Time 2 smartwatch, a round-faced Pebble Round 2, and a $75 AI smart ring, called the Index 01.

Notably, the company today is not going to be a large team of 180 employees as before, or one that works with distributors. Instead, there are only five people, and it sells directly to consumers on its website.

The foundation, however, remains PebbleOS, the smartwatch’s operating system, which was thankfully open sourced by Google.

Migicovsky recalls that he ran into a Google employee, Matthieu Jeanson, at a kid’s birthday party, where he got the contact information for someone who might be able to make a call about open sourcing the smartwatch’s operating system. He sent the email requesting that Google make the OS open source, and a year later, it followed through.

“I really am thankful to Google, because what other big company in the world would do that?” said Migicovsky. “I think they did it as an homage to the Pebble community.”

Without PebbleOS, the rebooted Pebble smartwatch would have been an impossibility, as it took a team of 30 to 40 people working for years to build it originally. Recreating that from scratch wasn’t an option.

So far, the new company’s structure is working. The company has sold 25,000 preorders for its smartwatches, and around 5,000 for its AI ring, which is newer.

Pebble preorders are currently shipping about six months out, but Migicovsky said that the team will tighten that down to a couple of weeks. In addition, the Pebble App Store features 15,000 watch faces and apps. In a few weeks, the team will also be relaunching the SDK for developers.

Migicovsky says the team is in a “comfortable spot,” where their expenses are paid, and they’re able to finance new projects.

That’s right — the team is not done yet. Migicovsky won’t detail what sort of hardware devices Core Devices may ship next, but says they’ll be the sort of things he personally wants to have.

“There are a lot of products that are already on the market. Nothing that we’re making is like something that already exists,” Migicovsky hints. “[The next products will be] fun, casual, simple hardware, and they’re things that will kind of make my life a little bit better, one block at a time. And they’re going to work together.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Monday, Anthropic announced a new tool called Cowork, designed as a more accessible version of Claude Code. Built into the Claude Desktop app, the new tool lets users designate a specific folder where Claude can read or modify files, with further instructions given through the standard chat interface. The result is similar to a sandboxed instance of Claude Code, but requires far less technical savvy to set up.

Currently in research preview, Cowork is only available to Max subscribers, with a waitlist available for users on other plans.

The new tool is inspired in part by the growing number of subscribers using Claude Code to achieve non-coding tasks, treating it as a general-purpose agentic AI tool. Cowork is built on the Claude Agent SDK, which means it’s drawing on the same underlying model as Claude Code. The folder partition gives an easy way to manage what files Cowork has access to, and because the app doesn’t require command-line tools or virtual environments, it’s less intimidating for non-technical users.

That opens up a new world of potential use cases. Anthropic gives the example of assembling an expense report from a folder of receipt photos — but Claude Code users have also put the system to work managing media files, scanning social media posts, or analyzing conversations.

Similar to Claude Code, Cowork is designed to take strings of actions without user input — a potentially dangerous approach if the tool is given vague or contradictory instructions. In a blog post announcing the new tool, Anthropic explicitly warns about the risk of prompt injection or deleted files, recommending that users make instructions as clear and unambiguous as possible.

“These risks aren’t new with Cowork,” the post reads, “but it might be the first time you’re using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation.”

Launched as a command-line tool in November 2024, Claude Code has become one of Anthropic’s most successful products, leading the company to launch a string of new interfaces in recent months. A web interface launched in October, followed by a Slack integration just two months later.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ever since Ronald Reagan was president, the Environmental Protection Agency has assigned a value to human life. If you think too long about it, it’s a bit crass, but the upshot was to provide some cost-benefit analysis of pollution controls. Lowering pollution can prolong human life, so if the health benefits of reducing pollution outweighed the costs, then there was an economic argument to be made in favor of those reductions.

Every administration since has assigned some value to human life when determining how to regulate air pollution.

The Trump administration is planning to throw decades of accepted practice out the window, according to a report in the New York Times. If the EPA follows through on its plans, then it would no longer count the value of human health when regulating ozone and fine particulate matter pollution.

The risks of air pollution have been known for decades, which was part of the reason the EPA was founded under President Richard Nixon in the first place.

Ozone and fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5, have long been linked to cardiovascular ailments like asthma, heart disease, and emphysema.

Ozone high in the atmosphere protects us against UV radiation. But when it forms close to the ground, as happens when oxides of nitrogen are emitted by everything from cars to power plants, it can create smog. On particularly smoggy days, it can be deadly to vulnerable populations.

PM2.5 might be even more pernicious. Recent research has connected PM2.5 to a broader range of illnesses, including Parkinson’s, kidney disease, Alzheimer’s, dementia, and type 2 diabetes. Even the tiniest, youngest infants aren’t spared, since a mother’s exposure to PM2.5 has been linked to low birth weight. Worldwide, as many as 10 million people per year die from fine particulate matter pollution annually. MAHA indeed.

The policy change comes at a time when data centers have been increasingly reliant on dirtier sources of electricity. Elon Musk’s xAI, for example, used dozens of unpermitted natural gas turbines to power its Colossus data center near Memphis, Tennessee, a region the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America said was already an “asthma capital” due to pollution from transportation and industry.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is welcoming the Trump administration’s policy change. “We appreciate the efforts of this administration to rebalance regulations with a common-sense approach. We look forward to examining the proposal from E.P.A,” Marty Durbin, president of the chamber’s Global Energy Institute, told the New York Times.

            <h2>The Soul of the Grateful Dead</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/bob-weir-grateful-dead-obituary/685586/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the summer of 1968, three years into the Grateful Dead’s existence, the band fired singer and rhythm guitarist Bob Weir. Jerry Garcia, the band’s other guitarist and its reluctant leader, and bassist Phil Lesh had decided that Weir and keyboardist Ron “Pigpen” McKernan were dragging the band down musically. Weir was just 20 years old, the youngest member of the group and the least technically accomplished. But Garcia didn’t have the heart to pull the trigger himself, and he made the band’s manager do the deed. Or at least he tried to. “It didn’t take. We fired them, all right, but they just kept coming back,” Garcia remembered later.

The failure was auspicious. A few months later, the band performed the shows that would be released as Live/Dead, one of the greatest psychedelic albums ever. The first sound heard on the record is Weir’s guitar, which methodically builds “Dark Star” up, sewing together Garcia and Lesh’s riffing. Weir’s place in the Dead was never again in doubt. When the group disbanded after Garcia’s death in 1995, Weir continued to lead or co-lead iterations of the band for another 30 years, culminating in a three-night 60th-anniversary celebration in San Francisco this past August. He died Saturday at 78, from complications of cancer.

Weir lived his entire adult life in the shadow of Garcia, a formidable genius who died too young, but he was more than just a backing musician. Garcia gave the band virtuosity; Lesh, with his avant-garde training, gave it ambition. Weir gave it soul and fun, and his underappreciated guitar playing was the glue that held the whole Dead sound together.

In a group of scruffy hippies, Weir was a bit of a misfit—ironically, by virtue of being normal. He was a prep-school kid, adopted by a well-off family from Palo Alto, California. But he was also perpetually getting kicked out of schools for misconduct—perhaps a side effect of his undiagnosed dyslexia—and his personal struggles helped lead him to Garcia. (It’s also how he met John Perry Barlow, a boarding-school classmate who would become his songwriting partner as well as an internet pioneer.)

Weir’s age made him the band’s little brother, and like many younger siblings, he could be embarrassing. In contrast to Garcia, who was famously impassive onstage, Weir had front-man energy. He sometimes came off as a pretty boy, and had a tendency to hit a helium falsetto in moments of excitement. After Pigpen’s death, he became the band’s standard-bearer for its lecherous blues songs. His flirtation with slide guitar in the late 1970s and ’80s was mediocre at best. And the less said about those short shorts, the better.

The magic of a band, though, comes from looking past any member’s individual foibles to see how they contribute to the whole, and it’s impossible to imagine the Dead functioning without Weir. During concerts, the set list would customarily alternate between songs sung by Garcia and songs sung by Weir, which was essential to maintaining interest and dynamism across their hours-long shows. Weir was the more conventionally talented singer, and sometimes what you need after the mawkish Garcia dirge “Wharf Rat” is Weir’s euphoric and randy “Sugar Magnolia.” (This change of vibe might be especially urgent and welcome if, like many attendees at Dead shows, you were experimenting with psychedelic drugs.)

Part of the Dead’s greatness resided in their integration of nearly the full breadth of American music: jug bands, modal jazz, Charles Ives, Motown. Weir’s role was often to inject swagger or grease, delivering signature renditions of songs by the likes of Chuck Berry, Merle Haggard, the Reverend Gary Davis, and Marty Robbins as well as upbeat originals such as “Greatest Story Ever Told.” But Weir wasn’t adept in only bluesy numbers. A ballad such as “Looks Like Rain” and “Black-Throated Wind” can grab you by the chest. My top criterion for judging a tape of a Dead show is usually the presence and quality of a rendition of Weir’s “Playing in the Band,” which elevates a boring trope—a song about being a rock and roller—into transcendence, with long, proggy passages.

Less obvious than his singing, but more singular, was Weir’s guitar playing. A typical rhythm guitarist aims to keep a song moving with chunky chords that outline the harmony of a song but also maintain the beat. The Grateful Dead had different needs: The group had to provide effective backing for Garcia’s solos, and it had to be able to morph from one song to another via collectively improvised jams. But it also had two drummers rather than one; an exploratory, meandering bassist; and a rotating cast of keyboardists. Standard rhythm playing would only have cluttered the sound.

Weir responded by developing a style unlike any previous rock guitarist, and one that even most contemporary jam bands can’t replicate. In place of steady strumming, Weir played arpeggios, single notes, little riffs, and odd, jazzy chords. One reason I and many other Deadheads favor concert recordings from the early 1970s is that drummer Mickey Hart’s temporary departure from the band left more room to hear and appreciate Weir’s playing. His model, he liked to say, was the jazz pianist McCoy Tyner’s work in the John Coltrane Quartet. This is also a fitting analogy for Weir’s relationship with Garcia: Both Weir and Tyner rose to fame playing behind immortals, but that in no way detracts from either musician’s individual brilliance.

Weir also never succumbed to the bad habits of many of his bandmates, or at least never so deeply. McKernan’s drinking killed him at 27. Garcia’s drug abuse contributed to his death at 53. Lesh required a kidney transplant because of drug use. Keyboardist Brent Mydland overdosed at 37. But Weir lived more cleanly and, in later life, became something of an Instagram fitness influencer. When Garcia’s drug use caused his consistency and abilities to falter in the 1980s and ’90s, Weir helped carry the band.

In addition to leading his own bands, including RatDog and the Wolf Bros, Weir was involved in a series of projects that kept the repertoire alive. There was Furthur, then the Other Ones (a pun on a Dead song title), and later the Dead. After that came Dead & Company, in which he traded licks and songs with the pop singer John Mayer, who improbably won over many Deadheads. Hardly anyone could have been surprised that Dead & Company was booked as one of the first bands to have a residency at the Sphere, the elaborate Las Vegas venue. The Sphere promised “immersive” experiences; with the Dead, Weir had been delivering those for decades. Deadheads—those old enough to remember the Summer of Love and those born well after Garcia’s death—flocked to Vegas to partake.

In the past few years, many fans had noted that Weir’s pace had slowed—sometimes literally, as he throttled classic Dead tunes down to somnolent tempos. Over time, his appearance morphed from babyfaced to Yosemite Sam; he grew a bushy white beard late in life. Even so, that Weir might be gone so soon seemed unthinkable. After all, he was the youthful, energetic one; his passing feels like the end of an era, just as Garcia’s did. (With Weir’s death, only drummers Hart and Bill Kreutzmann survive as core members of the Dead.)

Even at an age when he’d earned the right to retire, Weir continued to write, record, and perform to adoring crowds, as though compelled to go on. Last August, in one of the final Dead & Company concerts, he performed a song that might have been a personal mission statement. The 77-year-old Weir sang words he’d written at 24: “I can’t stop for nothing / I’m just playing in the band.” It was never just playing, though.</div>

            <h2>The Best Flu Drug Americans Aren’t Taking</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/better-flu-drug-than-tamiflu/685585/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Antiviral drugs for influenza, the best known of which is Tamiflu, are—let’s be honest—not exactly miracle cures. They marginally shorten the course of illness, especially if taken within the first 48 hours. But amid possibly the worst flu season in 25 years, driven by a variant imperfectly matched to the vaccine, these underused drugs can make a bout of flu a little less miserable. So consider an antiviral. And specifically, consider Xofluza, a lesser-known drug that is in fact better than Tamiflu.

The culprit behind this awful flu season is subclade K, a variant of H3N2 discovered too late to be incorporated into this year’s flu vaccine. Early data suggest the shot likely does confer at least some protection against this variant, but the jury is still out on whether that protection is much eroded from usual. What is undeniable, though, is a recent explosion of influenza cases. In New York, which was hit early and hard, the number of people hospitalized for flu broke records. Across the rest of the country, cases have been going up a “straight line,” nearly everywhere all at once, which is highly unusual, Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan who has been studying influenza for some 60 years, told me last week. Cases seem to be finally leveling off now, but much misery still lies ahead.

For flu, antivirals are a second but oft-overlooked line of defense after vaccines. “We are dramatically and drastically underutilizing influenza antivirals,” Janet Englund, a pediatric-infectious-disease specialist at the University of Washington, told me. Even the older, more commonly prescribed drug Tamiflu reaches only a tiny percentage of flu patients every year. Actual numbers are hard to come by, but compare the estimated 1.2 million prescriptions for Tamiflu and its generic form in 2023 with the some 40 million people who likely got the flu in the winter of 2023–24. Xofluza is even less popular, and exact prescription numbers even harder to find. But they are possibly somewhere from just 1 to 10 percent that of Tamiflu.

The two antivirals are equally effective at allaying symptoms, both shortening the duration of flu by about a day. But Xofluza, which was approved in 2018, offers some tangible benefits over Tamiflu.

First, Xofluza is simply more convenient, a single dose compared with Tamiflu’s 10, which are taken over five days, twice a day. It also causes fewer of the gastrointestinal side effects, such as vomiting and nausea, that patients on Tamiflu will sometimes experience. All in all, a course of Xofluza might be easier for you—or your kid already queasy from the flu itself—to get down and keep down. (That is, if they are old enough to take it: Xofluza is approved for kids ages 5 and up in the United States, but ages 1 and up in Europe; only Tamiflu is recommended for kids down to newborn age as well as for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.)

Second, Xofluza makes you less contagious to the rest of your family. It drives down the amount of virus spewed by sick patients more quickly than Tamiflu, possibly because of differences in how the two drugs work. Whereas Xofluza stops the virus from replicating, Tamiflu can only prevent already replicated viruses from exiting infected cells to infect others. In a study that Monto led last year, Xofluza cut household transmission by almost one-third compared with a placebo. Tamiflu might reduce transmission too, according to other studies, but probably to a lesser degree than Xofluza.

Third, Xofluza is better at heading off serious post-flu complications such as pneumonia or myocarditis. Patients on Xofluza needed fewer ER visits and hospitalizations than did those on Tamiflu, according to studies of large real-world data sets from insurance claims and medical records. This means that Xofluza should be the antiviral of choice for high-risk patients, including those over 65, who are most prone to these complications, Frederick Hayden, a flu expert at the University of Virginia who led one of the original Xofluza trials, told me. (Hayden has consulted on an unpaid basis, aside from travel expenses, for the companies behind Xofluza.)

The fourth advantage is less relevant to this season because the dominant subclade belongs to the influenza A family. But Xofluza is noticeably more effective against influenza B than Tamiflu, which tends to falter against this family of viruses.

Despite these benefits, awareness of Xofluza remains low. “It hasn’t been used as much as it should be,” Monto said, for reasons of cost and accessibility. Tamiflu, first approved in 1999, is available as a generic for less than $30 even without insurance. Xofluza is still patented and runs $150 to $200 a person. Because it’s less popular, pharmacies are less likely to stock it, making doctors less eager to prescribe it, and so on. In October, though, the company that markets Xofluza in the U.S. launched a direct-to-customer program that sells the drug for the comparably bargain price of $50 without insurance, along with same-day delivery in some areas. Even the flu-drug experts I spoke with, though, were not all aware of this new, more accessible route. The CDC still lists Tamiflu first and foremost in its recommendations, too.

For flu antivirals to be more widely used would also require better testing. Both Xofluza and Tamiflu are most effective within the first 48 hours of symptoms, and the earlier the better. Traditionally, a sick person would have to get to a doctor, get a flu test, get a prescription, and finally get to a pharmacy—which can easily put them past the first 48 hours. But COVID popularized at-home rapid testing, and combination COVID-flu tests have landed on pharmacies shelves recently. With telehealth and home delivery, you can get an antiviral without ever leaving the house.

Still, the at-home tests are expensive, Englund pointed out, about $20 a pop here, compared with just a couple of bucks in Europe. The expense can add up for a whole family. In Japan, where antivirals are widely used, nearly everyone with a flu-like illness gets a routine rapid test and, if necessary, antivirals, both largely covered by the public health-care system. (Xofluza was developed by the Japanese company Shionogi, which also makes Xocova, a promising COVID antiviral my colleague Rachel Gutman-Wei has written about that is not available in the U.S.)

If the U.S. were better at using antivirals, especially in the high-risk patients, the number of Americans dying of flu—roughly 38,000 last year—would likely drop, Cameron Wolfe, an infectious-diseases expert at Duke, told me. Doctors recommend that people at high risk for flu take antivirals prophylactically, upon exposure to anyone with flu, before symptoms appear. Both Xocova and Tamiflu as prophylaxis can cut the chances of getting sick by upwards of 80 percent.

For healthy people who fall ill, antivirals can ease the burden of flu, which is nasty even when it is not deadly. “I don’t want you to be out of work longer than you need to be. I don’t want you to not be a caregiver for your kids,” Wolfe said. “Maybe you have business travel coming up, and I don’t want you to be sick still on that plane.” With challenges around access to antivirals, he said that “the best drug is the one you can get.” Both Tamiflu and Xofluza can make this historically bad flu season a little more bearable.</div>

            <h2>Why Vance Committed So Hard to the Minneapolis Shooter</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/vance-defends-minneapolis-shooter-ice-maga-symbol/685584/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">More than Donald Trump, more than Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, more than anyone in ICE’s leadership, J. D. Vance has made himself the lead defender of the killing in Minnesota. Why?

The day after the shooting, Vance announced a new administration effort to prosecute welfare fraud in Minnesota and elsewhere. Vance’s message started hot and got hotter. He blamed immigrants in general—and Somali immigrants in particular—for cheating taxpayers and raising the cost of child care for Americans. Then he launched into a denunciation of Renee Nicole Good, the woman shot dead in Minneapolis. He accused her of intentionally attacking a federal agent with her car. He alleged that she belonged to a broader network of activists who plotted “to attack, to dox, to assault” federal law enforcement. He blasted media outlets for covering her killer unsympathetically.

Nick Miroff: From “I’m not mad at you” to deadly shots in seconds

Vance’s words were not a spontaneous reaction to an unexpected question. They were planned, the message he arrived to drive. He did not wait for all of the facts. He did not bother with any notes of compassion for the dead woman and her grieving family.

The vice president next took to X, first to promote a video from the shooter’s point of view, then to mix it up with a journalist about that video (“He is allowed to discharge his weapon in self-defense”).

He did not have to do any of that. He could have expressed support for law enforcement more generally. He did not have to malign the victim. He did not have to champion the shooter. He did not have to insert himself as the main character in a story that was still only just coming into view.

That he did so may seem especially bold given the political context. According to a poll taken the same day as the shooting in Minneapolis, the public has turned against ICE’s often-brutal methods. A majority of Americans condemn ICE as “too forceful.” Vance began his term as perhaps the least popular new vice president in the history of polling. Identifying himself with ICE at its deadliest might seem a hazardous move for such a disliked politician.

But there is a logic to Vance’s combative stance. Vance clearly understood what ICE means to Trump’s base.

For MAGA America, ICE is an instrument for cleansing violence. Visit ICE social-media accounts and you’ll see, again and again, videos of armed force against unarmed individuals, against a soundtrack of pumping music. There’s a montage of aggressive arrests in Minnesota of unarmed, nonwhite men, many of them thrown to the ground and cuffed, set to the 1977 hit “Cold as Ice”: “Someday you’ll pay the price.” A dozen heavily armed and armored agents round up a single unarmed woman in a T-shirt and two similarly defenseless men in California. In Indiana, armored agents throw handcuffs and ankle chains on a big haul of men and shove them in a cell, where they can be seen pacing, weeping, or with their heads plunged in their hands.

Rarely do these videos present a situation that couldn’t be managed with a couple of plainclothes officers bearing holstered sidearms. The point is to prove that the fearsome power of the American state is being wielded by righteous MAGA hands against despised MAGA targets.

On the afternoon of January 9, the DHS X account posted an image of a lone cowboy riding through some Western landscape while a stealth bomber flies overhead. Across the image are the words “We’ll have our home again.” You may not recognize the phrase. It’s a lyric of a song that’s popular on the nationalist far right:

In our own towns, we’re foreigners now, our names are spat and cursed The headlines smack of another attack, not the last, and not the worst Oh my fathers they look down on me, I wonder what they feel To see their noble sons driven down, beneath a coward’s heel

Oh by God we’ll have our home again, by God we’ll have our home By blood or sweat, we’ll get there yet, by God we’ll have our home

That is not a paean to law enforcement. MAGA Republicans do not reliably care about laws or the people who enforce them. One of Trump’s first actions upon entering office was to pardon more than 1,500 people charged in connection with the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, including many convicted of violent offenses against the police. He has denigrated the FBI and transformed the agency into a tool of retribution, and he regularly disparages prosecutors and law-enforcement officials if they fail to comply with his will.

The only law-enforcement agency the administration consistently champions happens to have a particularly grim record of violent overreactions. According to The Trace, which tracks gun violence generally, Good was one of four people who have been killed by ICE since the crackdown began in June, and the organization has identified more than 30 incidents in which immigration agents have either opened fire or held someone at gunpoint. Border Patrol agents have also shot at least three people who were simply observing or documenting immigration raids, including a 30-year-old American woman in Chicago, at whom an agent shouted “Do something, bitch” before opening fire with an assault rifle. She was hit five times but somehow survived.

Caitlin Dickerson: How ICE lost its guardrails

This count doesn’t include the many reported incidents of physical assaults without guns, such as choking and body slams, including of elderly men and women. More and worse scenes have been recorded in Minnesota this past weekend.

ICE is violence-prone in part because the agency has lowered its training standards and ditched much of its background vetting to meet the president’s grandiose deportation targets. But more fundamentally, ICE is violence-prone because its main purpose has become theatrical. Under present leadership, ICE is less a law-enforcement agency than it is a content creator.

Americans want borders enforced. They want foreign criminals apprehended and deported. They want unfounded asylum claimants to be removed promptly. But most Americans don’t thrill to spectacular acts of six-on-one violence aimed at DoorDash delivery men. ICE’s approval ratings have duly plummeted.

Again and again, ICE agents are encountering members of the public who reject their protection and sympathize with the supposed invaders. Yet ICE’s powers against U.S. citizens are limited. Americans can record ICE operations, follow ICE motorcades, and vex and annoy ICE personnel, and there’s not much that ICE or Border Patrol agents can legally do to stop them—hence the turn to unlawful force instead.

That’s the mentality the whole world saw in videos of the killing of Good in Minneapolis, including the one seemingly recorded by the shooter himself. The ICE agent will likely argue that he opened fire on Good—who was unarmed and driving away—to save his own life. But the videos also raise the possibility that he fired because he felt disrespected by a person who—in his opinion—owed him deference. ICE agents who use violence may be counting on superiors to back them up, because they feel disrespected too, and by the whole ungrateful country. Which returns us to Vance and his don’t bother me with the facts defense of the ICE shooter.

MAGA is many things, but above all it’s a movement about redistributing respect away from those who command too much (overeducated coastal elites) to those who don’t have enough (white Americans without advanced degrees who feel left behind). You see that redistribution at work in the Trump administration’s project to devalue medical experts and empower wellness gurus and vaccine skeptics, and in its dismissal of “deep state” national-security professionals in favor of TV pundits.

Nowhere does the demand to redistribute respect come into starker view than when guns start firing. In Trump’s first term, Kyle Rittenhouse—who shot and killed two men and injured a third during protests against police brutality in Wisconsin in August 2020—became a MAGA hero largely because he was enforcing the MAGA vision of respect due. Many Americans saw him as a trigger-happy 17-year-old vigilante, but to the MAGA faithful he was a brave soldier in the larger war against MAGA enemies, real and imagined.

The ICE agent who killed Good is Trump’s second-term Kyle Rittenhouse. Of course the agent could have walked away and left everyone unharmed. By law, perhaps he should have walked away: It’s generally illegal for a law-enforcement officer to kill a civilian seeking to escape, more so if the civilian is unarmed, and even more so if the civilian is not a criminal suspect of any kind. But letting protesters drive off unscathed, without punishing them for their disrespect, would let them “get away with it.” And that would be an intolerable affront to the MAGA vision of who must submit to whom.

Idrees Kahloon: The return of MAGA’s favorite forbidden book

By coming so vociferously to the shooter’s defense, Vance full-throatedly committed himself to the MAGA mission of enforcing respect by any means necessary. Because there’s always such a strong whiff of cynical calculation and inauthenticity about Vance, he has to say more and go further than many natural MAGA personalities do. He has to pay moral cash where others might be trusted on moral credit. If the Minneapolis shooter is the next Kyle Rittenhouse, Vance dared not delay before thrusting himself at this new MAGA hero’s side.

This is how we arrive at a moment when the country’s highest-ranking officials are endorsing a lethal shooting on the basis of claims refuted by the evidence. Failure to heed the MAGA campaign to redistribute respect is insolence punishable by death.</div>

            <h2>The Court Case That Is Allowing ICE to Stop Just About Anyone It Wants</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/scotus-case-ice-arrests-permission-whren/685587/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For 30 years, law-enforcement officers have been empowered to be “clever”—and that cleverness has today become the cover for abusive actions by ICE.

In 1996, the Supreme Court decided Whren v. United States, which came about when plainclothes vice officers patrolling in the District of Columbia passed a truck in a “high drug” area and “their suspicions were aroused.” They had a hunch that the truck was involved in a drug operation. They chose to wait until it had violated a traffic ordinance (turning without a signal) and then used that violation as an excuse to stop the truck. In the course of searching the truck, they found crack cocaine.

The Supreme Court said that the temporary detention of a motorist “upon probable cause to believe that he has violated the traffic laws” did not violate the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable seizures, even if the officer would not have stopped the motorist absent some additional law-enforcement purpose. The Court developed a rule of objective intent. Under this theory, if the officers had a valid reason for acting—an objectively reasonable intention, in the Court’s terminology—then their true motive and subjective intent was of no constitutional consequence. A pretextual traffic stop to search for drugs was just fine with the Court.

Adam Serwer: Conservatives want the antebellum Constitution back

That decision, though couched as an application of the Fourth Amendment’s “reasonableness” standard, was grounded on two premises that were plausible at the time. First, that the discretionary authority granted to the police would be used against genuine criminals such as drug dealers. Second, that the occasional misuses of that discretion would be few, far between, and manageable by the court system through robust testing and oversight. Any harm that could possibly occur was outweighed by the good that would be achieved.

Whren has long plagued minority communities, leading to countless incidents of racial profiling. The current use of Whren in the immigration context takes these abuses further yet, singling out people not on suspicion of criminal behavior but for noncriminal immigration enforcement. Both of the premises in Whren, if they ever were accurate, are now manifestly false. Officer discretion is not being deployed solely against possibly malevolent actors, and the misuse of that discretion is causing more harm than good, not only to those illegally present, but also to those here legally, including U.S. citizens.

The confluence of Whren and ICE is easily captured anecdotally. In Washington, D.C., for example, the U.S. Park Police (a federal police agency) is responsible for enforcing traffic laws on Rock Creek Parkway, a piece of federal land. Since the ICE crackdown began, the park police have begun pulling over commercial trucks for technical violations—say, obscured license plates or driving on the noncommercial parkway—and then allowing ICE to arrest those suspected of immigration violations. To the same effect in D.C., delivery drivers are at risk of being stopped for traffic violations and then being sucked into the immigration-enforcement machine. It’s not just D.C.; the crackdown is nationwide. ICE detentions start with minor traffic violations in Phoenix. In Florida, they begin at truck inspection checkpoints. Or, in Montana, with a broken taillight. Unsurprisingly, the traffic crackdown is not race-neutral. In South Florida, for example, ICE is targeting specific types of work trucks typically driven by people of color.

Even 30 years ago, the Court’s view rested on shaky empirical foundations. It adopted the rule of objective intent despite understanding that, at least sometimes, the subjective intent of the officer might be invidious. The Court recognized that instead of targeting suspicious vehicles in a high-crime area, an officer might have been the sort who targeted a car filled with Black Americans simply because of their skin color. But the Court had a general view that the police were typically trustworthy and honest, and it wrote a rule based on that assumption.

This rule was attractive to the Court because subjective intent is much more difficult to assess than objective factors. It is hard to know what someone else is really thinking, even if you know them quite well. Many judges know that they are particularly ill-suited to assess spur-of-the-moment motivation when sitting in the quiet of their chambers. Worse yet, adopting a rule that asks an officer to explain his motivation is just a formula to solicit perjury—a rule that relies on subjective intent would give any officer an incentive to shade the truth and embellish on his thought process.

But the incentives for officers to shade the truth are really no different under either the objective standard or the subjective one. Just as a law-enforcement officer may sometimes gild the lily in describing his thought process, he may also do so in describing the objective facts that he has observed. I had one case, many years ago, in which my client was suspected of engaging in a drug transaction. The police broadcast a lookout for his car, and he was pulled over for a traffic violation. His offense? Allegedly driving faster than 15 miles per hour in a mall parking lot. But given the configuration of the lot and the presence of other parked cars, the officer’s contention that the car was speeding was dubious at best. Still, he had offered an objectively valid ground for the stop, and my client was duly convicted based on the drugs found in his car.

Whren’s logic has always been a formula for abuse, but that abuse has come especially to the fore today, when acted on by ICE agents who, far from investigating federal crimes, are deploying their authority in the service of noncriminal immigration enforcement to satisfy Trump’s deportation quota. Without any actual knowledge that a crime may have been committed, ICE officers can convert an everyday occurrence that almost every person in America does routinely (rolling through a stop sign, say) into the pretext for arrest that can lead to banishment.

Listen: Federal agents are violating the rights of Americans

Whren’s most fundamental error was the Court’s implicit assumption that malicious intent by law-enforcement officers was a rare subset of justified traffic stops. Back then, the Court might plausibly have given law enforcement the benefit of the doubt. Today, the current conduct of federal law enforcement—and most particularly ICE investigations where criminal activity is not generally at issue—seems to be different both in degree and in kind from what the law might reasonably have anticipated decades ago.

It is, no doubt, too much to hope that the Court, as currently constituted, will revisit this unwise decision. But if there ever comes a time when reconsideration is possible, Whren should be scrapped, and a rule of subjective intent should be adopted that is more aligned with what we now know about the possibility of authoritarian abuse. ICE’s conduct, if it has taught us anything, has taught us not to blindly trust the good intentions of law enforcement.</div>

            <h2>Banana Republicanism</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-desperate-powell-investigation/685583/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration has opened a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on grounds so flimsy and transparently hypocritical that it is difficult to know whether anybody is supposed to take the charges at face value. When a respected public servant is being accused of wasting taxpayer dollars and lying to Congress by a president whose extravagant White House renovation has already doubled in cost in just three months, and whose inexhaustible capacity for lies has essentially broken every fact-checking medium, one almost wonders if the criminal allegation was chosen for its absurdity, to demonstrate that Donald Trump can make the law mean whatever he wants it to.

Trump’s gambit is more likely to fail than it is to succeed. Powell’s term ends in four months, a timeline so brief that it wouldn’t be hastened by even a well-founded criminal charge, which this is not. In theory, harassing Powell with trumped-up charges could intimidate him into backing down, but the Fed chair responded with a defiant statement. Republican Senator Thom Tillis vowed not to support any new nominees to the Federal Reserve board “until this legal matter is fully resolved.” And even if Trump were to manage to install sufficiently pliant figureheads at the agency, the Fed’s demonstrable lack of independence would be apt to weaken its influence over monetary policy and make the economy worse, not better.

What’s more, Trump is gambling that his control over the Republican Party is so unshakable that he can extend his banana republicanism to a policy domain that matters deeply to his wealthy partisan allies. Those conservative economic elites who don’t actively cheer on Trump’s authoritarianism and corruption have learned to live with both, because he delivers the goods in the policy realms that matter to them: tax cuts, deregulation, and other conservative economic priorities.

Every affluent Republican, from the tech right to fossil-fuel owners to heirs managing their inherited portfolios, has a direct and visible interest in stable and competent monetary policy. The Republican Party’s respect for the Fed’s independence is already evident in a recent Supreme Court ruling, in which the conservative majority appears to be seeking to create a special exemption for the Federal Reserve from the Court’s general doctrine that presidents are entitled to fire the heads of independent agencies. When Trump messes with the Fed, he is defecating where his wealthy donors eat. Perhaps they will go along with this, too, but he is testing the limits of their acquiescence.

Rogé Karma: Trump is getting closer to having an ‘infinite money pit’

The apparent source of this desperate gamble is that Trump seems keenly aware that the public disapproves of his presidency and his economic policy making. But rather than move to the center and try to allay the concerns of his wavering supporters, Trump’s response to adversity has been to try to seize as much economic and political power as he can, as fast as possible.

Thus the invasion of Venezuela, which he hopes will provide him with a windfall source of petro-dollars. (Sunday night, Trump shared on Truth Social a mock biography describing himself as “Acting President of Venezuela.”) After floating a proposal to cap credit-card interest rates that stands little chance of passage in Congress, he told reporters on Air Force One that firms that fail to comply with his target by January 20—before any law capping interest rates can conceivably make it through the House and Senate—will be “in violation of the law.”

In normal times, private companies could simply laugh off a president’s threat that they have “violated” a law that does not exist. But since Trump has amply demonstrated his eagerness to redefine the law as synonymous with his own whims, his threats may well contain real power.

Trump’s clumsy legal intimidation of Powell mirrors tactics used by regimes such as those of Argentina, Russia, Turkey, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. This is not a list of the most prosperous economies in the modern world. What these states have in common (with the exception of Argentina, which has rebuilt its economic and political systems from the setbacks they suffered under disastrous Trump-style experiments) is an entrenched elite that hoards wealth and control.

Caitlin B. Tully: The Court has an easy answer on the Fed

The administration is fond of accusing immigrant communities of importing dysfunctional political cultures from the developing world. “If these societies all over the world continue to fail, you have to ask yourself, if you bring those societies into our country and then give them unlimited free welfare, what do we think is going to happen? You’re gonna replicate the conditions that they left,” Stephen Miller recently told Fox News.

The global South may be cursed with more than its share of regimes in which economic success depends on political access and the rule of law is a bitter joke. However, it is not the desperate refugees fleeing poverty and oppression who are importing their political culture, but Trump himself.</div>

            <h2>What <em>Black Swan</em> Knew About Leaning In</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/black-swan-women-workplace-movie/685564/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Darren Aronofsky’s 2010 film, Black Swan, fit into a lot of boxes. It was a psychological thriller, a body-horror flick, a character study, a coming-of-age saga. It was a cautionary tale about ballet culture, helicopter parenting, and perfectionism. Rewatching it roughly 15 years after its release, though, I’ve come to see it as something else: a workplace drama, about an ambitious woman navigating a hypercompetitive environment, contorting herself to please the mercurial boss who holds her fate in his hands.

The ballet world is, of course, unique—a field that requires uncommon athletic and artistic mastery, as well as more commitment and sacrifice than most 9-to-5 jobs. The path to success for a dancer doesn’t necessarily look the same as that of a corporate employee. Yet Black Swan’s central character, Nina Sayers, played by Natalie Portman, struggles in ways that feel broadly relatable.

Like many young strivers, Nina has wound up with her identity entirely entangled in her job. When she lands her dream role in Swan Lake, playing both the innocent White Swan loved by a prince and the seductive Black Swan who attempts to steal him away, she throws herself into her work. But recognition always seems out of reach. The company’s director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), keeps telling Nina she’s too “frigid” and sexless to play the Black Swan. The other dancers covet her part and make her feel unworthy of it. (In any industry, sparse opportunities can lead to hungry, cutthroat workers.) Nina has no mentor to look up to; Beth, the former prima ballerina played by Winona Ryder, has been ruthlessly excised from the company for being too old. The film implies that Beth is still as capable as ever of performing beautifully; the company simply wants a “fresh face,” as Thomas puts it, to draw audiences. Here as in so many workplaces, employees are expendable, valued not for their personhood but for their present contribution to the bottom line.

On top of all that, Thomas keeps coming on to Nina, arguing that she needs to loosen up to get in touch with her inner Black Swan. He asks if she’s a virgin, tells her to masturbate (homework), and kisses her (more than once). This of course puts her in an impossible position: If she protests, she’ll be proving his point that she’s too uptight; if she relents, she’ll be proving right the other dancers’ suspicion that she exploited his attraction to get the part. Thomas’s fiefdom seems similar to that of many real-life dance companies in that power is concentrated in a man with few checks on his behavior. His harassment evokes some of the abuse accusations that have rocked the ballet world—but also the kind of #MeToo stories that have emerged in numerous fields. And as Nina struggles to focus, Thomas keeps telling her, cruelly: “The only person standing in your way is you.”

That idea—and the disturbing question of whether it’s true—is one that I imagine haunts many working women. Around the time Black Swan came out, high-powered female executives were making headlines, and Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Women could see that incredible professional success was possible—but this didn’t mean they were in a position to achieve it. In 2013, Sheryl Sandberg, then the chief operating officer of Meta, delivered a diagnosis in her best-selling book Lean In: Women tend to deny themselves career success, she argued, because they internalize the idea that they should be meek and deferential, and thus take “their foot off the gas,” as she put it in one TED Talk. Instead, she asserted, they need to be bold: speak up in meetings; ask for that raise. Sandberg’s philosophy, I realized, is rather Thomas-esque. In one scene, seemingly testing Nina, he tells her that she won’t be getting the main role in Swan Lake—then berates her for accepting his decision rather than fighting him on it. “You could be brilliant,” he tells her later. “But you’re a coward.”

Though Lean In was a hit—people like to feel that they have agency—it also stirred immediate controversy for its insistence that women could change their circumstances through sheer force of will. Sandberg eventually gave more credence to the structural causes of professional inequity and acknowledged that she hadn’t truly understood the plight of, say, working single moms. But three years before her book was published, Black Swan had already captured one of the problems with holding yourself entirely responsible for your own success: It can turn you against yourself. In a sense, Thomas’s warning that Nina is getting in her own way is a self-fulfilling prophecy. She becomes her own worst enemy.

Aronofsky has said that he based Black Swan on Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s short 1846 novel The Double, about a struggling low-level civil servant who finds that a man has joined his office who looks exactly like him—but who is far more charming and well liked by their colleagues. They become nemeses, naturally. (The Double was also made into its own movie, starring Jesse Eisenberg, in 2013.) In Black Swan, Nina is surrounded by creepy mirror images. Sometimes, her reflection, in the studio’s great glass wall, stops mimicking her actions. Sometimes she hallucinates that people walking down the street or dancing across from her have her face. Primarily, though, Nina’s double—the far more charming, better-liked version of her—is a dancer named Lily (Mila Kunis), a clear Black Swan to Nina’s White one. When Nina despises Lily, she is despising herself. Eventually Nina grows paranoid, losing her grip on what’s real and what’s not. Her breakdown is far more dramatic than what most people will ever experience, but it illustrates the way in which endless, lonely toil can alienate a person from herself. It’s the extreme but logical conclusion of adopting a bootstrap mentality under conditions that don’t actually allow you to pull yourself up.

The path for ambitious women today may be even more obscure than it was upon Black Swan’s release. Politicians, academics, pundits, and influencers are challenging not only the idea that women should be CEOs but also that they should be in the workforce at all (or able to vote). McKinsey’s annual Women in the Workplace study of corporate America—co-conducted by Sandberg’s LeanIn.org and published last month—found that “women are as dedicated to their careers as men” but that they tend to receive less mentorship at work and, in senior positions, remain outnumbered by men. Some companies, according to McKinsey’s report, had recently cut programs designed to support women; many had curtailed remote- or flexible-work options, which are generally a boon to moms trying to keep their jobs. For the first time since McKinsey began conducting its study, female participants reported less desire for promotion than male participants did.

Yet when men and women receive similar amounts of support from senior colleagues, the report found, any ambition gap between the sexes disappears. Women, this suggests, care plenty about what they do and whether they’re seen. Only when they feel undervalued or have little hope of advancement are they more likely to pull back.

Something that struck me when I rewatched Black Swan was all the little reminders that Nina once really loved ballet, before the job wore her down. And I wondered: What if she’d had a less predatory director in a less punishing environment? What if she’d had someone to help her tap into that love without losing her mind? One of the saddest parts of Black Swan is seeing Nina’s passion for dance draining out of her. Thomas keeps telling her to feel the music, to not just to go through the motions. By the time he’s got his grip on her, it’s too late.

Yes, who can remember some esoteric stuff like <i> for italic or <b> for bold? It&#39;s a lot easier to remember that your asterisks will be converted. Thanks Markdown!

What, these doesn&#39;t seem intuitively obvious to you?

Image: ![alt text](image.jpg)Strikethrough: ~~The world is flat.~~Highlight: I need to highlight these ==very important words==Bold: **Bold text**Italic: *Italic Text*

One asterisk for italics and two asterisks for bold, obviously. Except for when those asterisks are for list items, also obviously.

And God help me whenever I need to make a table, especially if I need it to be formatted a non-default way... :-P

I hadn&#39;t actually heard of Markdown before today so I had to look it up, and it looks terrible.Two examples:Using both underscores and asterisks for italic text, despite the fact that asterisks are/were used to denote bold text.Double spaces for a line break. What moron came up with the idea of invisible markup?!

Even BBCode seems better than Markdown to me.

Markdown and YAML are definitely spiritual cousins.

* Simple* Human-first editing* Whitespace-significant / Diff-friendly* Low-ceremony / Huffman-coded

Markdown of course is for freeform idea and narrative capture, whereas YAML is data.

But, they both share the opinion that XML/HTML are cursed for the most common use cases, and they&#39;re both mostly right on that account.

Has Slashdot considered support for Markdown?

Markdown is a very limited set of formatting codes. HTML is a huge tag language for micromanaging every aspect of a web page. The two serve different purposes and are not comparable.

Have you ever tried posting code with markdown?

Does markdown have a blink tag? I rest my case.

Oh boy, what a comeback!  The amazing wit to think of calling someone a &quot;fag&quot; is just breathtaking!

But glad you love that for them.  You must be one too.  But Slashdot is a griping site, not a dating site.

I don&#39;t live in Norway either, but I&#39;m happy to learn about other places. It&#39;s especially refreshing to know that there are still some progressive countries out there.

I know a lot of people will have a gut reaction to want to immediately find and point out the unique aspects of Norway that make its various successes possible, but take a moment to ponder, and first look at whether there might be anything to learn.

Of course. If you have a huge country with a small population then setting up enough charging stations isnt an issue. There are 4 million private cars in norway. There are 34 million here in the uk, a country just over half Norway&#39;s land area with very crowded cities and many flats and houses with zero off street parking or any kind of parking at all so charging at home is a non starter for them. Meanwhile theres nowhere to put charging stations and no, all the streets cant be dug up to install street charger or uprate the supply to street lamps to install there of which there arnt nearly enough anyway.

And you&#39;re out of brains sonny. Run along to mummy, your dinners ready.

I&#39;m coming around to wireless charging. Putting a strip of wireless charging coils along a tight street is expensive, but doable. It would be ideal if they could make capacitive work, since it can use a lot less copper, but even inductive is doable.

An optimist would instead look to find similarities between Norway and individual US states, and say that Norway&#39;s approach might be worth looking into for a state like California, or Minnesota, ... or Scotland.

Extremely high rate of private parking. An electricity grid dimensioned for resistive heating now sitting around with excess capacity. Oil wealth.

Good for them! As one of the world&#39;s largest exporters of oil, they shouldn&#39;t be wasting it on domestic uses.

The hypocrisy of funding their countries &quot;green&quot; lifestyle by selling crude tends to stick in peoples throats.

Why? Has the nation or Norway made statement chastising the rest of the world for using oil? Have they made hypocritical statements?

Or is this just how you perceive them based on the news you hear?

You don&#39;t actually even have to even believe in climate change or harmful emissions at all to acknowledge the advantages of electric vehicles.  Even Suadi Arabia is targeting 50k chargers by 2030 and a big EV investment.

Newsflash dimwit - hypocrisy can be through actions as well as words. If they truly believed in environmentalism they limit their crude production or even cease it altogether. Oh but wait -&quot;if we didnt produce it someone else would, right?&quot;. That&#39;s the BS of corporate sociopaths everywhere to excuse their morality free actions.

So the action of selling the oil itself is enough to declare the entire nation hypocritical, even if they don&#39;t say or do much to anyone else outside of that.  Are they doing sanctions against other nations? Are they making statements decrying the other nations?

Seriously, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve justified this position at all, can you give us anything else besides the fact that Norway has and sells a bunch of oil and they&#39;ve also invested heavily into electric vehicles.  That&#39;s it?  On it&#39;s face there is nothi

Norway isn&#39;t all clear regarding environmental protection https://www.newsinenglish.no/2...

I like EVs and all.    But elektrek buries the lede,  but at least mentions it:

a)  2/3rds of registered cars still fossil.   so about 1/3 electric  1/3 diesel  1/3 gas

But even with this victory, Norway isn’t ready to sit still. OFV director Geir Inge Stokke took the moment to remind everyone that “two out of three passenger cars on the road still run on fossil fuels.. so even though this is an important milestone, we must continue working towards an emission-free vehicle fleet.”b) The EV sales for the 2nd half of the year were juiced because of expiring incentives.The end-of-year surge in EV sales was helped by retiring incentives. Earlier this year, Norway declared victory on its 100% EV goal, and changed the generous incentive structure that had helped the country reach these heights.The incentive will now be reduced for more expensive EVs (those costing over 300k NOK, or ~$30k), which led to a rush to buy higher-priced EVs, including Teslas. (those are discounts via VAT exemptions.  so  i think they became like 25% discounts.   This year they dropped the price limit from $50k  to ~$30K  they&#39;re fully expiring by 2027.     But they also promised to crank up   ICE taxes even more to  &quot;make sure E

That&#39;s neat, I&#39;m glad it&#39;s working, I just hope it doesn&#39;t leave yet another toxic debt. Cyanobacteria commonly produce toxins.

Formatted as a joke, but so far not moderated Funny and I tend to concur. At one level is sounds like a good idea, but we sure don&#39;t know everything about how climate works. So let&#39;s shoot some more technology at it and see what happens?

The goal is to fight desertification [wikipedia.org], that is, to undo the harm we&#39;re doing to the environment and put it back to the way it was before.

Saturated brine is a pretty hostile environment, which is what you would eventually get. The water evaporates, the salt sticks around.

Toss a smallish asteroid into the Pacific ocean?

What are you smoking? Windmills kill whales.....or something.

Is this similar to how we cover bare dirt, like land cleared for construction, with grass seed and then a layer of straw over the top to stop it blowing and washing away before roots go down?

There&#39;s also a sprayable slurry of seed and &quot;mulch&quot; to cover bare spots and small areas. But I&#39;ve not seen that one used on anything larger than half an acre.

Here&#39;s a video [youtube.com] of China&#39;s greening efforts.

If China keeps on the way it&#39;s been going, eventually the whole country will be green!

The way I read it, the bacteria isn&#39;t supposed to survive. It&#39;s just gunk to form a crust for erosion control. Think hair spray but for sand dunes.

Wikipedia has a summary of the causes of desertification  [wikipedia.org].  The most relevant part:

Though vegetation plays a major role in determining the biological composition of the soil, studies have shown that, in many environments, the rate of erosion and runoff decreases exponentially with increased vegetation cover. Unprotected, dry soil surfaces blow away with the wind or are washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile lower soil layers that bake in the sun and become an unproductive hardpan.The goal is to create a crust over the top that resists erosion and gives plants a place to grow.  Once the plants are established, they further resist erosion.It&#39;s a little unintuitive that heavy rain can sometimes promote desertification.  When there&#39;s lots of plants, the rain soaks into the ground and helps them to grow.  If the plants are removed (through overgrazing, unsustainable agriculture, drought, etc.), it washes aw

Mankind has been doing this kind of thing for thousands, if not millions of years.  The fact that it involves bacteria vs plants is not unique. Yeast, Lactobacillus, Aspergillus, are just some of the more famous ones.

We discovered Azotobacter in 1901 and have been using it to fix nitrogen for quite some time.

LOL! I feel ya! Nevertheless, Batman and the OG Star Trek are still some of my all time favorite shows that I can watch on repeat indefinitely. Sooooo much fun

I am but a wee lad of 62, and we didn&#39;t get ABC at the time, so I only saw Batman much later, on afternoon reruns.

My first real memory of the show was the movie they made in &#39;66.

I think I&#39;ll break out the old boxed set this evening and have some campy fun. Penguin for Mayor! Pengy, the people&#39;s pick!

Ok, so I have a favorite character; stemming from the fact that Burgess Meredith is one of my all time favorite actors. In fact, the movie they shot between seasons 1 and 2 is where my screen name came from. Want to buy a diesel powered surplus pre-atomic submarine but you&#39;re a super villain? You&#39;ll need a clever alias, Mr. P. N. Gwen :D

When my daughter was growing up, I used to watch Fairly Oddparents with her. One of my favorite characters was &quot;Adam West&quot;, who was voiced by ... Adam West! In the Fairly Oddparents universe, Adam West was an elderly actor known for playing the role of &quot;Catman&quot; - and who had at best a tenuous grip on reality.

It&#39;s always fun when well-known actors are willing to make fun of themselves. (also in this camp - Jon Voight&#39;s and Raquel Welsh&#39;s appearances on Seinfeld).

It&#39;s always fun when well-known actors are willing to make fun of themselves. (also in this camp - Jon Voight&#39;s and Raquel Welsh&#39;s appearances on Seinfeld).

On the other hand, it&#39;s sad when a perfectly &#39;fine&#39; actor gets so badly typecast that all they can do for the rest of their career is make fun of themselves.

The Batman: The Animated Series episode &#39;Grey Ghost&#39; was the only one that actually treated West and his Batman history with respect and dignity.

They really let him have fun on that show especially towards the end.....

You&#39;ll need a clever alias, Mr. P. N. Gwen :DOne of my favorite lines of all time comes from that movie:&quot;Sometimes, you just can&#39;t get rid of a bomb!&quot;

One of my favorite lines of all time comes from that movie:

&quot;Sometimes, you just can&#39;t get rid of a bomb!&quot;

I love that line. In the DVD Commentary that I have, Adam West playfully quipped at that moment &quot;Well, that about sums up my post-Batman career.&quot;

I didn&#39;t need molded plastic to improve my physique. Pure. West. [youtube.com]

West had a great second act in voice work, truly the man was game for anything.

I met Burt Ward at a car show in Memphis in the late 70&#39;s.

I was six years old and took the show very seriously.

Once I forgot to watch it and wept bitter tears.

&quot;Holy Astringent Plum-Like Fruit!&quot; (google it)

While I agree Julie owned the role, I can&#39;t have you dissing Eartha Kitt.

That is still common for USA network tv shows.  It is streaming that pegs a &quot;season&quot; at 8 episodes.  The big difference is a &quot;season&quot; in streaming tends to be a long story, as opposed to network TV tends to be standalone episodes with possible overarching plot across it.

The guest villains and guest stars on that show were insane: Frank Gorshin, Cesar Romero,  Eartha Kitt, Burgess Meredith, Sammy Davis, Jr., Vincent Price. It goes on and on. Of course, no one under 50 knows who any of them are these days but they were big at that time.

&quot;The treatment is given once every three to four weeks for around 10 months in total.&quot;

I had one before, and fainted. Nevertheless, it was medically necessary.

The alternative can be a gradual decline into blindness. Juice me up, baby.

Honestly, I&#39;m more weirded out by the fact that it&#39;s a gel getting injected. But still... it means being able to see.

Question: Is a country trending in a healthy direction if the head of its central bank releases an SOS message about the political persecution he’s suffering?

On Sunday evening, the Federal Reserve posted a video of Chairman Jay Powell speaking directly to the camera about how the Justice Department had launched a criminal investigation into the Fed. While superficially related to excessive Federal Reserve building renovation costs, Powell said, “the threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.” The administration is trying to spook Powell into cutting rates deeper and, if he doesn’t, ginning up cause to fire him.

You don’t want a central bank that makes interest rate decisions according to presidential demands. There’s significant overlap between countries whose leaders meddle in their central banks’ decisions and those that suffer hyperinflation. This is one of those bright red lines separating functioning countries—however barely, in the case of the good ol’ U.S.—from the rest, and why the move against Powell has former Treasury secretaries and Fed chairs rushing to start a Substack to condemn it.

In a political system with a functioning brain, the threat of criminal charges against a technocrat for not juicing the economy to the president’s liking would be enough to open an impeachment inquiry. In the United States political system circa 2025, we’ll get a handful of statements from Republicans offering meaningful pushback. Fortunately, one of those Republicans has real power in this situation.

“If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,” North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said in a statement Sunday night. “It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question. I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed—including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy—until this legal matter is fully resolved.”

This is more than your usual meaningless Senate threat. What he’s saying, in short, is that unless Trump’s Justice Department drops this stick-up against Powell, he’s not going to get the Fed chair of his dreams wants when Powell’s term as chair ends in May.

Tillis’ position is important for two reasons.

First, he’s retiring at the end of the year, which gives him the political space to behave like an adult. Had he chosen to run again in 2026 and was facing down a primary from his right, he may well have been in Powell’s driveway last night trying to make a citizen’s arrest.

Second, Tillis serves as a pivotal vote on the Banking Committee, which considers Fed nominees. The committee is comprised of 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats. If Tillis joined all Democrats in opposing a Fed nominee, the committee would be deadlocked and the nomination unable to advance out of committee. And while the full Senate could try to force a nomination out of committee, a vote to do so would be subject to the filibuster—meaning it would need Democratic votes to get to 60. Powell, meanwhile, could stay on the Fed: While his tenure as chairman expires in May, his term on the board lasts until 2028.

Then, there’s always the chance that Senate Republicans could go “nuclear”—meaning, to set a new precedent, by simple majority vote, eliminating the filibuster on votes to force nominees out of committee. There are 53 Republican senators, so Tillis’ vote wouldn’t be needed.

But are we to believe that Tillis, while being one of the few to express such outrage, is the only Senate Republican who feels so strongly about preserving Fed independence? Of course not. His retirement, though, allows him to do the dirty work and absorb whatever expressions of disappointment from Trump are coming his way. He has the political breathing room, and the right committee assignment, to constrain one of Trump’s very worst ideas on behalf of others who are, privately, terrified about Trump’s move against the Fed.

And if you’re trying to measure how convincing Tillis’ statement was, well, consider the markets: The day after the Federal Reserve chair, who manages monetary policy for the country that mints the world’s reserve currency, released a hostage video, the S&P 500 was still somehow up 11 points at close on Monday.

Even with this effective pushback, though, what’s frightening is how precarious it all is. What if Tillis were running again? What if he weren’t on the Banking Committee? Who, then, would stand up?

Don’t let the markets think too much about that.

The mantra “Abolish ICE” first gained traction midway through Donald Trump’s first term.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement has had critics since it first came into existence more than 20 years ago. Skepticism breached containment among immigration and civil-liberties activists when Trump came to power, and went mainstream during his “zero tolerance” policy, when federal agents began separating children from their parents at the southern border.

At that point, policy demanders outside Democratic Party officialdom treated ICE abolition as part of the price of entry for primary candidates. The progressive pollster Sean McElwee became a minor celebrity for popularizing the phrase. Democratic New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who mounted a short-lived campaign for president, said that Democrats should “get rid of ICE” if they were able to retake Congress in the 2018 midterms.

Chanting “Abolish ICE” proved to be a potent, replicable means of catharsis, but accomplished little else. It’s at least plausible that without the “Abolish ICE” craze, leading progressives wouldn’t have been primed to embrace the activist call to “Defund the police” in 2020, after the murder of George Floyd.

Years later, police budgets remain intact, and ICE is the largest, most lavishly funded law-enforcement organization in the world. McElwee left the progressive movement and joined forces with moderate Democrats before becoming embroiled in ethical scandals. And the legacy of the whole episode is a lot of bad blood within the party.

From a wide-angled perspective, these hard feelings are somewhat mystifying: Whatever substantive or political misgivings Democrats had about Abolish ICE, they went on to win the 2018 midterms in a landslide. “Defund the police” ignited a panic among Democrats, but election polling that summer didn’t budge, and Democrats went on to win a governing trifecta in 2020. The 2022 midterms also went pretty well for Democrats, then an incumbent party. If you believe “Defund the police” was a major political misstep, your theory of the case has to account for a four year lag.

But zoom in and the tension makes more sense. Republicans were able to exploit “Defund the police” to divide Democrats and squeeze anxious front-line members. Whether or not it cost any Democrats their jobs, it certainly made their lives more difficult. And since there was no upshot at the federal level, what purpose did the ritual serve? The party has run scared from nearly all justice issues ever since.

That, to me, is the real tragedy of the “Abolish ICE” and “Defund the police” crazes. It left everyone with skin in the game too snake-bit to propose any higher level of accountability for law enforcement. This is regrettable for many reasons, but particularly because, whatever the politics, “Abolish ICE” was a good idea.

Elected Democrats now blanch reflexively at both slogans—abolish and defund—as if the animating issues are identical. Or perhaps because they fear that embracing “Abolish ICE” will revive “Defund the police” activism, and we’ll repeat the whole unpleasant cycle. But they’re different ideas stemming from different kinds of abuses and structural flaws, and there’s no reason they must go together.

The way to avoid the doom loop is for those of us who believe ICE must go to be explicit about what makes ICE unique, and specific about what fills the void when its gone. Because if Democrats suspect the real aim is to end all immigration enforcement, the project is doomed.Six years ago, if you pressed police defunders for details, you’d find the slogan papered over broad disagreement and hazy thinking. Some would hew to the most radical interpretation—complete abolition of armed law enforcement, perhaps followed by the creation of reconstituted, unarmed police forces. Others would describe a more incremental and defensible policy: to siphon from police budgets, and use the proceeds to finance social services, so that cities would no longer have to rely on agents trained in the use of lethal force to resolve civil disturbances.

ICE is different. It needs to be abolished because the agency is rogue, and, more pointedly, because it’d be exceedingly difficult to design an agency like ICE that wouldn’t go rogue eventually. If not on its own, then whenever Republicans came to power.

Police forces are not established through conscription. Policing is a career field people choose to enter. It attracts people who either want to catch bad guys or wield power over civilians, or perhaps a bit of both. A federal police force that is hypermilitarized, but with jurisdiction limited exclusively to immigration, will never resemble professional law enforcement. It will invariably attract white nationalists, who will both mete out violence against the population and subvert our democratic processes, including by taking actions designed to choose their own bosses.

Stephen Miller’s souped-up ICE is in the process of proving me correct about this right now, terrorizing blue cities (and only blue cities) while targeting and politicking against Democratic officeholders. But it’s always been true. It’s true as a theoretical matter. The creation of ICE was a mistake. The purpose of abolition is, in part, accountability for the crimes its agents and administrators have committed, but it would be a worthy and necessary goal anyhow. The question is, how will this timid, cowering Democratic Party ever find the courage required to embrace the goal of abolishing ICE? The answer is to provide them approaches to policy that are defensible, and that don’t obligate them to recite “Abolish ICE” as an empty incantation or litmus test.

Step one is to observe something that’s become fairly uncontroversial: The whole panic-driven post-9/11 settlement was an error. We should never have created a Department of Homeland Security, let alone a discrete immigration-enforcement police agency.

Ideally we’d undo all of that. But post-Trump, all federal police forces should be substantially demilitarized, and immigration policing should once again become a largely administrative function, enforced by FBI agents and local cops—officers with broad remit, rather than narrow jurisdiction over immigration laws.

This kind of institutional reshuffling would require new legislation, a happy consequence of which would be the legal dissolution of ICE. But, crucially, the legislation would be technocratic in character. It wouldn’t have to be called the ABOLISH ICE Act, and different politicians could sell it in different ways. For a bill like that to gain broad buy-in, it would be incumbent upon activists not to treat the slogan as a purity test.

But this is where we also need a sea change in Democratic politics. The whole party, including front-line members, needs to be mentally clear about what makes bureaucratic reform so urgent: that ICE is no longer compatible with self-rule, and probably never was. Whatever political concerns they might harbor, they need to move with confidence. To be able and willing to defend the approach on the merits, as a means of democracy protection and accountability for abuses.

Even if Democrats lack a governing trifecta, and thus can’t pass new legislation, they’ll need to stand foursquare behind a Democratic president willing to impose accountability unilaterally.

Abolishing ICE as a legal entity would require new law. Nullifying it, as a practical matter, may not. And if that’s the only option available, a Democratic president will have to embrace it.Trump has asserted the power to effectively abolish departments and agencies of government by fiat: simply terminate all the people who work there. If the Supreme Court upholds Trump’s mass firings, Democrats will inherit that power.

But whether or not the next Democratic president can simply fire ICE agents en masse, he or she could surely ground the agency. Comb through records for evidence of abuses and criminal activity. Prosecute bad actors. Fire others for cause. Bench every agent who received a preemptive pardon from Trump.

The only predicate here is winning power. And this is why I think it’s so important for both activists and politicians alike to approach the ICE challenge differently than they did in the past—with activists offering more generosity and specificity to Democrats trying to win elections, and Democrats earning that generosity by giving their voters reason to believe they won’t tuck tail.

A big selling point of accountability politics and procedural hardball is that the way Democrats currently approach all kinds of challenges makes people suspect they’ll be too scared to take action when it’s needed. What if it doesn’t poll well?

I want progressives to be clear about what the “Abolish ICE” mantra means—what legislation should and shouldn’t do, what a president can and can’t accomplish unilaterally—and I want Democrats to be determined to act, even if they never recite the slogan. Everyone should be OK with a division of labor within the Democratic tent, where protesters can brandish signs that say “ABOLISH ICE,” and Democratic politicians can simply promise that there will be a reckoning and reform, and people in both camps know the real score.

The alternative is for an angry base to bully Democrats into answering yes-or-no questions about abolishing ICE, without any depth of meaning, such that they enter forthcoming elections divided, and the reckoning never materializes.

The Trump administration served the Federal Reserve with grand-jury subpoenas on Friday, part of a criminal investigation into baseless claims that Chair Jerome Powell lied to Congress about renovations to the Fed’s headquarters. As Powell explained after the news broke, these allegations are transparent “pretexts” for Donald Trump’s real motive: coercing the agency into cutting interest rates based on “the preferences of the president” rather than “our best assessment of what will serve the public.” The probe represents yet another weaponization of the Justice Department’s prosecutorial powers to menace perceived political foes. But it is also an astoundingly foolish, self-defeating gambit that is all but guaranteed to backfire badly at the Supreme Court and further frustrate Trump’s efforts to take control of the Fed. This investigation is not just legally frivolous; it is a grave tactical blunder that shows exactly why the judiciary must insulate Powell and his colleagues from the president’s wrath.

Since his return to office, Trump has been hammering the Fed to slash rates—to little effect, given the institution’s considerable independence from the White House. By law, the president may fire Federal Reserve Board governors only “for cause,” and no previous president has tried to remove a governor since the Fed’s creation in 1913. In August, however, Trump attempted to fire Lisa Cook from the board based on dubious allegations of mortgage fraud. He has also for months been setting the stage to oust Powell, using the Fed’s ongoing renovations as a flimsy pretext. It seems pretty clear that if the president is allowed to remove Cook, he will swiftly fire Powell too.

But that is a big if. Cook sued to retain her job, and in September, a federal judge kept her in office, holding that Trump lacked sufficient cause to remove her. An appeals court also sided with Cook, prompting the DOJ to ask the Supreme Court to boot her from the board. The court refused to do so immediately but set the case for oral argument on Jan. 21. With that date fast approaching, the administration has telegraphed that Cook’s case is a test run for an even more explosive confrontation with Powell.

And that is the exact wrong signal to send to SCOTUS. The Republican-appointed supermajority has already shown real (and rare) skepticism toward the administration’s position. Although it has allowed Trump to fire plenty of other executive officials, it has kept Cook on the job while her case is pending and sought to carve out the Fed’s autonomy through incoherent legal contortions. Even as these justices abolish every other agency’s independence, they take pains to reiterate that the Fed alone lies outside the president’s direct control.

John Sauer, Trump’s solicitor general, recognizes all this. And he has crafted his arguments to flatter the supermajority’s belief that the Fed is somehow special while still leaving the president ample room to fire its members. In his briefing in the Cook case, Sauer makes three primary arguments, each more audacious than the previous. First, he claims that Cook had no right to contest her removal before Trump fired her. Second, he asserts that courts may not review Trump’s finding of “cause” for removal—but if they can, such “cause” clearly exists here. Third, he contends that courts have no authority to reinstate Cook even if they find that she was fired unlawfully.

These arguments boil down to a single command to SCOTUS: Courts have no right to question Trump. Don’t question whether he considered the facts before moving to oust Cook. Don’t question whether he marshaled a compelling reason to do so. And don’t question whether courts even have the power to reinstate her if they conclude that he got it wrong. Sauer makes this premise explicit when he insists that the judiciary grant Trump “the presumption of regularity,” which “requires courts to presume that the president will not use statutorily prescribed removal causes as pretexts.” According to the solicitor general, then, courts cannot question Trump’s true motive in sacking Cook. As long as he puts forth some marginally plausible reason, no judge may second-guess his findings or put her back on the Fed.

Now Trump is showing the justices precisely why they should not trust him. His allegations against Cook were always flimsy but not 100 percent frivolous: It appears that she really did list a vacation home as a “primary residence” on a single document submitted to a lender, a move that could have secured her a lower interest rate. Her lawyers call this a “clerical error” or “inadvertent notation” made on one page of a voluminous loan application, and that seems to be true: She identified the house as a vacation home on other documents provided to the lender, and there is no evidence that the lender treated it as a primary residence. Nonetheless, Trump is not entirely lying about the allegation.

The Powell probe, by contrast, is pure nonsense. There is no kernel of truth here: The claims of wrongdoing are fabricated from top to bottom. Trump’s DOJ suggests that the Fed chair is misusing taxpayer dollars in the renovation of the Fed’s century-old D.C. headquarters. In reality, every penny of the $2.5 billion project has been put to good (and meticulously documented) use. Builders discovered major complications, including asbestos and lead, as well as groundwater, all of which sent costs spiraling beyond the initial estimate. The federal commission that oversees the renovations also spurned cost-cutting measures, insisting on the inclusion of expensive materials like marble to preserve historical fidelity. There is simply no evidence that Powell misused public funds, or that his testimony to Congress about the project contained a single falsehood.

Yet the chair is now staring down a potential criminal charge for a made-up crime. The investigation is an obvious act of retaliation for his refusal to slash interest rates—and a preview of how Trump would move against Powell himself if the court blessed this theory of unchecked removal power. Cook’s lawyer, the conservative attorney Paul Clement, will likely draw this development to the Supreme Court’s attention next week. And while Cook is a liberal Democrat, Powell is a lifelong Republican who was, in fact, first elevated to chair by Trump himself. Now the president has demonstrated that a ruling against Cook would amount to a death sentence for Powell’s tenure on the Fed too. By targeting the chair so crudely, Trump laid bare why the court should not afford him the presumption of regularity, and should instead impose strict limits on the president’s ability to fire the Fed’s members.

SCOTUS may not have needed the nudge. In December, during arguments in a different removal case, several justices sounded preoccupied with preserving the judiciary’s authority to reverse unlawful firings, particularly at the Fed. Justice Brett Kavanaugh said he had “some real doubts” about the DOJ’s claim that courts cannot reinstate executive officials, calling the idea “an end run around the exceptions” for the Fed’s independence. And he warned the solicitor general that he would not endorse a theory that left the institution exposed to presidential whims. It’s easy to see why: The Fed’s independence is crucial to the American economy, since direct political control over monetary policy invariably leads to economic instability. To see why, look no further than Trump, who wants massive rate cuts to juice the economy before the midterms while disregarding the serious long-term consequences for inflation.

It is pretty apparent that Kavanaugh and his colleagues support the Fed’s independence as a matter of policy and seek to work their way backward to a constitutional rationale. The agency’s leaders exercise “executive power” just as much as other officials whom SCOTUS has allowed Trump to terminate. But the justices cannot swallow the logical end point of the “unitary executive” theory, so they’ve drawn the line at the central bank. There is a chance they would have let the president fire Cook if they believed that her ouster would constitute the one-off purge of a holdover Democrat. The Powell investigation proves that Trump has far greater ambitions—to knock off anyone, even a Republican, who won’t do his reckless bidding. It is a terrible omen for the rule of law, and the single greatest gift the president could have given Cook.

The Trump administration doesn’t merely flout international law; it treats the very idea of a rules-based legal order as a weakness to be mocked, violated, and destroyed. Overseas, that contempt takes the form of unrestrained military force that threatens to unravel the post–World War II international system that the United States itself built. At home, the same impulse can be seen in a growing willingness to discard legal limits on state violence, recasting unlawful force as strength and accountability as effeminacy.

On this week’s episode of Amicus, Mark Joseph Stern spoke with Brian Finucane, a senior adviser to the International Crisis Group and a former attorney in the State Department’s Office of the Legal Adviser, about what happens when performative machismo replaces law as a governing principle—and when breaking the rules becomes the point. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mark Joseph Stern: Prominent right-wing provocateur and Donald Trump supporter Matt Walsh declared that international law is “fake and gay.” In response, you wrote that “International law is gay” does seem to be the general attitude of this White House. I know that was kind of a joke, but it also aligns with something that New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie pointed out, which is that the administration seems to think that blowing up the rules-based international order is the ultimate expression of masculinity. There’s a performative straight-guy machismo at work here, where tearing up international law becomes something akin to bragging rights in the manosphere.

Brian Finucane: I think there’s a certain element of trying to “own the libs” by burning down the U.S.-built international legal order. This president enjoys performative military action, military spectacle. We saw the way he boasted about the attack on Venezuela on social media, the way he characterized this as just another of the greatest hits during his press conference following the military incursion. He put this up there with the Soleimani strike, the Baghdadi strike, the attack on Iran over the summer. This administration’s approach to international law is trollish and petulant, showing contempt for it and holding it in general disdain. That may be especially true for international law, but I think that holds true for other areas of law—or at least areas of law in which the administration is unlikely to get a Supreme Court judgment against it.

It’s always a trap when you sense an “Own the Libs” play. It’s difficult to avoid jumping in to rebuke the outrageous act without feeling as if you’ve been baited into fulfilling the narrative that the administration has set up. That’s what played out here: The Trump administration goes into Venezuela, arrests Nicolás Maduro, Democrats are mad. The administration and all of these right-wing commentators turn around and say that it proves that Democrats are weak and that international law is fake. The whole thing is swallowed by circular logic, whereby anyone who supports international law must be discredited because their views are rooted in feminine, “gay” weakness.

That does seem to be the attitude at play here, and one way I would respond to that is that this is not strength. This is childishness. This is not a law imposed upon the U.S. by someone else. These are laws of the United States’ own creation. We agreed to these rules for very good reasons; the horrors of two world wars and of the Holocaust were very high on the list of motivating factors.

And these rules have served us very well, because as part of creating and setting them up, we established ourselves as the global leader and gave this nation a lot of special rights and privileges. Now we are inexplicably trading those away by tearing down the whole system in favor of a boastful machismo that plays well on TV and might help in the midterms but ultimately leads to the destruction of any semblance of an international rules-based order.

We established this international legal order because it was in the United States’ national interest to do so. We benefit from it disproportionately. And the U.S. has been an essential pillar of that for the past 80 years.

This sort of gender-based “Own the Libs” dimension braids into some of the right-wing commentary about Renee Nicole Good, the 37-year-old woman, mother, poet, and U.S. citizen who was shot and killed in her car by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer last Wednesday in Minneapolis. On Fox News, Jesse Watters took pains to mention that Good included pronouns in her bio and left behind a lesbian partner and a child from a previous marriage. I’m not sure what those things have to do with thresholds for the use of deadly force, but perhaps they’re relevant to Watters because they play in the key of “Anything that’s not a MAGA model of masculine dominance is fair game.” As you pointed out last week, it seems as if this is turning the Trump administration’s culture war into an actual war on American citizens.

The killing of Renee Good is horrifying, heartbreaking, and sickening. I think that the administration’s response is very revealing: smearing her without any basis in fact of domestic terrorism. This ties into the White House’s approach to smear or characterize a broad range of perceived foes as terrorists. There have been these moves to repurpose and redirect the “war on terror” framing against alleged narcos—as we’ve seen with the boat bombings and the shipping of Venezuelan men off to CECOT prison in El Salvador to be abused. With the boat-bombing scheme, the administration asserted that the president had a license to kill people, essentially based on his own say-so, by labeling them terrorists. Now it’s being used against perceived domestic political opponents. That needs to be extremely concerning for Americans.

Perhaps in retrospect, as soon as the president claimed a license to kill fishermen in international waters, it was only a matter of time before he claimed a license to kill American citizens on American streets.

That was the concern. That was one of the things that initially struck me about where the boat strikes might lead. The fact that the administration is now smearing this poor dead woman with claims of domestic terrorism suggests that it’s where it indeed has led.

I wonder if what happens next is that anyone who speaks openly and candidly about the killing of Good is also smeared as, at a minimum, trying to incite violence against ICE or against the administration. And that protesters and those who speak out will also soon be tarnished as terrorists themselves who then become fair game for use of lethal force. Is that too dramatic a vision that I’m having here?

No, I would not be surprised by that. We see other elements of the attempts to paint perceived domestic political opponents as terrorists. For example, the decision to label antifa as a terrorist organization when it of course isn’t even an organization. The administration is also referring to other domestic political opponents or perceived opponents as terrorist sympathizers. The attempts to smear a broader and broader swath of the American public as “terrorists” are likely to continue.

This takes us all the way down the rabbit hole to a more meta question about how this particular political brand of toxic masculinity that the Trump administration is modeling can invert the rule of law. Breaking international law and using unjustified lethal force on American streets becomes a sign of strength rather than recklessness. A mom with stuffed animals in her car becomes a domestic terrorist and therefore fair game to be gunned down, while those who kill are the real heroes. At this point, does law stop functioning as a limit and start functioning as something to be deliberately and proudly violated? It seems as if we’re at a point when it’s the administration not just pretending that it didn’t break the law but saying: “Yeah, we did this, so what?”

That sort of flex is certainly an element of it. I also think you have the dynamic of “For my friends, everything; for my enemies, the law.” You see that with these bogus attempts to prosecute perceived political enemies. So the law is not constraining this administration, at least in their view, but it is a tool to be weaponized against perceived opponents. Now, the American public doesn’t have to accept that. This is our republic. The question is, do we want to keep it?

            <h2>Danish dev delights kid by turning floppy drive into easy TV remote</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/danish_dev_floppy_drive_remote/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Smart TV UIs are hard enough for adults to navigate, let alone preschoolers. When his three-year-old couldn&#39;t learn to navigate with a remote, one Danish computer scientist did what any enterprising creator would do: He turned an old floppy disk drive into a kid-friendly content controller that starts streams based on what disk you insert.

As Mads Olesen explained in a blog post, his son usually winds up asking him to handle the television, leaving him disempowered and unable to make content choices for himself. If dad doesn&#39;t spend a lot of time with the remote, unwanted autoplay ensures his son inevitably &quot;ends up stranded powerless and comatose in front of the TV.&quot;

Faced with that dilemma, Olesen turned to the ancient storage medium of 3.5-inch floppy disks to give his son a tactile, simple way to control his own viewing.

&quot;Floppy disks are the best storage media ever invented,&quot; Olesen opined. &quot;Why else would the &#39;save-icon&#39; still be a floppy disk?&quot;

A prior project delivering episodes of his child&#39;s earlier favorite TV show (Fantus, in case our Scandinavian readers are curious), which relied on a single big red button, served as the engineering basis for his new floppy disk remote player. Like the single-button Fantus player, the floppy disk player served as a physical way for Olesen&#39;s son to access content hosted online, as it&#39;s hard to fit much modern digital content on a 1.44 MB disk, after all.

Of course, relying on multiple floppy disks with one show or type of media (there are also disks that stream playlists of Olesen&#39;s and his wife&#39;s favorite kid-appropriate music videos) per disk meant some additional coding had to be done. Still, the system remains pretty simple.

&quot;The disk just has a very short string in a file (&#39;autoexec.sh&#39;), basically saying which bash-script to run on the server, e.g. &#39;dad-music&#39; would be one disk,&quot; Olesen explained in a conversation with The Register. &quot;The server is just a Raspberry Pi with a bunch of these scripts, and pychromecast for controlling the Chromecast from Python.&quot;

&quot;At this point, I think we have about 8 or 9 different disks,&quot; Olesen added. &quot;It is relatively easy to make new disks; the main hurdle for me is printing the labels.&quot;

As far as controls go, inserting a floppy disk of his son&#39;s choice starts the content streaming, popping a disk out pauses it, and reinserting starts the playback again, emulating &quot;the illusion as much as possible that it is the disk that is playing.&quot;

With the disk drive designed to automatically stream content to a television when a disk is inserted, and floppies not exactly famous for their autoplay, Olesen had another hurdle to jump.

&quot;While, in theory, floppy disks are supported for AutoRun, it turns out that floppy drives basically don&#39;t know if a disk is inserted until the operating system tries to access it,&quot; Olesen wrote. He noted that 34-pin headers for many old floppy drives had a &quot;disk change&quot; pin on the 34th position, but none of his drives had that feature.

&quot;In the end I slightly modified the drive and added a simple rolling switch that would engage when a disk was inserted,&quot; Olesen explained.

The switch, an Arduino designed to transmit code wirelessly to the Raspberry Pi server, and a whole bunch of batteries that provide wireless power, combine to form a device that Olesen told us months after handing it over to his kid, is still a favorite device.

&quot;My kid is still using it,&quot; Olesen told us. &quot;Obviously, the TV shows he watches have changed a bit, but he does enjoy dancing to the music, and the fact that he has his own floppy disk.&quot;

The one thing Olesen said he&#39;d do differently, were he to redesign the entire project, would be to eliminate the Chromecast due to excessive latency and connect a computer directly to the TV. That, and he wishes he would have programmed a different melody onto each disk that would play from the drive itself when a disk was inserted, which he told us &quot;should be totally doable&quot; if he ever gets around to it.

If you, too, long for the era when a satisfying ca-chunk preceded file transfers and want to find something useful to do with that old floppy disk drive rotting away in that box of old computer stuff, Olesen&#39;s entire codebase and other relevant project files are available on GitHub. ®

            <h2>Apple hopes to save Siri from laughingstock status with infusion of Google Gemini</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It may finally be time to take AI on the iPhone siri-ously. Apple and Google on Monday announced a multi-year partnership that will see Apple Foundation Models standing on the shoulders of Google Gemini models, one that will return a small portion of the roughly $20 billion Google pays annually to be Apple&#39;s default search provider.

Terms of the tie-up have not been disclosed, but Bloomberg previously reported that Apple was planning to pay about $1 billion per year to use Google&#39;s AI technology.

&quot;After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google&#39;s AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users,&quot; the two companies said in a joint statement. &quot;Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple&#39;s industry-leading privacy standards.&quot;

Apple&#39;s home-grown machine learning, despite some effort to show off rather than hide behind the usual secrecy, has been beset by unkept promises and staff departures. An updated Gemini-flavored version of Apple Intelligence is expected to debut later this year.

The deal looks like a setback for OpenAI, brought in to buttress Siri in 2024 with support for ChatGPT as a Siri extension. Last month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly declared a &quot;Code Red&quot; to signal the urgency of responding to improvements in Google&#39;s Gemini model family.

Apple, in theory, has some strong cards to play in the AI game, specifically hardware suited for running local models and its public commitment to privacy, which like security has been something of an afterthought among commercial AI model makers.

Apple&#39;s Private Cloud Compute system for handling AI queries in a way that protects private data proved compelling enough that Google announced a similar scheme dubbed Private AI Compute more than a year later.

That might mean more if customers demanded AI device integration, but so far interest in AI hardware has been tepid. AI PCs are not exactly flying off the shelves and Dell reportedly downplayed AI features at CES 2026.

Part of the issue is that, while local models may eventually be a thing, the trade-offs required for on-device inference, particularly on mobile devices, keep people looking to cloud-based AI services for the time being.

Demand for AI on mobile devices is further complicated by public disinterest in AI phone features. A survey of 2,000 smartphone users in late 2024 found that 73 percent of iPhone customers and 87 percent of Samsung customers said AI added little or no value to their devices.

Samsung, for its part, appears to be pushing back on that narrative by noting that people don&#39;t recognize how much they already use AI-powered functions on their phones. A Samsung survey of 2,000 adults conducted by Talker Research found that 90 percent of Americans use AI on mobile devices. But only 38 percent of respondents recognize how many device features have AI elements, such as weather alerts, call screening, autocorrect, voice assistants, auto brightness, and photo editing features.

By the time Apple rewires Siri to work with Gemini, maybe the company will have figured out how AI can add value for customers in a way they recognize and appreciate. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/nvidia_eli_lilly_ai_drug_lab/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nvidia has teamed up with pharmaceutical heavyweight Eli Lilly to plow up to $1 billion into a research lab over the next five years to advance the development of foundation models for AI-assisted drug discovery.

Announced at the JPMorgan Healthcare conference on Monday, the collaboration will span the infrastructure, talent, and compute necessary to develop these biology and chemistry models using Nvidia&#39;s BioNeMo software platform and Vera Rubin accelerators.

Introduced in fall 2022, just months before ChatGPT kicked off the AI arms race, BioNeMo is an open source framework for building and training deep learning models for use in drug discovery.

Located in the San Francisco Bay Area, the so-called co-innovation lab will bring together Eli Lilly&#39;s top biologists and chemists to work alongside Nvidia&#39;s software engineers and model devs, when it opens later this year.

&quot;Combining our volumes of data and scientific knowledge with Nvidia&#39;s computational power and model-building expertise could reinvent drug discovery as we know it,&quot; Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said in a canned statement.

“The focus will be on creating a laboratory where AI software (the dry lab) and robotic hardware (the wet lab) talk to each other 24/7, keeping humans in the loop without the need for constant reprogramming the robot or manually completing every step of the experiments.. This amplifies the scientist’s productivity, elevating them to a strategic lead, while the system executes the iterative testing cycle at machine speed,” an Nvidia spokes person told El Reg.

From there, the two companies will harness Nvidia&#39;s newly unveiled Vera Rubin compute platform. Announced at CES last week, the system promises a fivefold increase in performance over Nvidia&#39;s prior-gen Blackwell GPUs. These chips will provide the computational grunt necessary to train new foundation models based on the lab&#39;s research.

This suggests the lab will be among the first to get its hands on the chips, which aren&#39;t expected to be available in any significant numbers until the second half of this year.

In the meantime, it&#39;s not like Eli Lilly is hurting for compute. At GTC DC last October, the pharmaceutical giant revealed it had deployed a Blackwell Ultra-based SuperPOD complete with 1,016 B300 GPUs to support its exploration into computational biology and chemistry.

The lab&#39;s sole focus won&#39;t be limited to AI drug discovery, however. Researchers will also explore applications for AI in clinical development, manufacturing, and commercial operations.

For example, Eli Lilly is also investigating Nvidia&#39;s Omniverse Robotics platforms as a means to optimize its manufacturing plants and increase production of high-demand drugs. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/memory_shortages_price_hikes/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Memory shortages will likely stunt PC shipments in 2026, as available supplies will not be able to meet demand thanks to memory makers chasing the lucrative AI infrastructure market instead.

Overall PC market performance in 2025 was healthy, according to research biz Omdia, but it notes that memory and storage supply was already tightening, with associated upward price pressure emerging around the middle of last year.

By December, PC vendors were signaling their expectations of price increases, and this is dampening expectations for the volume of shipments during 2026.

&quot;Between Q1 and Q4 2025, mainstream PC memory and storage costs rose by 40 percent to 70 percent, resulting in cost increases being passed through to customers,&quot; said Omdia Principal Analyst Ben Yeh.

As The Register recently reported, shortages are being caused by the memory chip manufacturers reallocating manufacturing capacity to output more of the high-margin server DRAM and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips instead of mainstream DDR. Those components are in high demand to kit out AI servers and the accelerators needed for the AI investment boom.

PC makers such as Dell and Lenovo were also warning in December of &quot;unprecedented cost increases&quot; that meant they were planning to up the price tags on their products. The alternative is to ship configurations with less memory, which risks disappointing buyers who may find that their PC&#39;s performance doesn&#39;t match expectations.

&quot;Given tight 2026 supply, the industry is emphasizing high-end SKUs and leaner mid- to low-tier configurations to protect margins,&quot; Yeh added.

But with memory supplies unable to meet demand, something will have to give.

&quot;Actual shipment performance will hinge on vendors&#39; memory and storage procurement and negotiating leverage; beyond scale, their track records and credibility with suppliers will be a decisive factor in determining their success in navigating this period of complexity,&quot; Yeh said.

If we&#39;re reading that right, it means there is going to be stiff competition between the PC makers for whatever memory is available, and that typically means those prepared to pay the most are likely to win, again pushing up prices.

As a result, Taiwanese market watcher TrendForce has reduced its global projection for laptop shipments in 2026 to indicate a 5.4 percent decrease compared with 2025, making for an estimated 173 million units in total.

This could have an impact on Windows 11 uptake, as the platform is more demanding than the previous version, Windows 10, and buyers may be put off trading in their old laptop by the high cost of a replacement system. Windows 11 has not significantly increased its market share over the older version since support for it ended in October.

Typically, when memory prices start rising as demand is outstripping supply, the chip manufacturers increase production to capitalize on it. The upshot is that prices fall again, and there may eventually be a glut of memory chips – the so-called boom-bust cycle.

However, analysts think this is this unlikely to happen this time.

Despite this crunch, a November 2025 poll by Omdia of B2B channel vendors found that 57 percent were still forecasting growth during 2026. Optimism reigns supreme.

Last year, Lenovo was the top PC vendor in terms of shipments, accounting for just over a quarter of the market. HP was second, with just over 20 percent, while Dell made up 15 percent, Apple just under 10 percent, and Asus 7.2 percent. ®

            <h2>Mall display crashes the vibe with Windows activation nag</h2>

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Windows activation is a tricky thing, particularly for digital signage that should be directing customers to in-store bargains but instead shows passersby that someone has yet to give Microsoft their pound of flesh.

Today&#39;s bork was spotted by a Register reader in Virginia&#39;s Danville Mall. The screen is affixed to a wall, but whatever&#39;s driving it is having a very bad day indeed.

Judging by the taskbar and the old-school buttons, this is an older iteration of Windows, and the activation notification carries a distinct whiff of something unsupported.

Windows activation warnings tend to appear after installing the operating system or after changing specific components. A hardware-based hash is generated, and if that hash changes too much, Windows starts bleating about activation.

In the past, it was possible to activate Windows by telephone. Indeed, back in the days of XP and its ilk, there was no guarantee that a device would be connected to the internet. One of the brains behind Windows activation (in its earlier incarnations), former Microsoft engineer Dave Plummer, told us that having a user key in numbers using a telephone keypad presented problems of its own. &quot;Phone activation,&quot; he said, &quot;is always going to limit the amount of information that can go back and forth and so will always be an attack vector and likely the easiest one for hackers to target.&quot;

Today, things have changed. Microsoft has retired the telephone procedure and now directs users to its Product Activation Portal.

For whoever is running the Danville screen, a click on the activation message and a visit to Microsoft&#39;s portal should do the trick. With luck, there is a screen in an office somewhere with the same message being shown to a tired IT professional. Otherwise, having to climb a ladder to stop Windows from complaining about activation feels a step too far. Perhaps a return to simpler signage is required before a harassed techie ends up breaking a bone or two for the sake of Windows activation. ®

            <h2>Businesses in 2026: Maybe we should finally look into that AI security stuff</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/ai_security_wef_survey/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The number of organizations that have implemented methods for identifying security risks in the AI tools they use has almost doubled in the space of a year.

Nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of all business leaders who participated in the World Economic Forum&#39;s (WEF) Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2026 said that they assessed AI tools&#39; security risks before deploying them.

The finding represents a steep rise compared with last year&#39;s 37 percent figure, and underlines how much of a priority AI security has become for organizations worldwide.

Nearly all respondents (94 percent) said that AI will be the most significant driver of cybersecurity change in 2026, and 87 percent believe that the associated vulnerabilities have increased – more than any other type of threat.

It&#39;s true that The Reg was busy last year covering AI vulnerabilities. Prompt injections were the main culprits – there were lots of them – while AI code assistants were seen making expert devs worse, and in December, Google was called in to fix the security issues created by Gemini.

The WEF&#39;s findings, published a week before its annual Davos meeting, offer a more positive view on the state of AI security across the world than the show of hands suggested at the NCSC&#39;s annual conference in May.

In a room full of roughly 200 security professionals, not a single one could claim that they had a strong grasp of the security of their organization&#39;s AI systems.

For leaders, the most common fear concerning AI right now is data leaks, the WEF survey noted. Coming in just behind is the advancement of adversarial capabilities, which makes sense given that the report also found that geopolitically motivated attacks were the most common feature of leaders&#39; risk strategies.

Sixty-four percent of organizations reported that geopolitical matters played the biggest role in shaping their cyber risk strategies, topping the list for consecutive years.

Geopolitics was far more of a concern for larger organizations, those with more than 100,000 employees, with 91 percent reporting that their security plans changed as a result, compared to just 59 percent for those with fewer than 1,000 staffers.

Gartner reached similar conclusions after surveying European CIOs and other IT leaders in 2025, finding that many were considering opting for a local cloud provider as data sovereignty fears escalate.

Geopolitics most commonly influences cybersecurity and cybercrime when it comes to the conflicts between major adversaries.

It is not uncommon for UK or US organizations to be pelted with DDoS attacks from Russian cyber troublemakers, for example.

Russia also has a history of targeting major sporting events, so organizations in the US may be preparing for politically-motivated cyberattacks later this year, as the world&#39;s eyes will be on the FIFA World Cup this summer.

For CEOs, however, the threat from hacktivists is not even on their radars. Cyber-enabled fraud, such as phishing and social engineering, is the number-one concern, followed by AI vulnerabilities and exploits of software flaws.

Ransomware was the chief worry of 2025, and supply chain disruptions were third on the list last year, but both dropped out of the top three in 2026.

Ransomware remains the prime fear for CISOs, though. Both ransomware and supply chain attacks remain at ranks one and two, respectively, in security chiefs&#39; lists of nightmares.

The key to preventing the worst outcomes is for all organizations to pursue a heightened state of cyber resilience.

&quot;Cyber resilience&quot; is a phrase that&#39;s repeated time and again by national security authorities for a good reason. It refers to an organization&#39;s ability to minimize the impact of a cyberattack, should one penetrate its systems.

The majority of respondents to the WEF&#39;s survey (64 percent) claimed that they met the minimum requirements for cyber resilience, while only 19 percent believed that they are exceeding those baseline standards.

Major attacks, such as those on JLR and M&S, high-profile events that led to extensive and costly periods of downtime for both businesses, illustrate the issues with minimizing cyberattacks that organizations continue to face. ®

If you’re planning on traveling at all this year, the Baseus EnerCore CG11 Universal Travel Adapter is worth a look. The adapter can power up to six devices at once, and now through the end of today, January 12th, it’s on sale for just $34.19 (about $36 off) at Amazon, matching the all-time low price we last saw at the end of November.

Baseus’ handy wall adapter supports four different plug types so you can use it in more than 200 countries, including the US, UK, much of Europe, Australia, India, and South Africa. Instead of requiring you to pack a separate cable, it also includes a built-in USB-C cable that extends up to 27 inches. The braided cord can deliver up to 70W of power and retracts into the adapter, too, making it easy to carry.

In addition to the aforementioned built-in cable, the EnerCore CG11 features three USB ports on the bottom: one USB-C port that delivers up to 60W, a USB-A port that delivers up to 60W, and a USB-A port that delivers up to 5W. That means you can charge your phone, tablet, camera, tablet, earbuds, and even a laptop — albeit slowly — without having to carry multiple chargers with you while you travel.

Despite its versatility, the adapter weighs about half a pound and can fit in the palm of your hand, so it won’t add a ton of unnecessary bulk to your backpack or luggage. You can even take it on a cruise, as it doesn’t include surge protection, a feature that’s often banned on cruise ships.

Creating nonconsensual intimate deepfake images will be a criminal offense, and platforms will have to take ‘proactive action’ to stop it.

The UK is bringing a law into force that makes creating nonconsensual intimate deepfake images, like the ones that have proliferated on X because of the Grok AI chatbot, a criminal offense, as reported by the BBC.

“The Data Act, passed last year, made it a criminal offence to create – or request the creation of – non-consensual intimate images,” according to a statement from Liz Kendall, the UK’s Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology. “And today, I can announce to the House that this offence will be brought into force this week and that I will make it a priority offence in the Online Safety Act too.” As a priority offense, “services have to take proactive action to stop this content from appearing in the first place.”

Ofcom, which regulates communications industries in the UK, announced earlier today that it is formally investigating X over Grok’s deepfakes. Should Ofcom find X in violation of the Online Safety Act, it could require the platform to take certain steps to comply and impose fines of “up to £18 million or 10% of qualifying worldwide revenue, whichever is greater.”

“The government expects Ofcom to set out a timeline for the investigation as soon as possible,” Kendall says. “The public – and most importantly, the victims of Grok’s activities – expect swift and decisive action. So this must not take months and months.”

xAI didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. On January 3rd, X said, “We take action against illegal content on X, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary. Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”

Last week, X also placed some limits on the ability to generate an image using Grok, making tagging the chatbot in a reply to generate an image publicly a feature just for paying subscribers. However, The Verge found there were still free ways to use Grok to edit and create images, including sexualized ones.

One Last Adventure is about as far as you can get from ‘conformity gate.’ But at least you can see Vecna in headphones.

It’s a weird time in the Stranger Things community. Following a monthslong lead-up to a finale that was so big it screened in theaters, the show’s superfans have been spending their time dissecting the fifth season in order to prove that a hidden ninth episode is coming that represents the true ending of Stranger Things. So far that hasn’t happened — but that doesn’t mean Netflix is done with the series. The streamer just released One Last Adventure: The Making of Stranger Things 5, a two hour-long documentary about, well, the making of season 5. And while it’s far removed from a secret episode and provides little in the way of new conspiracy fodder, it does provide some insights into how the creative team wrapped up Netflix’s biggest show.

My biggest takeaway from watching One Last Adventure is the sheer scale of the final season. Obviously Netflix was going to go big here, but even still it’s impressive to see; the Duffer brothers used 12 stages for filming, including a backlot where the team built downtown Hawkins, and that’s in addition to scenes filmed on location. It’s especially cool seeing some of the craftspeople work on the bigger set pieces, like building and painting the massive, pulsing tendrils that make up Vecna’s lair, or figuring out how exactly to design an office building that is also melting while characters move through it. There are a number of sequences in the doc where the crew stress over just how they’re going to pull off the ideas the Duffers have.

My second biggest takeaway: this season came together on the fly. Despite being in the works for so long — there are shots of table reads dating back to 2023 — the final episode was actually being filmed while the script was still being written. The reason, it seems, is because of the pressure of wrapping up Stranger Things. “There’s always a sense of panic that it’s not going to come together,” Ross Duffer explains early on in the doc. There are a few moments where you can see the writers struggling with what to do. For example, one of the reasons the abyss in the finale is largely devoid of creatures is because the team worried about “demogorgon fatigue.” They also intensely debated how to approach Eleven’s faith in the last episode. “You have to keep toying with the audience,” Ross says, in reference to whether or not El will live.

Aside from that, there isn’t much in the way of revelations, but One Last Adventure does have some fun details. The Duffers hired their own high school drama teacher to play the Hawkins High School principal, and a lot of thought went into how much blood Karen Wheeler needed to lose in her fateful fight with a demogorgon. Even better, there’s a shot of Vecna wearing over-ear headphones that has the potential to be a new meme template, albeit maybe not as much as the time he had an iced coffee.

So yeah, this documentary isn’t the return to Hawkins that many were hoping for, and it’s a pretty standard look behind the scenes of a major production. But it’s also a welcome change of pace: in the age of streaming, behind-the-scenes featurettes have dwindled alongside the physical media that used to house them. So in that way, much like Stranger Things itself, One Last Adventure is a bit of a throwback — and one I hope Netflix leans into more as it pushes into its post-Hawkins future.

            <div id="article-text">The new feature debuted today in research preview.

The new feature debuted today in research preview.

Anthropic wants to expand Claude’s AI agent capabilities and take advantage of the growing hype around Claude Code — and it’s doing it with a brand-new feature released Monday, dubbed “Claude Cowork.”

“Cowork can take on many of the same tasks that Claude Code can handle, but in a more approachable form for non-coding tasks,” Anthropic wrote in a blog post. The company is releasing it as a “research preview” so the team can learn more about how people use it and continue building accordingly. So far, Cowork is only available via Claude’s macOS app, and only for subscribers of Anthropic’s power-user tier, Claude Max, which costs $100 to $200 per month depending on usage.

Here’s how Claude Cowork works: A user gives Claude access to a folder on their computer, allowing the chatbot to read, edit, or create files. (Examples Anthropic gave included the ability fo “re-organize your downloads by sorting and renaming each file, create a new spreadsheet with a list of expenses from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft of a report from your scattered notes.”) Claude will provide regular updates on what it’s working on, and users can also use existing connectors to link it to external info (like Asana, Notion, PayPal, and other supported partners) or link it to Claude in Chrome for browser-related tasks.

“You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format,” Anthropic wrote. “Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel. It feels much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker.”

The new feature is part of Anthropic’s (and its competitors’) bid to provide the most actually useful AI agents, both for consumers and enterprise. AI agents have come a long way from their humble beginnings as mostly-theoretically-useful tools, but there’s still much more development needed before you’ll see your non-tech-industry friends using them to complete everyday tasks.

Anthropic’s “Skills for Claude,” announced in October, was a partial precursor to Cowork. Starting in October, Claude could improve at personalized tasks and jobs, by way of “folders that include instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude can load when needed to make it smarter at specific work tasks — from working with Excel [to] following your organization’s brand guidelines,” per a release at the time. People could also build their own Skills for Claude relative to their specific jobs and tasks they needed to be completed.

As part of the announcement, Anthropic warned about the potential dangers of using Cowork and other AI agent tools, namely the fact that if instructions aren’t clear, Claude does have the ability to delete local files and take other “potentially destructive actions” — and that with prompt injection attacks, there are a range of potential safety concerns. Prompt injection attacks often involve bad actors hiding malicious text in a website that the model is referencing, which instructs the model to bypass its safeguards and do something harmful, such as hand over personal data. “Agent safety — that is, the task of securing Claude’s real-world actions — is still an active area of development in the industry,” Anthropic wrote.

Claude Max subscribers try out the new feature by clicking on “Cowork” in the sidebar of the macOS app. Other users can join the waitlist.

            <div id="article-text">Gov. Kathy Hochul made new requirements meant to protect kids online a centerpiece of her plan for state policy.

Gov. Kathy Hochul made new requirements meant to protect kids online a centerpiece of her plan for state policy.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is making kids’ online safety a cornerstone of her administration, and she’s eyeing a platform that has often flown under the radar: Roblox.

As progress in Congress has stagnated, states have become the primary drivers of internet reforms meant to protect kids, including age verification laws and new requirements for online platforms. Hochul announced a sweeping plan to expand online parental controls and age verification, which she’ll tout at her State of the State on Tuesday. It notably pulls from a piece of legislation crafted by state Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Nily Rozic meant to plug a gap in earlier state legislation in order to encompass online gaming. Gounardes told The Verge in a 2024 interview when he first introduced the legislation as the New York Children’s Online Safety Act (NYCOSA) — now the Stop Online Predators Act — that the idea came from parents who wondered whether his earlier kids safety legislation would cover Roblox, the social gaming platform that is extremely popular with children.

Drawing from the bill, Hochul’s plans include expanding requirements for platforms to verify their users’ ages to include online gaming platforms like Roblox. She also wants platforms to keep kids’ accounts on the highest privacy settings by default so that they can’t be seen or contacted by unknown accounts, and to disable AI chatbot features for kids. The plan also includes requirements for parents to be able to limit financial transactions on their kids’ accounts.

“There’s no reason platforms like Roblox should be different”

New York state leaders don’t want Roblox, for which more than 40 percent of users are reportedly under age 13, to be left out of new protections. “From toys to food to cars, we regulate all sorts of products to keep children safe. There’s no reason platforms like Roblox should be different,” Gounardes said in a statement ahead of the State of the State. “Online platforms like Roblox are enabling unsafe environments for children, including allowing predators to send explicit messages to children,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “We urgently need to pass crucial online safety protections to stop predators from exploiting children and create safer online environments for children to play.”

Roblox did not immediately provide comment on the State of the State proposal, but Roblox spokesperson Eric Porterfield told The Verge after Gounardes unveiled the legislation in 2024 that the company is a “COPPA compliant gaming platform that is designed for all ages,” referring to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA). Porterfield said Roblox has “gone beyond COPPA-compliance and built safety tools and systems that address the unique needs of children and do not support photo uploads or other features specific to social media platforms.” The company has since rolled out new requirements for users to undergo a facial scan to estimate their age in order to access its chat features.

States have been at the forefront of such discussions as Congress has largely failed to pass new protections

The kids online safety proposals were the first of the State of the State plans that Hochul previewed last week, underscoring how important an issue that internet safeguards for kids has become in states like New York. States have been at the forefront of such discussions as Congress has largely failed to pass new protections since the 1990s. The proposals come alongside offline actions to address kids’ mental health, including expanded mental health clinics in schools, and an advisory board that includes 11-to-17-year-olds to inform youth mental health policy. They build on earlier legislation passed in New York state, including the Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) For Kids Act, which requires social media companies to obtain parental consent for using “addictive feeds” on kids.

But some of the proposals, like age verification, come with their own risks that opponents ranging from industry players to civil liberties groups oppose on the grounds that they could require more data collection, and potentially chill adults’ speech online. The Supreme Court recently opened the door to some age verification of porn sites, breaking from earlier decisions, but age-gating platforms that host a wide variety of speech raises even thornier questions. Courts across the country have struck down a variety of laws seeking to impose age verification at the platform and app store level, raising questions of constitutionality under the First Amendment. But states have continued to try to enact different kinds of age verification laws nonetheless, creating the potential for a fractured landscape state to state should some courts eventually uphold them.

Still, many advocates for more online safeguards are praising Hochul’s plans. “The online games kids play and the social media platforms they use for hours and hours a day have become veritable hunting grounds for predators,” Common Sense Media CEO Jim Steyer said in a statement. “Kids and teens need these new protections now more than ever.”

The Nintendo Switch 2 can be enjoyed right out of the box, but it’s even better with the right accessories. Some of these add-ons are more crucial than others, especially if you’re deciding what to buy early on. For example, a case and a screen protector can keep your console safe from scuffs, scratches, and drops, so both are what I’d consider to be essential. If you’re not a fan of how the Joy-Con 2 feel to use, a cheap but good wireless controller wouldn’t hurt, either.

On the other hand, a microSD Express card lets you add even more digital games to your library, although the console’s somewhat generous 256GB of internal storage means you may not need one right away (unless you buy a lot of games that are 50-70GB each, such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Madden 26). Some other accessories don’t add enough to the gaming experience to justify the cost. Those Joy-Con 2 steering wheel accessories? You can pass on those.

The Switch 2 and its games are expensive enough, so we’ve assembled this guide with picks that are a great value. You don’t need to spend hundreds on accessories — many of us at The Verge certainly aren’t. No matter your budget, we’ve included numerous categories, beginning with a starter kit of recommendations we think everyone should consider.

Our list of the best Switch 2 controllers is always evolving. It started with just a few alternatives to Nintendo’s great, yet imperfect Switch 2 Pro controller that costs $90. Now it’s full of options covering a range of budgets. There’s one thing that ties all of the candidates together: they have better internal hardware than the Switch 2 Pro. At a bare minimum, you’ll get a gamepad that has Hall effect or TMR joysticks that won’t eventually develop stick drift. There are also options that offer features that let you play exactly how you want, with add-on rear paddles, triggers with customizable pull distances, swappable face buttons, and more.

Currently, the best wireless controller for most Switch 2 gamers is the EasySMX S10. It offers comfort, great-feeling rumble, it includes a floating eight-way direction pad, and has support for motion controls and amiibo. It’s the total package, but I have minor complaints. The home, GameChat, and screenshot buttons are placed awkwardly, and not everyone will dig the design or the gritty texture on the grips.

It’s technically not a controller, but I’m a broken record when it comes to recommending 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2 for households already with more than one console. In the case that you have an Xbox or a PS5 and would rather not buy a bespoke Switch 2 controller, just buy this $20 adapter instead, and use it to connect a wireless controller you already own.

This adapter goes into the Switch 2’s dock (or directly into the console, if you have a USB-A to C adapter). Connecting your controller is as easy as putting it into pairing mode, then ensuring that the “Pro Controller Wired Communication” option is turned on within the console’s settings. Click and hold the adapter’s coin-shaped button to initiate pairing, then you should be good to go. The DualSense’s rumble and motion controls work seamlessly, for example, and you can remap buttons as you please within the console’s OS like you would an official Switch controller. GuliKit’s Hyperlink 2 wireless adapter works similarly, and is usually a couple dollars cheaper ($16.99 at the time of publishing). I’m still in the process of testing it, but it was easy to pair a DualSense to a Switch 2 and the connection was reliable, with motion control and rumble support.

The Killswitch is a great Switch 2 companion, whether you’re someone who primarily uses the console in handheld mode or while it’s docked. It’s a case that wraps around the Switch 2’s back, with detachable components that snugly grip onto each Joy-Con 2, adding some extra bulk that makes them more comfortable to hold. Above all else, it’s a great way to protect your console from scratches and slightly more significant damage. What’s also great is that it doesn’t limit its flexibility as a hybrid console.

Each Killswitch ships with a USB-C dock adapter that is inserted into the Switch 2 dock. Since the case-equipped console can no longer fit in Nintendo’s dock, this adapter lets you connect it to your TV without taking off the case. It’s tougher to correctly align the Switch 2’s USB-C jack with this adapter than it is to put it in the dock, but it gets easier with practice.

The Dbrand KillSwitch is worth the cost for people who can afford it. It’s more comfortable to use in handheld mode than other options, and it’s great to be able to detach the Joy-Cons when I want to. Jsaux’s ModCase is a great runner-up, though. The foundation of the accessory pack is the wrap-around case that the console fits into (you can’t remove the Joy-Con or use the kickstand once it’s on), which adds bulkier grips that make it more comfortable to hold. There’s a protrusion on the rear of the case, which is where its batch of “mods” can be attached.

The basic $29.99 kit includes a kickstand (which works better on tables than laps) and a watch-like strap for holding a power bank during charging. The $59.99 Ultimate kit that Jsaux sent for testing includes those, plus a few other extras. You get a faceplate for the console to protect its screen when not in use, as well as a phone mount with a magnet that lets you attach, say, your iPhone so you can view it while you play games. Lastly, it includes a USB-C dock extender with a silicone stand. It’s like a dock for your dock, which looks more cumbersome than Dbrand’s also-clumsy-looking solution. But, hey, it all works as intended.

The best, slimmest zip-up case you should buy is made by Tomtoc. Compared to the Belkin hard zip-up case that I got my hands on before the Switch 2’s launch, the Tomtoc FancyCase slim case feels more durable; anecdotally, it holds up much better to being squeezed by hand. It even has more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2 sticks, so it’ll never press them in on accident. Like most zip-up cases, it features a screen cover that doubles as cartridge storage. This one can hold 12 cartridges.

I’m confident that it’ll absorb more potential damage over time than other cases I’ve tried. Plus, it just looks cooler, with low-profile designs for gamers who don’t want to draw attention to their console. That said, its “Froz Edition” has ice cream-inspired looks that are a lot more expressive.

When I’m relaxing after putting our kid to sleep, I want everything to be easy. Like, I don’t even want to hold a Switch 2 while I play, if at all possible. The console’s kickstand is nice, but Mechanism’s Gaming Pillow is better, since its articulating arm can suspend the console at eye level while its plush bottom rests on my lap. You can detach the Switch 2’s Joy-Con and hold them where it’s most comfortable, or better yet, just connect a wireless controller that offers better ergonomics. The Gaming Pillow works with many other devices, too, whether it’s a PlayStation Portal, an Xbox ROG Ally, or even a Kindle with the right adapter.

Jsaux is among the first companies to launch a compact, all-in-one wall charger that doubles as a dock for the Switch 2 and other handhelds. The OmniCentro dock — which comes with a USB-C port, a USB-A port, and an HDMI cable — retails for $39.99 at time of writing, which isn’t a bad price given its specs. Its USB-C port tops out at 65W, which is more than enough for a Switch 2 and most other gaming handhelds. The adapter supports 4K resolution at 60 frames per second with HDR, or 1440p and 1080p at up to 120 frames per second. You can also use it as a compact hub for your tablet or laptop, as its USB-A port comes in handy for wireless dongles or for charging small accessories.

If you use Nintendo’s GameChat feature, you might want a webcam to show your face to friends. The best webcam that you can get for your Switch 2 should be the cheapest one you can find that’s guaranteed to work with it. Almost all of Logitech’s webcams support the Switch 2, and Elgato has updated its Facecam MK.2 to support it, as well. Elgato’s model is pricier than we recommend most people spend, but it’s a solid option if you also have a PC to use it with. It’s worth knowing that the Switch 2 displays low-fidelity video feeds during gameplay, so unless you plan to use the webcam with your PC as well, it’s not worth spending a lot for a model that promises great video quality.

The Switch 2 is more powerful than the original Switch. However, it doesn’t require all that much more power to charge, even while you’re playing games. While new phones and tablets are breaking new ground with fast charging speeds, getting a power bank that can deliver at least 20W is totally sufficient to get the fastest-possible charging speeds with the Switch 2 in handheld mode.

By using a display-equipped USB-C cable with a wattage reading, I was able to see that the Switch 2 usually pulls a maximum of about 15-17W of power (sometimes less) from a USB-C battery during gameplay. When the system was asleep, the rate went down to between 8-13W, fluctuating at different points during the charging process. From a totally dead state, the console took almost 90 minutes to reach 69 percent with a 20W battery plugged into it. You’ll likely drain your USB-C battery more quickly if you’re playing as you charge.

Thankfully, your options for compatible batteries are plentiful. You’ll likely be paying for more power than you’ll need with the Switch 2, but more power (and especially more ports) are never a bad thing to have too much of.

The Switch 2 supports microSD Express cards of up to 2TB, even though models with that amount of storage aren’t yet available for purchase. Most brands make cards in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB configurations, and some offer 1TB cards as well. I’d suggest grabbing the cheapest microSD Express card you can find, as so far they all offer similarly fast read/write speeds. Right now, Samsung’s P9 is one of the most affordable models you can get, with the 256GB version going down to $34.99 sometimes.

If you travel often or just really want heightened immersion, AR glasses are a good purchase to consider. Instead of using a TV or a monitor, they put the screen right up to your eyeballs, and modern models offer head-tracking to let the screen follow your movements, as well as sensors that let you lock the screen in place virtually. There’s more than one good set of AR glasses out there, too. Viture’s $499 Luma Pro and its Pro mobile gaming dock, which is necessary for connecting a Switch 2 and HDMI-based consoles, are a solid pair that offer both great contrast and brightness. Better yet, they offer physical myopia adjustment dials, giving you another way besides prescription lenses to achieve the clarity you’re looking for.

Xreal’s $449 1S are also worth considering. They require the Xreal Neo mobile dock to connect a Switch 2, but the Neo is actually smaller and slicker than Viture’s competing dock (the Luma Pro also work great on the Neo). Performance, resolution, features, and comfort are nearly identical between the two Xreal and Viture models; however, with Xreal, you’ll have to settle for software-based interpupillary distance adjustments instead of a hardware-based solution. In other words, you might need prescription lenses with the 1S if you require glasses to see clearly for any reason.

There are two extra items that I think most people should consider buying for their Switch 2. The first is a screen protector. As I mentioned at the top of the post, the console’s screen is its most fragile component, so spend the $10 or so necessary to get a multipack of tempered glass protectors so you don’t have to think about it again. Many brands make them, but I’ve had great experiences with stuff from amFilm.

The other accessory is a USB-C-to-Ethernet adapter. It’s possible that you may get a ton of usage out of this, especially if you play online multiplayer games and you want to nip latency in the bud. Or, if you’re like me, you’ll just plug it in when it comes time to download a game. The Switch 2’s Wi-Fi is awfully slow when it comes to downloading large files, even when you have fast internet. Plugging this accessory into either of its USB-C ports greatly increases download speeds.

Update, January 12th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability and several products, including Jsaux’s OmniCentro dock, Mechanism’s Gaming Pillow, and two pairs of video glasses.</div>

            <h2>CES showed me why Chinese tech companies feel so optimistic</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1131193/ces-showed-me-why-chinese-tech-companies-feel-so-optimistic/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

I decided to go to CES kind of at the last minute. Over the holiday break, contacts from China kept messaging me about their travel plans. After the umpteenth “See you in Vegas?” I caved. As a China tech writer based in the US, I have one week a year when my entire beat seems to come to me—no 20-hour flights required.

CES, the Consumer Electronics Show, is the world’s biggest tech show, where companies launch new gadgets and announce new developments, and it happens every January. This year, it attracted over 148,000 attendees and over 4,100 exhibitors. It sprawls across the Las Vegas Convention Center, the city’s biggest exhibition space, and spills over into adjacent hotels.

China has long had a presence at CES, but this year it showed up in a big way. Chinese exhibitors accounted for nearly a quarter of all companies at the show, and in pockets like AI hardware and robotics, China’s presence felt especially dominant. On the floor, I saw tons of Chinese industry attendees roaming around, plus a notable number of Chinese VCs. Multiple experienced CES attendees told me this is the first post-covid CES where China was present in a way you couldn’t miss. Last year might have been trending that way too, but a lot of Chinese attendees reportedly ran into visa denials. Now AI has become the universal excuse, and reason, to make the trip.

As expected, AI was the biggest theme this year, seen on every booth wall. It’s both the biggest thing everyone is talking about and a deeply confusing marketing gimmick. “We added AI” is slapped onto everything from the reasonable (PCs, phones, TVs, security systems) to the deranged (slippers, hair dryers, bed frames).

Consumer AI gadgets still feel early and of very uneven quality. The most common categories are educational devices and emotional support toys—which, as I’ve written about recently, are all the rage in China. There are some memorable ones: Luka AI makes a robotic panda that scuttles around and keeps a watchful eye on your baby. Fuzozo, a fluffy keychain-size AI robot, is basically a digital pet in physical form. It comes with a built-in personality and reacts to how you treat it. The companies selling these just hope you won’t think too hard about the privacy implications.

Ian Goh, an investor at 01.VC, told me China’s manufacturing advantage gives it a unique edge in AI consumer electronics, because a lot of Western companies feel they simply cannot fight and win in the arena of hardware.

Another area where Chinese companies seem to be at the head of the pack is household electronics. The products they make are becoming impressively sophisticated. Home robots, 360 cams, security systems, drones, lawn-mowing machines, pool heat pumps … Did you know two Chinese brands basically dominate the market for home cleaning robots in the US and are eating the lunch of Dyson and Shark? Did you know almost all the suburban yard tech you can buy in the West comes from Shenzhen, even though that whole backyard-obsessed lifestyle barely exists in China? This stuff is so sleek that you wouldn’t clock it as Chinese unless you went looking. The old “cheap and repetitive” stereotype doesn’t explain what I saw. I walked away from CES feeling that I needed a major home appliance upgrade.

Of course, appliances are a safe, mature market. On the more experiential front, humanoid robots were a giant magnet for crowds, and Chinese companies put on a great show. Every robot seemed to be dancing, in styles from Michael Jackson to K-pop to lion dancing, some even doing back flips. Hangzhou-based Unitree even set up a boxing ring where people could “challenge” its robots. The robot fighters were about half the size of an adult human and the matches often ended in a robot knockout, but that’s not really the point. What Unitree was actually showing off was its robots’ stability and balance: they got shoved, stumbled across the ring, and stayed upright, recovering mid-motion. Beyond flexing dynamic movements like these there were also impressive showcases of dexterity: Robots could be seen folding paper pinwheels, doing laundry, playing piano, and even making latte art.

However, most of these robots, even the good ones, are one-trick ponies. They’re optimized for a specific task on the show floor. I tried to make one fold a T-shirt after I’d flipped the garment around, and it got confused very quickly.

Still, they’re getting a lot of hype as an  important next frontier because they could help drag AI out of text boxes and into the physical world. As LLMs mature, vision-language models feel like the logical next step. But then you run into the big problem: There’s far less physical-world data than text data to train AI on. Humanoid robots become both applications and roaming data-collection terminals. China is uniquely positioned here because of supply chains, manufacturing depth, and spillover from adjacent industries (EVs, batteries, motors, sensors), and it’s already developing a humanoid training industry, as Rest of World reported recently.

Most Chinese companies believe that if you can manufacture at scale, you can innovate, and they’re not wrong. A lot of the confidence in China’s nascent humanoid robot industry and beyond is less about a single breakthrough and more about “We can iterate faster than the West.”

Chinese companies are not just selling gadgets, though—they’re working on every layer of the tech stack. Not just on end products but frameworks, tooling, IoT enablement, spatial data. Open-source culture feels deeply embedded; engineers from Hangzhou tell me there are AI hackathons every week in the city, where China’s new “little Silicon Valley” is located.

Indeed, the headline innovations at CES 2026 were not on devices but in cloud: platforms, ecosystems, enterprise deployments, and “hybrid AI” (cloud + on-device) applications. Lenovo threw the buzziest main-stage events this year, and yes, there were PCs—but the core story was its cross-device AI agent system, Qira, and a partnership pitch with Nvidia aimed at AI cloud providers. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, launched Vera Rubin, a new data-center platform, claiming it would  dramatically lower costs for training and running AI. AMD’s CEO, Lisa Su, introduced Helios, another data-center system built to run huge AI workloads. These solutions point to the ballooning AI computing workload at data centers, and the real race of making cloud services cheap and powerful enough to keep up.

As I spoke with China-related attendees, the overall mood I felt was a cautious optimism. At a house party I went to, VCs and founders from China were mingling effortlessly with Bay Area transplants. Everyone is building something. Almost no one wants to just make money from Chinese consumers anymore. The new default is: Build in China, sell to the world, and treat the US market like the proving ground.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

The model is built to detect when crimes are being “contemplated.”

            <h2>Mitigating emissions from air freight: Unlocking the potential of SAF with book and claim</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1128939/mitigating-emissions-from-air-freight-unlocking-the-potential-of-saf-with-book-and-claim/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emissions from air freight have increased by 25% since 2019, according to a 2024 analysis by environmental advocacy organization Stand.Earth.

The researchers found that the expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport goods during the pandemic — as air travel halted, slower freight modes faced disruption, but demand for rapid delivery soared — has led to a yearly increase of almost 20 million tons of carbon dioxide, making up 93.8m tonnes from air freight overall.

And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn&#39;t really picked up massively. It&#39;s not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They&#39;re very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they&#39;re getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it&#39;s providing to our customers to be sure that they&#39;re not saying something which they can&#39;t confidently stand behind.”

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don&#39;t wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

Introducing this year’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies

It’s easy to be cynical about technology these days. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were more about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans than improving the world. Yet you can be sympathetic to the techlash and still fully buy into the idea that technology can be good.

We really can build tools that make this planet healthier, more livable, more equitable, and just all-around better. And some people are doing just that, pushing progress forward across a number of fundamental, potentially world-changing technologies.

These are exactly the technologies we aim to spotlight in our annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list. These are 10 technologies that we believe are poised to fundamentally alter the world, and they’re a matter of hot debate across the newsroom for months before being unveiled. So, without further ado… Here’s the full list.

Do you think we’ve missed something? You have until April to cast your vote for the 11th breakthrough!

—Fabio Duarte is associate director and principal research scientist at the MIT Senseable City Lab.

Today marks the 25th year the MIT Technology Review newsroom has compiled its annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, asking them what we can learn from the failures.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. Read about why that is.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

This startup is about to conduct the biggest real-world test of aluminum as a zero-carbon fuel

Found Energy aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale.

Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which it claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built. Soon, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel.

If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. Read the full story.

A place for comfort, fun and distraction to brighten up your day. (Got any ideas? Drop me a line or skeet &#39;em at me.)

+ I enjoyed this heartwarming story of love across the generational divide ❤️ + It turns out you can cook an egg in an air fryer. The big question is—should you?+ Of course Japan has a real-life Pokémon Fossil Museum.+ If you haven’t already, make 2026 the year you get a hobby. Your life will be all the richer for it.

            <h2>Securing digital assets as crypto crime surges</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1129479/securing-digital-assets-as-crypto-crime-surges/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In February 2025, cyberattackers thought to be linked to North Korea executed a sophisticated supply chain attack on cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. By targeting its infrastructure and multi-signature security process, hackers managed to steal more than $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum in the largest known digital-asset theft to date.

The ripple effects were felt across the cryptocurrency market, with the price of Bitcoin dropping 20% from its record high in January. And the massive losses put 2025 on track to be the worst year in history for cryptocurrency theft.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins have established themselves as benchmark monetary vehicles, and, despite volatility, their values continue to rise. In October 2025, the value of cryptocurrency and other digital assets topped $4 trillion.

Yet, with this burgeoning value and liquidity comes more attention from cybercriminals and digital thieves. The Bybit attack demonstrates how focused sophisticated attackers are on finding ways to break the security measures that guard the crypto ecosystem, says Charles Guillemet, chief technology officer of Ledger, a provider of secure signer platforms.

”The attackers were very well organized, they have plenty of money, and they are spending a lot of time and resources trying to attack big stuff, because they can,” he says. “In terms of opportunity costs, it&#39;s a big investment, but if at the end they earn $1.4 billion it makes sense to do this investment.”

But it also demonstrates how the crypto threat landscape has pitfalls not just for the unwary but for the tech savvy too. On the one hand, cybercriminals are using techniques like social engineering to target end users. On the other, they are increasingly looking for vulnerabilities to exploit at different points in the cryptocurrency infrastructure.

Historically, owners of digital assets have had to stand against these attackers alone. But now, cybersecurity firms and cryptocurrency-solution providers are offering new solutions, powered by in-depth threat research.

One of the advantages of cryprocurrency is self custody. Users can save their private keys—the critical piece of alphanumeric code that proves ownership and grants full control over digital assets—into either a software or hardware wallet to safeguard it.

But users must put their faith in the security of the wallet technology, and, because the data is the asset, if the keys are lost or forgotten, the value too can be lost.

”If I hack your credit card, what is the issue? You will call your bank, and they will manage to revert the operations,” says Vincent Bouzon, head of the Donjon research team at Ledger. &quot;The problem with crypto is, if something happens, it&#39;s too late. So we must eliminate the possibility of vulnerabilities and give users security.”

Increasingly, attackers are focusing on digital assets known as stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that is pegged to the value of a hard asset, such as gold, or a fiat currency, like the US dollar.

Stablecoins rely on smart contracts—digital contracts stored on blockchain that use pre-set code to manage issuance, maintain value, and enforce rules—that can be vulnerable to different classes of attacks, often taking advantage of users&#39; credulity or lack of awareness about the threats. Post-theft countermeasures, such as freezing the transfer of coins and blacklisting of addresses, can lessen the risk with these kinds of attacks, however.

Software-based wallets, also known as “hot wallets,” which are applications or programs that run on a user’s computer, phone, or web browser, are often a weak link. While their connection to the internet makes them convenient for users, it also makes them more readily accessible to hackers too.

“If you are using a software wallet, by design it&#39;s vulnerable because your keys are stored inside your computer or inside your phone. And unfortunately, a phone or a computer is not designed for security.” says Guillemet.

The rewards for exploiting this kind of vulnerability can be extensive. Hackers who stole credentials in a targeted attack on encrypted password manager application LastPass in 2022 managed to transfer millions worth of cryptocurrency away from victims in the subsequent two or more years.

Even hardware-based wallets, which often resemble USB drives or key fobs and are more secure than their software counterparts since they are completely offline, can have vulnerabilities that a diligent attacker might find and exploit.

Tactics include the use of side-channel attacks, for example, where a cycbercriminal observes a system’s physical side effects, like timing, power, or electromagnetic and acoustic emissions to gain information about the implementation of an algorithm.

Guillemet explains that cybersecurity providers building digital asset solutions, such as wallets, need to help minimize the burden on the users by building security features and providing education about enhancing defense.

For businesses to protect cryptocurrency, tokens, critical documents, or other digital assets, this could be a platform that allows multi-stakeholder custody and governance, supports software and hardware protections, and allows for visibility of assets and transactions through Web3 checks.

As the threat landscape evolves at breakneck speed, in-depth research conducted by attack labs like Ledger Donjon can help security firms keep pace. The team at Ledger Donjon are working to understand how to proactively secure the digital asset ecosystem and set global security standards.

Key projects include the team’s offensive security research, which uses ethical and white hat hackers to simulate attacks and uncover weaknesses in hardware wallets, cryptographic systems, and infrastructure.

In November 2022, the Donjon team discovered a vulnerability in Web3 wallet platform Trust Wallet, which had been acquired by Binance. They found that the seed-phrase generation was not random enough, allowing the team to compute all possible private keys and putting as much as $30 million stored in Trust Wallet accounts at risk, says Bouzon. “The entropy was not high enough, the entropy was only 4 billion. It was huge, but not enough,” he says.

To enhance overall safety there are three key principles that digital-asset protection platforms should apply, says Bouzon. First, security providers should create secure algorithms to generate the seed phrases for private keys and conduct in-depth security audits of the software. Second, users should use hardware wallets with a secure screen instead of software wallets. And finally, any smart contract transaction should include visibility into what is being signed to avoid blind signing attacks.

Ultimately, the responsibility for safeguarding these valuable assets lies on both digital asset solution providers and the users themselves. As the value of cryptocurrencies continues to grow so too will the threat landscape as hackers keep attempting to circumvent new security measures. While digital asset providers, security firms, and wallet solutions must work to build strong and simple protection to support the cryptocurrency ecosystems, users must also seek out the information and education they need to proactively protect themselves and their wallets.

            <div id="article-text">Our reporters and editors constantly debate which emerging technologies will define the future. Once a year, we take stock and share some educated guesses with our readers. Here are the advances that we think will drive progress or incite the most change—for better or worse—in the years ahead.

Sodium-ion batteries, made from abundant materials like salt, are emerging as a cheaper, safer alternative to lithium. Backed by major players and public investment, they’re poised to power grids and affordable EVs worldwide.

AI coding tools are revolutionizing how we write, test, and deploy code, making it easier and faster to build sophisticated websites, games, and other applications than ever before. Just be sure to double-check what they come up with.

Nuclear power already provides steady electricity to grids around the world, without producing any greenhouse-gas emissions. New designs rely on alternative fuels and cooling systems or take up less space, which could get more reactors online faster.

From molten salt to TRISO fuel, here’s how technological advancements could upend an old power technology.

Every day, millions of people interact with AI chatbots. Some of them form what feel like close, personal bonds with the bots. There’s mounting evidence that this can be dangerous, and politicians are finally waking up.

When he was just seven months old, baby KJ became the first person to receive a personalized gene-editing treatment. A clinical trial is now planned, and bespoke gene-editing drugs could be approved within the next few years.

Growing banks of gene information on extinct creatures are providing clues to new treatments and suggesting solutions to climate change—and may help save endangered species.

Nobody knows exactly how large language models work, which means we don’t have a clear idea of their limitations. But that’s changing: Clever research techniques are giving us the best glimpse yet of what’s really going on inside the black box.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

Space tourism may seem fanciful, but this might be the year paying customers can finally check into a room with a galactic view. The shiny new modules will also support research missions by scientists and space agencies.

Screening embryos for genetic diseases is relatively common practice in fertility clinics today, and it can give potential parents some peace of mind. Now, though, new startups are making bold claims about using similar techniques to predict certain traits, including intelligence.

The race for AI supremacy has supercharged data centers. Hyperscale AI data centers pack powerful computer chips into synchronized clusters that work like giant, high-speed supercomputers—sizzling hot, power-hungry behemoths pushing infrastructure to its limits.

MIT Technology Review’s annual list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies aims to help our audience know which emerging technologies are really worth paying attention to right now. Our editors and reporters pitch advances that they think should make the list, and we discuss and debate the merits of each over the course of several months.

We look for breakthroughs that will have a broad impact and make meaningful differences in our lives and work. We give equal consideration to those that we think will have a positive effect or bring negative consequences. Every year, we have to pass on many worthy candidates. Here’s what didn’t make the list this year.

This is the 25th year we’ve produced this list. Predicting the future is tough and we don’t always get it right. Look back through our archives to see what’s worked out—and what hasn’t. Or read this special analysis by an MIT researcher about some of the flops.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every year, MIT Technology Review publishes a list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies. In fact, the 2026 version is out today. This marks the 25th year the newsroom has compiled this annual list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning.

We ask these MIT students to find some of the “flops” from breakthrough lists in the archives and consider what factors or decisions led to their demise, and then to envision possible ways to “flip” the negative outcome into a success. The idea is to combine critical perspective and creativity when thinking about technology.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. It reveals how factors outside what is narrowly understood as technology play a role in its success—factors including cultural context, social acceptance, market competition, and simply timing.

In some cases, the vision behind a breakthrough was prescient but the technology of the day was not the best way to achieve it. Social TV (featured on the list in 2010) is an example: Its advocates proposed different ways to tie together social platforms and streaming services to make it easier to chat or interact with your friends while watching live TV shows when you weren’t physically together.

This idea rightly reflected the great potential for connection in this modern era of pervasive cell phones, broadband, and Wi-Fi. But it bet on a medium that was in decline: live TV.

Still, anyone who had teenage children during the pandemic can testify to the emergence of a similar phenomenon—youngsters started watching movies or TV series simultaneously on streaming platforms while checking comments on social media feeds and interacting with friends over messaging apps.

Shared real-time viewing with geographically scattered friends did catch on, but instead of taking place through one centralized service, it emerged organically on multiple platforms and devices. And the experience felt unique to each group of friends, because they could watch whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted, independent of the live TV schedule.

Here are a few more examples of flops from the breakthroughs list that students in the 2025 edition of my course identified, and the lessons that we could take from each.

The DNA app store (from the 2016 list) was selected by Kaleigh Spears. It seemed like a great deal at the time—a startup called Helix could sequence your genome for just $80. Then, in the company’s app store, you could share that data with third parties that promised to analyze it for relevant medical info, or make it into fun merch. But Helix has since shut down the store and no longer sells directly to consumers.Privacy concerns and doubts about the accuracy of third-party apps were among the main reasons the service didn’t catch on, particularly since there’s minimal regulation of health apps in the US.

Elvis Chipiro picked universal memory (from the 2005 list). The vision was for one memory tech to rule them all—flash, random-access memory, and hard disk drives would be subsumed by a new method that relied on tiny structures called carbon nanotubes to store far more bits per square centimeter. The company behind the technology, Nantero, raised significant funds and signed on licensing partners but struggled to deliver a product on its stated timeline.Nantero ran into challenges when it tried to produce its memory at scale because tiny variations in the way the nanotubes were arranged could cause errors. It also proved difficult to upend memory technologies that were already deeply embedded within the industry and well integrated into fabs.

Light-field photography (from the 2012 list), chosen by Cherry Tang, let you snap a photo and adjust the image’s focus later. You’d never deal with a blurry photo ever again. To make this possible, the startup Lytro had developed a special camera that captured not just the color and intensity of light but also the angle of its rays. It was one of the first cameras of its kind designed for consumers. Even so, the company shut down in 2018.

Ultimately, Lytro was outmatched by well-established incumbents like Sony and Nokia. The camera itself had a tiny display, and the images it produced were fairly low resolution. Readjusting the focus in images using the company’s own software also required a fair amount of manual work. And smartphones—with their handy built-in cameras—were becoming ubiquitous.

Many students over the years have selected Project Loon (from the 2015 list)—one of the so-called “moonshots” out of Google X. It proposed using gigantic balloons to replace networks of cell-phone towers to provide internet access, mainly in remote areas. The company completed field tests in multiple countries and even provided emergency internet service to Puerto Rico during the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. But the company shut down the project in 2021, with Google X CEO Astro Teller saying in a blog post that “the road to commercial viability has proven much longer and riskier than hoped.”

Sean Lee, from my 2025 class, saw the reason for its flop in the company’s very mission: Project Loon operated in low-income regions where customers had limited purchasing power. There were also substantial commercial hurdles that may have slowed development—the company relied on partnerships with local telecom providers to deliver the service and had to secure government approvals to navigate in national airspaces.

While this specific project did not become a breakthrough, the overall goal of making the internet more accessible through high-altitude connectivity has been carried forward by other companies, most notably Starlink with its constellation of low-orbit satellites. Sometimes a company has the right idea but the wrong approach, and a firm with a different technology can make more progress.

As part of this class exercise, we also ask students to pick a technology from the list that they think might flop in the future. Here, too, their choices can be quite illuminating.

Lynn Grosso chose synthetic data for AI (a 2022 pick), which means using AI to generate data that mimics real-world patterns for other AI models to train on. Though it’s become more popular as tech companies have run out of real data to feed their models, she points out that this practice can lead to model collapse, with AI models trained exclusively on generated data eventually breaking the connection to data drawn from reality.

And Eden Olayiwole thinks the long-term success of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm (a 2021 pick) is in jeopardy as awareness grows of the technology’s potential harms and its tendency to, as she puts it, incentive creators to “microwave” ideas for quick consumption.

But she also offers a possible solution. Remember—we asked all the students what they would do to “flip” the flopped (or soon-to-flop) technologies they selected. The idea was to prompt them to think about better ways of building or deploying these tools.

For TikTok, Olayiwole suggests letting users indicate which types of videos they want to see more of, instead of feeding them an endless stream based on their past watching behavior. TikTok already lets users express interest in specific topics, but she proposes taking it a step further to give them options for content and tone—allowing them to request more educational videos, for example, or more calming content.

It’s always challenging to predict how a technology will shape a future that itself is in motion. Predictions not only make a claim about the future; they also describe a vision of what matters to the predictor, and they can influence how we behave, innovate, and invest.

One of my main takeaways after years of running this exercise with students is that there’s not always a clear line between a successful breakthrough and a true flop. Some technologies may not have been successful on their own but are the basis of other breakthrough technologies (natural-language processing, 2001). Others may not have reached their potential as expected but could still have enormous impact in the future (brain-machine interfaces, 2001). Or they may need more investment, which is difficult to attract when they are not flashy (malaria vaccine, 2022).

Despite the flops over the years, this annual practice of making bold and sometimes risky predictions is worthwhile. The list gives us a sense of what advances are on the technology community’s radar at a given time and reflects the economic, social, and cultural values that inform every pick. When we revisit the 2026 list in a few years, we’ll see which of today’s values have prevailed.

            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.

            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.

            <h2>ChatGPT Health has arrived</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-08</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.
