            <h2>The Chevrolet Bolt is back... but for how long?</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new Chevrolet Equinox EV is a solid entry into the compact crossover market, and with a (just) sub-$35,000 starting price, it also counts as affordable by the standards of 2026. But if you think that’s too rich for your blood, or that the Equinox is still too large for your needs, take heart—the Chevrolet Bolt is back in dealerships now as well.

The Bolt was GM’s first modern electric vehicle, following on from the hand-built, pre-lithium ion EV1 and the compliance car that was the Spark EV. We’re big fans of the Bolt here at Ars Technica. It offered well more than 200 miles of range in a mass-produced EV at a reasonable price well before Tesla’s Model 3 started clogging up our roads, it got more efficient over time, and it managed to be fun to drive in the process.

General Motors (which owns Chevrolet) probably feels less well-disposed toward the Bolt. It lost thousands of dollars on each car it sold, even before the entire fleet had to be recalled for a costly battery replacement. The issue was due to improperly folded tabs on some cells that could cause a battery fire, giving GM (and its battery partner LG) plenty of bad press in the process. That recall alone cost $1.8 billion.

The Bolt also predated GM’s big investment into the battery platform it used to but no longer calls “Ultium.” As the automaker began to ready a larger portfolio of new EVs (including the aforementioned Equinox EV), it decided the Bolt would have to go to make room for production of other, more profitable vehicles. The announcement was made in April 2023 and helped make the Bolt GM’s bestselling EV by a large margin.

The outcry from Bolt fans was loud and vociferous, and in July 2025, GM CEO Mary Barra announced that it would be coming back, with a new Ultium-based battery pack. But only in the Bolt EUV body style—if you prefer the original hatchback, you’re out of luck.

Reengineering the Bolt for a new battery pack wasn’t a quick process. The cells, modules, and electronics are all different but had to fit in the same size space with the same mounting points as the original. And GM’s own LFP factory won’t be producing cells until sometime next year. Which means for now, GM is importing LPF cells from CATL in China, paying costly tariffs in the process.

In October, Chevy released pricing: $28,995 (plus a $1,395 delivery charge) for the Bolt LT, or $32,995 for the Bolt RS. In time—we’re not sure when—there’s supposed to be a stripped-out model that starts at less than $28,000. For the record, this is more expensive than the Bolt EUV we reviewed in late 2022, particularly once you take trim levels into account. And of course, there’s now no way to cast your Apple or Android phone to the new infotainment system. And the model-year 2027 Bolt makes far less torque than the Bolts we were used to driving, which may well mean a very different on-road experience, given how important that tidal wave of torque is to how an EV feels.

Now, Chevy has released the all-important info: 262 miles (422 km) of range according to the EPA test, a slight improvement on the 249 miles (398 km) of range from the old Bolt EUV. Better news is that fast charging is almost three times more powerful. Where the old Bolt topped out at 55 kW, often infuriating other EV drivers waiting for them to hurry up at overcrowded charging stations, the new car will reach rates of up to 150 kW, meaning a 10–80 percent charge should take as little as 26 minutes, not close to an hour.

Chevy says that the new Bolt is already in dealerships, in both LT and RS trims. But its inventory checker won’t search for MY27 vehicles yet, so we haven’t been able to confirm that. The company has also said that the car is only back “for a limited time only.” Although with no elaboration on what “limited” means in this context, we can’t tell you how many cars the automaker will actually build.</div>

            <h2>New research shows how shunning ultraprocessed foods helps with aging</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Older adults can dramatically reduce the amount of ultraprocessed foods they eat while keeping a familiar, balanced diet—and this shift leads to improvements across several key markers related to how the body regulates appetite and metabolism. That’s the main finding of a new study my colleagues and I published in the journal Clinical Nutrition.

Ultraprocessed foods are made using industrial techniques and ingredients that aren’t typically used in home cooking. They often contain additives such as emulsifiers, flavorings, colors, and preservatives. Common examples include packaged snacks, ready-to-eat meals, and some processed meats. Studies have linked diets high in ultraprocessed foods to poorer health outcomes.

My team and I enrolled Americans ages 65 and older in our study, many of whom were overweight or had metabolic risk factors such as insulin resistance or high cholesterol. Participants followed two diets low in ultraprocessed foods for eight weeks each. One included lean red meat (pork); the other was vegetarian with milk and eggs. For two weeks in between, participants returned to their usual diets.

A total of 43 people began the dietary intervention, and 36 completed the full study.

In both diets, ultraprocessed foods made up less than 15 percent of the total calories—a significant reduction from the typical American diet, where more than 50 percent of total calories comes from ultraprocessed foods. The diets were designed to be realistic for everyday eating, and participants were not instructed to restrict calories, lose weight, or change their physical activity.

We prepared, portioned, and provided all meals and snacks for the study. Both diets emphasized minimally processed ingredients and aligned with the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the US government’s nutrient-based recommendations for healthy eating, while providing similar calories and amounts of key nutrients.

The 2025–2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, released on January 7, 2026, explicitly recommend eating less ultraprocessed food, but the previous versions of the guidelines did not specifically address food processing. Our feeding study design allowed us, for the first time, to examine the health effects of reducing ultraprocessed foods while keeping nutrient levels consistent with recommended targets.

We compared how participants fared while eating their habitual diets with how they responded to the two diets that were low in ultraprocessed foods. During the periods when participants ate fewer ultraprocessed foods, they naturally consumed fewer calories and lost weight, including total and abdominal body fat. Beyond weight loss, they also showed meaningful improvements in insulin sensitivity, healthier cholesterol levels, fewer signs of inflammation, and favorable changes in hormones that help regulate appetite and metabolism.

These improvements were similar whether participants followed the meat-based or the vegetarian diet.

Ultraprocessed foods make up more than half the calories consumed by most US adults. Although these foods are convenient and widely available, studies that track people’s diets over time increasingly link them with obesity and age-related chronic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. With older adults making up a growing share of the global population, strategies that preserve metabolic health could support healthy aging.

Most previous feeding studies testing how ultraprocessed foods affect people’s health haven’t reflected real-world eating, especially among Americans. For example, some studies have compared diets made up almost entirely of ultraprocessed foods with diets that contain little to none at all.

Our study aimed to more closely approximate people’s experience while still closely tracking the foods they consumed. It is the first to show that for older adults a realistic reduction in ultraprocessed foods, outside the lab, has measurable health benefits beyond just losing weight. For older adults especially, maintaining metabolic health helps preserve mobility, independence, and quality of life.

Our study was small, reflecting the complexity of studies in which researchers tightly control what participants eat. It was not designed to show whether the metabolic improvements we observed can prevent or delay diseases such as diabetes or heart disease over time. Larger, longer studies will be needed to answer that.

On the practical side, it’s still unclear whether people can cut back on ultraprocessed foods in their daily lives without structured support, and what strategies would make it easier to do so. It’s also not fully understood which aspects of processing—for example, additives, emulsifiers, or extrusion—matter more for health.

Answering these questions could help manufacturers produce foods that are healthier but still convenient—and make it easier for people to choose healthier food options.

The Research Brief is a short take on interesting academic work.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two historic NASA test facilities used in the development of the Saturn V and space shuttle launch vehicles have been demolished after towering over the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama since the start of the Space Age.

The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility, which was erected in 1957—the same year the first artificial satellite entered Earth orbit—and the Dynamic Test Facility, which has stood since 1964, were brought down by a coordinated series of implosions on Saturday (Jan. 10). Located in Marshall’s East Test Area on the US Army’s Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, the two structures were no longer in use and, according to NASA, had a backlog of $25 million in needed repairs.

“This work reflects smart stewardship of taxpayer resources,” said Jared Isaacman, NASA administrator, in a statement. “Clearing outdated infrastructure allows NASA to safely modernize, streamline operations and fully leverage the infrastructure investments signed into law by President Trump to keep Marshall positioned at the forefront of aerospace innovation.”

The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility, also known as Building 4572 (and 4573, its associated gantry) or the “T-tower” in reference to its shape, was the first stand to support the firing of single-stage rockets with multiple engines. During the 1960s, the 175-foot-tall (53-meter) facility contributed to the development of the F-1 engine and the first stage (S-IC) of the Saturn V, the rocket that launched the first astronauts to the moon.

The facility, which was built by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, was used to test the Redstone rocket, the first stage of the Saturn IB and, after being modified, the solid rocket motor used by the space shuttle program. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 and listed as a National Landmark the next year.

In most recent years, NASA considered using the Propulsion and Structural Test Facility to support the Constellation program and its Ares family of rockets, but that program was canceled in 2010.

“While it is hard to let them go, they’ve earned their retirement,” said Rae Ann Meyer, the acting director of the Marshall Space Flight Center. “Each one of these structures helped NASA make history.”

The Dynamic Test Stand (Building 4550) rises more than twice as high as the Propulsion and Structural Test Facility and for good reason—it was built to fit a fully assembled Saturn V (363 feet or 111 meters tall) for mechanical and vibrational trials. Described once as the tallest building in the state, the stand later was used to form the first complete space shuttle stack with a winged orbiter (the prototype “Enterprise”), external fuel tank, and solid rocket boosters.

The Dynamic Test Stand is so tall that, according to NASA, its last use in the early 2000s was as a drop tower in support of microgravity testing. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places and deemed a National Landmark in 1985.

“These structures are not safe,” said Meyer. “Strategic demolition is a necessary step in shaping the future of NASA’s mission to explore, innovate and inspire. By removing these structures that we have not used in decades, we are saving money on upkeep of facilities we can’t use. We also are making these areas safe to use for future NASA exploration endeavors and investments.”

The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility and Dynamic Test Facility were among 19 sites identified for removal at the Marshall Space Flight Center. The count also includes the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator (NBS), a facility that enabled NASA astronauts and researchers to practice for spacewalks and work in microgravity. It comprised a tank that was 75 feet in diameter, 40 feet deep, and designed to hold up to nearly 1.5 million gallons of water (23 by 12 meters by 5.7 million liters).

The tests and training conducted in the NBS were pivotal to saving Skylab, the United States’ first space station, from damage it sustained during its 1973 launch. The simulator was also used to prepare for the repair of the Hubble Space Telescope during its first servicing mission in 1993.

The NBS opened in 1968 and was succeeded nearly 30 years later by a larger tank in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab at the Sonny Carter Training Facility near NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Demolition of the NBS began in mid-December.

To preserve the legacy of the NBS, Propulsion and Structural Test Facility, and Dynamic Test Stand, detailed architectural summaries, written histories, and large-format photos were permanently archived in the Library of Congress’ Historic American Engineering Record collection. This ensures the information will be available to the public and researchers for years to come. Additionally, NASA partnered with Auburn University to create digital models of each site.

Physical artifacts from each site were also identified and transferred to the US Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, preserving tangible pieces for educational and inspirational purposes.

“As we look to an exciting future, we honor the past, especially the dedication of the men and women who built these structures and tested hardware that has launched into space, made unprecedented scientific discoveries, and inspired generations of Americans to reach for the stars,” said Meyer.</div>

            <h2>The most fascinating monitors at CES 2026</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES 2026 took place in Las Vegas last week, and as usual, we’re looking at the most interesting monitors from the show. Not every display is a monitor in the strictest sense, but they all provide a display for computers and have a unique twist that make them worth exploring.

It was a pretty safe bet that Dell would announce new UltraSharp monitors at CES. The displays are a solid recommendation for reliable USB-C monitors, including for Mac users and people needing something polished for professional or creative work. In recent years, UltraSharp monitors have also boasted more modern features, including integrated web cameras and IPS Black tech.

This year, the strategy was clear: Bigger is better.

At 51.5 inches, the UltraSharp U5226KW that Dell announced at CES is the biggest UltraSharp monitor yet. It has a resolution of 6144×2560, for a pixel density of 129 pixels per inch. The IPS Black monitor also has a bevy of ports via a Thunderbolt 4 hub that supports up to 140 W power delivery. There’s a separate pop-out box with 27 W USB-C and 10 W USB-A ports, and the monitor can connect to up to four PCs simultaneously via an integrated KVM. There’s a bounty of connectivity options across this massive display.

The U5226KW lacks any other noteworthy innovations beyond its size, but Dell is still hoping to impress professionals who frequently use numerous apps simultaneously, and especially those currently using multi-monitor setups.

Dell’s giant UltraSharp launched last week for $2,900 with a stand or $2,800 without a stand.

All-in-ones (AIOs) are often overlooked, but Lenovo arrived at CES with a unique take on the computer-monitor combo.

The Lenovo ThinkCentre X AIO Aura Edition differs from other AIOs, including Apple’s 24-inch iMac, in its square-like panel. Its 16:18 aspect ratio means it’s not a true square, but the display is still much taller than other AIOs and most regular computer monitors, which are both usually 16:9.

The Aura Edition’s specs include a 27.6-inch IPS panel with 2560×2880 resolution, up to an Intel Core Ultra X7 Series 3 processor, up to 64GB of LPDDR5x RAM, and two M.2 SSD storage slots.

Lenovo expects the PC to appeal to “creators, programmers, and data professionals who benefit from seeing two A4 pages or full data sets in an easy-to-view portrait display,” the company said in a press release.

Additionally, Lenovo will preload the system with business-friendly features, like Lenovo DeskView, which can “digitize documents placed in front of the screen for instant sharing.” And in case there’s any debate over whether the ThinkCentre X AIO is truly a monitor, Lenovo says the device will launch with Lenovo Share Zone, which lets the screen support both the AIO and a second, connected system simultaneously.

Noteworthy AIO releases are infrequent these days (Lenovo also announced a 32-inch 4K-resolution Yoga AIO I Aura Edition aimed at consumers who want their monitor’s base to light up in different colors depending on what’s on the screen. That machine is expected to release in Q2 for $2,400). Laptops, smartphones, and improvements in monitor technology and affordability have largely supplanted some of AIOs’ primary benefits, like saving space and providing an ample screen.

But with many companies pushing employees back into offices full-time or part-time, there’s an incentive to explore alternative ways to equip offices, from AIOs to big-screen tablets, and even keyboard-PCs. AIOs are easy for IT teams to set up and use minimal space. Simultaneously, Lenovo is offering an option for the growing number of people who prefer taller screens, perhaps due to the nature of their work or the increasing presence of taller displays in consumer laptops.

Lenovo didn’t announce a price or release date for its tall AIO.

A return to classic OLED subpixel layouts from panel-makers LG Display and Samsung Display is a promising sign for the versatility and legibility of future OLED monitors.

Most OLED computer monitors use either a WOLED panel from LG Display or a QD-OLED panel from Samsung Display. WOLED panels feature a red, white, blue, and green (RWBG) subpixel layout or, for newer monitors, an RGWB subpixel layout. QD-OLED monitors have a triangular RGB layout.

Both subpixel layouts have issues with text legibility on Windows. That’s because ClearType, Windows’ subpixel font-rendering software, is built for LCDs with an RGB-stripe subpixel layout. The result for OLED monitors is “fringing,” which, to astute eyes, appears as a colorful border around text. Fringing is especially common on OLED monitors with less than 4K resolution and is often more associated with QD-OLED than WOLED.

As is common in emerging, expensive computing peripherals, OLED monitors first targeted gamers, making fringing less of a concern. WOLED and QD-OLED panels were also favored by panel suppliers because they were easier to manufacture in large sizes for TVs.

And after Japanese panel maker JOLED went bankrupt (it has since been acquired), we stopped seeing new RGB-stripe OLED monitors, which should be more suitable for reading, working, and other non-gaming applications.

But this year, LG Display is making OLED panels with RGB-stripe subpixels. As the company announced in December, “the RGB stripe structure arranges the three primary color subpixels—red, green, and blue—in a straight line, significantly reducing visual distortions such as color bleeding and fringing, even at close viewing distances. Although OLED panels using the RGB stripe method existed before, their maximum refresh rate reached around 60 Hz, making them unsuitable for use as gaming monitors.”

To enable an RGB-stripe subpixel and high refresh rates, LG Display said it increased “the proportion of the pixel area that emits light.”

Similarly, Samsung Display announced at CES that this year, Asus and MSI will release monitors with Samsung’s new QD-OLED panels, which use a vertical RGB subpixel structure the company has named “V-stripe.”

“The biggest technical challenges in mass-producing high refresh rate panels with a new pixel structure include reduced organic material lifespan, heat generation, and brightness degradation,” Samsung Display’s announcement said. “By leveraging QD-OLED’s top emission structure, which offers brightness advantages, along with improvements in organic material efficiency and design optimization, we were able to mass-produce a high-performance monitor.”

Some publications that demoed RGB-stripe OLED monitors at CES reported text looking noticeably better than on other OLED monitors.

LG and Gigabyte also announced that they will release OLED monitors with RGB-stripe subpixels this year.

In true CES fashion, Samsung’s latest Odyssey 3D monitor one-ups its predecessor in every way it can.

Samsung launched its first Odyssey 3D monitor last year. We found that while the glasses-free 3D experience was impressive, the monitor was hard to recommend given its limited game support.

Back then, Samsung’s Odyssey 3D Hub app, which is used to launch stereoscopic content, had 14 games. As of this writing, there are 29 3D-supporting titles (you can see a full list at the Microsoft Store), but that still may not be enough to warrant a purchase price of what we expect will be over $2,000, based on the preceding Odyssey 3D’s release price.

The lack of applications for a glasses-free 3D gaming monitor didn’t stop Samsung from releasing a larger option, though. The Odyssey 3D that came out in 2025 has a 27-inch 4K IPS screen with a 165 Hz refresh rate. The 2026 model is 32 inches and supports 6K resolution (6144×3456) at a refresh rate of 165 Hz. The monitor is also supposed to easily drop down to 3K resolution (3072×1728), at which point it will run at 330 Hz. So although you don’t need glasses to get the most out of this monitor, you will need a decently powerful GPU.

In addition to glasses-free 3D gaming, Samsung’s 3D monitors can make 2D videos appear to be in 3D. In our testing of the 27-inch Odyssey 3D, this worked well enough on YouTube videos, albeit with a bit of a cardboard-cutout effect.

Most gamers or people seeking 6K resolution won’t opt for a 3D monitor. But Samsung’s investment in improving 3D displays alongside (slowly) growing game support should be welcome for people who have been waiting 15 years for glasses-free 3D to really take off.

G-Sync Pulsar is a backlight strobing technique designed to reduce perceived blur when viewing fast-moving content on supported monitors.

The backlight on a Pulsar monitor pulses for one-fourth of a frame right before pixels are overwritten. This enables pixels to be the proper color before they’re lit up so you don’t see pixels fading from one hue to another. The approach differs from that of most monitors, which use always-on backlights, and is reminiscent of plasma TVs, which didn’t have backlights but lit up pixels in quick pulses, helping to reduce motion blur. Pulsar also differs from other forms of backlight strobing, such as Nvidia’s Ultra Low Motion Blur, in that it works with variable refresh rates.

Speed-hungry gamers have been awaiting Pulsar monitors since Nvidia announced the technology at CES 2024. As of this writing, three Pulsar monitors are available to purchase: Acer’s Predator XB273U F5, Asus’ ROG Strix Pulsar XG27AQNGV, and MSI’s MPG 272QRF X36.

Two-year-old California startup Odinn reportedly held limited demos at CES last week of Odinn’s Omnia X,  a provocative approach to the idea of a “portable data center.”

The term “data center” is a stretch, though, as Omnia X is far from matching the computing capabilities of even a modest data center. The PC can support up to two AMD EPYC 9965 CPUs, four Nvidia H200 NVL GPUs, and 6TB of DDR5 memory.

That’s an impressive amount of power to fit in a chassis that Odinn claims is the size of carry-on luggage. The system also has a flip-down keyboard and a pair of handles, which are essential since Omnia X weighs 77 pounds. That’s more than what you’d expect from a&quot;portable” gadget, but Omnia X’s form factor is more about simplifying “data center” access for businesses and employees with demanding and sensitive computing needs who work in various locations.

In an interview with Las Vegas Sun, Oddin CEO Carl Liebel compared Omnix X to about half of a data center rack and said it could replace a company’s need to rent space in a data center.

The Omnia X makes this list due to its (optional) integrated, 23.8-inch 4K display that flips out from the system’s side. With the display and max specifications, the Omnia X could be the most well-equipped portable computing solution we’ve seen.

Odinn says that Omnia X uses a redundant power supply unit (PSU) with a high Platinum rating for efficiency. In a PSU, efficiency means less internal heat and lower energy consumption—key areas of concern in a system like Omnia’s. Interesting Engineering reported that Omnia X uses a proprietary closed-loop cooling system.

Odinn’s website targets Omnia X at heavy-lift projects, like “military AI missions,” “enterprise-grade simulations,” and portable data centers.

“Run large models without ever connecting to the cloud. Omnia AI was built for mission-critical inference at the edge, from battlefield computer vision to real-time autonomous navigation,” Omnia’s website reads. “With dual GPUs, massive RAM, and hardware-level isolation, it delivers the kind of raw AI horsepower previously reserved for large-scale data centers, right where your team needs it most.”

Odinn is also pitching the computer to cinematographers, 3D artists, and VFX editors who work on location. Analysts, investigators, and cyber operators could also benefit by using the system for “mapping threat surfaces, performing forensic investigations, or searching across massive, disconnected data sets,” the California startup claims.

Omnia X will cost at least $550,000 Liebel told Las Vegas Sun. You can see pictures of it at the show here and here.

Every year at CES, a new panel claims to be the fastest monitor that has ever existed. Sure, most people don’t need a monitor that can refresh 1,000 times per second. But extremely high refresh rates do offer visual benefits, including less blur and fast objects looking sharper. It’s also just cool to see how far professional-grade gaming monitors can go.

One of the fastest monitors at CES 2026 is Acer’s 1,000 Hz Predator XB273U F6. Last month, Philips and AOC announced upcoming monitors that could run 720p at 1,000 Hz, too. But Acer appears to be the closest to actually releasing such a monitor. The OEM gave demos of its 1,000 Hz, 27-inch display at last week’s trade show. Unlike the other monitors, Acer’s speedy screen has a launch timeframe: Q2 2026. (Samsung also announced a 1,040 Hz monitor at the show, but the additional 40 Hz seems negligible at this point, and Samsung hasn’t provided details about how it purportedly reached that speed. Further, there seemed to be minimal demos of Samsung’s 27-inch Odyssey G6 G60H at CES 2026.)

While 1,000 Hz monitors target gamers playing games at the highest levels, they are also built to support a 2560×1440 resolution at a slower—but still amazingly fast—500 Hz.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2024, scientists announced the discovery of a new species of giant anaconda in South America. A National Geographic camera crew was on hand for the 2022 expedition that documented the new species—and so was actor Will Smith, since they were filming for NatGeo’s new documentary series, Pole to Pole with Will Smith. Now we can all share in Smith’s Amazon experience, courtesy of the three-minute clip above.

Along with venom expert Bryan Fry, we follow Smith’s journey by boat with a team of indigenous Waorani guides, scouring the river banks for anacondas. And they find one: a female green anaconda about 16 to 17 feet long, “pure muscle.” The Waorani secure the giant snake—anacondas aren’t venomous but they do bite—so that Fry (with Smith’s understandably reluctant help) can collect a scale sample for further analysis. Fry says that this will enable him to determine the accumulation of pollutants in the water.

That and other collected samples also enabled scientists to conduct the genetic analysis that resulted in the declaration of a new species: the northern green anaconda (Eunectes akayama, which roughly translates to “the great snake”). It is genetically distinct from the southern green anaconda (Eunectes murinus); the two species likely diverged some 10 million years ago. The northern green anaconda’s turf includes Venezuela, Colombia, Suriname, French Guyana, and the northern part of Brazil.

Smith’s time in the Amazon also brought the arachnophobic actor face to face with a giant tarantula while scientists extracted the venom. His further adventures brought him to the South Pole, where he trekked across frigid ice fields; to the Himalayas, where he trekked to a small village in Bhutan; to the Pacific Islands to record a lost native language; to the Kalahari Desert, where he joined the hunter-gatherer San people on a hunt; and to the North Pole, where he joined an expedition to dive under the ice to collect scientific samples.

Pole to Pole with Will Smith premieres on January 13, 2026, and will stream on Disney+ the following day.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since 2018, a group of researchers from around the world has crunched the numbers on how much heat the world’s oceans are absorbing each year. In 2025, their measurements broke records once again, making this the eighth year in a row that the world’s oceans have absorbed more heat than in the years before.

The study, which was published Friday in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Science, found that the world’s oceans absorbed an additional 23 zettajoules’ worth of heat in 2025, the most in any year since modern measurements began in the 1960s. That’s significantly higher than the 16 additional zettajoules they absorbed in 2024. The research comes from a team of more than 50 scientists across the United States, Europe, and China.

A joule is a common way to measure energy. A single joule is a relatively small unit of measurement—it’s about enough to power a tiny lightbulb for a second, or slightly heat a gram of water. But a zettajoule is one sextillion joules; numerically, the 23 zettajoules the oceans absorbed this year can be written out as 23,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

John Abraham, a professor of thermal science at the University of St. Thomas and one of the authors on the paper, says that he sometimes has trouble putting this number into contexts that laypeople understand. Abraham offers up a couple options. His favorite is comparing the energy stored in the ocean to the energy of atomic bombs: The 2025 warming, he says, is the energetic equivalent to 12 Hiroshima bombs exploding in the ocean. (Some other calculations he’s done include equating this number to the energy it would take to boil 2 billion Olympic swimming pools, or more than 200 times the electrical use of everyone on the planet.)

“Last year was a bonkers, crazy warming year—that’s the technical term,” Abraham joked to me. “The peer-reviewed scientific term is ‘bonkers’.”

The world’s oceans are its largest heat sink, absorbing more than 90 percent of the excess warming that is trapped in the atmosphere. While some of the excess heat warms the ocean’s surface, it also slowly travels further down into deeper parts of the ocean, aided by circulation and currents.

Global temperature calculations—like the ones used to determine the hottest years on record—usually only capture measurements taken at the ocean’s surface. (The study finds that overall sea surface temperatures in 2025 were slightly lower than they were in 2024, which is on record as the hottest year since modern records began. Some meteorological phenomena, like El Niño events, can also raise sea surface temperatures in certain regions, which can cause the overall ocean to absorb slightly less heat in a given year. This helps to explain why there was such a big jump in added ocean heat content between 2025, which developed a weak La Niña at the end of the year, and 2024, which came at the end of a strong El Niño year.) While sea surface temperatures have risen since the Industrial Revolution, thanks to our use of fossil fuels, these measurements don’t provide a full picture of how climate change is affecting the oceans.

“If the whole world was covered by a shallow ocean that was only a couple feet deep, it would warm up more or less at the same speed as the land,” says Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at Berkeley Earth and a co-author of the study. “But because so much of that heat is going down in the deep ocean, we see generally slower warming of sea surface temperatures [than those on land].”

Surface temperatures, Hausfather says, are what most directly impact human societies: They have direct effects on weather patterns and most of the ocean life we interact with. But the amount of heat stored in deeper parts of the ocean is a key metric for understanding how climate change is affecting the planet.

“Ocean heat content is in many ways the most reliable thermostat of the planet,” he says. “That’s where all the heat is going—and that’s the reason why almost every year we set a new record for ocean heat content, because there’s so much heat being absorbed by the ocean.”

The estimates of ocean heating in the paper were created using a mix of mathematical models of ocean warming as well as reams of data on ocean temperatures collected from sites around the world. Humans have been tracking ocean temperatures for a long time; Benjamin Franklin recorded sea temperatures during his transatlantic voyages. In the 1870s, the HMS Challenger expedition—which is largely credited with inventing modern oceanography—took measurements at deeper depths. But regularly measuring temperatures substantially below the surface is a relatively new phenomenon. The study’s earliest data goes back to the 1960s, when some navies began taking measurements of deeper ocean temperatures.

A key tool that revolutionized our understanding of deeper ocean temperatures is the international network of Argo floats, with more than 3,500 robotic buoys that were first deployed in the early 2000s to collect data on oceans around the world. In addition to the Argo floats, the study pulls data from a variety of other sources, including data measured from buoys, ship hulls, satellites—and animals. (“We actually put instruments on mammals that swim under ice, and so we can measure temperatures while they swim,” Abraham says. “They can take measurements where our robots can’t go.”) The study also uses algorithmic models trained on particular sets of ocean data.

“It’s really quite impressive that they get such consistent results using multiple datasets,” says Raphael Kudela, a professor of ocean science at UC Santa Cruz who was not involved in the study. Kudela says that studies like these help to hammer home just how much climate change is altering the planet.

“What people often don’t grasp is that it’s taken 100 years to get the oceans that warm at depth,” he says. “Even if we stopped using fossil fuels today, it’s going to take hundreds of years for that to circulate through the ocean. We’re going to pay this cost for a very, very long time, because we’ve already put the heat in the ocean.”

            <div id="article-text">Despite an economy that’s booming on paper, economists are warning that the middle class is being squeezed as new jobs aren’t materializing fast enough to make up for the ones we’re losing.

It’s a grim economic outlook for those who are already struggling to make ends meet. At the same time, sports betting is taking off, with experts warning of a surge in gambling addiction. And online “prediction market” platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi are taking things even further, allowing practically anybody to bet their hard-earned cash on dubious predictions, like whether the US will invade Venezuela — without any meaningful regulatory oversight to protect them from scams, insider trading, and financial ruin.

Even cable television is embracing the worrying trend. Case in point, CBS‘ 83rd Golden Globes award show showed a live ticker of Polymarket predictions for various awards during its Sunday evening broadcast of the event — actively encouraging viewers to gamble on the platform.

Some predictions turned out totally wrong, with “Sinners” taking a clear front lead on Polymarket for Best Drama, only for “Hamnet” to take the prize. Others triumphed, with the majority of users correctly betting on Paul Thomas Anderson winning Best Director for “One Battle After Another.”

Bets for the evening closed up at 7 am Sunday morning on Polymarket, which means live viewers were unable to get in on the fun. Nonetheless, onlookers were appalled at the pointed inclusion, turning the storied awards show into a glorified gambling ad. Many pointed out that the Golden Globes had already struggled with viewership in recent years, amidst a series of scandals involving corruption, racism, and even sexual assault.

In other words, encouraging crypto-based gambling was the cherry on top.

“‘The Golden Globes Best Podcast odds presented by Polymarket’ is a new low for this humiliating awards show,” tweeted Semafor senior social media editor Josh Billinson.

“The Golden Globes incorporating Polymarket betting ON SCREEN is genuinely disgusting, and we need to push back on these pocket casinos at every opportunity,” online celebrity Matt Bernstein wrote.

“We’re so deep into capitalism that the Golden Globes are showing [P]olymarket betting odds on award winners… we’re so cooked,” another user.

The Golden Globes’ owner, Penske Media Corp., announced the eyebrow-raising pairing-up between the Donald Trump Jr.-funded prediction platform and the Larry Ellison-run broadcaster last week.

“Our partnership with Polymarket unlocks a groundbreaking new frontier, redefining how audiences engage with and connect to the content they love,” said president Craig Perreault in a statement. “Deepening the connection between fans and their favorite films, shows, and actors strengthens the entertainment industry and highlights the award-winning content celebrated at the Golden Globes.”

Penske-owned publications, including Variety,Deadline, and The Hollywood Reporter, breathlessly promoted the partnership, as The Wrap reports, suggesting a troubling degree of editorial influence.

The timing of the partnership couldn’t have been worse. The news comes just days after Polymarket became embroiled in a major insider trading scandal after a mystery trader made more than $400,000 by making incredibly well-timed bets on the United States’ attacks on Venezuela — just hours before the US invaded the South American country.

In a certain sense, the Golden Globes flap is fitting; the awards show has long garnered a reputation for being pay-to-play, giving preferential treatment to those willing to line Penske’s pockets.

To many, directly encouraging users to bet on awards during an awards ceremony is not just irritating; it’s a sign of the times we live in, as gambling becomes a mainstay part of Americans’ everyday lives.

“This is like watching a car crash in real time,” one user lamented.

“Polymarket odds on the telecast of the Golden Globes,” another wrote. “Just push me in front of a bus at this point.”

Others poked fun at Penske achieving a new low.

“Heartfelt congratulations to Penske Media for achieving its highest state of being,” author Mark Harris wrote mockingly on Bluesky.

            <h2>Red Hot Christmas Toy Crashes So Badly That Kids Can’t Actually Use It</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/robots-and-machines/christmas-toy-crash-phone">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Parents were left scrambling on Christmas day after the hot toy of the season appeared to crash and burn, in a perfect cautionary tale about the era of connected gadgets that can easily brick if their delicate infrastructure is put under strain.

The toy, called the Tin Can, is basically a stripped down landline phone that places calls over WiFi. The devices are styled after colorful tin cans — like an old school tin can telephone, an archaic toy so thoroughly ancient that kids today presumably have no idea it ever existed — with twirly cords just like the landlines of yore.

The pitch is that the Tin Can allows parents to set up a sort of closed network of other Tin Can users, making it a nice compromise for kids who are too young for a cell phone, but who still want to communicate with their friends and family members. It’s free to call other Tin Can users, or parents can pay a $10 monthly subscription to make outside calls.

Yet when kids rushed to phone their friends over the holidays to schedule playdates and sledding runs, they found the string had been cut.

“Call volume on Christmas Day increased more than 100x from the start of the month, which impacted people’s abilities to set up their devices or make calls,” Tin Can’s founder Chet Kittleson told Business Insider in an interview. “Despite spending months and months preparing for it, we didn’t get it all right.”

“It worked great, the kids were using it,” Maria Pahuja, a parent from Virginia, told the publication. “Then, Christmas morning, it stopped working. Sometimes you’d pick it up, and there would be a dial tone, you would call, and nothing would happen. Once in a while, a call would go through, and then two minutes later another call wouldn’t.”

In other words, kids probably would have had a better chance of connecting with their friends with an actual tin can telephone, operated via vibrationson a string, on Christmas morn’.

By now, things seem to be back up and running, though there are still some issues with call quality popping up, BI reports. A January 8th status update on the company’s website — and, tellingly, a banner on the very top of its home page — advises parents that “we’re continuing to see very positive signs of recovery, but we’re still working through some lingering issues.” The company began in Seattle “with a handful of families and has since grown to serve families across more than 30 states,” its site says. BI reports the company has successfully raised $15.5 million since its launch in Autumn of 2024 — resources which apparently weren’t enough to prevent the toys from turning into a corded lump of coal at the exact moment they were supposed to make a great first impression.

            <div id="article-text">Cosmetic surgeons have turned to using a “fat filler” harvested from dead people in order to give patients new breasts, sexier buttocks and other body contouring tweaks, according to reporting by Business Insider — in a practice that not even “Frankenstein” author Mary Shelley could have dreamed up in her day.

The hot new product in question is called alloClae, manufactured by biomedical science business Tiger Aesthetics, and it’s become increasingly popular in plastic surgery circles despite its gruesome origins and aggressive price tag — ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 per procedure, according to BI — because it allows dramatically less healing time and doesn’t require patients being put under general anesthesia.

“People are paying for the convenience,” New York City plastic surgeon Sachin Shridharani told the site.

Historically, plastic surgeons have relied on implants or siphoning fat from another section of your body and injecting it into another part in order to perform body contouring. Using alloClae gives them a flexible new option.

Another reason why it’s become popular is that weight loss GLP-1 agonists drugs like Ozempic have made faces and bodies saggy — and that has them clamoring for specialists like Shridharani to fix their body issues.

“In their own words, ‘I’ve got no ass,&#39;” Shridharani said. “‘My trousers look like they’re falling off.&#39;”

So how does somebody’s fat end up in a plastic surgeon’s syringe?

What typically happens is that people donate their bodies to science, with organs going to donation or scientific research. Tissue banks also harvest fat calls from dead people’s abdomen’s, though, and Tiger Aesthetics buys it and processes the fat cells into alloClae.

“As of the beginning of 2026, we’ll be producing a ton more alloClae so that we can service the real demand that’s out there,” Tiger Aesthetics preident Caroline Van Hove told BI.

The practice isn’t entirely unprecedented. There’s already a product called Renuva, for instance, with the same origin but used for facial injections.

Is it weird to have your body sculpted with the fat from a dead person? Maybe, but you clearly can’t argue with results — or the horror of body issues.

            <h2>Researchers Just Discovered Something Startling About How Conservatives Pick Political Positions</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-11</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’ve been watching the intense partisan divide over the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minnesota this week, it’s likely felt as though different Americans are living in completely separate realities.

As it turns out, neuroscience might be able to explain why. In a new study whose findings will surprise absolutely no one who’s endured a fiery holiday dinner debate, researchers discovered that conservative and liberal brains don’t just arrive at fundamentally different conclusions, but take strikingly different paths to get there. It’s a fascinating piece of research which just might explain something about the yawning political divides currently tearing society apart.

The study, published in the journal PLOS One, explored why people rely on different types of evidence when explaining why things happen. Specifically, the paper’s authors at the University of Idaho sought to find why some people look for tons of high-level statistical information, while others are happy to listen to anecdotes or single authority figures to reach political conclusions.

In order to carry out the study, researchers recruited 583 adults from the US, who each took a political ideology survey as well as a test to measure their level of “cognitive reflection,” which measures the capacity to look past a knee-jerk response and engage in factual analysis.

Each participant was then given a fictional scenario about cash bail, a “pay-to-leave-jail” policy which critics say unjustly punishes the poor.

The participants were told that, out of the top 300 US cities by population, 100 had ended cash bail. They were then asked to evaluate whether the policy was “effective at reducing crime” based on 10 pieces of evidence. Each piece of information was either composed of statistical figures or testimony from political “experts” from groups like the Democratic Party, Republican Party, and the National Rifle Association, in order to measure which type of evidence each one gravitated toward.

Participants had the chance to go through as many bits of evidence as they wanted before they delivered their final analysis to the researchers — though not all took advantage of this. For example, the researchers found that the probability a participant would rely on a single data point for their conclusion rose from about 4 percent for “very liberal” people to over 37 percent for “very conservative” folks.

As the researchers concluded, those on the left “tend to be more likely to consult a comprehensive set of statistical data relative to those on the right.”

Outside of the left-right paradigm, those who scored high on the cognitive reflection test were more likely to compare and contrast all available statistical data to form their conclusions than those who scored lower.

“Importantly, our study shows that two major individual-level variables help to predict what type of ‘evidence seeker’ a given person is: whether or not they are ‘cognitively reflected’ and whether or not they are liberal/conservative,” the study’s lead author and professor of politics and philosophy at the University of Idaho Florian Justwan told PsyPost.

“Indeed, people’s political beliefs influence how they look for information (often without them realizing it),” Justwan continued.

Zooming out, the research adds to a body of work which suggests that left-leaning people have more trust in the scientific method than conservatives. While that isn’t exactly a bombshell revelation, it does paint an interesting picture of how people one both sides of the aisle come to their political conclusions.

Said another way: while the research surely won’t end the culture war bickering at Thanksgiving, it gives us a strong explanation why one person’s “obvious proof” is another person’s fake news — a fundamental rift which, if ever resolved, could completely change the political landscape.

            <h2>War Profiteers Furious After Polymarket Refuses to Pay Out on Venezuelan Invasion Bets</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly a week after US strikes bombarded Venezuela during the kidnapping of its president Nicolás Maduro, betting platform Polymarket is refusing to pay out users who gambled on the invasion of Venezeula.

Polymarket is a controversial prediction market where users can gamble on the outcome of real-world events, like who will win a certain election, or which side will control a certain village in the Ukraine-Russo war by a pre-specified date.

In this particular wager, Polymarket was supposed to pay out if “the United States commences a military offensive intended to establish control over any portion of Venezuela,” a determination to be made by “a consensus of credible sources,” the New York Times reported. To those who wagered on such an outcome, the events of January 3rd were proof positive that an invasion had taken place.

Instead, Polymarket came out with a statement arguing the opposite.

“This market refers to US military operations intended to establish control,” the note declares. “President Trump’s statement that they will ‘run’ Venezuela while referencing ongoing talks with the Venezuelan government does not alone qualify the snatch-and-extract mission to capture Maduro as an invasion.”

Those looking to cash in on the brutal attacks — which have killed at least 100 people so far — weren’t too impressed with the platform’s semantical wit.

“Pretty sure this should be yes after Trump said approximately 20 times in his press conference that the US now controls Venezuela,” groused a bettor with $1,876 wagered on a US invasion of Venezuela by March 31st. “We are going to run the country,” another user exclaimed.

“They think there will be no punishment for all this fraud. They are openly changing the rules and manipulating the market,” one user who bet $123 on the outcome complained. “A major investigation file is being prepared regarding Polymarket by the US Department of Justice. Don’t worry.”

Betting market participants relitigating results they don’t like is quickly becoming a pattern in the sector, with similar debates playing out over Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” pick and Elon Musk’s overly ambitious promises about Tesla’s self-driving taxi program.

Still, the latest incident heaps drama on Venezuela’s role in betting markets; it comes amidst some pretty compelling allegations that an insider with advanced knowledge of the US attack on Venezuela scored over $400,000 betting similar lines. (The alleged insider’s bets won all their bets.)

In this case however, every bettor who thought they were crowdsourcing the truth instead got a time honored lesson: no matter what you’re betting over, the house always wins.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hundreds of earthquakes have been detected rattling Antarctica’s Thwaites Glacier, also known as the Doomsday Glacier — the disintegration of which could send between two and 10 feet of devastating flooding to coastal communities worldwide.

This stunning finding, published in a new study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, suggests that this gigantic behemoth of ice, which is almost as big as the island of Great Britain, is even more fragile than experts feared — and that world governments’ efforts to stop global warming haven’t been nearly enough.

To keep an eye on its imminent collapse, Australian National University seismologist Thanh-Son Phạm suggests in the paper that a dedicated seismic network be located and maintained on the icy continent to “monitor glacial dynamics, which may evolve abruptly in the coming decades or even years.”

The risk is high; Phạm detected a total of 362 previously unrecognized seismic events between 2010 and 2023, and they mostly occurred in the West Antarctic region, the home of the Thwaites Glacier and Pine Island Glacier, another big block of ice that’s become visibly smaller over the years due to climate change.

Glacier earthquakes are detected at around magnitude 5 on the Richter scale, and are often associated with iceberg calving in warmer months of the Arctic Circle such as the ones in Greenland. By contrast, the dynamics that drive Antarctic earthquakes are little understood because there is simply isn’t much data on them and they tend to register at a lower magnitude.

To rectify that situation, Phạm developed an algorithm to pick up wave patterns collected by seismic monitors on Antarctica. From this data, he determined that 245 of the 362 earthquakes recorded came from Thwaites Glacier, where he believes they were caused by icebergs calving off into the ocean.

Scientists are deeply concerned about the Thwaites Glacier collapse not only because of the immense amount of water it could displace, but because it acts like an icy plug on the West Antarctic ice shelf that keeps all that ice from sliding into the ocean.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s official. Apple has chosen to work with Google, a longtime partner, to power AI features like Siri.

“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” Apple and Google said in a statement.

The partnership confirms previous reporting on a deal with Google. Neither Apple nor Google have confirmed the price tag, but previous reports indicate Apple could be paying Google around$1 billion for access to its AI technology. The deal also comes after Apple spent some time testing the technology of competitorslike OpenAI and Anthropic.

The multi-year partnership will involve Apple using Google’s Gemini models and cloud technology for future Apple foundational models. The deal is not exclusive, per a source familiar with the matter. Apple has historically focused on vertical integration, relying on its own hardware and software.

The iPhone-maker has faced a fair amount of public chatter criticizing it after its AI efforts, particularly its assistant Siri, lagged behind competitors. That’s not to say Apple hasn’t been quietly building powerful foundational models. The company released the first versions of Apple Intelligence in 2024, which adds AI to existing OS functions like searching for photos and summarizing notifications. Apple has also focused on privacy with its AI rollout, with much of the processing happening on-device or through tightly controlled infrastructure. Apple says it will maintain those privacy standards throughout its partnership with Google.

The firm’s strategy has resulted in a subtle, sometimes invisible, occasionally resented form of AI – one that doesn’t have the same wow factor as ChatGPT or Gemini. It also stops short of delivering the kind of Siri overhaul many users have been waiting for.

Apple has delayed the rollout of its “more personalized Siri” voice assistant several times, but a spokesperson told TechCrunch an upgrade is coming this year. Previous reports indicate the overhauled Siri is expected to launch in the spring.

Apple’s partnership with Google also comes as the search and adtech giant is in the midst of multiple antitrust lawsuits, including one that put its relationship with Apple front and center. In August 2024, a federal judge ruled that Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search by paying companies like Apple to present its search engine as the default on its devices and web browsers. Between 2021 and 2022, Google paid Apple about $38 billion to secure default search placements.

In December 2025, Judge Amit Mehta issued his final remedies on the case, which include banning Google from entering into exclusive, default agreements like the one it had with Apple “unless the agreement terminates no more than one year after the date it is entered.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As two major streaming platforms—Warner Bros. and Netflix—prepare for a merger, concerns continue to be voiced about the implications of the deal, which represents more consolidation in the media business.

On Monday, Paramount CEO David Ellison announced that the company has filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) in Delaware, demanding greater financial disclosure regarding Netflix’s $82.7 billion acquisition.

In a letter to shareholders, Ellison disclosed that the lawsuit has been filed in the Delaware Chancery Court, requesting that WBD provide essential information that it allegedly has failed to share. Ellison argues that shareholders need accurate information to assess whether to accept Paramount’s competing offer of $30 per share in cash, which he claims is superior to Netflix’s deal.

Ellison wrote, “WBD has provided increasingly novel reasons for avoiding a transaction with Paramount, but what it has never said, because it cannot, is that the Netflix transaction is financially superior to our actual offer.”

“Along with the WBD shareholders, we have asked for the customary financial disclosure a board is supposed to provide shareholders when making an investment recommendation…WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its ‘risk adjustment’ of our $30 per share all-cash offer. WBD shareholders need this information to make an informed investment decision on our offer,” Ellison added.

Last week, WBD’s board rejected Paramount’s latest bid once again, saying there’s too much risk of the deal falling through.

President Trump also expressed his dissatisfaction with the merger. Over the weekend, Trump shared on Truth Social an opinion piece by John Pierce titled “Stop the Netflix Cultural Takeover,” published in One America News last month. Pierce believes if Netflix acquires Warner Bros.’ streaming and studio assets, it would establish itself as “the most dominant cultural gatekeeper the United States—and much of the world—has ever seen.”

After meeting with Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos in December, Trump indicated that the merger “could be a problem,” due to Netflix’s already significant market share, which would expand greatly with the acquisition.

The industry has also generally reacted negatively to the acquisition, raising concerns about job implications, the future of theatrical releases, and the representation of diverse voices in film and TV.

Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Sarandos attempted to address these fears in a letter last month. However, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) continues to oppose the acquisition, citing antitrust law violations. Lawmakers, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal, warn that the merger could lead to increased consumer costs, exacerbating financial pressures on middle-class families, especially following Netflix’s recent price hike.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For more than two years, an app called ClothOff has been terrorizing young women online — and it’s been maddeningly difficult to stop. The app has been taken down from the two major app stores and it’s banned from most social platforms, but it’s still available on the web and through a Telegram bot. In October, a clinic at Yale Law School filed a lawsuit that would take down the app entirely, forcing the owners to delete all images and cease operation entirely. But simply finding the defendants has been a challenge.

“It’s incorporated in the British Virgin Islands,” explains Professor John Langford, a co-lead counsel in the lawsuit, “but we believe it’s run by a brother and sister and Belarus. It may even be part of a larger network around the world.”

It’s a bitter lesson in the wake of the recent flood of non-consensual pornography generated by Elon Musk’s xAI, which included many underage victims. Child sexual abuse material is the most legally toxic content on the internet — illegal to produce, transmit or store, and regularly scanned for on every major cloud service. But despite the intense legal prohibitions, there are still few ways to deal with image generators like ClothOff, as Langford’s case demonstrates. Individual users can be prosecuted, but platforms like ClothOff and Grok are far more difficult to police, leaving few options for victims hoping to find justice in court.

The clinic’s complaint, which is available online, paints an alarming picture. The plaintiff is an anonymous high school student in New Jersey, whose classmates used ClothOff to alter her Instagram photos. She was 14 years old when the original Instagram photos were taken, which means the AI-modified versions are legally classified as child abuse imagery. But even though the modified images are straightforwardly illegal, local authorities declined to prosecute the case, citing the difficulty of obtaining evidence from suspects’ devices.

“Neither the school nor law enforcement ever established how broadly the CSAM of Jane Doe and other girls was distributed,” the complaint reads.

Still, the court case has moved slowly. The complaint was filed in October, and in the months since, Langford and his colleagues have been in the process of serving notice to the defendants — a difficult task given the global nature of the enterprise. Once they’ve been served, the clinic can push for a court appearance and, eventually, a judgment, but in the meantime the legal system has given little comfort to ClothOff’s victims.

The Grok case might seem like a simpler problem to fix. Elon Musk’s xAI isn’t hiding, and there’s plenty of money at the end for lawyers who can win a claim. But Grok is a general purpose tool, which makes it much harder to hold it accountable in court.

“ClothOff is designed and marketed specifically as a deepfake pornography image and video generator,” Langford told me. “When you’re suing a general system that users can query for all sorts of things, it gets a lot more complicated.”

A number of US laws have already banned deepfake pornography — most notably the Take It Down Act. But while specific users are clearly breaking those laws, it’s much harder to hold the entire platform accountable. Existing laws require clear evidence of an intent to harm, which would mean providing evidence xAI knew their tool would be used to produce non-consensual pornography. Without that evidence, xAI’s basic first amendment rights would provide significant legal protection..

“In terms of the First Amendment, it’s quite clear Child Sexual Abuse material is not protected expression,” Langford says. “So when you’re designing a system to create that kind of content, you’re clearly operating outside of what’s protected by the First Amendment. But when you’re a general system that users can query for all sorts of things, it’s not so clear.”

The easiest way to surmount those problems would be to show that xAI had willfully ignored the problem. It’s a real possibility, given recent reporting that Musk directed employees to loosen Grok’s safeguards. But even then, it would be a far riskier case to take on.

“Reasonable people can say, we knew this was a problem years ago,” Langford says. “How can you not have had more stringent controls in place to make sure this doesn’t happen? That is a kind of recklessness or knowledge but it’s just a more complicated case.”

Those First Amendment issues are why xAI’s biggest pushback has come from court systems without robust legal protections for free speech. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have taken steps to block access to the Grok chatbot, while regulators in the United Kingdom have opened an investigation that could lead to a similar ban. Other preliminary steps have been taken by the European Commission, France, Ireland, India and Brazil. In contrast, no US regulatory agency has issued an official response.

It’s impossible to say how the investigations will resolve, but at the very least, the flood of imagery raises lots of questions for regulators to investigate — and the answers could be damning.

“If you are posting, distributing, disseminating Child Sexual Abuse material, you are violating criminal prohibitions and can be held accountable,” Langford says. “The hard question is, what did X know? What did X do or not do? What are they doing now in response to it?“

            <div id="article-text">The 83rd Golden Globes was a standout evening for streaming platforms. Netflix led the pack with seven wins, while Apple TV and HBO Max each secured three awards, and Hulu took home one.​

Among Netflix’s highlights, the hit series “Adolescence” claimed four awards, including best limited series. The show also earned awards for best actor (Stephen Graham), supporting actor (Owen Cooper), and supporting actress (Erin Doherty) in a miniseries. Netflix’s most-watched title, “KPop Demon Hunters,” won best animated feature and best original song.​

Netflix’s Golden Globes sweep comes just as the company prepares for the biggest moves in Hollywood: the acquisition of Warner Bros.

​As for the other streamers, Apple TV earned two awards for “The Studio,” one for best television series (musical or comedy) and another for best actor in a TV series, awarded to Seth Rogen. Rhea Seehorn also secured the best lead actress in a television drama for her performance in “Pluribus.”

HBO found success with its medical drama “The Pitt,” which picked up two Golden Globes, including one for actor Noah Wylie. HBO’s third award was for best female actor in a TV series – musical or comedy (Jean Smart, “Hacks”).

​Hulu’s lone win came from Michelle Williams, who earned best lead actress for “Dying for Sex.” However, titles like “Only Murders in the Building,” “The Bear,” “Paradise,” and “Chad Powers” didn’t convert their nominations into wins.​

Meanwhile, Disney+ received 15 nominations — including for “Andor” and “Elio” — but did not secure any wins this year.​

The Golden Globes also notably introduced a best podcast category, which Amy Poehler won for “Good Hang with Amy Poehler.” Other nominees included Alex Cooper’s “Call Her Daddy” and “Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/12/luminar-lines-up-22-million-bidder-for-its-lidar-business/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Luminar has reached a deal to sell its lidar business to a company called Quantum Computing Inc. for just $22 million, unless it receives better offers by a deadline of 5:00 p.m. CT on Monday.

The lidar-maker, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December, already announced plans to sell its semiconductor subsidiary to Quantum Computing Inc. for $110 million. The deals have to be approved by the bankruptcy judge in the Southern District of Texas before they are finalized.

Luminar founder and former CEO Austin Russell has signaled interest in submitting a bid for the lidar assets and tried to buy the whole company in October, before it filed for bankruptcy. The company is currently trying to serve him with a subpoena for information stored on his cell phone, as Luminar evaluates whether it wants to make any legal claims against him related to the board-run ethics inquiry that led to his resignation last May. It’s not known how many other bids Luminar might receive by Monday’s deadline.

Quantum Computing Inc. has been designated as a “stalking horse bidder,” which helps establish a baseline for the value of the assets and helps prevent low-ball bids. Luminar has said it wants to move through the bankruptcy case quickly, as its largest creditors — mostly financial institutions that loaned the company money over the last few years — are helping fund the proceedings.

Even if Luminar receives a higher offer, the stalking horse bid represents a monumental fall from the company’s peak market cap in 2021, when it was worth around $11 billion. That valuation was propped up by the promise that Luminar’s lidar sensors were going to become widely adopted by major automakers like Volvo, which at one point planned to buy more than 1 million of them before ultimately walking away from the deal in 2025. Other deals with Mercedes-Benz and Polestar fell apart along the way, too.

Quantum Computing Inc. was founded in 2001 as a company called Ticketcart that sold ink-jet cartridges, according to its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It bought a beverage company in 2007, went through its own restructuring process 10 years later, and pivoted to making optic technology for the budding world of quantum computing. The company raised more than $700 million by selling shares in 2025, though its revenue for the first nine months of last year was just $384,000.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta announced on Monday that it has appointed former Trump advisor Dina Powell McCormick as president and vice chairman of the company. Meta said Powell McCormick will be a member of the company’s management team and will help guide Meta’s overall strategy and execution.

“Dina’s experience at the highest levels of global finance, combined with her deep relationships around the world, makes her uniquely suited to help Meta manage this next phase of growth as the company’s President and Vice Chairman,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the blog post.

Powell McCormick served as deputy national security advisor to President Donald Trump.

Trump celebrated the news on Truth Social in a post reading: “Congratulations to DINA POWELL MCCORMICK, WHO HAS JUST BEEN NAMED THE NEW PRESIDENT OF META. A great choice by Mark Z!!! She is a fantastic, and very talented, person, who served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.”

Powell McCormick previously served under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during the George W. Bush administration. She also spent 16 years at Goldman Sachs as a partner in senior leadership roles.

Last week, Meta hired Curtis Joseph Mahoney, a former Microsoft legal executive who also served as a deputy U.S. trade representative during Trump’s first term.

            <h2>The Court Case That Is Allowing ICE to Stop Just About Anyone It Wants</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/scotus-case-ice-arrests-permission-whren/685587/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For 30 years, law-enforcement officers have been empowered to be “clever”—and that cleverness has today become the cover for abusive actions by ICE.

In 1996, the Supreme Court decided Whren v. United States, which came about when plainclothes vice officers patrolling in the District of Columbia passed a truck in a “high drug” area and “their suspicions were aroused.” They had a hunch that the truck was involved in a drug operation. They chose to wait until it had violated a traffic ordinance (turning without a signal) and then used that violation as an excuse to stop the truck. In the course of searching the truck, they found crack cocaine.

The Supreme Court said that the temporary detention of a motorist “upon probable cause to believe that he has violated the traffic laws” did not violate the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable seizures, even if the officer would not have stopped the motorist absent some additional law-enforcement purpose. The Court developed a rule of objective intent. Under this theory, if the officers had a valid reason for acting—an objectively reasonable intention, in the Court’s terminology—then their true motive and subjective intent was of no constitutional consequence. A pretextual traffic stop to search for drugs was just fine with the Court.

Adam Serwer: Conservatives want the antebellum Constitution back

That decision, though couched as an application of the Fourth Amendment’s “reasonableness” standard, was grounded on two premises that were plausible at the time. First, that the discretionary authority granted to the police would be used against genuine criminals such as drug dealers. Second, that the occasional misuses of that discretion would be few, far between, and manageable by the court system through robust testing and oversight. Any harm that could possibly occur was outweighed by the good that would be achieved.

Whren has long plagued minority communities, leading to countless incidents of racial profiling. The current use of Whren in the immigration context takes these abuses further yet, singling out people not on suspicion of criminal behavior but for noncriminal immigration enforcement. Both of the premises in Whren, if they ever were accurate, are now manifestly false. Officer discretion is not being deployed solely against possibly malevolent actors, and the misuse of that discretion is causing more harm than good, not only to those illegally present, but also to those here legally, including U.S. citizens.

The confluence of Whren and ICE is easily captured anecdotally. In Washington, D.C., for example, the U.S. Park Police (a federal police agency) is responsible for enforcing traffic laws on Rock Creek Parkway, a piece of federal land. Since the ICE crackdown began, the park police have begun pulling over commercial trucks for technical violations—say, obscured license plates or driving on the noncommercial parkway—and then allowing ICE to arrest those suspected of immigration violations. To the same effect in D.C., delivery drivers are at risk of being stopped for traffic violations and then being sucked into the immigration-enforcement machine. It’s not just D.C.; the crackdown is nationwide. ICE detentions start with minor traffic violations in Phoenix. In Florida, they begin at truck inspection checkpoints. Or, in Montana, with a broken taillight. Unsurprisingly, the traffic crackdown is not race-neutral. In South Florida, for example, ICE is targeting specific types of work trucks typically driven by people of color.

Even 30 years ago, the Court’s view rested on shaky empirical foundations. It adopted the rule of objective intent despite understanding that, at least sometimes, the subjective intent of the officer might be invidious. The Court recognized that instead of targeting suspicious vehicles in a high-crime area, an officer might have been the sort who targeted a car filled with Black Americans simply because of their skin color. But the Court had a general view that the police were typically trustworthy and honest, and it wrote a rule based on that assumption.

This rule was attractive to the Court because subjective intent is much more difficult to assess than objective factors. It is hard to know what someone else is really thinking, even if you know them quite well. Many judges know that they are particularly ill-suited to assess spur-of-the-moment motivation when sitting in the quiet of their chambers. Worse yet, adopting a rule that asks an officer to explain his motivation is just a formula to solicit perjury—a rule that relies on subjective intent would give any officer an incentive to shade the truth and embellish on his thought process.

But the incentives for officers to shade the truth are really no different under either the objective standard or the subjective one. Just as a law-enforcement officer may sometimes gild the lily in describing his thought process, he may also do so in describing the objective facts that he has observed. I had one case, many years ago, in which my client was suspected of engaging in a drug transaction. The police broadcast a lookout for his car, and he was pulled over for a traffic violation. His offense? Allegedly driving faster than 15 miles per hour in a mall parking lot. But given the configuration of the lot and the presence of other parked cars, the officer’s contention that the car was speeding was dubious at best. Still, he had offered an objectively valid ground for the stop, and my client was duly convicted based on the drugs found in his car.

Whren’s logic has always been a formula for abuse, but that abuse has come especially to the fore today, when acted on by ICE agents who, far from investigating federal crimes, are deploying their authority in the service of noncriminal immigration enforcement to satisfy Trump’s deportation quota. Without any actual knowledge that a crime may have been committed, ICE officers can convert an everyday occurrence that almost every person in America does routinely (rolling through a stop sign, say) into the pretext for arrest that can lead to banishment.

Listen: Federal agents are violating the rights of Americans

Whren’s most fundamental error was the Court’s implicit assumption that malicious intent by law-enforcement officers was a rare subset of justified traffic stops. Back then, the Court might plausibly have given law enforcement the benefit of the doubt. Today, the current conduct of federal law enforcement—and most particularly ICE investigations where criminal activity is not generally at issue—seems to be different both in degree and in kind from what the law might reasonably have anticipated decades ago.

It is, no doubt, too much to hope that the Court, as currently constituted, will revisit this unwise decision. But if there ever comes a time when reconsideration is possible, Whren should be scrapped, and a rule of subjective intent should be adopted that is more aligned with what we now know about the possibility of authoritarian abuse. ICE’s conduct, if it has taught us anything, has taught us not to blindly trust the good intentions of law enforcement.</div>

            <h2>Banana Republicanism</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-desperate-powell-investigation/685583/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration has opened a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on grounds so flimsy and transparently hypocritical that it is difficult to know whether anybody is supposed to take the charges at face value. When a respected public servant is being accused of wasting taxpayer dollars and lying to Congress by a president whose extravagant White House renovation has already doubled in cost in just three months, and whose inexhaustible capacity for lies has essentially broken every fact-checking medium, one almost wonders if the criminal allegation was chosen for its absurdity, to demonstrate that Donald Trump can make the law mean whatever he wants it to.

Trump’s gambit is more likely to fail than it is to succeed. Powell’s term ends in four months, a timeline so brief that it wouldn’t be hastened by even a well-founded criminal charge, which this is not. In theory, harassing Powell with trumped-up charges could intimidate him into backing down, but the Fed chair responded with a defiant statement. Republican Senator Thom Tillis vowed not to support any new nominees to the Federal Reserve board “until this legal matter is fully resolved.” And even if Trump were to manage to install sufficiently pliant figureheads at the agency, the Fed’s demonstrable lack of independence would be apt to weaken its influence over monetary policy and make the economy worse, not better.

What’s more, Trump is gambling that his control over the Republican Party is so unshakable that he can extend his banana republicanism to a policy domain that matters deeply to his wealthy partisan allies. Those conservative economic elites who don’t actively cheer on Trump’s authoritarianism and corruption have learned to live with both, because he delivers the goods in the policy realms that matter to them: tax cuts, deregulation, and other conservative economic priorities.

Every affluent Republican, from the tech right to fossil-fuel owners to heirs managing their inherited portfolios, has a direct and visible interest in stable and competent monetary policy. The Republican Party’s respect for the Fed’s independence is already evident in a recent Supreme Court ruling, in which the conservative majority appears to be seeking to create a special exemption for the Federal Reserve from the Court’s general doctrine that presidents are entitled to fire the heads of independent agencies. When Trump messes with the Fed, he is defecating where his wealthy donors eat. Perhaps they will go along with this, too, but he is testing the limits of their acquiescence.

Rogé Karma: Trump is getting closer to having an ‘infinite money pit’

The apparent source of this desperate gamble is that Trump seems keenly aware that the public disapproves of his presidency and his economic policy making. But rather than move to the center and try to allay the concerns of his wavering supporters, Trump’s response to adversity has been to try to seize as much economic and political power as he can, as fast as possible.

Thus the invasion of Venezuela, which he hopes will provide him with a windfall source of petro-dollars. (Sunday night, Trump shared on Truth Social a mock biography describing himself as “Acting President of Venezuela.”) After floating a proposal to cap credit-card interest rates that stands little chance of passage in Congress, he told reporters on Air Force One that firms that fail to comply with his target by January 20—before any law capping interest rates can conceivably make it through the House and Senate—will be “in violation of the law.”

In normal times, private companies could simply laugh off a president’s threat that they have “violated” a law that does not exist. But since Trump has amply demonstrated his eagerness to redefine the law as synonymous with his own whims, his threats may well contain real power.

Trump’s clumsy legal intimidation of Powell mirrors tactics used by regimes such as those of Argentina, Russia, Turkey, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. This is not a list of the most prosperous economies in the modern world. What these states have in common (with the exception of Argentina, which has rebuilt its economic and political systems from the setbacks they suffered under disastrous Trump-style experiments) is an entrenched elite that hoards wealth and control.

Caitlin B. Tully: The Court has an easy answer on the Fed

The administration is fond of accusing immigrant communities of importing dysfunctional political cultures from the developing world. “If these societies all over the world continue to fail, you have to ask yourself, if you bring those societies into our country and then give them unlimited free welfare, what do we think is going to happen? You’re gonna replicate the conditions that they left,” Stephen Miller recently told Fox News.

The global South may be cursed with more than its share of regimes in which economic success depends on political access and the rule of law is a bitter joke. However, it is not the desperate refugees fleeing poverty and oppression who are importing their political culture, but Trump himself.</div>

            <h2>What <em>Black Swan</em> Knew About Leaning In</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/black-swan-women-workplace-movie/685564/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Darren Aronofsky’s 2010 film, Black Swan, fit into a lot of boxes. It was a psychological thriller, a body-horror flick, a character study, a coming-of-age saga. It was a cautionary tale about ballet culture, helicopter parenting, and perfectionism. Rewatching it roughly 15 years after its release, though, I’ve come to see it as something else: a workplace drama, about an ambitious woman navigating a hypercompetitive environment, contorting herself to please the mercurial boss who holds her fate in his hands.

The ballet world is, of course, unique—a field that requires uncommon athletic and artistic mastery, as well as more commitment and sacrifice than most 9-to-5 jobs. The path to success for a dancer doesn’t necessarily look the same as that of a corporate employee. Yet Black Swan’s central character, Nina Sayers, played by Natalie Portman, struggles in ways that feel broadly relatable.

Like many young strivers, Nina has wound up with her identity entirely entangled in her job. When she lands her dream role in Swan Lake, playing both the innocent White Swan loved by a prince and the seductive Black Swan who attempts to steal him away, she throws herself into her work. But recognition always seems out of reach. The company’s director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), keeps telling Nina she’s too “frigid” and sexless to play the Black Swan. The other dancers covet her part and make her feel unworthy of it. (In any industry, sparse opportunities can lead to hungry, cutthroat workers.) Nina has no mentor to look up to; Beth, the former prima ballerina played by Winona Ryder, has been ruthlessly excised from the company for being too old. The film implies that Beth is still as capable as ever of performing beautifully; the company simply wants a “fresh face,” as Thomas puts it, to draw audiences. Here as in so many workplaces, employees are expendable, valued not for their personhood but for their present contribution to the bottom line.

On top of all that, Thomas keeps coming on to Nina, arguing that she needs to loosen up to get in touch with her inner Black Swan. He asks if she’s a virgin, tells her to masturbate (homework), and kisses her (more than once). This of course puts her in an impossible position: If she protests, she’ll be proving his point that she’s too uptight; if she relents, she’ll be proving right the other dancers’ suspicion that she exploited his attraction to get the part. Thomas’s fiefdom seems similar to that of many real-life dance companies in that power is concentrated in a man with few checks on his behavior. His harassment evokes some of the abuse accusations that have rocked the ballet world—but also the kind of #MeToo stories that have emerged in numerous fields. And as Nina struggles to focus, Thomas keeps telling her, cruelly: “The only person standing in your way is you.”

That idea—and the disturbing question of whether it’s true—is one that I imagine haunts many working women. Around the time Black Swan came out, high-powered female executives were making headlines, and Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Women could see that incredible professional success was possible—but this didn’t mean they were in a position to achieve it. In 2013, Sheryl Sandberg, then the chief operating officer of Meta, delivered a diagnosis in her best-selling book Lean In: Women tend to deny themselves career success, she argued, because they internalize the idea that they should be meek and deferential, and thus take “their foot off the gas,” as she put it in one TED Talk. Instead, she asserted, they need to be bold: speak up in meetings; ask for that raise. Sandberg’s philosophy, I realized, is rather Thomas-esque. In one scene, seemingly testing Nina, he tells her that she won’t be getting the main role in Swan Lake—then berates her for accepting his decision rather than fighting him on it. “You could be brilliant,” he tells her later. “But you’re a coward.”

Though Lean In was a hit—people like to feel that they have agency—it also stirred immediate controversy for its insistence that women could change their circumstances through sheer force of will. Sandberg eventually gave more credence to the structural causes of professional inequity and acknowledged that she hadn’t truly understood the plight of, say, working single moms. But three years before her book was published, Black Swan had already captured one of the problems with holding yourself entirely responsible for your own success: It can turn you against yourself. In a sense, Thomas’s warning that Nina is getting in her own way is a self-fulfilling prophecy. She becomes her own worst enemy.

Aronofsky has said that he based Black Swan on Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s short 1846 novel The Double, about a struggling low-level civil servant who finds that a man has joined his office who looks exactly like him—but who is far more charming and well liked by their colleagues. They become nemeses, naturally. (The Double was also made into its own movie, starring Jesse Eisenberg, in 2013.) In Black Swan, Nina is surrounded by creepy mirror images. Sometimes, her reflection, in the studio’s great glass wall, stops mimicking her actions. Sometimes she hallucinates that people walking down the street or dancing across from her have her face. Primarily, though, Nina’s double—the far more charming, better-liked version of her—is a dancer named Lily (Mila Kunis), a clear Black Swan to Nina’s White one. When Nina despises Lily, she is despising herself. Eventually Nina grows paranoid, losing her grip on what’s real and what’s not. Her breakdown is far more dramatic than what most people will ever experience, but it illustrates the way in which endless, lonely toil can alienate a person from herself. It’s the extreme but logical conclusion of adopting a bootstrap mentality under conditions that don’t actually allow you to pull yourself up.

The path for ambitious women today may be even more obscure than it was upon Black Swan’s release. Politicians, academics, pundits, and influencers are challenging not only the idea that women should be CEOs but also that they should be in the workforce at all (or able to vote). McKinsey’s annual Women in the Workplace study of corporate America—co-conducted by Sandberg’s LeanIn.org and published last month—found that “women are as dedicated to their careers as men” but that they tend to receive less mentorship at work and, in senior positions, remain outnumbered by men. Some companies, according to McKinsey’s report, had recently cut programs designed to support women; many had curtailed remote- or flexible-work options, which are generally a boon to moms trying to keep their jobs. For the first time since McKinsey began conducting its study, female participants reported less desire for promotion than male participants did.

Yet when men and women receive similar amounts of support from senior colleagues, the report found, any ambition gap between the sexes disappears. Women, this suggests, care plenty about what they do and whether they’re seen. Only when they feel undervalued or have little hope of advancement are they more likely to pull back.

Something that struck me when I rewatched Black Swan was all the little reminders that Nina once really loved ballet, before the job wore her down. And I wondered: What if she’d had a less predatory director in a less punishing environment? What if she’d had someone to help her tap into that love without losing her mind? One of the saddest parts of Black Swan is seeing Nina’s passion for dance draining out of her. Thomas keeps telling her to feel the music, to not just to go through the motions. By the time he’s got his grip on her, it’s too late.

She can hold up four fingers: she understands that next month she’ll be 4. Already she remembers scenes, so many— her mother walking in through the front door with her wrapped-up baby brother; that time the big dog gobbled up her toast before she could take a single bite; that day a bad man pushed her so hard on the swing she spun out, landing face down in the dust. Also, sometimes, some first happy thing she barely senses anymore— a soapy bath toy, warm in her baby hands?

All of that has made her who she is right now, a girl with pictures in her head from a place he called the South, her grandfather whose house she plays outside where there’s a falling whiteness that her mouth takes in as ice cream: of all her memories, this is the first one she will claim even into old age. How could she know that everything that’s happened until now would melt away in time, except the snow?

            <h2>Trump’s Shrinking Coalition</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tulsi Gabbard, a combat veteran who detests military intervention, joined the MAGA coalition full of hope that Donald Trump shared her beliefs. Gabbard especially despises—or at least despised—the notion of meddling in Venezuela, a once far-fetched idea that she had denounced many, many times.

But it turns out that President Trump’s foreign-policy doctrine is not actually isolationist. Although he doesn’t care about defending allies or toppling dictatorships to spread democracy, he’s perfectly happy to intervene overseas to steal resources or simply to show other countries who’s boss.

Gabbard has had to swallow her principles, first when Trump bombed Iran, and then when he did the very thing she had accused the neocons of plotting: invading Venezuela to take its oil. As director of national intelligence, she is stuck issuing rote endorsements of the administration’s position. “Kudos to our servicemen and women and intelligence operators for their flawless execution of President Trump’s order to deliver on his promise thru Operation Absolute Resolve,” she wrote on X on Tuesday. Poor Tulsi Gabbard never thought the leopards would eat Nicolás Maduro’s face.

There’s good reason for Gabbard to toe the party line—resigning would do nothing to advance either her policy agenda or her employment prospects. But millions of people who voted for Trump for reasons similar to Gabbard’s, but didn’t bet their whole career on supporting him, have no such dilemma. They can simply drift away from his coalition. By all accounts, this is exactly what’s happening. Trump is bleeding support, notably among his newfound constituencies: young people, minorities, and populists who distrust the system.

Trump has expressed bewilderment that his approval ratings could be so low given the breadth of change he has enacted. “I wish you could explain to me what the hell is going on with the mind of the public,” he complained at a recent gathering of House Republicans. “We’ve had the most successful first year of any president in history, and it should be a positive.”

In the president’s mind, he is living his best, Trumpiest life, and the public ought to be rewarding him for it. What he seems not to grasp is that he is losing support in no small part because he is accomplishing so many of his goals.

Winning national elections requires building big coalitions, including with groups that disagree with one another. Trump has a rare and underestimated talent for finessing these internal fissures. His rhetorical style is rambling, dishonest, and inconsistent, which makes it hard to pin him down on specific commitments. As a result, voters often see in him what they want to see.

During the campaign, Trump generally linked immigration with crime, leading many voters to believe that his plan was to focus on deporting criminals. This enabled him to make huge gains in Latino communities, which often bore the burden of accommodating the migrant surge during the Biden administration. Many of those voters have been surprised to learn that Trump’s immigration policy is actually inspired by the belief that the entire immigration pattern of the past half century was a catastrophic, civilization-threatening error, and that Trump intends to roll it back by unleashing a massive enforcement army that detains people who simply look like undocumented immigrants, with scant attention to due process.

Likewise, Trump performed well with low-income voters, many of whom expected or hoped that as president he would spare the social benefits they rely on. Indeed, Trump did not run on any promise to cut Medicaid or food stamps, and he discussed health care only rarely and in vague terms. But he has carried out the largest upward redistribution of wealth in American history, and he is taking health insurance from millions of Americans.

Those reversals might have been predictable to people who had been paying close attention to policy. What has been more surprising is Trump’s alienation of voters who are sometimes described as being “anti-system”—people who distrust authority and often gravitate toward conspiracy theories. Those voters are disproportionately young and male, and they get their news from mostly untraditional sources, such as Joe Rogan and Nick Fuentes. Their embrace of Trump had appeared to signal a durable expansion of the Republican coalition.

Trump, however, has squandered their trust. These anti-establishment voters wanted the Epstein files released, and they believed the promises of FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi that they would be. Trump has instead engaged in a clumsy cover-up, insisting that the files are both a fantastical hoax devised by his enemies and also too boring to even merit discussion.

The president also purported to champion free speech. Trump is no civil libertarian, yet he managed to present a contrast to a scolding moralism that had spread through much of American culture, especially schools and Hollywood. His willingness to offend the sensibilities of liberal elites gave him a sort of outlaw appeal.

In office, though, Trump has relentlessly cracked down on the speech that he opposes, hunting down students who criticized Israel and targeting anyone who failed to discuss Charlie Kirk’s death in sufficiently reverent terms. Voters have noticed this hypocrisy, and polling has shown that a majority believed that Trump had restricted free speech.

Trump’s embrace of a neo-imperialist foreign policy is likely to further alienate those anti-system voters. People like Gabbard, who served in Iraq and Kuwait, saw overseas conflicts as costly distractions from domestic problems, and viewed American military power with deep cynicism. Trump’s moves to bomb Iran, invade Venezuela, and threaten Greenland—his policy of speaking very loudly and carrying a big stick—make it hard to convince his supporters that he’s focusing on domestic concerns.

A through line connects these apparent reversals. Trump is alienating anti-system voters because he now controls the system. His appeal lay in his opposition to established power, but now that he has it, he is flexing it gleefully. He is the warmonger, the censor, the face of the Epstein cover-up.

It is hard to remain an outsider while holding the world’s most powerful job. But Trump seems not to have anticipated this, in part because he had far less trouble maintaining his anti-establishment identity in his first term. He managed this because that term consisted mainly of failures. Some of these failures were traditional legislative setbacks, such as the defeat of his bid to repeal Obamacare and his inability to pass the infrastructure bill that he had promised. But Trump also suffered an unusual inability to direct his own executive branch. He publicly entertained a stream of wild-sounding ideas, such as firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller and taking foreign oil, that he could not see through. His presidency ended in humiliation when he could not persuade Mike Pence to reject the election results.

Read: Donald Trump is a lamer duck than ever

These setbacks not only spared the country the full brunt of Trumpism; they also positioned Trump as a kind of outsider within his own presidency. Trump’s bond with anti-system voters remained intact because he was constantly expressing his anger that the system was working to undermine him. He fought the law and the law won.

Trump is no longer making this complaint about the established forces working against him, because he has solved this problem. His presidency is filled with loyalists. He has largely overcome any reluctance that officials might have had in carrying out his most unethical or illegal demands. He can’t present himself as anti-system, because he has become the system.

Trump relishes this power and glories in making it as visible as possible. He has duly torn down a section of the White House, staged an Army parade on his birthday, put his name on the Kennedy Center, and so on. It is as if he wakes up every morning with a new plan for getting across the idea I’m in charge now.

Trump seems to assume that voters share his own worship of power. His most intense fans may revel in his displays of dominance, but his least attached supporters—the ones who turned him from a loser in 2020 to a winner in 2024—are recoiling.</div>

            <h2>The Golden Globes Tried to Have It Both Ways</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/golden-globes-2026-winners-hamnet-one-battle-after-another/685582/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">During Sunday night’s Golden Globes, the host Nikki Glaser expertly ribbed the nominees in her opening monologue. Beaming presenters read their lines off teleprompters. Some winners cried as they thanked their loved ones. The ceremony ran long.

This was business as usual, in other words. Though the Globes have developed a reputation for being a boozy affair, those inside the ballroom seemed determined to generate a polite atmosphere. Hollywood is undergoing plenty of turbulence—a month ago, Netflix struck a deal to purchase Warner Bros., and a month from now, the actors’ union SAG-AFTRA will enter into a fresh round of contract talks that could lead to another strike—but Glaser delivered only light jokes about the industry’s precarity. A few attendees wore tiny pins that read “Be Good” in honor of Renee Nicole Good, who was fatally shot by an ICE agent last week in Minneapolis. The winners who mentioned politics in their acceptance speeches opted for broader messages, describing how “we live in a very divided country” and urging “a shared humanity.” The night was a far cry from boisterous past ceremonies that also took place in times of turmoil, and farther still from the work that was being honored.

The evening’s final two film winners captured the apparent tension between defining Hollywood as a place for escapism and acknowledging real-world uncertainty. The Best Motion Picture—Musical or Comedy winner One Battle After Another, Paul Thomas Anderson’s adaptation of Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland, is a propulsive thriller about a former revolutionary, who is thrust back into his previous lifestyle to save his daughter. The Best Motion Picture—Drama winner Hamnet, Chloé Zhao’s take on Maggie O’Farrell’s novel imagining the hidden origins of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, is a potent tearjerker about art’s transformative power. Both movies are made by auteur filmmakers; both offer cinematic visions of best sellers. But while One Battle After Another touches, as my colleague David Sims put it, a “raw nerve” in its examination of the costs of American political violence, Hamnet is its opposite in scope and tone: a formal, intimate period piece about the Bard and his personal tragedy.

Anointing this pair of films came across like a deliberate choice. Taken together, they allowed voters to split the difference between making a point about the world Hollywood faces and recusing themselves from doing so. One Battle After Another was the most feted film of the night—it scored four trophies, including Best Director for Anderson—yet it was the somber Hamnet that closed the evening as the winner of the last category presented.

As a result, One Battle After Another’s triumphs at the Globes didn’t feel much like a coronation. Instead, last night’s remarkably muted ceremony at times seemed unsure of what it was meant to celebrate at all. The event is ostensibly meant to recognize the industry’s creative talent, yet it didn’t broadcast one of the craft categories, Best Original Score, which went to the Sinners composer Ludwig Göransson. The evening is also supposed to represent the tastes of the Globes voting body—which is composed of international members of the press—yet the only speech cut short by music was that of Kleber Mendonça Filho, the director of the Best Non-English Film winner, The Secret Agent. Even the freshly added Podcast category offered a confusing sample of what constituted quality: chitchat shows hosted by celebrities and a news program from NPR.

Late in the night, the comedian Wanda Sykes cut through the monotony and brought some sharpness to the stage. As she accepted the Best Performance in Stand-Up Comedy trophy for the absent Ricky Gervais, she thanked the trans community on his behalf, in a pointed jab at Gervais’s history of offensive joke-making. Fiery moments such as hers were few and far between, though. The ceremony was dominated by winners that had much more of substance to say on-screen than at the podium. Most of the awarded films apart from Hamnet, including The Secret Agent, If I Had Legs I’d Kick You, Marty Supreme, and Sinners, are defined by a sense of urgency; the same goes for the TV shows honored, such as The Studio, The Pitt, and Adolescence. But with a handful of exceptions—such as Teyana Taylor, who won for her performance in One Battle After Another, punctuating her speech with a rallying cry for her “brown sisters and little brown girls” to remember that “our softness is not a liability”—those in the ballroom seemed incapable of finding much of a spark.</div>

I don&#39;t know if Apple, a company that (supposedly) prides itself on protecting users&#39; privacy, partnering with one of the world&#39;s biggest Privacy Rapists is the flex they think it is.

I mean, Apple didn&#39;t have their own on par, and as others have said, at least it&#39;s not Nazi-Grok.

If the data is getting used by google though - someone&#39;s gonna be firing off an anti-trust lawsuit against Google over it - they&#39;d have nearly all of the smartphone AI going their way in a lot of markets.

This is when Microsoft, of all people, play the anti-monopolist card - lobbying the European Union to allow the choice of Copilot on all Android/iOS devices!

2025 Siri is dumb as hell, and only does about six things, but four of those things are really useful and work reliably enough to not have to worry about using them.  I&#39;m not sure I want anything &quot;smarter&quot;.

Zero accountability is exactly why most shut the fuck up real quick-like when bitching about what they can and cannot afford.Zero accountability for one side of the debt, but not the other.  It shouldn&#39;t be the government&#39;s job to make sure loans get repaid, but we routinely bail out lenders and set up systems where the most risky loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  Lenders don&#39;t have to even bother checking borrower&#39;s ability to repay, which in theory is what lenders are supposed to do in our system.

It was only literally 18mons ago that we saw rates on things like HELOCs and 30 year mortgages in the 8.5% range.

certainly it isn&#39;t going to be sustainable to have unsecured debt and secured debt in such a tight range.  Clearly when prime rates are in that range it would be impossible to profitably extend unsecured credit at 10% at least on the default rates that are currently common in the credit card space.

So would we see a lot of lenders closing consumer credit card accounts, and not offering them to anyone with a less that stellar FICO score?

That is exactly what would happen. This is another Trump idea that sounds good when you say it but anyone who puts any thought into it finds very quickly it is a terrible idea. Everything he says is about getting people to like him. He says something like this so people will say &quot;that will help me, Donald Trump is a good guy and on my side&quot;. Meanwhile, if it happens, most of those same people will have their credit cards cancelled or not be able to get a card to begin with. He can then say it is all the banks faults not his. Trump is nothing but optics, once you look past the words and actually at how things works, everything falls apart.

I find it laughable that a guy who has mainly extended his inherited fortune via strategic bankruptcies considers himself even remotely competent to manage the US (and world) economy.

I&#39;d laugh if I were young. Unfortunately I&#39;m near retirement age, and I&#39;m seriously wondering how screwed I am thanks to the orange imbecile.

Everything he says is about getting people to like him.Not anymore. Now it is about how can he line his pockets. This is just a ploy to get the finance industry to donate more to his &quot;campaign.&quot;

Considering how much credit card debt people are saddling themselves with, wouldn&#39;t having cards cancelled and/or not issued be a good thing?  Do you want to be hopelessly in debt?  If you&#39;re not hopelessly in debt, your credit score will reflect that, and you&#39;ll be able to continue using credit cards responsibly.  What&#39;s the downside?

Want a credit card? Then the bank must charge enough interest to pay for the costs associated with it and the defaults by people who don&#39;t pay back what they borrowed. If they don&#39;t, then lots of people won&#39;t have credit cards anymore.

Yes you need a credit card.  You cannot rent a car or stay in a hotel without one.  My cell phone company does not accept any payment other than credit cards.  Pay in full every month avoids paying interest but the credit card companies still collect obscene merchant fees.

If they don&#39;t, then lots of people won&#39;t have credit cards anymore.Which probably wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing overall.

You havent sold that counterpoint. Crushing existing exploitative businesses and optional purchases is the point, but it cettainly wouldnt be immediate.

Which probably wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing overall.Probably eventually, but in the shorter term we are talking about adding a lot new friction to the economy. ACH and debit would certainly replace a lot of the transaction processing but you&#39;d be removing an easy source of credit from a population where there has been a near zero savings rate for decades.Take the credit card away and you turn needing a new transmission into a lost job.

Yes lots of people who were not supposed to have credit card to begin with.

Frankly, I think most of you don&#39;t really get it.

This is strictly about the midterm elections in November. Trump and the GOP know they&#39;re in trouble. Right now, Trump is coming up with stupid ideas, hoping to mollify enough of the electorate between now and November so the GOP doesn&#39;t get slaughtered in the house. There will certainly be more crazy ideas coming from him in the next month or two.

And, frankly, if none of that works (and it probably won&#39;t - the guy really isn&#39;t that bright)... I fully expect w

let&#39;s be real.  if you look at the polling both parties are in trouble.  Voters rate each very poorly.

Turn out defines midterm elections.  I would pretend to guess what will happen in November right now.  If Trump or the GOP can animate their base somehow, they could hold or even pickup.  If they do nothing they probably take a pounding.

If Spanburger or Mamdani do something that spooks people, Democrats might find any support beyond the just 40% of the population that hates

Remember we had to vote against Harris because she wanted anti-price gouging measures and those were declared un-American and Socialist (but they would have been actually voted on)

Here we get potential worse price controls and done via executive fiat because in this admin everything has to be run through the WH.  I don&#39;t even think Trump considers that Congress is a thing.

There are price controls today on wages for H2A visa workers.  The problem is that these prices are below market rate.  This causes undocumented workers to demand higher wages than documented ones.  This is bad for big ag, so the donor class really needs them to get documented.

Call it price controls or whatever, but I think the government needs to step in when the market fails.I don&#39;t disagree, but I&#39;m not seeing evidence that this is actually a market failure (at least to the degree of slashing rates to 10% being a proportionate response). From what I&#39;ve seen interest rates on credit cards are over 20% around the world.  I obviously can&#39;t prove that a global cabal of bankers isn&#39;t colluding to set that rate at an artificially high level internationally, but it seems more likely that it&#39;s simply the price of offering unsecured debt to the general public.

Even AI disagrees with you -When Amex advertises cards at &quot;98%&quot;, they&#39;re likely referring to their extremely high customer retention (98% billed business retention) or merchant acceptance, not an interest rate, as they focus heavily on premium service, which drives loyalty, despite higher merchant fees; they also spend heavily on marketing to maintain this hig

Paying over 18% virtually guarantees bankruptsy.Not true. I got a 24% interest used car loan when I was in my early 20s with no credit history. I refinanced it after a year (I had credit history then) to somewhere around 10%, and the loan for my next car was closer to 3-4%.While I would like there to be a better way than what I went through (and I now know there is, but didn&#39;t back then), it still can work to get temporary large interest loans for very specific reasons. Keeping a 20+% interest loan for years is a recipe for disaster though.

Ah yes, the free market at work.Republicans have never cared about the free market.  It&#39;s only a talk point that holds zero water when looking at historical voting records and executive orders. (Fun fact: they don&#39;t care about states rights either.)

Their spin doctors like political convenience. And American voters appear to have very short term memories, so the behavior continues.

&quot;LOL, I&#39;m sure people would see that they now have a 10% cap on their CC interest rate and jump to one with an interest rate more than 10%.If you are a high risk debtor you would not end up with a 10% capped CC: you would end up without CC altogether since creditors would deem the risk not adequately covered at a 10% cap.That&#39;s what would drive these high risk debtors to &quot;unregulated, more costly alternatives&quot;, since I doubt they suddenly would become eligible for better forms of credit, or not need the credit altogether.

They would driven by the fact they want credit but now cannot get it from a major credit-card company.

Like if you can&#39;t get a car loan from your bank or a major dealer you end up at a buy-here-pay-here place which charged you 38% interest and massive penalties.

They would when the lender stops authorizing new charges.  Which read their contract, they certainly can do.

Sure we can bring that back but that legislation changed a lot of rates and other things as well, worth considering what else in there should be undone.

If the low interest rate is legally mandated then the risk profile changes. Maybe it will result in banks not giving people with crap credit ratings credit cards if they can&#39;t monetise them and result in better spending management.

The Orange Doofus cares not for unintended consequences.  Cap credit card rates at 10%?  Sure, then banks will stop extending credit to millions of people with marginal credit ratings.  &quot;Sorry, but we&#39;re canceling your credit card... we can&#39;t price your risk appropriately.&quot;

That leads to much less consumer spending, which leads to recession.  Or worse, makes people who can&#39;t qualify for a credit card use less-regulated, dodgier and more expensive credit products.

Come February when tens of millions of people get credit card statements still showing 29.95% interest, those 1-800 #s will be swamped with calls about how its illegal to charge more due to Trump. Then, many will stop paying until its &quot;corrected&quot; causing many banks to make a decision to charge fines to Trump&#39;s supporters and enrage them and him even more, or to submit and lose control of their business.

Also, where is my &quot;dividend&quot; check for DOGE and the tariffs?

As long as people aren&#39;t talking about the Epstein files then I think Trump will think this is fine.

Unsecured vs secured debt.  Own a home, get a HELOC and the rate is way less.

That is a strong recent indicator that there is a problem that your past history doesn&#39;t accurately reflect.If you are actually responsible with your credit cards, who cares if the interest is 25000%? You&#39;ll never be charged it anyway. That isn&#39;t a reason for society to allow companies to prey on the less fortunate, but anyone with strong credit shouldn&#39;t care what their credit card interest rates are.

Those that do, and offer lower rates, are very selective about who can get their card.  With a 800+ credit rating, you should look around for a company with a lower rate (which you will never use, but it is the principal of the thing?).

I&#39;m in the same position.  But if you never pay interest, why do you care what the interest rate is?

My bank lets me set things up so the credit card balance is paid in full automatically on the due date.  So I really don&#39;t care what the interest rate is because I will never forget to pay the balance.

It means most people aren&#39;t going to be offered credit cards. Maybe that&#39;s OK, but it sure is damn convenient to be able to put expensive car repairs on credit. Or buy your kids new shoes any day of the week instead of only Friday night, after you get paid.

That paying the king doesn’t result in good fortune. You just got branded as a sucker that will pay out some more.

I was looking at their special financing just to see the terms and they are charging crazy rates - Purchase APR is 34.99%. Penalty APR 39.99%. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen rates that high, but I&#39;ve never really looked for them either. My post-college debt was paid off long ago. There should be a cap on rates. 10% is probably too low, but miss a payment by one day and you&#39;re now burdened with a 40% penalty rate? In the case of Guitar Center, I think the penalty rate is retroactive on the full financed amount

Credit card companies base their rates on the risk that you will default.  If you are too risky and they can&#39;t raise the rates, they&#39;ll just drop you and cancel your card.Alternatives include &quot;payday loans&quot; (which can have APRs of around 400%) and of course your friendly neighborhood loan shark.  And I&#39;m sure the silicon valley oligarchs are ready to go with some kind of fintech crypto-usury scam.

&quot;The American Bankers Association warned that such a cap &quot;would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives.&quot;

what are the alternatives that consumers will be driven toward?  and why?Pay day loan services.  Various other predatory lenders.  And loan sharks never completely disappeared.

I haven&#39;t yet seen any activities by President Trump, which are to the right of LBJ. Another example, right here. Every fucking news item, if it isn&#39;t about his personal dishonesty and corruption, then it&#39;s about his far-left politics, which for some reason, are called far-right. WTF.

I am starting to disapprove of the Soviet Union&#39;s Communist Party renaming themselves as America&#39;s Republican Party. Why didn&#39;t the existing trademark holders object?! They should have fought back against the hostile takeover.

Trump has always been a populist pushing to appeal to a very conservative base rather than an actual conservative. That his occasional left wing policy goals are immediately embraced by his base is a testament to how much of a cult he&#39;s running.

I REALLY got a kick out of the idea he floated recently about eliminating corporate home ownership though. That is such an incredibly left wing proposal I have my doubts even he can push that through the rest of the party without watering it down so much it won&#39;t mak

A limit on credit card interest rates for just one year isn&#39;t going to solve any problems this country has. Clearly this is just Trump trying to boost Republican standing before the midterms using what is essentially the credit card company&#39;s money.

The president obviously can&#39;t control the free market.*

People who sign up for 25% interest credit cards, fuck &#39;em, that&#39;s their own problem.If those people declare bankruptcy and the cc companies lose out, fuck THEM, that was their risk they took issuing the card.

*then again, this applies to the previous president and &quot;forgiveness of college loans&quot; which everyone seemed to cheer?

Your new sub-prime card will have 10% interest, an annual fee of several dollars per $100 of credit limit, and very stiff fees an immediate freezing of the card for new purchases if you are as much as a day late.

The only special perks you will get will be the opportunity to buy things at inflated prices through affiliate programs and the &quot;opportunity&quot; (no opt-out) to have your personal data sold to anyone willing to pay for it.  Oh wait, never mind, these &quot;perks&quot; are already available to all customers.

There used to be reasonable limits on interest rates, but when credit card companies were allowed to violate state usury laws by setting up shop in a friendlier state, the laws became moot.

If he really wanted to bring those rates down, this could be a first significant step.

...a capitalist or socialist. Perhaps &quot;meddle-ist&quot; is most appropriate: he likes to stick his fingers into where whim takes them.

Only those who don&#39;t know what socialism is. Hint: he isn&#39;t one since he is not advocating for the workers owning the means of production.

OK so the banks will make up for lost interest by charging more fees... I don&#39;t see the point of this. You shouldn&#39;t have any credit card debt to begin with, regardless of the interest rate. This isn&#39;t helping people so much as giving them more rope. There are more subtle ways of helping people get out of debt traps like this.

Trump can say this all day long.  But she has no legal authority to do so.

As bad as 20% credit card interest is, the alternative is far worse: payday loans. If credit card interest were capped at 10%, the net result is that only people with strong incomes/credit scores would be offered credit cards. Those people typically don&#39;t actually need credit- they just want the convenience and perks.

Those without access to credit cards would still seek credit because they typically need credit. They don&#39;t have savings to deal with unexpected expenses or a job loss and high interest credit

Italy is not opening backdoors on any private personal system.

Italy wants to defend copyright holders and block pirate streaming services. Is that an absurd request?

The line between the two is blurrier than you think.

That&#39;s the issue, how much does it take before italy decides a start up competing with youtube is a piracy site because a user posts a chunk of pirated content?

The issue is that instead of following the existing due process of law to get sites like that removed the correct way; they&#39;re looking for easy, blanket attacks to apply with minimal effort and time. It&#39;s not about protecting copyright holders, it&#39;s about the money of a few corps taking over the law

What&#39;s the existing due process of the law to do this in Italy?

Italy wants to defend copyright holders and block pirate streaming services. Is that an absurd request?

Note that copyright holders also include copyleft. The ability to defend copyright is essential for FOSS to work.

Should we let CloudFlare get away with it, it means enforcing the GPL is worthless because CloudFlare will let people pirate FOSS code. And pirating FOSS code is possible by not following the license. So if a company releases a product using Linux without releasing the source, and refuses to do

Depends on the way it&#39;s done. If you want to see the Internet stop being a Common Carrier and have only approved content, then root for the Italian way.

Italy is a censorious, protectionist crab.

(To be fair, Prince is not the sort of crazy asshole chasing unstated goals that you&#39;d expect to be in his role. I&#39;ve disagreed with several of his choices, but I&#39;ve never seen much of a hint of hidden motives or short-sighted greed. But he&#39;s human, and even if he stays perfectly aligned with the &quot;forces of good&quot;, whatever that means, he won&#39;t be there forever. And they have too much power now.)

(As far as Italy goes, my first statement was fair.)

Cutting customers off on less than a month&#39;s notice is very bad for your own reputation.

Better option from a PR standpoint:* Pay the fine, then appeal it.  Paying first make you look like a good corporate citizen in the eyes of the rest of the world.* Immediately stop accepting new customers in Italy.* Tell all existing customers in Italy that you are declaring Force majeure and ending their services in 90 days.* Let it be known that the above notices will be rescinded if you reach an amicable agreement wit

Why pay it, who cares about looking good in anyone&#39;s eyes, especially to look good as a &#39;corporate citizen&#39;, whatever t.f. that means?  putin can start a land grab war and his minions are absolutely clear  https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com] that they want to destroy Ukraine as a nation and to make sure there are no such people as Ukrainians. Trump attacks countries with force to kidnap presidents (and not putin, notice, he didn&#39;t kidnap a mass murderer) and he is open about using Venezuela for his own purpose

Though &quot;spend&quot; has been corporate speak to show how they&#39;re doing discretionary spending (as opposed to expenses and other things).

I guess they are spending it all on sports.

have you tried to watch YT recently (without adblockers)? its fucking atrocious and certainly not what i would call &quot;watchable&quot;Yes, I would argue the same is true on terrestrial TV, OTA TV, or regular cable TV. But at least with YouTube, since I limit my exposure to Google and block trackers to the fullest extent possible, the adds on YouTube TV are hilariously inappropriately targeted for me. I can&#39;t believe advertisers pay to get their ads shown to me as a person who is probably among the least likely in the world to purchase their product or support their political candidate.

Yeah, that&#39;s kinda different than &#39;streamers&#39;.

That was my first read of the title as well. I have no idea why everyone suddenly started calling streaming services streamers when that was already an established term for an adjacent but different thing.

3.58% and they are crowing?  A couple of weeks ago, there were people calling IPv6 a failure b&#39;cos it was a &quot;mere&quot; 49% of all internet traffic

I think whenever Steam succeeds in getting most of its current games running on SteamOS, it&#39;ll be worth seeing how much that percentage grows.  Oh, also whether it is just SteamOS on x86, or on Arm as well

Is feasibility. If 3.6% of steam users (130M total, hence 4.7M on Linux) find gaming on Linux feasible, then it is. With the recent crap that Microsoft is pulling all over the place, even people that were too lazy (like me) are seriously considering moving gaming over. And all other things (like Office, Teams, etc.) are less demanding on the platform. I expect a landslide to something like 20% at some time and then this will not go away anymore.

The mix of games that users are playing matters less than the percentage. If hypothetically 95% of users used a platform, but that platform &#39;only&#39; did casual games and/or 10-year-old AAA games, then the gaming ecosystem is defined by those games you are being dismissive of.

To the extent your sentiment applies, the percentage will dictate the viability. It has proven to be technically capable, with improved performance for AMD GPU systems compared to Windows, and while it lags today for nVidia, there&#39;s been analagous work that suggests the improvements that would put nVidia in the same boat. The lack of &#39;native&#39; editions is now a matter of relative popularity, rather than technical implementation concerns.

Even that all said, looking through the general &#39;top seller&#39; list without regard to Linux, I&#39;m struck by the fact that most of those are over 10 years old already. But trying to filter by games released in the last 3 years, the list is:* ARC Raiders - Not native linux, but reported to work fantastic with &#39;Steam Play&#39; (AKA Proton, Valve&#39;s packaging of wine)* Marvel Rivals - Same as above, strong compatibility through Proton.* StarRupture - Same* Dead Island 2 - same* Battlefield 6 - Finally, a recent unplayable game, thanks to windows rootkit requirement* Fallout 76 - Back to playable under Linux* GTA V Enhanced - Playable under linux, *technically* newer edition of older game* NBA 2k26 - Playable with proton* Apex legends - Similar to Battlefield 6, technically can work but blocked by draconian anti-cheat* Path of Exile 2 - Playable with Proton

So there&#39;s a top 10 of &#39;new/popular games today that released 2020 or later&#39; (six games skipped because they were &#39;too old&#39; by your metric) and only 2 don&#39;t work and that&#39;s because the respective publishers explicitly block Linux due to anti-cheat concerns. I suppose you have a *partial* point that every last one of those use Proton to work rather than having native ports, and the native port catalog is a bit more anemic, but the point stands that even running with Windows binary compatibility mechanism, it still can outperform Windows at playing their own games.

Most popular non-Valve games on Steam ARE 10-year-old titles, but there are no technical reasons all these games can&#39;t run on Linux, it just depends on the publisher. Based on the top games:

Counterstrike 2 - Yes, runs natively on LinuxDOTA2 - Yes, runs natively on LinuxPUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS - will not run on linux.ARC Raiders from Embark Studios has released today and even though it has anti-cheat, it still appears to run just fine on Desktop Linux.Apex Legends - It used to run on Linux, but EA is actively bl

This fails to at all address the idea of what games those linux users are playing. If the linux users are playing casual games and/or 10-year-old AAA games, it does nothing to validate linux as a viable gaming platform.

There&#39;s only a handful of games Linux won&#39;t run, the vast majority run on Linux just fine with Proton.

The ones that don&#39;t are the multiplayer games that require kernel anti-cheat, so those games that have huge player bases (think Call of Duty and Fortnite).

Denuvo is DRM not an anti-cheat, really those kernel level anti-cheats should only be found on competitive multiplayer titles which unfortunately is somewhat required and that&#39;s one more the fault of the player-base who wants to cheat than the studios who have to fight against cheaters to keep their games viable.

It&#39;s going up another 0.0000001 this year when I kick Windows to the curb.Advertising, Recall, dark patterns? No thank you. It&#39;s my computer, not yours.

The Wyoming Supreme Court struck down its state’s sweeping abortion ban on Tuesday, preserving access to reproductive health care by a 4–1 vote. Its opinion found that Wyoming had (perhaps inadvertently) enshrined a right to abortion access when it ratified the freedom to make medical decisions in 2012 as part of a backlash to Obamacare. The majority also dismantled lawmakers’ justifications for its draconian abortion restrictions, reflecting a sensitivity toward the complexity of pregnancy that stands in stark contrast to the U.S. Supreme Court. Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the ruling, its ironic backstory, and its clear-eyed refutation of SCOTUS on this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus. An excerpt from their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This is a pretty bold ruling, coming from a court in an extremely red state. Can you just talk us through how Wyoming, of all places, wound up with such incredibly robust protection for reproductive freedom?

Mark Joseph Stern: The Wyoming Supreme Court’s five justices are all Republican appointees. But the Wyoming Constitution explicitly declares that “each competent adult shall have the right to make his or her own health care decisions.” How did a ruby-red state wind up enshrining that fundamental right? Well, when Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act back in 2010, GOP politicians and activists decided they were going to fight back by banning socialized medicine in state constitutions. They claimed they were worried that the government would force everyone into a state-run health care system in which bureaucrats dictated exactly what would be provided. So they pushed for these constitutional amendments that would preserve private insurance and give everyone the right to access and pay for medical treatment.

As Michigan State University College of Law professor Quinn Yeargain has documented, five states ultimately enacted those amendments, including Wyoming in 2012. But their proponents wrote them in broad language rather than framing them as an explicit rebuke to Obamacare. So Wyoming’s amendment begins by granting every adult this sweeping right to make their own health care decisions, and it shields that right from “undue government infringement.” Everybody ignored that this was part of the state constitution until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Then the Wyoming Legislature passed a ban on virtually all abortions at every stage of pregnancy. A group of doctors sued and said: These abortion bans violate the right to medical decisionmaking secured in our state constitution. And on Tuesday, the Wyoming Supreme Court said they were correct.

I can hear the woodwinds and strings in your ode to creative lawyering in the states. But I think it’s really worth flagging that, as you said, these are not rabid lefty judges. They are Republican appointees. And you could certainly imagine conservative judges finding a way to get the results they wanted by saying: Look, this was all about Obamacare. This has nothing to do with abortion. This decision does not take the easy route. It says that words have meaning.

I’ll note two things. First, even though these are not flaming liberal judges, Wyoming does have a merit-based judicial-selection system. So these are also real judges who are committed to trying to figure out what the law means. Second, the key move here is the court’s holding that terminating a pregnancy is a health care decision. The state of Wyoming argued that it wasn’t. It said: Abortion isn’t health care, so it doesn’t fall under this provision whatsoever. And the majority said that that was wrong; given the often detrimental impact of pregnancy on an individual’s health, the choice to terminate is clearly a health care decision. That means all restrictions on it must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.

This led to another interesting analytical move, which Mary Ziegler wrote about in Slate: The court held that Wyoming’s ban was not narrowly tailored to protect “fetal life.” And it did so by pointing to its lack of meaningful, coherent exceptions. So, for instance, state law allows termination for lethal fetal defects only if the baby would die within hours or days of birth. But the plaintiffs had doctors testify that they could not know for certain whether an infant with these defects would live for days, weeks, or maybe even a few months before suffering a painful death. So the majority said: Look, it’s illogical for the state to make patients carry a doomed high-risk pregnancy just because that infant might live a few more days or a few more weeks before inevitably dying. In legal terms, the law was tailored in a very arbitrary way, seemingly to prolong the suffering of women, as well as fetuses who were not going to survive if they were born.

The majority also pointed to Wyoming’s exception for rape, which is barely an exception at all, and noted that it really violates the logic of the ban: If Wyoming has an obligation to protect life from conception, as the state claims, how can it deem a life unworthy of protection because it was the product of sexual assault? The majority also pointed out that rape victims can terminate a pregnancy only if they report their assault—but many victims do not file a police report for a variety of reasons, including fear of retaliation by the perpetrator, who is often a family member. This is especially perverse because a minor who becomes pregnant from rape is not, under Wyoming law, allowed to request an abortion herself; she has to go through her parents or guardians. And if her parent or guardian is the person who raped her, they can veto her attempt to terminate the resulting pregnancy.

The majority said this was all deeply irrational and unworkable, and not remotely tailored to serve the state’s alleged interest. That is just solid legal analysis that really should not have a partisan or ideological slant. It’s just rooted in reason and the real world.

What you are describing is the anti-Dobbs opinion, right? This is a rebuke to Justice Samuel Alito and his completely inane analysis about the complexity of pregnancy. But it’s also a rebuke to state lawmakers who think they understand how medicine works, and to the entire pro-life industrial complex, which keeps treating pregnancy as though it’s a simple, check-the-box enterprise. This is an opinion that deeply honors the fact that pregnancies are complicated. They are fraught. They are a big deal. It sweeps in questions of rape and abuse and power differentials and reporting and how the criminal justice system works. It sweeps in granular questions about when life begins and whose life matters.

This is not the kind of thing that Alito can just imagine away, because he likes the idea of fetuses above all. What you’re describing is a court that is really sensitive to the principle that Alito missed completely in Dobbs, which is that when the government tries to regulate pregnancy and abortion in simpleminded cartoonish ways, women are oppressed and tortured. But then there’s the other piece of this that I want you to just amplify, which is that this is a court doing actual, principled, Scalian textual analysis. I’ve almost forgotten what that looks like, because you sure as hell don’t see it at the Supreme Court.

Those are the two pieces that braid together so nicely. This is a court saying that constitutional language has consequences and courts can’t just pretend that the words in the Constitution don’t exist because they’re inconvenient. This amendment, whatever its intent, was ultimately approved by the voters of Wyoming. We don’t know exactly what those voters thought they were approving when they enshrined this into their founding charter. People had different ideas. You can’t read their minds. Maybe a lot of them thought it was about socialized medicine. But what they ended up doing was create a fundamental right to make health care decisions. And because that right still exists, the state Supreme Court felt an obligation to enforce it.

That meant striking down Wyoming’s whole anti-choice regime—which, as you say, collapsed under its own internal contradictions. What the court did was say: This is a fundamental right, so we have to apply real, meaningful scrutiny to it. And once you do that, you see how horrible and irrational these abortion laws are on the ground. Forcing minors to get approval from the parent who raped them in order to terminate the resulting pregnancy. Forcing doctors to tell a patient: Sorry, you have to give birth to this doomed fetus because I can’t certify that it’ll die within days rather than weeks. All of these realities of pregnancy on the ground that Alito totally glossed over are front and center in this opinion.

I find that to be the ultimate kind of rejoinder to Dobbs, because in Dobbs, there are no acknowledged victims. The victims of that decision are concealed and hidden. It’s presented as this great win for “fetal life” and democracy. And the women who die because they can’t get a medically necessary abortion? The women whose lives are forever altered in a terrible way because they are forced to carry a pregnancy with lethal defects to term? The rape victims who cannot terminate a pregnancy that results from assault? Alito pushes them under the rug. But this Wyoming Supreme Court opinion brings them out and says they matter too. And that is the opinion that I felt I needed to read since the day the Dobbs draft leaked. And I’m just shocked that it came from Wyoming.

On Friday, the Supreme Court decided Bowe v. United States, a procedural case that will meaningfully reshape how federal prisoners challenge unlawful convictions and sentences. The court held that a key restriction Congress imposed on state habeas petitions does not apply to federal prisoners, and that federal prisoners may seek Supreme Court review when courts of appeals deny permission to file successive post-conviction motions. Together, the pair of holdings loosens a set of procedural choke points that have blocked many federal habeas claims from merits review even when the underlying law has shifted decisively in a prisoner’s favor. In practice, it means more prisoners will have the opportunity to secure post-conviction relief when new law is established that supports their claims, even after previously failed appeal bids.

The case emerged from Michael Bowe’s mandatory 10-year added sentence—on top of an initial 14-year sentence—under a federal firearms statute that applies only when a defendant commits a qualifying “crime of violence.” His predicate offenses were conspiracy and attempted Hobbs Act robbery. After Bowe was sentenced, the Supreme Court dismantled the legal basis for treating those crimes as violent. In 2019, the court followed with United States v. Davis, which struck down part of the “crimes of violence” statute as unconstitutionally vague. In 2022, the court followed with United States v. Taylor, holding that attempted robbery, as defined in the Hobbs Act, does not qualify under the remaining part of the statute. The 11th Circuit has also held that conspiracy does not qualify, either. If Bowe were sentenced today, his firearm enhancement would almost certainly disappear.

But post-conviction law does not move in straight lines. Federal prisoners typically get one opportunity to challenge their convictions or sentences. A second or successive motion is permitted only if the prisoner can show either newly discovered evidence establishing innocence or a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court. Statutory interpretation decisions, standing alone, do not open the gate.

That framework created a procedural trap for Bowe. After Davis, he sought relief arguing that his firearm conviction rested on an unconstitutional basis. The 11th Circuit rejected the claim because, at the time of his conviction, circuit precedent still treated attempted Hobbs Act robbery as a qualifying crime for a sentence enhancement even under Davis. Even if the portion of the statute struck down in Davis was an invalid reason for sentence enhancement, the court concluded, the conviction survived anyway under the separate portion of the statute. Then Taylor arrived and eliminated that fallback theory. When Bowe returned to court, the 11th Circuit blocked him again, this time on procedural grounds. His Davis claim had already been raised once in a prior motion and was therefore barred as an old claim. His Taylor argument could not open the door because it was statutory rather than constitutional. The sequencing of Supreme Court decisions left him trapped between two doors that would never open at the same time.

The Supreme Court granted review to resolve two questions that had divided the lower courts. First, the court addressed whether it had jurisdiction to review denials of authorization to file successive federal habeas motions. A provision of federal law bars Supreme Court review of authorization denials in state habeas cases. Several circuits had treated that bar as extending to federal prisoners as well. The court rejected that reading. The statute speaks in terms of state habeas “applications,” while federal prisoners file post-conviction “motions” under a different statute. Congress did not clearly withdraw the court’s jurisdiction over federal authorization decisions, and absent a clear statement, the court declined to read its own authority away. That holding restores a meaningful layer of appellate oversight in an area that had become largely insulated from review.

The decision reinforces the value of Supreme Court review itself in a corner of the legal system where access to any forum is often vanishingly thin. Post-conviction litigation frequently turns not on whether a claim has merit, but on whether any court remains available to hear it at all. When authorization denials become effectively unreviewable, legal error hardens into permanence by default. In a system built on layered review, preserving a path to Supreme Court review keeps open a forum of last resort in cases where liberty depends on whether the courthouse door has closed forever.

The second holding addressed the mechanism that had blocked Bowe’s claim. The statute that bars repeat claims applies, by its terms, only to second or successive habeas petitions filed by state prisoners under a specific section of the statute. Federal prisoners proceed under a different section, which contains its own gatekeeping rules. Some courts had imported the state-law old-claim bar into federal practice by assumption and policy reasoning. The Supreme Court refused to do so. Congress used different language in the two statutes for a reason. Writing for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor confirmed that courts cannot graft additional restrictions onto the federal scheme simply because they think the result would be cleaner or more restrictive.

That correction matters because it removes the procedural device that trapped Bowe. Without the old-claim bar, federal prisoners are no longer automatically foreclosed from re-presenting claims that were previously rejected under legal assumptions the Supreme Court has since repudiated. Bowe may now again seek authorization to file a successive motion based on Davis, using Taylor to show that once the unconstitutional residual clause is removed, no valid predicate remains.

Importantly, though, the decision does not dismantle the draconian framework for seeking renewed appeal. Prisoners must still satisfy the strict requirements for successive motions. Statutes of limitations remain in force. Courts of appeals continue to screen habeas filings aggressively. While Bowe leaves unchanged the existence of barriers, it eliminates a uniquely arbitrary one that punished prisoners for the timing of legal change rather than the legality of their sentences.

More broadly, the case corrects a distortion in post-conviction law. Constitutional doctrine and statutory interpretation often evolve in stages. When procedural rules freeze prisoners at an intermediate moment in that evolution, legal error becomes permanent by accident of timing. Bowe restores coherence by allowing federal prisoners to return to court when later developments reveal that earlier denials rested on conclusions the Supreme Court has since rejected.

For Michael Bowe, the ruling offers another opportunity to challenge a decade of imprisonment that may no longer be legally justified. For the federal system and similarly situated prisoners, it reopens a path that had narrowed over time and ensures that procedural rules in federal post-conviction practice do not entrench legal error simply because the law evolved in stages.

I don’t know exactly what I should be doing right now, as a person who lives in the United States in 2026 and cares about others. But I know I’m falling short. I think about this often: When I’m sobbing over a news report about a toddler orphaned after his parents are swept up in an ICE raid, asking myself, “How are you helping, other than donating money here and there and sharing Instagram stories?” When I’m imagining what I’ll one day tell my children I did for the people who were scared and suffering back in 2026, when I’m reading a post that commands me to reject hopelessness and get involved in my community, I immediately start to hear my own excuses about work and kids and energy and time.

It feels awful to disappoint myself. What feels worse is my feeling that Renee Good, who was killed by a U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis during a raid on Wednesday, was the kind of person I want to be, and as a result, she’s dead.

When I say she was the kind of person I want to be, I’m talking specifically about her presence at the scene of the immigration raid. The New York Post reported that she was involved with an “ICE Watch” group; though the tabloid claims that such groups “can turn confrontational,” their purpose is to help prevent immigrants from being suddenly swept into detention centers. It is exceedingly clear that Good was not threatening agents when she was shot. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told NPR that Good was “anything but” a domestic terrorist, despite the claims of Trump administration officials who say she was interfering with the ICE agent’s work. Instead, he said, she was a “compassionate neighbor trying to be a legal observer on behalf of her immigrant neighbors.”

If that’s the case, it means she must have felt the same horror I feel when I see how so many people in this country are living through pain I can’t imagine—and then she did something. Instead of taking a break from the news, or fantasizing about leaving the county, or despairing over the world her kids will inherit (or who knows, maybe she did these things too!), maybe she thought, How can I help?

She didn’t have the power to change the outcome of the election, or change the minds of all the people who voted for this horrifying reality, or even to stop ICE from chasing down the people in her community, or to reunite kids with their parents. But she still showed up, to be the kind of person we all hope will be there if we’re having the worst day of our life. I imagine that, before she was killed, her presence was a comfort that showed that someone was watching and that someone cared.

“Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known,” her mom told the Minnesota Star Tribune (she also disputed the idea that her daughter was involved in any kind of protest against ICE). “She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.” It is very easy to leave to others the job of showing up when people are in danger—the job of documenting and witnessing. Memes about how the world is terrible but being a mother is enough (evolutionary, even!) appear often in my Instagram feed. I understand why I’m seeing them. My algorithm is undoubtedly shaped by two kinds of content. The first: Reels about things like the way 3-year-olds yell at their parents for singing, and how 1-year-olds do gymnastics while breastfeeding. The second: Footage documenting the unspeakable suffering of kids in Gaza, stats about the number of people around the world who will face hunger or die as a result of this administration’s policies, and reporting on people in Latino neighborhoods in Chicago who form a walking school bus for kids whose parents are too afraid of ICE to leave the house. So I’m served content perfectly tailored to someone peeking out from the working-mom-with-two-little-kids trenches, looking around, and despairing over the world—until someone needs a snack or the potty or the kind of comfort I wish I could give to all the kids in the headlines.

These messages about how I’m doing my part by raising kind humans are always beautifully illustrated with whimsical drawings and pleasant fonts. I really do appreciate them and the comfort they bring to others. But these “You’re enough when you feed your child breakfast” messages just don’t resonate with me. Maybe it’s because my kids, while very sweet, are still young enough that they’d walk through an active crime scene to get to a veggie straw, so it’s just hard to picture them fixing the world. Maybe it’s because I think of myself as a decent person, but I wonder if I am really contributing if I raise people who are every bit as empathetic as I am, but I fail to give them the example of what to do with that empathy. Or maybe it’s because I know that plenty of women throughout history have had just as much on their plates as—and the same clichéd struggle to work and parent and shower—and still managed to try to make the world outside their homes better.

Women like Renee Good. She was the mother of three, including of a 6-year-old whom she dropped off at school Wednesday morning. Afterward, she could have filled her time with countless other things: laundry, a summer camp lottery, taking down holiday decorations, finding a lost glove. Or maybe she could have done something for herself: calling a friend, getting a haircut, or finally doing that 10 minute daily meditation or 25 minutes of weight-bearing exercise that are supposed to solve so many of our problems if we can squeeze them in. Instead, something brought her to a residential street in south Minneapolis where some of her neighbors were living through a nightmare and others were trying to help.

What I keep thinking about isn’t that she was killed even though she was a good person (many good people have been killed, and ICE isn’t supposed to kill bad people either!). I believe she was killed because she was a good person. Because she decided to be there. She’s gone now, her kids don’t have a mom, and the world is missing the kind of woman who found the time to go stand in the street and let her neighbors know they weren’t alone. She should still be alive. But because she’s not and I am, I hope I can honor her memory by being more like her.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which if officially BACK from hiatus and is ready to see if the news is now “good” again. [Checks out the ol’ news.] Ah well.

We may be a little rusty, so bear with us. This week, Donald Trump fantasized about which Western Hemisphere landmasses he can conquer next. Tim Walz can’t catch a break ever since he inserted himself into national politics. A solution for expired health care subsidies remains mired in the limbo of a dreaded Senate working group.

And while we were hoping to lead with a “fun one” in this return edition, that wasn’t in the cards.

On Wednesday in Minnesota, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was in her car, perpendicular to traffic, during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minneapolis. An agent approached her and demanded she get out of the car. As that officer began trying to open her door, another approached from the other side. Good tried to drive away, turning her wheels right to avoid the officer who had approached from the other side. As the officer tried to get out of the way, he fired multiple shots from feet away and killed Good. We can’t predict how a court of law would judge the officer’s self-defense argument. But the naked eye tells that this was an overuse of force.

This administration, though, can’t afford you believing the naked eye. It has a lot riding on ICE. Anti-immigrant zealot Stephen Miller, who runs White House policy—or, really, just runs the White House—pushed with all of his might to secure a mammoth expansion of ICE capacity and personnel in last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. A supersized ICE is Miller’s tool to implement mass deportations. And so, a scandal in which an ICE officer unnecessarily shoots someone in the face, which could threaten public support for Miller’s grand ICE project, is not something the administration can afford.

This is why the administration went from zero to she was a terrorist in about 10 seconds. Miller described Good’s driving as “domestic terrorism,” intended to run over officers, a line echoed by the Department of Homeland Security’s spokesperson and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem herself. Vice President J.D. Vance performed a hammy scolding of the media for daring to question the officer’s actions during Thursday’s White House press briefing. The response was quick and well over-the-top. It was high-stakes crisis communications to protect Miller’s dream for America.

Feeling his imperialist oats after having kidnapped a head of state so that he could take the country’s natural resources, Trump has once again turned his attention to Greenland, a large ice sheet controlled by the Kingdom of Denmark that Trump wants to annex because it looks really big on a distorted map. Trump reiterated early in the week that “we need Greenland” and his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, observed that “utilizing the U.S. military is always an option” that Trump could use to secure it. Our good friend Stephen Miller, meanwhile, gave a characteristically unhinged interview, saying that the U.S. has a right to take Greenland because “we live in a world, in the real world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” Buddy, this is CNN, not an Xbox headset.

At least there’s been reasonable pushback, with European leaders formally condemning the saber-rattling and observing that an attack on Greenland would mean the end of NATO (perhaps a feature, for elements of Trump’s administration). Senate Republicans, by Senate Republican standards, have also been forceful in their rejection of the idea. One possible defense of what Trump’s doing, though, is making threats as a means of getting Denmark to put Greenland up for sale. Can we observe, before the savvy negotiator spin takes hold, that purchasing Greenland would also be absurd? It could cost in the trillions at a time when the federal budget is calamitous, higher interest rates and inflation have returned, and there are better things—really, anything else—to spend trillions of dollars on. There are real national security interests and economic interests involved in Greenland. The way to manage that is not to conquer the island but to reach an agreement with Denmark, which was our friend up until about 10 minutes ago.

The Minnesota governor used to have a nice life. He put a solid 12 years into the House of Representatives then cruised to a comfy couple of terms as governor. Then, in 2024, he had to have the dotty idea to throw himself into contention for the vice presidency. Not good! It’s not just that he’ll forever be associated with a catastrophic presidential race for Democrats. It’s that the scrutiny returned home with him when he returned to Minnesota.

Walz withdrew his bid for a third gubernatorial campaign this week amid various social services fraud scandals in the state that have drawn national media attention and a federal probe from the Trump administration. (Fortunately for Minnesota Democrats nervous about scandals engulfing the party in the midterms, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who always puts up strong margins in statewide races, may swoop into the governor’s race.) That decision hardly allows Walz to slink away from the spotlight, though, as now Minnesota is embroiled in an escalating standoff with the administration over ICE. His peace and quiet are another long year away.

As the Surge wrote in a separate piece this week, the long-standing battle between interventionist Sen. Lindsey Graham and isolationist Sen. Rand Paul for Trump’s heart and mind took a dramatic turn in Graham’s favor when Trump sent the military into Venezuela to abduct its leader. Graham was waltzing around the Capitol with a grin on his face all week as if he had won the 250-year chess match of American politics once and for all. He even went out of his way to neener-neener Rand Paul, who was rather upset by the president’s interventionist turn, on social media.

Paul did have one move up his sleeve, though. He, along with Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, forced a vote on a war powers resolution that would block the president from further military action in Venezuela barring congressional approval. The measure, somewhat surprisingly, advanced on a procedural vote on Thursday as five Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting it. This infuriated Trump, who said that those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Graham, meanwhile, said that he would try to convene a meeting of the Senate GOP “regarding Democrats’ efforts to restrict President Trump’s authority as Commander in Chief under the War Powers Act” concerning “the constitutional effect of the War Powers Act and the damage it will do to our national security.” Graham has had just about enough of Congress, the Article I branch of government to which Graham belongs, having a say in foreign policy.

Last year, Sen. Mark Kelly joined a handful of other Democrats in Congress in a video telling members of the military that they can refuse illegal orders. The administration took that personally. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened Kelly’s retirement rank and pension for having the … the … the nerve to suggest that anyone could refuse to obey his illegal orders, calling it “seditious.” Earlier this week, then, Hegseth followed up and posted that the department had, in fact, “initiated retirement grade determination proceedings.” Most delightful, though, was his “letter of censure” to Kelly listing a bevy of offenses (various criticisms of the Trump administration) that disgraced the military. The censure letter, bless its heart, includes the line, “I hereby formally CENSURE you.” It’s a light and airy read.

The letter is more than a window into the Trump administration’s deep and dangerous insecurities. Mark Kelly was nearly selected to be Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election and, having dodged that bullet, must maintain some presidential ambitions. His flaw has always been that he’s a bit dry, though. So what better way to elevate his profile and spice up his credentials ahead of a Democratic presidential primary than a letter of censure (CENSURE) from the try-hard fitness instructor running the Pentagon?

With Nick Maduro sitting in the clink in Brooklyn, who’s going to run Venezuela? (Under the watchful eye of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, of course). The administration’s plan, at least for now, is to leave the existing Chavista regime in place under Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, so long as she does everything the United States wants. When Trump was asked early in the weak why he wouldn’t push to install the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, instead, he said that while “she’s a very nice woman,” she “doesn’t have the support within, or the respect within, the country.”

The administration’s overriding interest is in restructuring Venezuela as a colony, not making it a democracy, and the CIA determined that replacing the existing regime right now would be more trouble than it’s worth. But it didn’t break Trump’s heart to deny Machado control of the country. Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize last year after Trump had campaigned for it. The Washington Post, citing sources close to Trump, reported that this effectively killed her chances of running Venezuela after Maduro’s ouster. “If she had turned it down and said, ‘I can’t accept it because it’s Donald Trump’s,’ ” one source said, “she’d be the president of Venezuela today.” Trump and Machado are nevertheless expected to meet soon, and Machado has said she would be willing to present her prize to Trump to express her gratitude. Trump liked the sound of that and said it would be a “great honor” to accept it. The world could not be more odd right now.

On Thursday, 17 House Republicans joined all Democrats to extend expired Affordable Care Act subsidies for another three years. This vote was made possible through use of a discharge petition, through which a majority of members can force a vote on a bill against House leadership’s wishes, and allows vulnerable Republican members to at least say that they tried. And while this particular bill is dead on arrival in the Senate, it does put pressure on Senate Republicans to address rising premiums in some way—or absorb the political blowback from failing to.

So what is Senate Majority Leader John Thune to do? The Senate has convened bipartisan working group trying to develop an extension that tightens subsidy eligibility. One of the stickiest points, as ever with ACA subsidies, is abortion. Republicans want more stringent Hyde Amendment protections in ACA plans to ensure that federal dollars would never even consider comingling with payments for abortion services. How does this get resolved? Perhaps with some browbeating from Trump. “You have to be a little flexible on Hyde, you know that,” Trump told House Republicans at a gathering this week. We’re not sure they know that at all.

            <h2>IceWM soldiers on while Budgie jumps the Wayland ship</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/icewm_budgie_x_server/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new year brings releases from opposite ends of the Linux GUI spectrum: IceWM, an X11 window manager from the late 1990s, and Budgie, a newer full desktop environment that has gone Wayland-native.

Version 4.0 of IceWM came out on January 1. Ten days later, the Budgie desktop environment followed with version 10.10, the first entirely Wayland-native version of the environment.

The first release in the IceWM project&#39;s own version history was 0.8.9 in 1997, which means that it&#39;s about to turn 30. Although for humans this is a point in life many find quite troubling, by FOSS standards it&#39;s almost geriatric – but even so, it remains active and in good shape.

We covered the release of version 3.0 back in 2022, and development hasn&#39;t slackened since then. It&#39;s gone through every version from 3.1 to 3.9, so the change in major version looks to be more numerical than based on it being a major rewrite. This release does have improved handling of switching between windows with Alt-Tab and it defaults to working in 32-bit RGBA color (that&#39;s Red/Green/Blue/Alpha, for transparency handling). It also fixes half a dozen bugs, including keyboard-layout switching on OpenBSD.

IceWM 4.0 fixes a bunch of bugs, including on OpenBSD, and improves Alt-Tab app switching

This is a salient reminder as the Linux world seems to obsess more over Wayland every day: there&#39;s more to FOSS Unix-like OSes than just Linux, and most Unix-like OSes run X11 in some form – even some on mainframes that lack any direct display output. X.org is not the only X11 server there is, and X11 isn&#39;t going anywhere.

As additional evidence that X11 isn&#39;t dead and shows no sign of disappearing just yet, a very preliminary new X11 server debuted at the end of 2025.

Phoenix is very new so far, but it&#39;s an entirely independent new X11 server – it&#39;s not a fork of X.org. Rather than being written in C, it&#39;s being developed in the Zig language, a relatively new low-level language that aspires to be a better replacement for C. The Register&#39;s sister site DevClass has covered Zig a few times, including the project&#39;s recent move from GitHub to Codeberg.

The Phoenix homepage says that it aims for simplicity:

Be a simpler X server than the Xorg server by only supporting a subset of the X11 protocol, the features that are needed by relatively modern applications (applications written/updated in the last ~20 years).

As such, the description reminds us of X12, which was a plan to devise a successor to X11. It&#39;s a big job but we wish them luck.

Even as new servers and window managers appear in the world of X11, other projects are eager to depart from it. The latest is the Budgie desktop environment, which just released Budgie 10.10.

This is planned to be the final release in the Budgie version 10 series. With it out the door, Budgie 10 is now in maintenance mode as the team focuses on the forthcoming Budgie 11.

As we reported back in 2023, the Budgie project has been exploring different routes to move off X11 and rebuild around a Wayland compositor instead. Version 10.10 follows just under two years after Budgie 10.9, and with this release, it can work with different Wayland compositors:

For Budgie 10.10, we recommend the use of a wlroots-based compositor. The team has put special effort into enabling a great experience with labwc, a modern, lightweight, and feature-rich Wayland compositor perfectly suited for Budgie Desktop.

That&#39;s the same compositor that openSUSE Leap 16 uses for a Wayland-based Xfce desktop. The Gentoo wiki lists ten wlroots-based compositors, so this seems like one of the best ways to offer users multiple compositor options.

This release drops some X11-specific components, and draws components from other environments such as Sway to implement things like wallpaper management, screenshot grabbing, and more. The new Budgie Desktop Services module orchestrates other components together, and interestingly given Budgie&#39;s roots in GNOME technologies, the new module is written using Qt 6, the same toolkit used in KDE Plasma 6 and LXQt 2.

The day after the new release, project lead Joshua Strobl published the latest State of the Budgie report, looking back at 2025 and describing the project&#39;s goals for Budgie 11.

Budgie 10.10 will be part of Fedora 44 and Ubuntu Budgie 26.04, which like the other non-GNOME flavors won&#39;t be a full five-year LTS version. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">interview When it comes to security, AI agents are like self-driving cars, according to Block Chief Information Security Officer James Nettesheim.

&quot;It&#39;s not enough for self-driving cars to be just as good as humans,&quot; Nettesheim said in an exclusive interview with The Register. &quot;They have to be safer and better than humans - and provably so. We need that with our agentic use, too.&quot;

The parent company of Square, Cash App, and Afterpay is pushing hard to position itself as an AI leader, co-designing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Anthropic and using MCP to build Goose, its open source AI agent that&#39;s used by almost all Block&#39;s 12,000 employees and connects to all of the company&#39;s systems including Google accounts and Square payments.

A year ago, the company open sourced Goose.

As CISO, it&#39;s Nettesheim&#39;s job to ensure that Goose and all of Block&#39;s AI-based systems are designed to be deployed securely, and at enterprise scale - which sounds a little bit terrifying.

&quot;Being CISO is very much about being okay with ambiguity and being uncomfortable in situations,&quot; Nettesheim said. &quot;We are balancing risk constantly, and having to make trade off - in the AI space in particular. Like: What is a bigger risk right now? Not taking advantage of the technology enough? Or the security downsides of it? LLMs and agents are introducing a new, very rapidly evolving space.&quot;

However, he adds, humans are just as capable as machines at introducing security risks into corporate environments.

&quot;Software engineers also download and execute things they shouldn&#39;t,&quot; Nettesheim said. &quot;Users do that regularly. We write bugs in our code to where it doesn&#39;t execute. So we really just have to apply a lot of the principles we already have about making sure these agents are executing with least privilege, just like I want my software engineers to be doing.&quot;

What is a bigger risk right now? Not taking advantage of the technology enough? Or the security downsides of it?

In other words: applying least-privilege access to humans and machines. Block employees should only have access to data they need to do their jobs - same with the company&#39;s AI agents, he explained. Customer data should only be retained as long as it&#39;s needed for a specific purpose, and this same rule should apply to AI agents.

&quot;There are times where it&#39;s a risky area, and we need to dive a little deeper and make sure we&#39;re protecting&quot; certain data and systems, Nettesheim said, using the example of an agent querying data on a user&#39;s behalf. For example, if a user asks Goose to provide information about their store, or their account, it&#39;s vital that only information about that particular user is accessed and returned.

To this end, Block uses penetration testing and other offensive security measures to identify how attackers could abuse its AI agent, and then find ways to fix the issue.

In a blog shared exclusively with The Register, Block described how it red-teamed Goose, and in one case successfully used a prompt injection attack to infect an employee&#39;s laptop with information-stealing malware.

Prompt injection happens when a prompt is manipulated to include malicious instructions that the AI carries out, either through direct text input or indirect, hidden commands embedded in content that may be invisible to the user.

No one has solved this security snafu. &quot;With our internal usage, we have to assume that prompt injection is possible,&quot; Nettesheim said.

Goose uses &quot;recipes&quot; ​​- reusable workflows that can be shared with other users - and the red team realized that the portable nature of these workflows could allow an attacker to poison a recipe.

&quot;One of the hiccups we ran into is that it&#39;s possible to hide what that recipe is actually doing, tricking both the user and the agent into performing actions,&quot; Nettesheim said.

Specifically: the team used a combo of phishing - direct emails to the goose development team about a purported &quot;bug&quot; in the system - and prompt injection, with the payload hidden in invisible Unicode characters.

In the process of &quot;debugging&quot; the workflow, the developer clicked the poisoned recipe, which downloaded and ran the infostealer.

The development team has since added features and built new prompt-injection mechanisms into Goose, both for internal Block use and also in the open source version.

This included a &quot;recipe install warning&quot; that alerts users before they execute a new recipe and warns them only to proceed if they trust the source, thus adding transparency to the instructions.

Plus, Goose now displays desktop alerts when a recipe contains suspicious Unicode characters and detects and removes invisible Unicode characters inserted into strings. These can be used to hide malicious commands within the text, causing the AI to execute hidden instructions.

Additionally, Block is working on new ways to prevent prompt injection; some of these, like improved detection, have already been integrated into Goose. It&#39;s experimenting with others including adversarial AI - using an AI to attack its own AI systems and agents, as well as validating inputs and monitoring outputs.

&quot;Let&#39;s use another LLM or another agent to check the content of the prompt and tell us if it thinks it&#39;s not good or bad, and then warn the user that it&#39;s bad,&quot; Nettesheim explained.

Block is still testing this internally, and hasn&#39;t yet merged it with open source Goose as it irons out kinks in speed - it takes longer to send an agent&#39;s input and output to another LLM for security checks - and quality to ensure the AI isn&#39;t sending fake, or too many, security alerts that overwhelm analysts and prevent them from focusing attention on real threats.

But Nettesheim remains confident that adversarial AI will soon become another tool in security teams&#39; arsenals. &quot;It&#39;s gaining traction in the research community, and I think we are helping lead the way,&quot; he said. &quot;If you have two agents that are competing or collaborating with each other, it leads to better code generation.&quot;

As with humans, two minds are better than one. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has abruptly pulled the plug on the venerable Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT), sending any administrators still clinging to the platform scrambling for alternatives.

Redmond retired MDT with &quot;immediate&quot; notice. This means there won&#39;t be any more fixes, support, updates, security patches, or enhancements. Microsoft also warned that &quot;MDT download packages might be removed or deprecated from official distribution channels.&quot;

It also means that any hope of future compatibility updates for new Windows releases are dashed, although existing deployments should continue to work for the time being.

MDT has survived for many years and is a set of free tools for deploying Windows operating systems and applications. It has, however, been on the chopping block for some time. Microsoft announced deprecation in December 2024, and many affected administrators will have already migrated to an alternative. The house that Gates built recommends Windows Autopilot or Configuration Manager Operating System Deployment (OSD) as alternatives.

We asked Microsoft the reason behind the &quot;immediate retirement notice&quot; but the company has yet to explain. A user on social media wrote: &quot;there are security flaws that Microsoft chose not to fix. Instead they retired the product immediately.&quot;

Other affected users noted that &quot;Autopilot and config manager seem way overkill.&quot;

One suggested three reasons why MDT had to go: &quot;It is free, it does not invade the customer&#39;s privacy (no telemetry), it does not force customers to Azure cloud.&quot; Ouch.

MDT is undoubtedly a platform from a bygone era at Microsoft. It dates back more than two decades to a time before Azure. It supports Zero-touch (ZTI) and User-driven (UDI) installations. The former is fully automated, while the latter requires a user to respond to prompts during installation.

It also supports Lite-touch installations (LTI) where operating system software can be installed via bootable media, such as a DVD or USB drive.

The writing has been on the wall for MDT. In addition to putting it on the deprecation list, Microsoft has not made many meaningful updates to the service, so its retirement is not particularly surprising, even if the immediate nature will raise a few administrator eyebrows.

As one user noted: &quot;Not entirely unexpected, but that definitely closes a chapter on some of my early-career knowledge.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Fresh from watching rival OpenAI stick its nose into patient records, Anthropic has decided now is the perfect moment to march Claude into US healthcare too, promising to fix medicine with yet more AI, APIs, and carefully-worded reassurances about privacy.

In a blog post over the weekend, Anthropic trumpeted the launch of Claude for Healthcare alongside expanded life sciences tools, a double-barreled push to make its chatbot not just a research assistant for scientists but an actual cog in the $4 trillion-plus American healthcare machine.

If this feels less like healthcare reform and more like an AI land rush toward anything stuffed with data and VC money, you&#39;ve got the gist.

Anthropic is selling Claude for Healthcare as a HIPAA-compliant way to plug its model into the plumbing of US medicine, from coverage databases and diagnostic codes to provider registries. Once wired up, Claude can help with prior authorization checks, claims appeals, medical coding, and other administrative chores that currently clog up clinicians&#39; inboxes and sanity.

&quot;Claude can now connect to industry-standard systems and databases to help clinicians and administrators find the data they need and generate reports more efficiently,&quot; Anthropic wrote. &quot;The aim is to make patients&#39; conversations with doctors more productive, and to help users stay well-informed about their health information.&quot;

The life sciences side of the announcement adds integrations with Medidata and ClinicalTrials.gov, promising to help with clinical trial planning and regulatory wrangling. Because nothing says &quot;we&#39;re a serious AI partner for pharma&quot; quite like rifling through clinical trial registries.

There&#39;s plenty of lofty talk about helping researchers and saving time, but the underlying logic is the same one driving most AI-for-industry plays – admin drudgery is far easier, and far more profitable, to automate than care itself.

The company is keen to emphasize that Claude won&#39;t quietly slurp up your health data to train future models: data sharing is opt-in, connectors are HIPAA-compliant, and &quot;we do not use user health data to train models,&quot; Anthropic reassures us. That&#39;s the polite way of saying it would let hospitals, insurers, and maybe patients themselves hand over structured medical forms and records as long as lawyers and compliance teams are satisfied.

And yes, patients may get to play too. In beta, Claude can integrate with services like HealthEx, Apple HealthKit, and Android Health Connect so subscribers can ask the bot to explain their lab results or summarize their personal medical history. That&#39;ll be handy right up until the inevitable moment when someone discovers that handing a large language model access to health apps brings with it all the usual &quot;AI hallucination&quot; caveats and eyebrow-raising liability questions.

Anthropic&#39;s announcement follows hot on the heels of OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT Health ploy, which instantly raised privacy concerns by suggesting clinicians and consumers alike could feed it raw medical records and get back summaries and treatment suggestions. That gambit drew criticism from privacy advocates worried about where all that data might go, a conversation Anthropic&#39;s carefully-worded language aims to pre-empt.

So here we are: two of the biggest names in &quot;responsible AI&quot; now neck-deep in the US healthcare sector, promising to make sense of everything from coverage policies to clinical trial data. The claims are big, the caveats are long, and the proof, as ever, will come later. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA astronaut Mike Fincke has handed command of the ISS to Roscosmos cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov as Fincke and the rest of Crew-11 are scheduled to head back to Earth on Wednesday.

The departure is more than a month earlier than planned and comes after NASA&#39;s decision to end the Crew-11 mission due to a medical concern involving one of the four astronauts. The issue could not be addressed using the facilities aboard the orbiting outpost.

NASA ended a tumultuous week for ISS operations by confirming the return of NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, JAXA astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.

Fincke and Cardman were scheduled to perform activities outside the ISS on January 8. However, the spacewalk was postponed due to the undisclosed medical concern. By the end of the day, NASA confirmed the crew were coming home prematurely.

Assuming factors including weather conditions at the recovery site cooperate, the Crew Dragon&#39;s hatch will be closed at 1530 (EST), and undocking will occur at 1700. Splashdown is expected at 0340 on Thursday, January 15.

The exact nature of the medical issue remains unclear, and NASA is protecting the privacy of the astronaut concerned. The ailing astronaut is stable, and managers have not had to perform an emergency deorbit to bring the individual back to Earth. This will be the first time in the ISS&#39;s history of crewed operations that a mission is curtailed due to crew illness.

NASA hopes to bring forward the launch of Crew-12 to shorten the period where the ISS will have a crew of three, including a single US astronaut, Chris Williams. However, given that Crew-12 will inevitably require additional training to complete the tasks originally expected of Crew-11, such as the spacewalk, it is unlikely many days can be shaved off the flow toward Crew-12&#39;s February launch.

NASA has a busy couple of months ahead. There is a chance that Artemis II could launch, with the first opportunity being February 6 EST. While the agency has insisted the crewed mission to the Moon will not be affected by the events unfolding in low Earth orbit, the distraction is still unwelcome. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft&#39;s latest Windows Insider release introduces a policy allowing admins to remove the Copilot app from managed devices. But there&#39;s a catch - actually, several.

The announcement arrived in the first Windows Insider release of 2026 and intruduces a new policy titled RemoveMicrosoftCopilotApp. It all sounds promising for admins who want the code off their computers, but Microsoft has attached some strict conditions.

First, a device must have both Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Copilot installed. Second, the Microsoft Copilot app cannot have been installed by the user. Third, the app must not have been launched in the last 28 days.

The last requirement is particularly onerous as getting through even a day without Copilot appearing can be tricky for many users. And even if admins succeed in removing it, users can simply reinstall Copilot if they choose.

Administrators have long been able to remove Microsoft Copilot via Intune or other management tools. According to Microsoft, the new policy enables removal &quot;in a targeted way.&quot; Unless, of course, the user puts it straight back on.

The update arrived in build 26220.7535 for the Dev and Beta Windows Insider Channels, so there is no guarantee it will make it into production. The update also marks a brief window during which the Dev and Beta Channels are synchronized, allowing insiders to switch between them without reinstalling.

Other Copilot features in the update include AI-generated descriptions of images, charts, and graphs for Copilot via Narrator on all Windows 11 devices, rather than just on Copilot+ PCs, which, according to Microsoft, continue &quot;to provide instant, on-device image descriptions using local AI.&quot;

The announcement reflects Microsoft&#39;s balancing act: offering enterprise control while protecting its very substantial investment in AI technology. ®

If you’ve got a recent smartphone, chances are it’s got a really good camera — and don’t you want to take the best photos you can? One way to do that is via the DJI Osmo Mobile 7P Gimbal Stabilizer, a selfie stick that includes a tripod, a telescoping arm, and (perhaps best of all) a module that offers built-in computer vision which automatically tracks you, stops and starts, and adjusts framing with a wave of your hand. And it’s currently on sale at Amazon, Adorama, and B&H for $103, down to its lowest price from its usual $129.

In fact, the Osmo Mobile 7P’s Multifunctional Module offers a treasure trove of tricks to help you make the most of your camera, including a built-in fill-light with adjustable color temperature. You can also pair it with one of DJI’s wireless mics. According to Sean Hollister, our reviewer, he got five hours of battery life with tracking, or four hours with tracking and the fill light on, which is not bad. (The company claims a maximum of 10 hours.) But of course, the main advantage is the ability to stabilize your image as you photograph your kids, your friends, or yourself.

Users can revert back to the original Alexa, but can’t opt out of the automatic update.

Over the past couple of weeks, users on the r/alexa subreddit have reported getting automatically upgraded to Alexa Plus as a perk for their Prime memberships. The update doesn’t appear to be opt-in, but there’s an option to roll it back.

Screenshots of a message from Amazon sent to users state that, “After your device updates, you can still revert to the original Alexa by saying, ‘Alexa, exit Alexa+.’”

Alexa Plus is an LLM-powered overhaul of Alexa that’s intended to help Amazon’s voice assistant compete with rivals like Google Gemini. Not everyone is eager to use the latest version of Amazon’s AI, though, and the rollout of the Gemini update for Google Home has had its own issues, like misidentifying objects and hallucinating camera activity.

Some users on Reddit have responded to Amazon’s update with a variety of reasons for wanting to stick with the original Alexa, including disliking Alexa’s new voice and attitude and experiencing longer wait times for Alexa Plus to respond to queries. Users also report an influx of ads for Alexa Plus, including one user who said that after they turned off the updated Alexa, they got “flooded with ads” until they turned it back on.

After teasing its first collaboration with the Pokémon franchise last March but sharing very few details, Lego’s first Pokémon sets are now available for preorder through the company’s online store. The cheapest of the three is an articulated version of Eevee, but there’s also a budget-busting set featuring Charizard, Blastoise, and Venusaur that’s a whopping $649.99. Along with Lego’s first Smart Brick sets launching in March, it’s already shaping up to be an expensive year for Lego fans.

Shipping for all three Pokémon sets is expected to start on February 27th.

A set that is only for the most diehard Pokémon fans and Lego collectors is the Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise diorama featuring the three original starter pokémon in their final evolutions. It’s a 6,838-piece behemoth that includes articulated and poseable versions of the three pokémon plus an elaborate display stand with beach, jungle, and volcano biomes matching their types.

Lego’s brick-built version of Pikachu includes articulated limbs and ears so you can pose it on its own or in a battle stance when attached to a display stand featuring lightning effects and a Poké Ball that can be opened or closed. The 2,050-piece set is the second-most expensive in the new collection at $199.99 and includes a fun Easter egg. On its display stand are studs forming the number 25, which is Pikachu’s Pokédex number.

For Pokémon fans trying to responsibly stick to a New Year’s budget resolution, the 587-piece Eevee set is the most affordable of the three at $59.99. It doesn’t come with a display stand, but the pokémon has a movable head, limbs, and tail, allowing the 7.5-inch-tall figure to be posed.

Alongside the sets featuring actual Pokémon characters, Lego has announced two additional promotional sets with limited availability. The 312-piece Kanto Region Badge Collection includes all eight Kanto region badges in a buildable display case, but is only available as a free gift when you purchase the Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set between February 27th and March 8th. There’s also a 233-piece Mini Pokémon Center that’s only available as a Lego Insiders reward (the company’s free loyalty program) when you redeem 2,600 points, according to Jay’s Brick Blog.

The first set of Palworld cards are slated to release on July 30th.

Palworld, the monster-hunting action / adventure game known for its originality, is getting into the trading card business.

Pocketpair announced today that it has partnered with Bushiroad — the company behind the Weiss Schwarz and Shadowverse: Evolve trading card games — to produce a new TCG featuring creatures from Palworld due out on July 30th. Though the company didn’t share any card art, it says that the game will feature “strategic and tactical” battles between two players using decks featuring their favorite Pals like Blazamut, Celaray, and Grizzbolt.

The Palworld TCG will be debuting right in the thick of The Pokémon Company’s 30 year anniversary multimedia blitz, which will naturally include special sets of Pokémon cards. It’s going to be difficult to snag this year’s Pokémon cards given the resurgence of interest and demand for those collectables. So it might be worth checking out what Palworld has to offer (or to see what’s going on over in Digimon’s neck of the woods.)

‘Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models.‘

Apple will use Google’s Gemini AI model to power a more personalized Siri coming this year. “After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google’s Al technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users,” Google and Apple announced on Monday.

CNBC first reported on the multi-year partnership, which will allow Apple to use Google Gemini and the company’s cloud technology for its future models. “These models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year,” Apple and Google say, adding that Apple Intelligence will still run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute.

Apple has spent the past year working on an AI-upgraded version of Siri that’s supposed to perform actions on your behalf, as well as understand your personal context. The company delayed the update last March after admitting that it’s taking “longer than we thought.”

As part of these efforts, Bloomberg reported that Apple considered using a custom version of Gemini for AI-powered features in Siri, including a “World Knowledge Answers” capability that allows users to search for information and receive AI-generated summaries using results from the web. Google launched its Gemini 3 AI model in November, which topped AI leaderboards.

Apple reshuffled its AI team as well, replacing AI chief John Giannandrea with Vision Pro head Mike Rockwell, according to Bloomberg. Giannandrea stepped down from Apple last month. In addition to its partnership with OpenAI, Apple also reportedly explored working with Anthropic and Perplexity as well, with CEO Tim Cook saying that the company plans to launch integrations with more AI companies over time.

Update, January 12th: Added the joint statement from Apple and Google.

            <div id="article-text">The search giant wants to dominate AI-powered shopping with a new protocol and buy now features on Gemini.

The search giant wants to dominate AI-powered shopping with a new protocol and buy now features on Gemini.

Google turned up the heat in the AI shopping wars this weekend, announcing plans to turn Gemini into a merchant and launching an open-source standard built together with major retailers including Shopify, Walmart, and Target. The move comes as companies like OpenAI, Amazon, and Perplexity jostle for power and influence at the heart of a growing AI-powered shopping ecosystem, with consumers increasingly turning to the technology to streamline purchasing.

At the National Retail Federation’s annual conference this weekend, Google said it had partnered with Shopify, Target, Walmart, Wayfair, and Etsy to develop a protocol it hopes will become the industry standard for shopping with AI. The standard, called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), is designed to streamline how AI agents and retailers’ systems communicate throughout the shopping process, from product discovery and payment to post-purchase support, Google vice president of ads and commerce Vidhya Srinivasan explained in a blog post. In other words, it sets up a common language for agents — AI tools capable of acting independently — and online shopping systems.

Google says the new standard will power a forthcoming “checkout feature” on Search and Gemini, which would allow users to make purchases directly using the AI tools without having to switch between apps or webpages. The feature will bring Gemini and Google’s AI Mode in Search in line with competitors like Microsoft’s Copilot and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which launched purchasing options last year.

Google hopes UCP will be widely used by retailers and others in the e-commerce ecosystem, an area that is quickly becoming a battleground for companies to prove the tangible value of generative AI. UCP is open-source, meaning companies can freely use it rather than having to develop their own tools to deal with AI agents. It is compatible with existing industry standards like the Model Context Protocol, Srinivasan says. It will compete with a similar standard for agentic shopping OpenAI launched last year, the Agentic Commerce Protocol, which is also open-source.

UCP has already secured buy-in from more than 20 other companies in the online shopping ecosystem, the Google executive says. This includes payment giants like Visa, Mastercard, American Express, PayPal, and Stripe, as well as retailers like The Home Depot, Macy’s, Best Buy, Kroger, Lowe’s, Gap, and Zalando. Ant Group, an affiliate of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba, has also endorsed the standard. Many of these partners are likely to — or already — partner with other AI companies as well. Shopify merchants, for example, can sell in AI modes on Gemini, ChatGPT, and Microsoft Copilot, and PayPal has also partnered with OpenAI.

As well as the buy button on Gemini and the UCP standard, Google also said it is launching a business agent on Monday that will allow shoppers to chat with brands directly on Search. In this case, “directly” means chatting with a virtual assistant from the brand that can “answer product questions in a brand’s voice.” Retailers including Lowe’s, Michael’s, Poshmark, and Reebok have been among the first to sign up.

The announcements come as companies bet big on AI-driven shopping, with firms like Amazon infusing it into almost every step of the shopping experience. The technology has yet to prove itself as a useful assistant — The Verge’s experience has been glitchy, to say the least — but companies are certain AI agents are the future. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company’s new standard is laying the “groundwork” for agentic shopping, which “will be a big part of how we shop in the not-so-distant future.”

            <h2>Mitigating emissions from air freight: Unlocking the potential of SAF with book and claim</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1128939/mitigating-emissions-from-air-freight-unlocking-the-potential-of-saf-with-book-and-claim/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Emissions from air freight have increased by 25% since 2019, according to a 2024 analysis by environmental advocacy organization Stand.Earth.

The researchers found that the expansion of cargo-only fleets to transport goods during the pandemic — as air travel halted, slower freight modes faced disruption, but demand for rapid delivery soared — has led to a yearly increase of almost 20 million tons of carbon dioxide, making up 93.8m tonnes from air freight overall.

And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn&#39;t really picked up massively. It&#39;s not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They&#39;re very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they&#39;re getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it&#39;s providing to our customers to be sure that they&#39;re not saying something which they can&#39;t confidently stand behind.”

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don&#39;t wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

Introducing this year’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies

It’s easy to be cynical about technology these days. Many of the “disruptions” of the last 15 years were more about coddling a certain set of young, moneyed San Franciscans than improving the world. Yet you can be sympathetic to the techlash and still fully buy into the idea that technology can be good.

We really can build tools that make this planet healthier, more livable, more equitable, and just all-around better. And some people are doing just that, pushing progress forward across a number of fundamental, potentially world-changing technologies.

These are exactly the technologies we aim to spotlight in our annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list. These are 10 technologies that we believe are poised to fundamentally alter the world, and they’re a matter of hot debate across the newsroom for months before being unveiled. So, without further ado… Here’s the full list.

Do you think we’ve missed something? You have until April to cast your vote for the 11th breakthrough!

—Fabio Duarte is associate director and principal research scientist at the MIT Senseable City Lab.

Today marks the 25th year the MIT Technology Review newsroom has compiled its annual 10 Breakthrough Technologies list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, asking them what we can learn from the failures.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. Read about why that is.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

This startup is about to conduct the biggest real-world test of aluminum as a zero-carbon fuel

Found Energy aims to harness the energy in scraps of aluminum metal to power industrial processes without fossil fuels. Since 2022, the company has worked to develop ways to rapidly release energy from aluminum on a small scale.

Now it’s just switched on a much larger version of its aluminum-powered engine, which it claims is the largest aluminum-water reactor ever built. Soon, it will be installed to supply heat and hydrogen to a tool manufacturing facility in the southeastern US, using the aluminum waste produced by the plant itself as fuel.

If everything works as planned, this technology, which uses a catalyst to unlock the energy stored within aluminum metal, could transform a growing share of aluminum scrap into a zero-carbon fuel. Read the full story.

            <h2>Securing digital assets as crypto crime surges</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1129479/securing-digital-assets-as-crypto-crime-surges/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In February 2025, cyberattackers thought to be linked to North Korea executed a sophisticated supply chain attack on cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. By targeting its infrastructure and multi-signature security process, hackers managed to steal more than $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum in the largest known digital-asset theft to date.

The ripple effects were felt across the cryptocurrency market, with the price of Bitcoin dropping 20% from its record high in January. And the massive losses put 2025 on track to be the worst year in history for cryptocurrency theft.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins have established themselves as benchmark monetary vehicles, and, despite volatility, their values continue to rise. In October 2025, the value of cryptocurrency and other digital assets topped $4 trillion.

Yet, with this burgeoning value and liquidity comes more attention from cybercriminals and digital thieves. The Bybit attack demonstrates how focused sophisticated attackers are on finding ways to break the security measures that guard the crypto ecosystem, says Charles Guillemet, chief technology officer of Ledger, a provider of secure signer platforms.

”The attackers were very well organized, they have plenty of money, and they are spending a lot of time and resources trying to attack big stuff, because they can,” he says. “In terms of opportunity costs, it&#39;s a big investment, but if at the end they earn $1.4 billion it makes sense to do this investment.”

But it also demonstrates how the crypto threat landscape has pitfalls not just for the unwary but for the tech savvy too. On the one hand, cybercriminals are using techniques like social engineering to target end users. On the other, they are increasingly looking for vulnerabilities to exploit at different points in the cryptocurrency infrastructure.

Historically, owners of digital assets have had to stand against these attackers alone. But now, cybersecurity firms and cryptocurrency-solution providers are offering new solutions, powered by in-depth threat research.

One of the advantages of cryprocurrency is self custody. Users can save their private keys—the critical piece of alphanumeric code that proves ownership and grants full control over digital assets—into either a software or hardware wallet to safeguard it.

But users must put their faith in the security of the wallet technology, and, because the data is the asset, if the keys are lost or forgotten, the value too can be lost.

”If I hack your credit card, what is the issue? You will call your bank, and they will manage to revert the operations,” says Vincent Bouzon, head of the Donjon research team at Ledger. &quot;The problem with crypto is, if something happens, it&#39;s too late. So we must eliminate the possibility of vulnerabilities and give users security.”

Increasingly, attackers are focusing on digital assets known as stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that is pegged to the value of a hard asset, such as gold, or a fiat currency, like the US dollar.

Stablecoins rely on smart contracts—digital contracts stored on blockchain that use pre-set code to manage issuance, maintain value, and enforce rules—that can be vulnerable to different classes of attacks, often taking advantage of users&#39; credulity or lack of awareness about the threats. Post-theft countermeasures, such as freezing the transfer of coins and blacklisting of addresses, can lessen the risk with these kinds of attacks, however.

Software-based wallets, also known as “hot wallets,” which are applications or programs that run on a user’s computer, phone, or web browser, are often a weak link. While their connection to the internet makes them convenient for users, it also makes them more readily accessible to hackers too.

“If you are using a software wallet, by design it&#39;s vulnerable because your keys are stored inside your computer or inside your phone. And unfortunately, a phone or a computer is not designed for security.” says Guillemet.

The rewards for exploiting this kind of vulnerability can be extensive. Hackers who stole credentials in a targeted attack on encrypted password manager application LastPass in 2022 managed to transfer millions worth of cryptocurrency away from victims in the subsequent two or more years.

Even hardware-based wallets, which often resemble USB drives or key fobs and are more secure than their software counterparts since they are completely offline, can have vulnerabilities that a diligent attacker might find and exploit.

Tactics include the use of side-channel attacks, for example, where a cycbercriminal observes a system’s physical side effects, like timing, power, or electromagnetic and acoustic emissions to gain information about the implementation of an algorithm.

Guillemet explains that cybersecurity providers building digital asset solutions, such as wallets, need to help minimize the burden on the users by building security features and providing education about enhancing defense.

For businesses to protect cryptocurrency, tokens, critical documents, or other digital assets, this could be a platform that allows multi-stakeholder custody and governance, supports software and hardware protections, and allows for visibility of assets and transactions through Web3 checks.

As the threat landscape evolves at breakneck speed, in-depth research conducted by attack labs like Ledger Donjon can help security firms keep pace. The team at Ledger Donjon are working to understand how to proactively secure the digital asset ecosystem and set global security standards.

Key projects include the team’s offensive security research, which uses ethical and white hat hackers to simulate attacks and uncover weaknesses in hardware wallets, cryptographic systems, and infrastructure.

In November 2022, the Donjon team discovered a vulnerability in Web3 wallet platform Trust Wallet, which had been acquired by Binance. They found that the seed-phrase generation was not random enough, allowing the team to compute all possible private keys and putting as much as $30 million stored in Trust Wallet accounts at risk, says Bouzon. “The entropy was not high enough, the entropy was only 4 billion. It was huge, but not enough,” he says.

To enhance overall safety there are three key principles that digital-asset protection platforms should apply, says Bouzon. First, security providers should create secure algorithms to generate the seed phrases for private keys and conduct in-depth security audits of the software. Second, users should use hardware wallets with a secure screen instead of software wallets. And finally, any smart contract transaction should include visibility into what is being signed to avoid blind signing attacks.

Ultimately, the responsibility for safeguarding these valuable assets lies on both digital asset solution providers and the users themselves. As the value of cryptocurrencies continues to grow so too will the threat landscape as hackers keep attempting to circumvent new security measures. While digital asset providers, security firms, and wallet solutions must work to build strong and simple protection to support the cryptocurrency ecosystems, users must also seek out the information and education they need to proactively protect themselves and their wallets.

            <div id="article-text">Our reporters and editors constantly debate which emerging technologies will define the future. Once a year, we take stock and share some educated guesses with our readers. Here are the advances that we think will drive progress or incite the most change—for better or worse—in the years ahead.

Sodium-ion batteries, made from abundant materials like salt, are emerging as a cheaper, safer alternative to lithium. Backed by major players and public investment, they’re poised to power grids and affordable EVs worldwide.

AI coding tools are revolutionizing how we write, test, and deploy code, making it easier and faster to build sophisticated websites, games, and other applications than ever before. Just be sure to double-check what they come up with.

Nuclear power already provides steady electricity to grids around the world, without producing any greenhouse-gas emissions. New designs rely on alternative fuels and cooling systems or take up less space, which could get more reactors online faster.

From molten salt to TRISO fuel, here’s how technological advancements could upend an old power technology.

Every day, millions of people interact with AI chatbots. Some of them form what feel like close, personal bonds with the bots. There’s mounting evidence that this can be dangerous, and politicians are finally waking up.

When he was just seven months old, baby KJ became the first person to receive a personalized gene-editing treatment. A clinical trial is now planned, and bespoke gene-editing drugs could be approved within the next few years.

Growing banks of gene information on extinct creatures are providing clues to new treatments and suggesting solutions to climate change—and may help save endangered species.

Nobody knows exactly how large language models work, which means we don’t have a clear idea of their limitations. But that’s changing: Clever research techniques are giving us the best glimpse yet of what’s really going on inside the black box.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

Space tourism may seem fanciful, but this might be the year paying customers can finally check into a room with a galactic view. The shiny new modules will also support research missions by scientists and space agencies.

Screening embryos for genetic diseases is relatively common practice in fertility clinics today, and it can give potential parents some peace of mind. Now, though, new startups are making bold claims about using similar techniques to predict certain traits, including intelligence.

The race for AI supremacy has supercharged data centers. Hyperscale AI data centers pack powerful computer chips into synchronized clusters that work like giant, high-speed supercomputers—sizzling hot, power-hungry behemoths pushing infrastructure to its limits.

MIT Technology Review’s annual list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies aims to help our audience know which emerging technologies are really worth paying attention to right now. Our editors and reporters pitch advances that they think should make the list, and we discuss and debate the merits of each over the course of several months.

We look for breakthroughs that will have a broad impact and make meaningful differences in our lives and work. We give equal consideration to those that we think will have a positive effect or bring negative consequences. Every year, we have to pass on many worthy candidates. Here’s what didn’t make the list this year.

This is the 25th year we’ve produced this list. Predicting the future is tough and we don’t always get it right. Look back through our archives to see what’s worked out—and what hasn’t. Or read this special analysis by an MIT researcher about some of the flops.

            <h2>Why some “breakthrough” technologies don’t work out</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1130726/opinion-breakthrough-technology-failures-flops/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every year, MIT Technology Review publishes a list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies. In fact, the 2026 version is out today. This marks the 25th year the newsroom has compiled this annual list, which means its journalists and editors have now identified 250 technologies as breakthroughs.

A few years ago, editor at large David Rotman revisited the publication’s original list, finding that while all the technologies were still relevant, each had evolved and progressed in often unpredictable ways. I lead students through a similar exercise in a graduate class I teach with James Scott for MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning.

We ask these MIT students to find some of the “flops” from breakthrough lists in the archives and consider what factors or decisions led to their demise, and then to envision possible ways to “flip” the negative outcome into a success. The idea is to combine critical perspective and creativity when thinking about technology.

Although it’s less glamorous than envisioning which advances will change our future, analyzing failed technologies is equally important. It reveals how factors outside what is narrowly understood as technology play a role in its success—factors including cultural context, social acceptance, market competition, and simply timing.

In some cases, the vision behind a breakthrough was prescient but the technology of the day was not the best way to achieve it. Social TV (featured on the list in 2010) is an example: Its advocates proposed different ways to tie together social platforms and streaming services to make it easier to chat or interact with your friends while watching live TV shows when you weren’t physically together.

This idea rightly reflected the great potential for connection in this modern era of pervasive cell phones, broadband, and Wi-Fi. But it bet on a medium that was in decline: live TV.

Still, anyone who had teenage children during the pandemic can testify to the emergence of a similar phenomenon—youngsters started watching movies or TV series simultaneously on streaming platforms while checking comments on social media feeds and interacting with friends over messaging apps.

Shared real-time viewing with geographically scattered friends did catch on, but instead of taking place through one centralized service, it emerged organically on multiple platforms and devices. And the experience felt unique to each group of friends, because they could watch whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted, independent of the live TV schedule.

Here are a few more examples of flops from the breakthroughs list that students in the 2025 edition of my course identified, and the lessons that we could take from each.

The DNA app store (from the 2016 list) was selected by Kaleigh Spears. It seemed like a great deal at the time—a startup called Helix could sequence your genome for just $80. Then, in the company’s app store, you could share that data with third parties that promised to analyze it for relevant medical info, or make it into fun merch. But Helix has since shut down the store and no longer sells directly to consumers.Privacy concerns and doubts about the accuracy of third-party apps were among the main reasons the service didn’t catch on, particularly since there’s minimal regulation of health apps in the US.

Elvis Chipiro picked universal memory (from the 2005 list). The vision was for one memory tech to rule them all—flash, random-access memory, and hard disk drives would be subsumed by a new method that relied on tiny structures called carbon nanotubes to store far more bits per square centimeter. The company behind the technology, Nantero, raised significant funds and signed on licensing partners but struggled to deliver a product on its stated timeline.Nantero ran into challenges when it tried to produce its memory at scale because tiny variations in the way the nanotubes were arranged could cause errors. It also proved difficult to upend memory technologies that were already deeply embedded within the industry and well integrated into fabs.

Light-field photography (from the 2012 list), chosen by Cherry Tang, let you snap a photo and adjust the image’s focus later. You’d never deal with a blurry photo ever again. To make this possible, the startup Lytro had developed a special camera that captured not just the color and intensity of light but also the angle of its rays. It was one of the first cameras of its kind designed for consumers. Even so, the company shut down in 2018.

Ultimately, Lytro was outmatched by well-established incumbents like Sony and Nokia. The camera itself had a tiny display, and the images it produced were fairly low resolution. Readjusting the focus in images using the company’s own software also required a fair amount of manual work. And smartphones—with their handy built-in cameras—were becoming ubiquitous.

Many students over the years have selected Project Loon (from the 2015 list)—one of the so-called “moonshots” out of Google X. It proposed using gigantic balloons to replace networks of cell-phone towers to provide internet access, mainly in remote areas. The company completed field tests in multiple countries and even provided emergency internet service to Puerto Rico during the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. But the company shut down the project in 2021, with Google X CEO Astro Teller saying in a blog post that “the road to commercial viability has proven much longer and riskier than hoped.”

Sean Lee, from my 2025 class, saw the reason for its flop in the company’s very mission: Project Loon operated in low-income regions where customers had limited purchasing power. There were also substantial commercial hurdles that may have slowed development—the company relied on partnerships with local telecom providers to deliver the service and had to secure government approvals to navigate in national airspaces.

While this specific project did not become a breakthrough, the overall goal of making the internet more accessible through high-altitude connectivity has been carried forward by other companies, most notably Starlink with its constellation of low-orbit satellites. Sometimes a company has the right idea but the wrong approach, and a firm with a different technology can make more progress.

As part of this class exercise, we also ask students to pick a technology from the list that they think might flop in the future. Here, too, their choices can be quite illuminating.

Lynn Grosso chose synthetic data for AI (a 2022 pick), which means using AI to generate data that mimics real-world patterns for other AI models to train on. Though it’s become more popular as tech companies have run out of real data to feed their models, she points out that this practice can lead to model collapse, with AI models trained exclusively on generated data eventually breaking the connection to data drawn from reality.

And Eden Olayiwole thinks the long-term success of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm (a 2021 pick) is in jeopardy as awareness grows of the technology’s potential harms and its tendency to, as she puts it, incentive creators to “microwave” ideas for quick consumption.

But she also offers a possible solution. Remember—we asked all the students what they would do to “flip” the flopped (or soon-to-flop) technologies they selected. The idea was to prompt them to think about better ways of building or deploying these tools.

For TikTok, Olayiwole suggests letting users indicate which types of videos they want to see more of, instead of feeding them an endless stream based on their past watching behavior. TikTok already lets users express interest in specific topics, but she proposes taking it a step further to give them options for content and tone—allowing them to request more educational videos, for example, or more calming content.

It’s always challenging to predict how a technology will shape a future that itself is in motion. Predictions not only make a claim about the future; they also describe a vision of what matters to the predictor, and they can influence how we behave, innovate, and invest.

One of my main takeaways after years of running this exercise with students is that there’s not always a clear line between a successful breakthrough and a true flop. Some technologies may not have been successful on their own but are the basis of other breakthrough technologies (natural-language processing, 2001). Others may not have reached their potential as expected but could still have enormous impact in the future (brain-machine interfaces, 2001). Or they may need more investment, which is difficult to attract when they are not flashy (malaria vaccine, 2022).

Despite the flops over the years, this annual practice of making bold and sometimes risky predictions is worthwhile. The list gives us a sense of what advances are on the technology community’s radar at a given time and reflects the economic, social, and cultural values that inform every pick. When we revisit the 2026 list in a few years, we’ll see which of today’s values have prevailed.

Fabio Duarte is associate director and principal research scientist at the MIT Senseable City Lab.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

We’ll keep following these developments, but this just wasn’t their year. Here’s why.

It’s free and easy to nominate yourself or someone you know—here’s how.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, space stations have been largely staffed by professional astronauts and operated by a handful of nations. But that’s about to change in the coming years, as companies including Axiom Space and Sierra Space launch commercial space stations that will host tourists and provide research facilities for nations and other firms.

The first of those stations could be Haven-1, which the California-based company Vast aims to launch in May 2026. If all goes to plan, its earliest paying visitors will arrive about a month later. Drew Feustel, a former NASA astronaut, will help train them and get them up to speed ahead of their historic trip. Feustel has spent 226 days in space on three trips to the International Space Station (ISS) and the Hubble Space Telescope.

Feustel is now lead astronaut for Vast, which he advised on the new station’s interior design. He also created a months-long program to prepare customers to live and work there. Crew members (up to four at a time) will arrive at Haven-1 via a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, which will dock to the station and remain attached throughout each 10-day stay. (Vast hasn’t publicly said who will fly on its first missions or announced the cost of a ticket, though competing firms have charged tens of millions of dollars for similar trips.)

Haven-1 is intended as a temporary facility, to be followed by a bigger, permanent station called Haven-2. Vast will begin launching Haven-2’s modules in 2028 and says it will be able to support a crew by 2030. That’s about when NASA will start decommissioning the ISS, which has operated for almost 30 years. Instead of replacing it, NASA and its partners intend to carry out research aboard commercial stations like those built by Vast, Axiom, and Sierra.

I recently caught up with Feustel in Lisbon at the tech conference Web Summit, where he was speaking about his role at Vast and the company’s ambitions.

Responses have been edited and condensed.

What are you hoping this new wave of commercial space stations will enable people to do?

Ideally, we’re creating access. The paradigm that we’ve seen for 25 years is primarily US-backed missions to the International Space Station, and [NASA] operating that station in coordination with other nations. But [it’s] still limited to 16 or 17 primary partners in the ISS program.

Following NASA’s intentions, we are planning to become a service provider to not only the US government, but other sovereign nations around the world, to allow greater access to a low-Earth-orbit platform. We can be a service provider to other organizations and nations that are planning to build a human spaceflight program.

Today, you’re Vast’s lead astronaut after you were initially brought on to advise the company on the design of Haven-1 and Haven-2. What are some of the things that you&#39;ve weighed in on?

Some of the things where I can see tangible evidence of my work is, for example, in the sleep cores and sleep system—trying to define a more comfortable way for astronauts to sleep. We’ve come up with an air bladder system that provides distributed forces on the body that kind of emulate, or I believe will emulate, the gravity field that we feel in bed when we lie down, having that pressure of gravity on you.

Kind of like a weighted blanket, but you’re up against the wall, so you have to create, like, an inflatable bladder that will push you against the wall. That’s one of the very tangible, obvious things. But I work with the company on anything from crew displays and interfaces and how notifications and system information come through to how big a window should be.

How big should a window be? I feel like the bigger the better—but what are the factors that go into that, from an astronaut’s perspective?

The bigger the better. And the other thing to think about is—what do you do with the window? Take pictures. The ability to take photos out a window is important—the quality of the window, which direction it points. You know, it’s not great if it’s just pointing up in space all the time and you never see the Earth.

You’re also in charge of the astronaut training program at Vast. Tell me what that program looks like, because in some cases you’ll have private citizens who are paying for their trip that have no experience whatsoever.

A typical training flow for two weeks on our space station is extended out to about an 11-month period with gaps in between each of the training weeks. And so if you were to press that down together, it probably represents about three to four months of day-to-day training.

I would say half of it’s devoted to learning how to fly on the SpaceX Dragon, because that’s our transportation, and the greatest risk for anybody flying is on launch and landing. We want people to understand how to operate in that spacecraft, and that component is designed by SpaceX. They have their own training plans.

What we do is kind of piggyback on those weeks. If a crew shows up in California to train at SpaceX, we’ll grab them that same week and say, “Come down to our facility. We will train you to operate inside our spacecraft.” Much of that is focused on emergency response. We want the crew to be able to keep themselves safe. In case anything happens on the vehicle that requires them to depart, to get back in the SpaceX Dragon and leave, we want to make sure that they understand all of the steps required.

Another part is day-to-day living, like—how do you eat? How do you sleep, how do you use the bathroom? Those are really important things. How do you download the pictures after you take them? How do you access your science payloads that are in our payload racks that provide data and telemetry for the research you’re doing?

We want to practice every one of those things multiple times, including just taking care of yourself, before you go to space so that when you get there, you’ve built a lot of that into your muscle memory, and you can just do the things you need to do instead of every day being like a really steep learning curve.

Strawberries and other perishable foods are freeze-dried by the Vast Food Systems team to prepare them for missions.

Do you have a facility where you’ll take people through some of these motions? Or a virtual simulation of some kind?

We have built a training mock-up, an identical vehicle to what people will live in in space. But it’s not in a zero-gravity environment. The only way to get any similar training is to fly on what we call a zero-g airplane, which does parabolas in space—it climbs up and then falls toward the Earth. Its nickname is the vomit comet.

But otherwise, there’s really no way to train for microgravity. You just have to watch videos and talk about it a lot, and try to prepare people mentally for what that’s going to be like. You can also train underwater, but that’s more related to spacewalking, and it’s much more advanced.

How do you expect people will spend their time in the station?

If history is any indication, they will be quite busy and probably oversubscribed. Their time will be spent basically caring for themselves, and trying to execute their experiments, and looking out the window. Those are the three big categories of what you’re going to do in space. And public relation activities like outreach back to Earth, to schools or hospitals or corporations.

This new era means that many more everyday people—though mostly wealthy ones at the beginning, because of ticket prices—will have this interesting view of Earth. How do you think the average person will react to that?

A good analogy is to say, how are people reacting to sub-orbital flights? Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic offer suborbital flights, [which are] basically three or four minutes of floating and looking down at the Earth from an altitude that’s about a third or a fifth of the altitude that actual orbital and career astronauts achieve when they circle the planet.

If you look at the reaction of those individuals and what they perceive, it’s amazing, right? It’s like awe and wonder. It’s the same way that astronauts react and talk when we see Earth—and say if more humans could see Earth from space, we’d probably be a little bit better about being humans on Earth.

That’s the hope, is that we create that access and more people can understand what it means to live on this planet. It’s essentially a spacecraft—it’s got its own environmental control system that keeps us alive, and that’s a big deal.

Some people have expressed ambitions for this kind of station to enable humans to become a multiplanetary species. Do you share that ambition for our species? If so, why?

Yeah, I do. I just believe that humans need to have the ability to live off of the planet. I mean, we’re capable of it, and we’re creating that access now. So why wouldn’t we explore space and go further and farther and learn to live in other areas?

Not to say that we should deplete everything here and deplete everything there. But maybe we take some of the burden off of the place that we call home. I think there’s a lot of reasons to live and work in space and off our own planet.

There’s not really a backup plan for no Earth. We know that there are risks from the space around us—dinosaurs fell prey to space hazards. We should be aware of those and work harder to extend our capabilities and create some backup plans.

            <h2>AI is old news. Generative AI is the future.</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is well known, often evoking futuristic movies like Robocop, Terminator and The Matrix. Yet what many don’t realize is that AI has been part of our lives for decades.

When you finish watching a movie on a streaming platform and instantly see recommendations for similar content, that’s AI. When you’re shopping online and an entire page of suggested products appears, that’s AI. Even the digital ads you see are powered by machine-learning algorithms designed to optimize engagement, clicks, and conversions.

Companies have relied on AI rule-based automation, routines, and machine-learning algorithms for years to power their systems and business processes.

So when you hear conversations about the “urgent need to start using AI,” pause for a moment. AI itself isn’t new, the real transformation we’re witnessing comes from Generative AI, a newer branch of deep learning, which itself is a subset of machine learning.

Artificial Intelligence broadly covers machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Machine Learning trains systems to learn from data. Deep Learning uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize complex patterns. Generative AI goes one step further. It doesn’t just analyze data or perform tasks, it creates new content: text, images, code, music, and more.

I was among the early adopters of ChatGPT, just a few months after its public launch in late 2022. It was a defining moment in the history of technology, the first time we could produce analyses, insights, and even complete outputs simply by typing natural-language prompts, without programming or complex tools.

I knew immediately that this would change the world. However, this accessibility has created a double-edged sword. Today, the digital landscape is flooded with “AI experts,” unverified tutorials, and get-rich-quick schemes that often promote the misuse of these tools.

There is a vast amount of misinformation circulating, ranging from overhyped capabilities to fundamental misunderstandings of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process truth and data.

To move beyond the noise, it’s important to seek out education from rigorous, academically backed sources rather than social media trends. The goal when using Generative AI tools shouldn’t be just to generate text, but to understand the capabilities and limitations well enough to apply it securely.

I was in university when the Internet first became commercialized. My first job, in 1996, was selling Internet access to individuals and companies. I witnessed firsthand the anxiety, resistance, and eventual transformation that followed. Yes, the Internet eliminated certain jobs, but it created far more, and often better ones.

Generative AI is bringing a similar paradigm shift today. The key is not to fear it but to learn it, to develop the literacy and critical understanding to use it responsibly. A sentiment often shared among industry leaders during my Generative AI research has stayed with me ever since: “AI will not steal your job; a human using AI will.”

That sentence should be a constant reminder for everyone: life is an ongoing evolution. Technologies disrupt, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge. So the next time you hear someone say, “We need to get into AI,” ask, “Which AI?”

Traditional AI analyzes what already exists, and chances are, you and your company are already using it. Generative AI creates what’s next. This distinction matters. If you treat Generative AI like a search engine or a calculator, you miss its true potential. If you treat it as an absolute source of truth, you risk misuse.

That is why deep literacy is essential. Understanding the specific capabilities of these tools is an act of digital responsibility. By educating ourselves, grounding our knowledge in fact, and embracing change with intention, we prepare to lead this next technological era, not be replaced by it.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is one of the most concerning questions for sales teams at the beginning of 2026: are tech giants killing cold outreach? The answer is that we do not know yet, but here is a perspective from someone working in sales.

Apple and Google have recently introduced two features that show a clear tendency toward the decline of cold outreach.

Apple’s new feature, “Ask Reason for Calling,” is a game changer. It effectively turns cold calling into another form of messaging. No more dynamism, no element of surprise, no offhandedness. Human touch is at the core of sales, but how can that element still exist if interaction is reduced to reading a few short phrases?

The magic of cold calling was always the surprise factor. No expectations for the person answering, no prior knowledge of who is calling or what the subject is, and no immediate cues such as where the caller is from, their accent, or how they pitch.

Does this feature mean that all the books and courses salespeople take to understand psychology, master tone, and capture attention are becoming worthless?

Google has announced a new AI inbox tool that offers personalized summaries of received emails and to-do items. What does this mean? As soon as a decision-maker notices that you are trying to sell something out of the blue, your email may be ignored, deleted, or your sequence may receive the old-fashioned “unsubscribe.”

This feature is not surprising, as Google has been tightening regulations around bulk and cold emails for some time. However, these measures have pushed salespeople toward increasingly extreme tactics, redefining what “off the wall” really means.

At this point, B2B email, Gmail, and LinkedIn are starting to resemble Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp. Less focus, less quality content, less valuable information, and more distraction.

While many people, especially decision-makers, blame salespeople for damaging the business landscape, particularly in terms of trust and distraction, and while endless tirades against cold calling and cold emailing continue on LinkedIn, sales and outreach remain fundamental to building a company.

All of us have something valuable to say and worth listening to, regardless of our role or the company we belong to. Time is indeed the most valuable resource, but taking a five-minute call or reading a three-minute email is not an eternity. It can offer more value than expected and open new opportunities.

In a world increasingly driven by AI, with clear shifts across all business sectors, human touch remains at the foundation of every company. Networking, meeting new people, and sharing ideas are the pillars of business.

So, are tech giants really killing cold outreach? Time will tell. For now, the answer is no.

            <h2>ChatGPT Health has arrived</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-08</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.
