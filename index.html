            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/heres-why-americas-most-historic-launch-pad-is-getting-yet-another-facelift/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida is accustomed to getting makeovers. It got another one Wednesday with the removal of the Crew Access Arm used by astronauts to board their rides to space.

Construction workers first carved the footprint for the launch pad from the Florida wetlands more than 60 years ago. NASA used the site to launch Saturn V rockets dispatching astronauts to the Moon, then converted the pad for the Space Shuttle program. The last shuttle flight lifted off from Pad 39A in 2011, and the agency leased the site to SpaceX for use as the departure point for the company’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.

SpaceX started launching from Pad 39A in 2017, then installed a new Crew Access Arm on the pad’s tower the following year, replacing the aging shuttle-era arm that connected to the hatches of NASA’s orbiters. SpaceX added the new arm ahead of the first test flight of the company’s human-rated Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2019. Astronauts started using the pathway, suspended more than 200 feet above the pad surface, beginning with the first crew flight on a Dragon spacecraft in 2020.

Now, Pad 39A is undergoing another facelift in preparation for launches of SpaceX’s powerful Starship rocket. Construction of a new launch tower for Starship is well along about 1,000 feet east of the existing tower at Pad 39A, still inside the facility’s circular perimeter. SpaceX aims to launch the first Starship flight from Kennedy Space Center later this year, following a series of flights from the company’s Starbase test site in South Texas.

With the arrival of Starship, SpaceX is suspending Falcon 9 flights from Pad 39A in favor of launches from nearby Pad 40, located a few miles to the south at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, on property leased from the US Space Force. Kiko Dontchev, SpaceX’s vice president of launch, wrote on X in December that the decision will allow teams to “put full focus on Falcon Heavy launches and ramping Starship from the Cape.”

SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, primarily used to launch payloads for the Space Force and NASA, will continue flying from Pad 39A, the only site currently outfitted to accommodate the triple-core rocket. The next Falcon Heavy launch is scheduled for no earlier than April, with no more than a handful of flights per year planned for the rest of the 2020s.

Ground teams installed a Crew Access Arm at Pad 40 ahead of the first crew launch there in 2024. All future Crew Dragon flights will now depart from Pad 40 for the foreseeable future, beginning with the launch of the Crew-12 mission to the International Space Station later this week.

“It’s great to have two launch pads off the Florida coast. For our manifest going forward, we’re planning to launch most of our Falcon 9 launches off of Space Launch Complex 40. That will include all Dragon missions going forward,” said Lee Echerd, a SpaceX senior mission manager for human spaceflight. “That will allow our Cape team to focus at 39A on Falcon Heavy launches and hopefully our first Starship launches later this year.”

Pad 40 has been the primary Falcon 9 launch site for most of the rocket’s history, while Pad 39A provided a location for crew launches and an augmentation to support SpaceX’s growing launch cadence. But there are signs the Falcon 9 launch cadence, which reached 165 missions last year, may be peaking as the company turns its attention to Starship. And SpaceX has steadily reduced the time it takes to reconfigure Pad 40 between launches, cutting the turnaround time to less than 48 hours.

If needed, SpaceX officials said they could reinstall the crew arm for Dragon missions launching from Pad 39A.

Bill Gerstenmaier, SpaceX’s vice president of build and flight reliability, said there’s another pressing reason for removing the crew arm at Pad 39A. The bearings that connect the arm to the launch pad’s tower need repairs.

“To physically get access to those, the arm needs to be removed,” Gerstenmaier said. “Those bearings have to come out and they have to be reinstalled. We’ll do that work at the Kennedy Space Center. And the intent there is, we don’t need to put the arm back up … When we get a call-up for a mission and we have to go fly a mission, if it requires that, we have plenty of time to get the arm back up.”

SpaceX has continued launching Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets from Pad 39A amid the nearby construction work to prepare for Starship flights. “That doesn’t impact our ability to launch from the pad,” Gerstenmaier said.

That could change as SpaceX begins testing and launching Starships from Kennedy Space Center. Starship launch operations may routinely force the closure of Pad 39A to personnel.

“The right thing to do is get those bearings replaced in the environment on the ground, make some upgrades to them, and then we’ll be ready to go and put the arm back up when it’s time to go fly, if we need to go fly,” Gerstenmaier said.</div>

            <h2>Trump orders the military to make agreements with coal power plants</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/trumps-latest-plan-to-revive-coal-power-make-the-military-buy-it/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, a fossil-fuel lobbying group called the Washington Coal Club awarded President Trump a trophy that named him the “Undisputed Champion of Clean, Beautiful Coal.” Trump took advantage of the opportunity to take his latest shot at reviving the fortunes of the US’s most polluting source of electricity: an executive order that would make the military buy it.

Coal is the second most expensive source of power for the US grid, eclipsed by gas, wind, solar, hydro—everything other than nuclear power. It also produces the most pollution, including particulates that damage human lungs, chemicals that contribute to acid rain, and coal ash that contains many toxic metals. It also emits the most carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced. Prior to Trump’s return to office, the US grid had been rapidly moving away from its use, including during his first term.

Despite the long-standing Republican claims to support free markets, the second Trump administration has determined that the only way to keep coal viable is direct government intervention. Its initial attempts involved declaring an energy emergency and then using that to justify forcing coal plants slated for closure to continue operations. The emergency declaration relied on what appears to be a tenuous interpretation of the Federal Power Act, and the administration was already facing a lawsuit challenging these actions.

Today’s executive order takes a different route to propping up coal: artificially inflating demand. “The Secretary of War, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy,” the order reads, “shall seek to procure power from the United States coal generation fleet by approving long-term Power Purchase Agreements, or entering into any similar contractual agreements, with coal-fired energy production facilities to serve Department of War installations or other mission-critical facilities.”

The justification for this seems to come from an alternate reality with little relationship to the US grid. “It’s going to be less expensive and actually much more effective than what we have been using for many, many years,” Trump said at the event. “And again, with the environmental progress that’s been made on coal, it’s going to be just as clean.” None of that is true.

The executive order instead seeks to highlight coal’s supposed ability to produce a constant power output, touting the “proven reliability of our coal-fired generation fleet in providing continuous, on-demand baseload power.” This seemingly ignores Texas’ recent experience, in which coal plants contributed significantly to the collapse of the state grid, having gone offline for a wide range of reasons.

The Trump administration, however, has rarely let spurious justifications stand in the way of its preferred policy actions. The key action here is likely to be locking the military into long-term contracts that would persist beyond the end of Trump’s term in 2029.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/el-paso-airport-closed-after-military-used-new-anti-drone-laser-to-zap-party-balloon/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday night, the Federal Aviation Administration closed airspace up to 18,000 feet above the El Paso International Airport in Texas, saying the restrictions would be in place for 10 days. Then, less than 10 hours later, the federal agency reopened the airspace, allowing planes to land and take off at the busy airport.

About an hour after lifting the restrictions, US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, whose responsibilities include overseeing the FAA, explained the unexpected closure by saying, “The FAA and DOW acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.” (The Trump Administration refers to the Department of Defense as the Department of War, or DOW, although its legal name remains the former.)

Not everyone agrees with Duffy’s account.

Based upon reporting from The New York Times and other publications, the military has been developing high-energy lasers to bring down drones. The FAA and US military officials had been discussing tests of the new weapon from the nearby Fort Bliss Army base. However, the FAA had not resolved all of its concerns about airplane safety from the tests.

Despite these apparently lingering concerns from the FAA, the military went ahead with a test earlier this week against what was thought to be a drone. The object was a party balloon.

That is not to make light of drone incursions. This is a real issue along the US border with Mexico, where cartels increasingly fly drones for surveillance. They are particularly useful for pinpointing the location of US Border Patrol agents to assist the cartel in smuggling non-citizens across the border into the United States.

One of the many lessons from the war in Ukraine, which has rapidly pushed forward drone technology in contested environments, is that it is not practical to shoot down drones with conventional missiles. So it is understandable that the US military is looking at alternatives. This all culminated in some sort of snafu between the FAA and military officials regarding coordination with this week’s test.

Whether it was genuine concern about air travelers, a show of force, a fit of pique, or something else, the FAA decided on Tuesday evening to take the extraordinary step of abruptly closing an airport that serves more than 3 million passengers a month. The proposed 10-day closure of the airport was remarkably long.

Moreover, this action was taken without consulting local or state officials in Texas—who are understandably outraged—or reportedly even the White House.

“I want to be very, very clear that this should’ve never happened,” El Paso Mayor Renard Johnson said during a news conference on Wednesday. “That failure to communicate is unacceptable.”</div>

            <h2>Once-hobbled Lumma Stealer is back with lures that are hard to resist</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/once-hobbled-lumma-stealer-is-back-with-lures-that-are-hard-to-resist/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last May, law enforcement authorities around the world scored a key win when they hobbled the infrastructure of Lumma, an infostealer that infected nearly 395,000 Windows computers over just a two-month span leading up to the international operation. Researchers said Wednesday that Lumma is once again “back at scale” in hard-to-detect attacks that pilfer credentials and sensitive files.

Lumma, also known as Lumma Stealer, first appeared in Russian-speaking cybercrime forums in 2022. Its cloud-based malware-as-a-service model provided a sprawling infrastructure of domains for hosting lure sites offering free cracked software, games, and pirated movies, as well as command-and-control channels and everything else a threat actor needed to run their infostealing enterprise. Within a year, Lumma was selling for as much as $2,500 for premium versions. By the spring of 2024, the FBI counted more than 21,000 listings on crime forums. Last year, Microsoft said Lumma had become the “go-to tool” for multiple crime groups, including Scattered Spider, one of the most prolific groups.

The FBI and an international coalition of its counterparts took action early last year. In May, they said they seized 2,300 domains, command-and-control infrastructure, and crime marketplaces that had enabled the infostealer to thrive. Recently, however, the malware has made a comeback, allowing it to infect a significant number of machines again.

“LummaStealer is back at scale, despite a major 2025 law-enforcement takedown that disrupted thousands of its command-and-control domains,” researchers from security firm Bitdefender wrote. “The operation has rapidly rebuilt its infrastructure and continues to spread worldwide.”

As with Lumma before, the recent surge leans heavily on “ClickFix,” a form of social engineering lure that’s proving to be vexingly effective in causing end users to infect their own machines. Typically, these types of bait come in the form of fake CAPTCHAs that—rather requiring users to click a box or identify objects or letters in a jumbled image—instruct them to copy text and paste it into an interface, a process that takes just seconds. The text comes in the form of malicious commands provided by the fake CAPTCHA. The interface is the Windows terminal. Targets who comply then install loader malware, which in turn installs Lumma.

A core part of the resurgence is the use of CastleLoader, a separate piece of malware that’s installed initially. It runs solely in memory, making it much harder to detect than malware that resides on a hard drive. Its code is heavily obfuscated, making it hard to spot its malice even when malware scanners can see it. CastleLoader also provides a flexible and full-featured command-and-control communication mechanism that users can customize to meet their specific needs.

CastleLoader shares some of Lumma’s recently rebuilt infrastructure, an indication that the operators are working together or at least coordinating their activities. In other cases, Lumma relies on legitimate infrastructure—mostly from the content delivery networks Steam Workshop and Discord shared files—to be installed. The use of trusted platforms helps lower targets’ suspicions. In either case, once the loader is executed, it surreptitiously burrows into the infected machine and, after lowering defenses, installs its second payload: Lumma.

People have grown so accustomed to hard-to-solve CAPTCHAs that they think little when instructed to copy website-provided text, click the Win-R keys, and then choose paste. Once this simple action is performed, Lumma has free rein over a host of sensitive files stored on infected machines. Bitdefender said the data includes:

“The effectiveness of ClickFix lies in its abuse of procedural trust rather than technical vulnerabilities,” Bitdefender said. “The instructions resemble troubleshooting steps or verification workarounds that users may have encountered previously. As a result, victims often fail to recognize that they are manually executing arbitrary code on their own system.”

While Lumma is targeting only Windows users, other malware campaigns have used the same technique to infect macOS machines since at least last June. More recent ClickFix attacks on macOS users have continued into this year.

The best defense against ClickFix is to steer clear of sites offering free stuff. Windows and macOS provide a means to require a password before the command terminals can be opened. People with technical skills who administer machines on behalf of less experienced users may want to consider using this latter defense as well.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On February 1, Robert Tinney, the illustrator whose airbrushed cover paintings defined the look and feel of pioneering computer magazine Byte for over a decade, died at age 78 in Baker, Louisiana, according to a memorial posted on his official website.

As the primary cover artist for Byte from 1975 to the late 1980s, Tinney became one of the first illustrators to give the abstract world of personal computing a coherent visual language, translating topics like artificial intelligence, networking, and programming into vivid, surrealist-influenced paintings that a generation of computer enthusiasts grew up with.

Tinney went on to paint more than 80 covers for Byte, working almost entirely in airbrushed Designers Gouache, a medium he chose for its opaque, intense colors and smooth finish. He said the process of creating each cover typically took about a week of painting once a design was approved, following phone conversations with editors about each issue’s theme. He cited René Magritte and M.C. Escher as two of his favorite artists, and fans often noticed their influence in his work.

Born on November 22, 1947, in Penn Yan, New York, Tinney moved with his family to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as a child. He studied illustration and graphic design at Louisiana Tech University, and after a tour of service during the Vietnam War, he began his career as a commercial artist in Houston.

His connection to Byte came through a chance meeting with Carl Helmers, who would later found the magazine. In a 2006 interview I conducted with Tinney for my blog, Vintage Computing and Gaming, he recalled how the relationship began: “One day the phone rang in my Houston apartment and it was Carl wanting to know if I would be interested in painting covers for Byte.” His first cover appeared on the December 1975 issue, just three months after the magazine launched.

Over time, his covers became so popular that he created limited-edition signed prints that he sold on his website for decades. “A friend suggested once that I should select the best covers and reproduce them as signed prints,” he said in 2006. “Byte was gracious enough to let me advertise the prints when they could fit in an ad (it did get bumped occasionally), and the prints were very popular in the Byte booth at the big computer shows, two or three of which my wife, Susan, and I attended per year. When an edition sold out, I then put the design on a T-shirt.”

Byte stopped commissioning Tinney’s cover art around 1987, opting for product photographs as competition in the computer magazine market intensified. His final cover was for the magazine’s 15th Anniversary issue in September 1990.

What made Tinney’s work distinctive was the fact that he was not a technical person. He had no engineering background and said in the 2006 interview that he always felt “a little uneasy” around Byte’s editors because he didn’t speak their technical language. But he saw that as a strength. “I’ve always thought that my interpretation of computer issues with non-technical visual metaphors was what gave my illustrations their distinctive character,” he told me. “So maybe that was a case of making lemonade out of lemons.”

That approach produced images that communicated instantly: a train running on a printed circuit board for an issue about computer engineering, a tiny computer wristwatch, or robots hatching from eggs. His 1981 Smalltalk cover featuring a colorful hot air balloon, according to his website, became a widely recognized symbol of object-oriented programming.

After leaving Byte, Tinney created illustrations for electronics companies, including JDR Microdevices and Jameco Electronics, and created cover art for Borland’s Turbo Prolog and Turbo Basic software. He eventually transitioned to oil portraits and adopted Photoshop for commercial work. “Anything I can do with gouache and an airbrush, I can do about three times better with Photoshop,” he told me, “plus I don’t have to breathe the fumes!”

Tinney is survived by his wife of 48 years, Susan, and their three children, nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. A celebration of his life will be held in May 2026.

In his later years, Tinney grew philosophical about the future of illustration as a profession, noting that stock image databases had changed the economics of the field. But he remained upbeat about the value of artistic talent, comparing it in that 2006 interview to the skill of public speaking: “It’s a nice talent to have, but it isn’t easy to find someone who’ll pay you just to do it. You need to combine that basic talent with another skill to really have a marketable service.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A little more than two months ago, a Rocket Lab employee called the Stennis Space Center Fire Department from the nearby A3 test stand. There was a grass fire where Archimedes engines undergo testing. Could they please send personnel over?

According to the fire station’s November 30 dispatcher log, the employee said, “The fire started during a test when an anomaly caused an electrical box to catch fire.”

Satellite imagery from before and after the anomaly appears to show that the roof had been blown off the left test cell, one of two at the test stand at the historic NASA facility in southern Mississippi. One person with knowledge of the anomaly said, “The characterization of this as an electrical fire doesn’t reflect what actually occurred. This was a catastrophic engine explosion that resulted in significant infrastructure damage.”

According to two sources, this is one of at least two Archimedes engine tests that have failed in the past three months.

The engine test anomalies come at a critical time for Rocket Lab, as it is attempting to finalize development of a flight version of the Archimedes engine, which burns liquid oxygen and methane and has a sea-level thrust of 165,000 pounds. Nine of these engines will power the company’s much-anticipated Neutron rocket, which is aiming for a debut launch later this year.

In response to a query from Ars about the engine test anomalies, Rocket Lab Chief Executive Officer Pete Beck downplayed concerns.

“Eric, you are trying to make a story out of nothing,” Beck said. “We test to the limits, that’s part of developing a successful rocket. We often put the engine into very off nominal states to find the limits and sometimes they let go, this is normal and how you ensure rockets don’t fail in flight.”

Rocket companies do test engines to the point of failure. These tests often occur out of public view on private or government property. However, when NASASpaceflight installed cameras outside SpaceX’s McGregor engine test facilities in Texas, it became clear that rocket engines, such as the company’s new Raptor engine, are pushed to failure not infrequently. What is not clear is how often this failure is intentional.

Beck said Rocket Lab is presently pushing the Archimedes engine to find its failure modes and performance in edge cases.

“Right now we are in the part of the program where we are doing very nasty things to the engine like backing right off the suction pressure, inducing cavitation and exploring outside the run box,” he said. “These things can often lead to engines letting go. We have two test cells so we can do these types of tests and not interrupt our test cadence or production flow, hence there is zero impact to schedule, in fact 48 hours later we were running engines again.”

Beck has previously said that it is Rocket Lab’s goal to identify failures during component-level testing so that when Neutron launches, it has a high chance of reaching orbit on its first go.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the Federal Aviation Administration announced it was shutting down El Paso Airport this morning, social media lit up with speculation.

Had freedom-hating terrorists planted anti-aircraft weapons in the desert? Was the government covering up an early-stage zombie apocalypse with El Paso as ground zero? Or had the Trump administration perhaps started firing high-energy laser weapons into the sky without bothering to tell anyone?

The answer, impossibly, seems to be door number three.

According to CBS News, the bizarre airspace closure came under orders from FAA administrator Bryan Bedford. Apparently, Bedford made the call after learning that the Pentagon planned to unleash high-energy, counter-drone laser weapons at Fort Bliss, situated right next to El Paso International Airport.

But wait, there’s more. Separately, Fox News reported that military personnel had shot down a rogue party balloon — like you’d see at a child’s birthday party — near El Paso, after misidentifying it as a foreign drone. Whether this was done using the Pentagon’s mega-laser is unclear at the moment, but it’d be a wild coincidence if this wasn’t the case.

The airspace closure occurred without alerting White House, Pentagon or Homeland Security officials, sources told CBS. Originally, the closure was said to last 10 days, citing “special security reasons.” The FAA’s original notice warned that the “government may use deadly force” against planes if officials decided “the aircraft poses an imminent security threat.”

In Bedford’s defense, CNN reports the military laser weapon deployment came nine days before a February 20th meeting to review the system’s potential impacts on commercial aviation.

Again, it isn’t clear if the Pentagon went ahead and deployed the laser system before officials could meet. That said, CNN‘s sources said the Defense Department was seeking to use the system in El Paso before such a sit-down could take place.

Further muddying the waters are the Trump administration’s claims that the Pentagon had taken action to disable a vague “cartel drone incursion” right before the airspace shutdown. (We have yet to see any evidence that that’s the case.)

So to recap: the FAA and the Pentagon appear to be in such poor communication that experimental weaponry by the latter is shutting down civilian flights by the former — and party balloons are caught in the crossfire. Welcome to 2026.

            <h2>It Seems Almost Statistically Impossible That This Polymarket Bettor Didn’t Profit Off Inside Knowledge About the Super Bowl Half Time Show</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this year, an anonymous bettor on Polymarket perfectly predicted the US invasion of Venezuela mere hours before over 150 US aircraft rocked the country’s capital of Caracas, netting them over $400,000.

The incident reignited a heated debate over insider trading on prediction market platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi. While the act is strictly forbidden on Wall Street, prediction markets are currently operating in a regulatory vacuum, allowing those who enjoy insider status to score big — while everyone else is left to pick up the bill.

And the evidence that prediction markets are rife with insider traders continues to grow. As one eagle-eyed Reddit user noticed, an anonymous day-old Polymarket account correctly guessed 17 out of around 20 bets about Sunday’s Super Bowl half-time show.

Statistically speaking, that’s an exceedingly unlikely success rate, strongly suggesting the account had some kind of insider knowledge of what would happen during Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny’s performance.

The account correctly predicted that popstars Lady Gaga, Cardi B, and Ricky Martin would perform at the show. The account also correctly predicted that rappers Travis Scott and Drake, as well as singer Post Malone, would not perform.

The anonymous user placed bets starting February 6, two days before the event took place. All told, they made about $17,000 in profit.

“If you bet, you’re a rube for these people,” one Reddit user commented. “Literally spending money to give it over to insiders and cheats.”

Polymarket has yet to publicly comment on the matter and didn’t respond to the Wall Street Journal‘s request for comment.

Ironically, gambling was a major focus during Sunday’s sporting event. Companies spent untold sums to air commercials for betting services like DraftKings.

Trading volumes on prediction markets hit record highs during the Super Bowl, with Kalshi reporting over half a billion dollars in trading tied to the final outcome of the game. Polymarket’s equivalent bet saw trading volumes hit over $55 million.

Given ongoing regulatory uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether the two platforms will be able to meaningfully address insider trading, a subject that demonstrably continues to be a major problem.

While a knowledgeable few, including professional gamblers, get away with major profits, plenty of other users are incurring significant losses. As Business Insider points out, for each “winner” on the platform, there’s a “loser” as well, since users are betting against each other — not against a house, like in a traditional casino.

The latter will need to remain confident that the setup isn’t rigged against them for the ruse to work.

“Those other people are going to, on average, make losses if they know less about the subject matter than the experts,” professor of economics and prediction markets expert Eric Zitzewitz told BI. “So you need them to be willing to trade despite that.”

“You need them to be overconfident about how much they know, or you need them to be participating for some other reason,” he added.

Prediction market regulations could take years before they materialize — if ever. The White House has made it clear it supports the industry, with president Donald Trump’s Trump Media and Technology Group announcing in October that it would enter the prediction markets business.

In the meantime, lawmakers are desperately warning that gambling on the platforms comes with some inherent risks.

“New Yorkers need to know the significant risks with unregulated prediction markets,” New York Attorney General Letitia James warned in a statement six days ahead of the Super Bowl. “It’s crystal clear: so-called prediction markets do not have the same consumer protections as regulated platforms. I urge all New Yorkers to be cautious of these platforms to protect their money.”

            <h2>Ring Boasts About Power to Surveil Entire Neighborhoods</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-11</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Ring’s latest commercial came on over a Super Bowl ad break, it offered a service that seems like a no-brainer. Called “Search Party,” it’s a new function that lets Ring devices help canvas the neighborhood through its vast network of cameras to find lost pets.

“One post of a dog’s photo in the Ring app starts outdoor cameras looking for a match to help families find lost dogs,” the company’s Super Bowl ad enthuses.

Yet beneath all that is a startling revelation: that Ring doorbells can now surveil living beings throughout every neighborhood the devices might be found.

For those unfamiliar, Ring is Amazon’s doorbell camera company — those ubiquitous gadgets mounted on front porches that record everyone who walks by.

The devices have been the target of widespread privacy criticisms for years at this point. However, their latest data sharing agreement with surveillance company Flock has many activists up in arms, as that startup has no qualms with working closely with federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

With those kind of optics swirling around, the decision to highlight new dog-finding capabilities is a clever PR move for Ring. Who would say no to reuniting lost puppies with their families?

At the same time, the new Search Party function represents a troubling development. Where the company’s Fire Watch system is said to index neighborhood devices to watch for signs of fire emergencies, the Search Party function means the company is capable of tracking living things as well. Who decides when and how to deploy that power is another story — but it’s obvious that Ring has opened Pandora’s box.

As MS Now columnist Hayes Brown observed: “there’s no world in which finding lost dogs is the final end-use for this technology.”

“Ring’s Search Party feature does what neighbors have done for generations — help reunite lost dogs with their families — just with better technology,” a Ring spokesperson told us in a statement. “We built the feature with strong privacy protections from the start and camera owners choose on a case-by-case basis whether they want to share videos with a pet owner to support a reunion. Since launch, Search Party has helped bring home more than a dog a day.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mainstream cryptocurrency Bitcoin plummeted earlier this month, crashing down to a sliver over $60,000 — which is well under half of its all-time high value it reached just over four months ago.

It was a bloodbath that was followed by a short moment of reprieve over the weekend, when it rebounded above the $70,000 mark once more.

But don’t call it a comeback. As CNBC reports, the bounce has faded once again, with Bitcoin slipping back down to $66,000 by midday on Wednesday, down 47 percent over its October record high.

Critics watched in glee as the cryptocurrency kept tumbling.

“I’m going to enjoy watching Bitcoin crash,” former White House staffer Claude Taylor tweeted.

“Not going to lie,” one X user tweeted. “Buying Bitcoin is painful right now. Feels like I’m lighting my money on fire.”

Bitcoin’s woes earlier this month resulted from a surge in liquidations, prompting other traders to follow suit. Uncertainty over president Donald Trump’s pick for Federal Reserve chair also had investors uneasy, with many choosing to bow out of riskier bets like crypto.

The US government reported earlier today that 130,000 jobs were added to the economy in January alone, double the economic forecasts, leading many traders to quickly rein in any expectations of an imminent interest rate cut. However, whether any rate cuts would’ve allowed Bitcoin to surge in the first place remains debatable, as Coindesk points out. For one, the Labor Department also revealed that it had made massive cuts to its 20245-2025 numbers, greatly undermining its latest announcement.

Large selloffs of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which allow investors to get in on Bitcoin bets indirectly through traditional brokerage accounts, added to the pressure.

All eyes are on Bitcoin. Historically, it’s often bounced back after a “halving” event, a pre-scheduled occasion which sees Bitcoin mining rewards being halved, and reaching new all-time highs after. It’s a four-year cycle that most recently restarted following a halving in April 2024.

But whether that will be the case following the latest crash has turned into a heated debate as of late, with some speculating that the “four-year cycle” is “dead,” while crypto bulls claim it’s “intact.”

“2026 I expect to be a bear leg to the four-year cycle,” Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg told CNBC. “We have experienced several four-year cycles since bitcoin has launched and this is no different than any other.”

Others have been far more pessimistic in their outlook, predicting Bitcoin could plummet to as low as $30,000, or even $0.

“This week has shown us that the supply of ‘greater fools’ that bitcoin relies on is drying up,” Financial Times columnist and Bitcoin critic Jemima Kelly argued in a recent piece. “The fairy tales that have been keeping crypto afloat are turning out to be just that. People are beginning to wake up to the fact that there is no floor in the value of something based on nothing more than thin air.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Elon Musk tries to sweep his Mars ambitions under the rug like an embarrassing teenage phase, he’s now shifting focus to the Moon — with no less eye-brow raising ideas.

According to new reporting from the New York Times, Musk told employees at xAI — his AI company recently acquired by SpaceX — that it needs to construct a factory on the Moon to churn out AI satellites. And to launch the satellites into space, he says, it needs to build an enormous electromagnetic catapult.

Sci-fi readers already know where this is going: Musk is thinking about building a mass driver, which is essentially a coilgun for launching payloads instead of deadly projectiles. Paired with the lunar facility, Musk views it as a necessary step in building out computing power for his AI empire, which must not be bound by the finitude of terrestrial real estate.

“You have to go to the Moon,” Musk said at an all-hands meeting, per the NYT.  “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about, but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen,”

The outpouring of lunar enthusiasm from Musk comes after his aerospace company SpaceX bought xAI ahead of what is anticipated to be a historic IPO.

In an announcement about the acquisition stuffed with more sci-fi concepts, Musk argued that space-based AI was the “only way to scale” the technology. He spoke of putting data centers in the Earth’s orbit, where in theory they’d have access to practically unlimited amounts of solar energy. Along with orbital data centers, he imagines populating the orbit with a vast constellation of AI satellites, something he likened to building a “sentient sun.”

The Moon may sound like a logical destination for a space company, but it actually represents an incredible about-face for Musk and SpaceX. Musk has spent years denigrating lunar missions, viewing them as a waste of time and a “distraction” from his ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars. His mantra has always been to “make life multiplanetary,” and “extend consciousness to the stars.” He has frequently provided optimistic timelines for achieving this, including promising in 2017 that the company’s first Mars mission would launch in 2022, and its first astronauts would arrive by 2025. He has consistently reiterated this mission, and presented SpaceX employees with a roadmap to reaching the Red Planet.

Of course, Musk insists he’s not abandoning Mars. In the Tuesday meeting, he described the Moon as a stepping stone to Mars. First, he wants to build “a self-sustaining city on the Moon,” then travel to Mars — and then, naturally, search the rest of the galaxy for aliens.

He provided a timeline for his dueling Moon-Mars ambitions in a recent tweet justifying the pivot.

“SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” Musk explained. “That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When you start a “bounty” board meant for AI agents during one of the worst job markets since the great recession, don’t be surprised when it becomes infested with humans.

Last week, an AI entrepreneur made a splash when he introduced a bizarre job portal to the world. Called RentAHuman, the platform is meant to connect autonomous AI agents to real people in order to complete various tasks. As such, the site is split between two sections: one for humans to register their real-world skills, and another where AI bots post tasks on a bounty board that humans can sign up for, à la carte.

Though the bounty board is meant for AI agents — stuff like “My AI Agent Wants a Video of Your Hand” for $10, to give an example — it only took a week for it to become overrun with human beings seeking remote work.

“I am available for remotly [sic] tasks,” one user from Pakistan advertised. “Hello, I am interested in the Email Mailing remote work. Available daily, flexible hours. I have basic computer skills and experience using Gmail.”

“Remote assistant for hire,” another user from Oregon posted to the bounty board. Many kept it simple: “I do anything,” one poster advertised.

Others were more specific, offering to do highly specialized freelance work for anyone who’ll pay. “Swiss Architect available — building permits, 3D scanning, ArchiCAD,” wrote one user from La Tour-de-Peliz, Switzerland.

One user from Miami offered to do “Mix mastering” for $30 an hour on musical recordings — “rap, pop, trap, emo rap, cloud rap, and US rap” included. “I will mix your voice and master your sound,” the advert reads.

Others are using the platform as an open forum to complain about features or changes they’d like to see. One bounty titled “update website” implores the admin to “PLEASE update the site so you don’t have tk [sic] scroll through each page of bounties one by one after reading a bounty.”

“If I’m on page 7, click and read a bounty, no matter what action I take I have to scroll through each individual page again to get back to page 7,” the human user complained, ironically cluttering the feed for other humans browsing the site.

Whether this grim humiliation ritual actually lands anyone a job remains to be seen. As of last Wednesday, the site boasted some 73,000 human users with only a few dozen bounties. Nearly a week later, the site claims to have some 377,000 users jockeying for over 11,000 bounties.

Either way, it’s a perfect snapshot of the extremes to which job-seekers are willing to go to eke out any kind of living.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, xAI took the rare step of publishing a full 45-minute all-hands meeting video on X, making it publicly accessible. Details of the Tuesday night meeting were previously reported by The New York Times, which may have influenced xAI’s decision to post the video online.

The full video reveals significant new details about Musk’s plans for the AI lab, including its product roadmap and its ongoing ties to the X platform.

Since xAI was formed just 30 months ago, the small and talented team has made remarkable progress.The future has never looked more exciting! pic.twitter.com/QZ73H2mpBj

The most immediate revelation concerned a string of departing employees, which Musk described as layoffs resulting from a changing organizational structure at the company. While reorganizations are common, the breadth of the departures has caused significant confusion, particularly as it has meant the loss of a significant portion of the founding team.

“As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve,” Musk said on X. “This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors.”

The new organizational system splits xAI into four primary teams: one focused on the Grok chatbot (including voice), another for the app’s coding system, another for the Imagine video generator, and finally a team focused on the Macrohard project, which spans from simple computer use simulation to modeling entire corporations.

“[Macrohard] is able to do anything on a computer that a computer is able to do,” Toby Pohlen, who will lead the project under the new organizational structure, told his colleagues. “There should be rocket engines fully designed by AI.”

The all-hands also featured claims about new usage and revenue figures for xAI and X. Nikita Bier, X’s head of product, said X had “just crossed” $1 billion in annual recurring revenue from subscriptions, which he attributed to a marketing push during the holidays.

Additionally, executives said the xAI’s Imagine tool is generating 50 million videos a day, and more than 6 billion images over the past 30 days, according to their internal metrics.

But it’s difficult to separate those figures from the flood of deepfake pornography that overtook X during that same period. The X platform saw engagement skyrocket as AI-generated explicit images became more prevalent, and with an estimated 1.8 million sexualized images generated over just nine days, the image-generation figures likely include substantial amounts of this controversial content.

The most eye-catching part of the presentation came at the end, when Musk reemphasized the importance of space-based data centers despite the technical challenges involved. Musk went still further, envisioning a moon-based factory for AI satellites, including a lunar mass driver — essentially an electromagnetic catapult — to launch them. With such infrastructure, Musk said, one could launch an AI cluster capable of capturing significant portions of the sun’s total energy output or even expanding to other galaxies.

“It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” Musk said, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/ai-inference-startup-modal-labs-in-talks-to-raise-at-2-5b-valuation-sources-say/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Modal Labs, a startup specializing in AI inference infrastructure, is talking to VCs about a new round at a valuation of about $2.5 billion, according to four people with knowledge of the deal. Should the deal close at these terms, the funding round would more than double the company’s valuation of $1.1 billion announced less than five months ago, when it announced an $87 million Series B round.

General Catalyst is in talks to lead the round, the people told TechCrunch. Modal’s annualized revenue run rate (ARR) is approximately $50 million, our sources said. The discussions are early, and terms could still change.

Modal Labs co-founder and CEO Erik Bernhardsson denied that his company was actively fundraising and characterized his recent interactions with VCs as general conversations. General Catalyst did not respond to our requests for comment.

Modal is focused on optimizing inference, the process of running trained AI models to generate answers from user requests. Improving inference efficiency reduces compute costs and cuts down the lag time between a user’s prompt and the AI’s response.

Modal is one of the handful of inference-focused companies attracting intense investor attention now. Last week, its competitor Baseten announced a $300 million raise at a $5 billion valuation, more than doubling the $2.1 billion valuation it reached just months prior in September. Similarly, Fireworks AI, an inference cloud provider, secured $250 million at a $4 billion valuation in October.

In January, the creators of the open source inference project vLLM announced they had transitioned the tool into a VC-backed startup, Inferact, raising $150 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz at an $800 million valuation. Meanwhile, TechCrunch reported that the team behind SGLang has commercialized as RadixArk, which sources told us secured seed funding at a $400 million valuation led by Accel.

Modal was co-founded by CEO Erik Bernhardsson in 2021 after he spent more than 15 years building and leading data teams at companies including Spotify and Better.com, where he was CTO.

The startup counts Lux Capital and Redpoint Ventures among its earlier backers.

            <h2>OpenAI disbands mission alignment team</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/openai-disbands-mission-alignment-team-which-focused-on-safe-and-trustworthy-ai-development/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has disbanded a team that was designed to communicate the company’s mission to the public and to its own employees. At the same time, the team’s former leader has been given a new role as the company’s “chief futurist.”

OpenAI confirmed to TechCrunch that the team’s members have now been assigned to other roles. The news was first reported by Platformer.

The disbanded team in question appears to have been formed in September of 2024. Platformer reports that the team was dedicated to promoting “the company’s stated mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”

An official OpenAI spokesperson described the team thusly: “The Mission Alignment project was a support function to help employees and the public understand our mission and the impact of AI. That work continues throughout the organization.”

In a blog post published Wednesday, Josh Achiam, the former head of OpenAI’s mission alignment team, explained his new role as the company’s chief futurist. “My goal is to support OpenAI’s mission — to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity — by studying how the world will change in response to AI, AGI, and beyond,” Achiam wrote.

Achiam noted that, in his new role, he would be collaborating with Jason Pruet, an OpenAI physicist.

A spokesperson for OpenAI said the rest of the mission alignment team — a group of six or seven people — had subsequently been reassigned to different parts of the company. The spokesperson couldn’t say where exactly the team members had been assigned, but said that they were engaged in similar work in those roles. It was also unclear whether Achiam would have a new team as part of his “futurist” role.

The spokesperson attributed the disbanding of the team to the kinds of routine reorganizations that occur within a fast-moving company.

OpenAI previously had what it called a “superalignment team” — which was formed in 2023 and focused on studying long-term existential threats posed by AI — but that team was disbanded in 2024.

Achiam’s personal website still lists him as head of mission alignment at OpenAI, and describes him as being interested in ensuring that the “long-term future of humanity is good.” His LinkedIn profile shows he had served as head of mission alignment since September 2024.

Correction: This story originally confused mission alignment with another, similarly named team called alignment. It has been corrected and we apologize for the error.

            <div id="article-text">Apple has been promising a new-and-improved, cutting-edge, AI-powered Siri since it first unveiled Apple Intelligence in 2024. Over about a year and a half since then, the release date for this new era of Siri has been continuously pushed back. According to a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, we’ll likely have to wait even longer.

While the new Siri was expected to launch with the upcoming iOS 26.4 update in March, now, the changes are expected to roll out more slowly over time, reportedly postponing some features until the May iOS update, or even until the release of iOS 27 in September. Apparently, Apple ran into trouble when testing the software, requiring the launch date to be pushed back further.

The changes are rumored to make the longtime digital assistant more like the LLM chatbots that have swept the tech world — but instead of opening up a ChatGPT or Claude app on your iPhone or MacBook, you would be able to just talk to Siri, which will be powered by Google Gemini.

We’re starting to feel bad for the Siri product managers. Hang in there, folks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Uber Eats announced a new AI feature, “Cart Assistant,” on Wednesday designed to fill customers’ grocery carts faster and easier. The beta version is now available in the app.​

To use the new chatbot, users search for a grocery store in the Uber Eats app and tap the purple Cart Assistant icon on the store’s page to begin shopping.

Customers can enter a list or upload an image of one, and Cart Assistant will automatically add the necessary items to their basket. This includes photos of handwritten lists or screenshots of recipes and their ingredients. Users can then customize the basket by swapping items for preferred brands or adding more products from the store.​

Uber Eats notes that Cart Assistant uses previous orders to prioritize familiar items — like your usual milk or favorite oatmeal — to make the experience more personalized.​

“Users were telling us they wanted a quicker way to shop, and we know how precious your time is,” Uber CTO Praveen Neppalli Naga said in a statement. “Cart Assistant helps you get from idea to checkout in seconds.”

Cart Assistant could help Uber Eats better compete with other food delivery and grocery apps that are already integrating or developing AI chatbots.​ For example, Instacart launched an AI search tool powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT in 2023 to help customers save time and receive personalized shopping recommendations. DoorDash was also reportedly testing an AI chatbot called DashAI that same year.​

Last year, both Uber Eats and rival DoorDash integrated with ChatGPT to streamline food ordering. With Uber Eats, U.S. users can browse local restaurants and menus in ChatGPT, then complete their purchase in the Uber Eats app. DoorDash’s integration allows users to request meal plans and automatically add all necessary ingredients to their DoorDash cart.

Notably, Bloomberg reported in 2023 that Uber Eats was developing an AI-powered chatbot that would supposedly ask users about their budget and food preferences, and help them place an order.​

Overall, Uber Eats is rapidly investing in AI, including tools for merchants like AI-generated menu descriptions, enhanced food photos, and customer review summaries.

            <h2>The Epstein Emails Show How the Powerful Talk About Race</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/02/epstein-race-science-watson-pinker-chomsky-musk/685965/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In February 2016, after exchanging email pleasantries with the left-wing public intellectual Noam Chomsky and extending an invitation to his private island, Jeffrey Epstein recommended an article. “On a different note, you have encouraged me to look at data, no holds barred,” Epstein wrote before linking to “Race and IQ: Genes That Predict Racial Intelligence Differences” from the Right Stuff, an openly white-supremacist website and a pioneer of the online alt-right. The article argued that different races have differing levels of intelligence and that there is a genetic basis for the disparity.

The exchange was included in the Department of Justice’s latest public release of the Epstein files and is one of the clearest examples of the disgraced financier’s interest in “race science,” the pseudoscientific practice of ascribing racial inequities to genetics. It is a way of thinking that has been refuted on multiple levels. IQ is a complex trait that results from a series of factors—many of them cultural and circumstantial—that are not neatly reduced to a specific gene or set of genes. Even if it weren’t, the consensus among geneticists, biologists, and anthropologists is that race isn’t a biological phenomenon. Race-science proponents tend to ignore all of this, as well as any other relevant context, and use correlations between race and IQ (and also things such as race and criminality) as evidence that racial stereotypes are in fact justified.

None of this mattered to Epstein, who recurrently expressed his interest in race science beyond this 2016 correspondence. The tranche of Epstein files also shows that in 2018, he repeatedly tried to get in contact with Charles Murray, a political scientist whose 1994 book, The Bell Curve, is one of the best-known texts to posit a relationship between intelligence and race. Epstein didn’t specify why he was trying to connect with Murray, but he claimed that they had met previously. (Murray told me over email that he had never received an email from Epstein and that it was possible that they’d met in passing at a conference reception at some point. If this ever happened, though, Murray had no memory of it, he said.)

Promoting contemptible perspectives on race is probably nowhere near the most depraved things Epstein did; he was, after all, a registered sex offender charged with child trafficking. But Epstein’s views are notable given his long-standing influence on some of the most powerful and influential Americans. His conversations from a decade ago provide clues as to how race science was picked out of the boneyard of history and reanimated into a force that’s influencing U.S. politics right now.

Epstein received Murray’s email address from his ideological fellow traveler James Watson, the late Nobel Prize–winning geneticist who was stripped of his titles in 2019 after he doubled down on comments he’d made to a British newspaper in 2007 about how he was “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa” because “all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours—whereas all the testing says not really.” He told the paper that he wished that all races were equal but that “people who have to deal with Black employees find this not true.”

Epstein liked to collect relationships with high-profile academics, but the emails suggest that he may have been drawn to Watson specifically because of his ideology. In his 2016 exchange with Chomsky, Epstein appears to endorse the perspective that improving the world “might require accepting some uncomfortable facts” about race and intelligence. Chomsky, who sustained his association with Epstein even after accusations that the financier had sexually abused children became well known, disagreed with Epstein on race science in their email exchange. (He did not respond to a request for comment.) Epstein references Watson in other emails, and he and Watson appear to have met several times.

The same year that Epstein tried to put Chomsky onto pseudoscientific racism, he was having similar discussions with Joscha Bach, an AI researcher. In one exchange, Bach told Epstein that Black children in the United States “have slower cognitive development” and “are slower at learning high-level concepts.” In another email to Epstein, Bach wrote that “given average brain size difference” between men and women, “the small difference in average IQ is surprising.”

Read: The far right is becoming obsessed with race and IQ

Bach appears to have since changed his mind. In a recent Substack post explaining his emails with Epstein, Bach claimed that he has never said “that people of different races have different cognitive abilities” and wrote that “every ethnic group contains highly capable individuals” and that no one “should be discriminated against because of their ancestry.” Over email, Bach further clarified to me that “the concept of race is not suitable to capture cognitive and behavioral differences between individuals.” He said that “scientific discussion about the heritability of traits can be important for the creation of a more fair and equitable society, it is important to understand the nature and limitations of our minds, but they are very complicated and not my area of research.”

Other names that pop up in Epstein’s emails: He reached out to Steven Pinker, a Harvard professor who has written about research that argues that Ashkenazi Jews are innately intelligent. (Pinker has disavowed Epstein and denied that he ever visited Little Saint James, Epstein’s island. He attended at least two events that Epstein was also present at. “I only had one conversation with him, and found him to be not only odious but intellectually deeply unserious, despite the praise from so many of my colleagues, and his own pretensions,” Pinker told me over email. He also said that he doesn’t believe that there is “good evidence that average racial or ethnic differences have a genetic component.”) Epstein also tried to meet with Richard Dawkins, who has made comments claiming that race is a biological reality; Dawkins did not respond to a request for comment.

In the past several years, race science has gained traction on the right and in parts of Silicon Valley’s elite circles. Elon Musk, for example, has repeatedly replied to the @cremieuxrecueil account, run by Jordan Lasker, an independent researcher who has been credited by a right-wing publication for tracing “the genetic pathways of crime, explaining why poverty is not a good causal explanation.” Musk has also engaged with an account that posted statistics supposedly illustrating the inferiority of Black people. In November, The Guardian reported that perspectives defending race science were embedded in Musk’s Wikipedia competitor, Grokipedia. Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment.

In 2023 and 2024, respectively, Charlie Kirk and Tucker Carlson interviewed Steve Sailer, a prominent race-science proponent. President Trump—who once considered Epstein a close friend and is referenced in many emails—has toyed around with the concept for years. In a November 2024 interview with the right-wing radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump said that some of the migrants coming across the southern border were genetically inferior. “How about allowing people to come to an open border, 13,000 of whom were murderers? Many of them murdered far more than one person, and they’re now happily living in the United States,” Trump told Hewitt, citing an incorrect number. “You know, now a murderer—I believe this—it’s in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now.” When I reached out to the White House, the spokesperson Abigail Jackson told me in an emailed statement that “President Trump is right—dangerous criminal illegal aliens exploited Joe Biden’s open border and flooded our country.”

Meanwhile, Trump’s deportation campaign appears to target people from countries and cultures that he seems to think are inferior. During a Cabinet meeting in December, Trump said of Somalis, “I don’t want them in our country, I’ll be honest with you,” adding that the U.S. will “go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.” He said this while the Department of Homeland Security was targeting Somalis in Minnesota.

Arguing that intelligence and adjacent traits are biologically determined served a clear function for a man like Epstein, who treated women as disposable and subordinate. And it’s equally unsurprising that the powerful people with whom he cultivated relationships might attempt to come up with a natural, objective explanation and rationale for their perch at the top of society.</div>

            <h2>Howard Lutnick’s Epstein Story Doesn’t Make Any Sense</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/02/howard-lutnick-epstein-files-misleading-story/685971/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>

“I have nothing to hide. Absolutely nothing,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told a Senate committee yesterday. Perhaps that’s true—but given his recent history, don’t bet on it.

During a podcast interview this past fall, Lutnick talked about an unsettling encounter he and his wife had with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who used to be his next-door neighbor, in 2005. After Epstein offered them a house tour and showed them his infamous massage table, Lutnick recalled, he was creeped out and left. “My wife and I decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,” he said. “So I was never in the room with him socially, for business, or even philanthropy.”

Only that wasn’t true at all. Documents in the Epstein files released by the Justice Department show repeated, if more cordial than chummy, conversation between the two men, as well as some shared business dealings. That’s okay, you might think—they never hung out socially again. Right? He seemed to confirm that, recently telling The New York Times, “I spent zero time with him.”

Well, about that: Yesterday, testifying before Congress, Lutnick reiterated, “I barely had anything to do with that person.” Then he admitted to having visited Epstein’s private island in 2012.

“I did have lunch with him, as I was on a boat going across on a family vacation,” Lutnick said. “My wife was with me, as were my four children and nannies. I had another couple; they were there as well, with their children. And we had lunch on the island. That is true. For an hour. And we left with all of my children, with my nannies, with my wife.”

Lutnick seems understandably eager to show that he was not involved in sexual misconduct, and as Senator Chris Van Hollen noted, there is no evidence that he was. But he has no answer for his misleading statements about his dealings with Epstein, and his previous lies make it harder to believe him now. So much for having nothing to hide.

The Trump administration has always been tied to the Epstein scandal—the president himself was once a close friend of Epstein’s—but these new details drag his allies still further into the spotlight. Even before his testimony, Lutnick was facing calls to resign from Democrats as well as from renegade Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky. The secretary, whose penchant for putting his foot in his mouth was already well established, seems to have held on to his job this long only because he is personally friendly with Donald Trump and because the president refuses to give his political adversaries satisfaction by firing anyone. (This stands in contrast to many other organizations and institutions that have been eager to create distance from Epstein by separating themselves from individuals who were connected to him.)

But Lutnick isn’t the only top Trump aide to come up in the new tranche of documents. Navy Secretary John Phelan, a reported billionaire Trump donor who was appointed despite lacking any military or naval experience, was listed as a passenger on flights between London and New York on Epstein’s private plane in 2006. (The flights took place before Epstein was first indicted later that year; Phelan has not been accused of any wrongdoing and has not commented on the revelations.)

One reason the Epstein files have created such a stir is that they have revealed the elaborate social and financial ties among so many people in positions of power. It’s not that most or even many of the big names who appear in them were pedophiles or sexual predators, but rather that their dealings with him demonstrate that there’s a wealthy, powerful, globe-trotting club, and the rest of us ain’t in it. Lutnick inadvertently reinforced this image with his mentions of his “nannies,” plural. These glaring markers of privilege are what Senator Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat, was talking about this past weekend when he called the Trump administration “a government of, by, and for the ultrarich. It is the wealthiest Cabinet ever. This is the Epstein class ruling our country.”

The defense that people connected to Epstein—from the billionaire financier Lutnick to the leftist intellectual Noam Chomsky and his wife—have offered is that they didn’t grasp Epstein’s abuses when they socialized with him and were appalled once they did. One problem is that this is sometimes demonstrably false: Lutnick visited the island four years after Epstein’s conviction for sex crimes, and emails show Chomsky offering Epstein public-relations advice after accusations became public.

Another problem is that many of them should have known. You don’t have to take my word for it. Take Trump’s. In 2019, he declared his surprise at the Epstein allegations: “No, I had no idea. I had no idea.” But the Palm Beach police chief at the time recalled that Trump commended him in July 2006, when charges first became public. “Thank goodness you’re stopping him; everyone has known he’s been doing this,” Trump said, as reported by Julie K. Brown of the Miami Herald.

(Trump may have had his suspicions for some time. In 2002, he told New York that Epstein is “a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”)

The Epstein revelations are starting to sink in for members of Congress. “Well, initially, my reaction to all this was, ‘I don’t care. I don’t know what the big deal is.’ But now I see what the big deal is, and it was worth investigating,” Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican, told NewsNation. (One reason Lummis may be willing to say so is that she is retiring, which insulates her from Trump’s wrath.)

These revelations about Trump’s close allies could affect the GOP’s electoral chances if enough voters become aware of them, but at the same time that members of the Trump administration are popping up in the newly released files, coverage in conservative media outlets has dropped significantly, CNN’s Aaron Blake reports. The result is that Democratic voters, who already dislike and distrust the president, are hearing a great deal about Epstein, but Republican ones, who might be swayed, are not. When MAGA pundits such as Dan Bongino talked about a media cover-up of the Epstein scandal, they were onto something—they were just wrong about the media outlets in question.

Here are four new stories from The Atlantic:

AI Is Getting Scary Good at Making Predictions

To live in time is to wonder what will happen next. In every human society, there are people who obsess over the world’s patterns to predict the future. In antiquity, they told kings which stars would appear at nightfall. Today they build the quantitative models that nudge governments into opening spigots of capital. They pick winners on Wall Street. They estimate the likelihood of earthquakes for insurance companies. They tell commodities traders at hedge funds about the next month’s weather.

For years, some elite forecasters have been competing against one another in tournaments where they answer questions about events that will happen—or not—in the coming months or years. The questions span diverse subject matter because they’re meant to measure general forecasting ability, not narrow expertise. Players may be asked whether a coup will occur in an unstable country, or to project the future deforestation rate in some part of the Amazon. They may be asked how many songs from a forthcoming Taylor Swift album will top the streaming charts. The forecaster who makes the most accurate predictions, as early as possible, can earn a cash prize and, perhaps more important, the esteem of the world’s most talented seers.

Explore. The Sundance Film Festival, which once helped turn small movies into blockbusters, is losing its Hollywood pull, Shirley Li writes.

Reflect. Spencer Kornhaber on what happened to the great American protest concert.

            <h2>Scientists Figured Out the Problem With Johnson &amp; Johnson’s COVID Vaccine</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2026/02/covid-vaccines-blood-clotting-answer/685966/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2021, just months after the first COVID vaccines debuted, concern was growing about an exceedingly rare but sometimes deadly outcome of certain shots. Two related vaccines—one from AstraZeneca and the other from Johnson & Johnson—were linked to dangerous blood clotting.

Out of almost 19 million doses of Johnson & Johnson’s version given in the United States during the first two years of the pandemic, at least 60 such cases were identified. Nine of them were fatal. In the United Kingdom, where almost 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca shot were given, 455 cases occurred; 81 people died. In Germany, at least 71 cases were identified, also linked to AstraZeneca. By late spring, use of both the AstraZeneca and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was paused, and ultimately both were pulled from the market. But the mystery surrounding the rare blood clotting caused by these vaccines lingered.

Now researchers believe they have cracked the case. They have hard evidence for how the blood clotting happened, and they believe that their findings could help make similar vaccines even safer. Understanding the blood-clotting problem is important, they say, because vaccines of this type could be essential in protecting people during future pandemics.

The team that initially gave this condition a name—vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, or VITT—included Andreas Greinacher, a blood expert at the University of Greifswald, in Germany. Back in 2021, as the cases of VITT emerged, he and others were unsure of what precipitated them. One theory was that they were caused by the body’s accidental reaction to the type of virus used in both the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines: adenoviruses, which had been engineered to prompt the body to recognize the pandemic coronavirus but were unable to replicate and considered harmless to people. Scientists had noticed that patients with VITT had telltale markers in their blood—antibodies that bind to a chemical signal released by platelets. Maybe a reaction to the adenovirus was causing immune cells to mistakenly go after a blood component and precipitate clotting. An alternative theory was that the body was reacting to a portion of the coronavirus called “spike protein,” which showed up as part of the immunization.

In a study published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, Greinacher and his colleagues show that the first theory was correct: VITT was a response to the adenovirus gone awry. And they discovered a further twist: This immune overreaction happened in people who were genetically prone to it.

In the study, Greinacher and his colleagues looked at the antibodies in stored blood from 21 patients with VITT. Among those antibodies, they found a subset that could glom on to a portion of the adenovirus and to one of the body’s own molecules, PF4, that can influence blood clotting. A person who received one of the adenovirus vaccines but did not have a reaction also had antibodies against that same part of the adenovirus. But, crucially, that person’s antibodies did not cross-react with PF4.

Those antibody molecules also offered clues about the immune cells that made them. And the scientists were able to link the immune cells responsible for VITT to patients who had two specific DNA variants. A wider survey of 100 VITT patients found that all of them had immune cells with one of these genetic types—which are far from universal. This signaled to the researchers that having these particular variants is a strong risk factor for blood clotting following an adenovirus vaccine.

But the study also showed that this genetic background on its own was not enough to cause VITT. The immune cells that made the dangerous antibodies had experienced an additional small genetic change, and that extra mutation had prompted them to produce those cross-reactive molecules.

In the past, scientists have suggested that genetic predispositions might explain some adverse events that happen after vaccination. For example, some data have indicated that certain people were genetically prone to developing narcolepsy following a version of swine-flu vaccine that was briefly used in Europe. But the new study from Greinacher and his team is the first to provide concrete evidence of how people with a particular DNA variant can develop self-sabotaging antibodies following a vaccination. Arnold Lining Ju, a biomedical engineer at the University of Sydney who has studied blood clotting, told me that the paper was a landmark finding in part because of how elegantly it explains the way a specific genetic trait, combined with a particular chance mutation in certain cells, creates VITT. And because the study shows that multiple genetic changes are involved, it finally explains why this immune reaction is so rare, he said.

This discovery will help guide researchers more than it will influence vaccination choices for individual patients. Most vaccine recipients will not know their genetic predisposition to an adverse event, Jennifer Juno, a vaccine researcher at the University of Melbourne, points out. But this type of work will help improve vaccine design—particularly in the field of “precision vaccinology,” in which vaccines are tailored to individual traits, Joanne Reed, the director of the Centre for Immunology and Allergy Research at the Westmead Institute in Australia, told me.

These results also mean that adenovirus-based vaccines could be made safer if they can be designed without the protein region that triggered the dangerous antibodies in VITT. “Instead of abandoning an entire vaccine platform because of a rare problem, we can engineer around the specific issue, and that’s the power of this kind of science,” Joann Arce of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital told me. The hope is that understanding the biology of a rare event like VITT, and then addressing it, helps bolster public trust in vaccines too. Greinacher told me that adenovirus-based vaccines remain vital, including for the development of vaccines for diseases that affect mostly low- and middle-income countries. The shots could also be useful in a future pandemic, because they can be scaled up in production relatively quickly.

Still, this one study may not have entirely answered the question of why adenovirus-based COVID vaccines caused clotting. A study published last year from Ju’s group suggested that a separate biophysical mechanism might cause a viral component found in the AstraZeneca vaccine to directly aggregate platelets, independent of the immune reaction identified in VITT. And a bigger mystery remains open too—why infections themselves are sometimes associated with dangerous blood clotting. Rushad Pavri, an immunologist at King’s College London, told me that the new study—because it shows how similarities between a virus particle and an innate protein involved in clotting can confuse the immune system—can shed light on that question. Ultimately, understanding why viruses can provoke immune overreactions might help limit damaging complications from sickness to begin with.</div>

You won’t find this in Cortina d’Ampezzo over the next few weeks, but for several decades of the Olympics’ history, the contest awarded medals not just for sport but for art too.

In the Summer Games from 1912 to 1948, musicians, painters, and plenty of other aesthetes went brain-to-brain in events such as lyric poetry and chamber music. “Town planning” was even contested one year under the umbrella of the architecture competition.

Lest you think the arts’ inclusion odd—one wonders what muscles need stretching before going for gold in watercolor—the submissions had to be at least about sports.

The Olympic committee ought to bring these events back. Well, maybe not town planning—but add trivia to the mix instead. Organizers can throw in a few sports questions for good measure, but with trivia, if you’re not working up a sweat thinking, you’re not doing it right.

And by the way, did you know that the Andersonville prison popularized the word deadline? Before it came to mean “due date,” the word had a gory, literal meaning: Prisoners at Andersonville and camps like it who crossed a certain boundary marked on the ground—the deadline—would be shot without warning. As dispatches emerged from Andersonville toward the end of the Civil War, understanding of (and horror at) the term quickly spread.

By the 1920s, newspapers had taken up the “do not cross” meaning to describe the time by which they had to finalize their next edition, and the rest of the world took the papers’ lead.

And by the way, did you know that—well, where to begin with Ashgabat? The massive statue of Niyazov is, like, the ninth thing you notice about the city.

All the marble hits visitors first. The capital has nearly 550 buildings clad in white marble, the highest concentration anywhere in the world. Combine that with the desert setting and the wide avenues that international visitors report as spotless and eerily empty, and you get an otherworldly effect.

And by the way, did you know that humans have a bone that does not connect to any other? We think of the skeleton as pretty contiguous, but in the middle of the neck, the hyoid bone, which supports the base of the tongue, is articulated only distantly to the rest of the skeleton by muscles and ligaments. It is, as scientists call it, a “floating bone.”

Because it’s not readily attachable, the hyoid is often left off of model skeletons. High-end ones hang it with string or wire.

            <h2>Five Basic Truths About America’s Most Polarizing Policy Debate</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/five-basic-truths-about-americas-immigration-debate/685962/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“If Liberals Won’t Enforce Borders, Fascists Will.”

So warned my colleague David Frum in the headline of an April 2019 article about America’s failure to control mass immigration. “Demagogues rise by talking about issues that matter to people, and that more conventional leaders appear unwilling or unable to address,” he wrote. “If difficult issues go unaddressed by responsible leaders, they will be exploited by irresponsible ones.”

That thesis looked shaky in 2020. Voters declined to reelect Donald Trump; for the first time in more than 50 years, Gallup found that Americans who wanted immigration to increase outnumbered those who wanted it to decrease––a seeming rebuke of Trump’s cruel family-separation policy and attacks on Mexicans and Muslims––and that 77 percent said immigration is a good thing for the United States. Then Joe Biden failed to control the southern border and presided over record surges in unlawful entries. By 2024, a majority wanted less immigration, Trump won the presidency while promising the biggest mass deportation in U.S. history, and an analysis of why voters rejected Kamala Harris found that “too many immigrants crossed the border” was nearly tied for the top reason.

Today, Frum’s warning seems prescient: The Trump administration has deployed a force of aggressive masked officers onto American streets while promising “retribution.” They’ve detained, pepper-sprayed, assaulted, shot, and killed Americans. And high-ranking officials have repeatedly gotten caught lying about events captured by citizen video footage.

A majority now disapproves of Trump’s handling of immigration. Perhaps Democrats will prevail in their current efforts to force ICE officers to take off their masks and get warrants, or even win back Congress as a result––the MAGA coalition is no less vulnerable than the left to voter backlash. But a Democratic victory in 2026 is not likely to end this cycle, in which majorities hate how both parties handle immigration and ping-pong unhappily between them.

I have covered immigration politics and policy for 25 years; here’s my sense of five basic truths that lawmakers need to acknowledge if they want to implement immigration policy that is both popular and in the nation’s best interest.

1. Even many of those Americans who say that they want to deport all immigrants who are here illegally would likely not stand by that position in practice.  Lots of MAGA supporters insist that deporting all immigrants in the U.S. illegally is a prudent goal. Some argue that conserving the rule of law requires doing so. “I don’t care if it’s a grandma who’s been here for 23 years and sits quietly on her porch all day long,” the populist-right pundit Walter Curt wrote. “We either have laws or we don’t, we either have borders or we don’t, there is no middle ground.”  Although superficially seductive, that logic is monomaniacal. In the real world, federal laws are enforced by presidents in a manner that predictably fails to catch anything close to 100 percent of lawbreakers, because resources are scarce, trade-offs are real, and maximalist outcomes are simply incompatible with limited government.

Consider the example of tax law. Most Americans abhor tax cheats. But they, and especially most conservatives, would oppose deploying thousands of masked, armed IRS agents into whatever American neighborhoods the president fancies and allowing them to search houses, workplaces, and private papers to catch all the tax cheats.

Yes, lots of Americans tell pollsters that they want every immigrant who came here illegally deported, but how many would stick to that position if told that it would require house-to-house raids, or that the federal government must choose between spending limited funds on apprehending undocumented grandmothers who stayed after their work visas and spending on other societal needs, such as finding a cure for cancer or paying down the national debt?

2. A majority of Americans support some level of immigration enforcement, particularly for unauthorized immigrants who commit violent crimes.

If excessive immigration enforcement is incompatible with liberty, insufficient immigration enforcement is incompatible with representative democracy––Republicans are correct that our immigration laws were duly enacted, and every plausible read of election results and polling data confirms that Americans favor some meaningful level of immigration enforcement.

Americans’ preferences are clearest on the question of immigrants in the country illegally who have been convicted of violent crimes: According to an Associated Press poll, 83 percent of Americans strongly or somewhat favor deporting them, a position that is also held by 79 percent of Democrats. The persistence of contrary policies in some Democrat-controlled jurisdictions is harmful to public safety and the political interests of that coalition.

I support sanctuary cities insofar as that means that local police don’t enforce immigration law, because they want residents to cooperate with law enforcement. But it doesn’t follow that jailers should refuse all cooperation with deportations. If you favor any immigration enforcement at all, who better to focus on than incarcerated bad actors, who can be found without spending any money on searches or deploying federal officers among the public?

3. Refugee crises will happen––and every response likely to satisfy the public requires prior planning.

Perhaps the most difficult challenge on immigration is what to do with large, sudden surges of people. The future will bring wars, natural disasters, regime collapses, famines, and more. Barring entry to desperate refugees seems cruel, but letting in large, unanticipated flows of foreigners can cause voters in democracies to feel overwhelmed and empower authoritarians. Escaping this dysfunctional cycle is in the interests of restrictionists and inclusionists alike. All potential solutions come with challenges, but none is more formidable than the status quo. The future will confront us with many such crises. We need a plan.

4. Even many Americans who argue for a stricter immigration policy find the demonization of immigrants concerning.

It is one thing to deport people and another thing to vilify them while doing so. In my youth, the Republican Party was explicit about the goodness and humanity of most immigrants––see, for example, the way that Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush talked about the issue in 1980. Bush noted that “honorable, decent, family-loving people” were in violation of the law.  Today, in an America where there are many more immigrants, lawful and not, and where violent crime is lower than it was for the entire 1980s and ’90s, data suggest that unauthorized immigrants commit felonies at lower rates than U.S. citizens and immigrants who are authorized to be here. Obviously, some do commit murders and other serious crimes, but it is misleading and incendiary to talk about the entire class as if a large share are violent criminals, or to treat particular ethnic groups as scapegoats for citizens’ financial struggles. Many Americans find such talk unnerving and distasteful.

That is not mere political correctness. It is rooted in the fact that U.S. history is rife with examples of the demonization of ethnic-minority groups preceding mob violence against them. I hope America is beyond atrocities like the Los Angeles Chinese massacre, the World War I–era lynching of ethnic Germans, and the Zoot Suit Riots. But humans today are no more evolved than the perpetrators of those atrocities. Insofar as we’re less likely to participate in mob attacks, it’s because of the existence of cultural guardrails—the very ones that the MAGA coalition is dismantling.

5. Every high-immigration country has citizens who fear immigration and immigrants. They are least likely to sow dysfunction when their predispositions are understood and to some degree accommodated.

The United States has no choice but to tolerate people who fear immigration and immigrants. Although many humans enjoy diversity, a percentage of people in all countries and racial and demographic groups are psychologically uncomfortable with difference. Their discomfort may be to some degree innate, and they are either unable or unwilling to change.

America should never allow its xenophobes to persecute immigrants or violate their rights. But people who hold anti-immigrant views are fellow citizens who influence our culture, politics, and public policy––and we can influence whether they do so in ways that are better or worse for immigrants.

In The Authoritarian Dynamic, the social psychologist Karen Stenner explains how people with a latent predisposition to authoritarianism get triggered, and how best to respond to preserve a pluralistic society. Her work suggests that liberals should stop framing immigration as a celebration of multicultural difference and instead emphasize ways in which immigrants are just like the rest of us: people who seek safety, opportunity, and a better future for their family. These framings can better assuage the fears of those with xenophobic tendencies, she argues. Stenner suggests that countries implement practical assimilationist policies, such as encouraging and assisting with English fluency. She argues that immigration is most sustainable—and backlash against it least likely to succeed—when inflows of new immigrants are controlled, and subject to known limits rather than unlimited in a way that feels unpredictable.

As she puts it in her book, insisting on unconstrained diversity “pushes those by nature least equipped to live comfortably in a liberal democracy not to the limits of their tolerance, but to their intolerant extremes.” And once a society’s authoritarians are activated, the outcome depends in part on how its conservatives react. If they side with authoritarians, repressive policies follow. But under the right conditions, conservatives can be counted on to rally behind pluralism and tolerance. One condition is that they feel reassured “regarding established brakes on the pace of change, and the settled rules of the game,” Stenner writes.

If Democrats or Republicans hope to create sustainable immigration policy, that policy must roughly reflect the public will. Instead of efforts to alter public opinion through persuasion, we’ve seen a succession of fringe factions forcing extremist positions on majorities that hate them. Politicians from both parties should moderate according to what voters actually want. Otherwise, endless political failures risk causing many to lose faith in all politics––which is an existential danger to our democracy.</div>

Nothing you can&#39;t fix by building 8-10 more datacenters and dumping in them 4 or 5 more &quot;agentic expert&quot; models to loop over each others&#39; &quot;reasoning&quot; per request.

one cannot expect our incompetent upper class overlords to produce anything but even more overpriced and unimaginative technology, let&#39;s not forget the goal is not to produce good tech but to extract the most revenue in order to increase shareholder value

our devices and our services are designed to exploit us, manipulate us and surveil us, welcome to our classist corporatocracy

If phone interfaces (And windows 11) were designed by professional interface designers instead of as an afterthought by programmers then we wouldn&#39;t have to search to find functionality, it would be obvious where it is.

Actually, now that I think about it... I kind of expected this.

... just focus on fixing the issues like bugs. Way too many problems. V26 is awful. Also, please stop doing new major versions every year. Why not slow down and take the time?

Seconded.  There are so many things that need refactored in macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and other *OS items.  Not to mention iCloud.

Even something as basic as Time Machine needs help.  Ideally, have the ability for iCloud to handle S3, and Time Machine able to do deduplicating S3 backups similar to Restic or Duplicacy.  Duplicacy has some nice things, including public key encryption of data, so machines can back up and deduplicate, but not read the data.

Then comes other items.  Macs need something like BootCamp so

Said before a AI-designed superbug took out you and your entire family. Do you think or just spew gibberish?

This year it is arthritic, the outfit that admitted that &quot;AI&quot; is a dead end, but then slapped a neverending loop of reparsing long json bits onto that shit and called it a business model.

It is almost like all knowledge of architecture design is gone and the whole of &quot;AI&quot; is vibe-coded by stoned schoolchildren.

Wait, exactly as it was in the year 2000.

I don&#39;t have a good idea as to what has caused it, but look at any TV debate up to sometime around the 1980s and you are likely to find a logical discussion, with little tolerance for lies, exaggeration, or logical error. That seems to have gone now.

Scientists might show that we are in trouble, and the result is that the most powerful deride the scientists, and most voters are incapable of the thought required to arrive at an informed opinion.

Politics and social debate need to fundamentally change.

If it isn&#39;t tech, it is nation-states with their psy-ops teams wanting a media platform to push their agendas or outright do falsehoods.

The problem is that due to their self-inflicted wounds, journalism is gone, and there is zero trust in the press.  This allows almost anyone to come in, assert almost anything, just because there is no need for them to have to prove otherwise, and there is no penalty for lying, such as blaming the trash piles in NYC on &quot;socialism&quot;.

It&#39;s pretty much a trope that coffee has been bad for us one week and then good for us again the next week, ad infinitum. Scientists are not the ones telling you this. The people telling you this are the same ones that inject themselves into every conversation and try to convince you to buy things you don&#39;t need.

I partly agree. It&#39;s also a bunch of &quot;journalists&quot; who will write anything for views, including anything they don&#39;t understand themselves. Things like looking at a summary of one scientific article, misunderstanding it, and ignoring all other science on the same topic. This kind of nonsense already existed in the old media landscape, but it was a minority of content, at least where I lived. Nowadays the suggestion algorithms of a few social media companies decide how much of that content people will see.

It&#39;s pretty much a trope that coffee has been bad for us one week and then good for us again the next week, ad infinitum.

It would be very amusing to see the world through your eyes.

How exactly do you think science works?  Do you think that someone asks a question, and then scientists all get together in a single meeting to answer that question, and then they post the answer and claim it is the full and unquestionable truth?

No, that would be ridiculous.  Instead, science is performed by millions of individua

The predictions of science led to every single thing about whatever device you&#39;re typing this drivel on.  They led to the microwave you nuked your dinner in and likely to most of the food you put in there. They also led to whatever lifesaving treatments have kept you from dying from any of the numerous ailments that left most families with at least one dead child until very recently.  They&#39;re why you don&#39;t have smallpox and never will.

Yeah, because Ronnie Raygun didn&#39;t make up a bunch of BS about welfare queens that years later turned out to be BS. Nevermind the back door comms to Iran to get the hostages held until he secured the Presendency ... etc.

The 80s are not the bastion of good behavior and one can&#39;t have an honest conversation when folks lie and hide things.

Actually it is a smart move, and the guy is spot on on security, there is none of it in the &quot;AI&quot;.

The &quot;architecture&quot; of the claude and the whole &quot;AI&quot; crap is beyond ridiculous.

You have a stateless &quot;AI&quot; produce unsafe code that nobody checks, then you feed the descriptors of that code fed to the &quot;AI&quot; at every request so that it can re-learn what it did and call some other process to run that very code. Or some similar code. Or some code that has that descriptor. Or something.

While that&#39;s obviously accurate, the way the argument frames his points makes it sound like Anthropic are preventing them putting in protections against people using AI to spontaneously generate viral weapons that can be used to target specific populations.

Every single part of that explanation, including the unstated premises, is narrative made with the assumption that those things are functionally possible and just a matter of time... Including but not limited to implicit computational chemistry, genetical

Back in the real world, cops have been asking for privately owned surveillance recordings to help with investigations since video recording became a thing. And the very reason people (usually businesses) have set up video surveillance was to deter crime and help track down crooks who were insufficiently deterred.

It actually works pretty well as it is IMO.

They&#39;re not going to only be used to fight crime.   As we have seen in multiple other technologies that offer surveillance to an entity with no effective oversight.

Like guns and vehicles we need regulations.   Perhaps make it a crime to show footage from another person&#39;s property unless there is a warrant or reasonable suspicion of a crime committed?.  So yeah, you catch someone stealing your neighbor&#39;s packages (I live in the city, so our front doors are less than 50 feet apart), you&#39;re a hero.  You use it to show your neighbor her husband had a visitor when she&#39;s not in town?...you&#39;re human trash and should be charged with a misdemeanor and banned from using surveillance cameras in public for a year.

I&#39;m sure that somewhere buried in the terms and conditions is a statement that allows Amazon AI to analyze your video footage for products that they can monetize.

That way, the next time you log into amazon.com, they can recommend winter floor mats for the 2018 Toyota RAV-4 they see in your driveway and flea and tick medication for the golden retriever that you take for walks every afternoon.

There&#39;s always a few adorable lunkheads who chime on these discussions about how responsible and well reasoned their decisions are, but for whatever reason they&#39;re unable to spot why that is fully orthogonal to the expressed concern.

MS seems to instead optimize &quot;engagement&quot; with their OS and Office programs, i.e. they waste as much of your time as possible with far too deep menu structures, changing things around, minimal customization for users, low/no customization persistence, and other crap that makes their stuff a permanent load on your attention capacity.Essentially, they are doing &quot;attention economy&quot; instead of &quot;professional tool economy&quot; and it is a massive problem now. The second indicator is that reliability and security are slowly getting worse and worse. They probably cannot fix that anymore and hence need to be replaced. In Europe, that process has started.

The second indicator is that reliability and security are slowly getting worse and worse. They probably cannot fix that anymore and hence need to be replaced. In Europe, that process has started.

I never did figure out Mint&#39;s versions.  Like what&#39;s the difference between 22.1, 22.2, and 22.3? Seems like all three versions exist at once and most updates are within the minor point version.  Last I had Mint it wasn&#39;t an automatic one-click upgrade between, for example,  22.2 and 22.3?  That kind of gave me pause when installing it for people.

My laptop is in dire need of a refresh (Ubuntu 20.04 believe it or not).  I&#39;m thinking of going back to LMDE instead of regular Mint.  Although would be nice to ha

>&quot;Last I had Mint it wasn&#39;t an automatic one-click upgrade between, for example, 22.2 and 22.3? That kind of gave me pause when installing it for people.&quot;

Not sure what you mean.  I &quot;one click&quot; upgraded from every version.  It was actually a few clicks, because it warns you to make a backup and such.  And you click to skip the features list.  But it is an &quot;in-place upgrade&quot; to the next version.  I have been doing it for years on many machines and haven&#39;t had any issue on any of them (knock on wood).

Well go to mint&#39;s website.  They have no less than four versions of 22 listed. Why?  Why should you need backups to go from 22.1 to 22.2 to 22.3?  Why do I need an &quot;in-place upgrade?&quot;  Doesn&#39;t make any sense to me.  As far as I know the last computer I set up for someone with Mint 22 is probably still on 22.1 or whatever it was when I set it up.  I don&#39;t understand at all the need for a manual step to bump between minor versions.  Ubuntu has no such thing.  And the RHEL world where I spent my professional c

>&quot;Well go to mint&#39;s website. They have no less than four versions of 22 listed. Why?&quot;

Don&#39;t know what you are talking about.  When you go here:  https://www.linuxmint.com/down...  [linuxmint.com] it shows one version, the current one, 22.3.  If you go to the Download ALL area here:  https://www.linuxmint.com/down... [linuxmint.com] then they list ALL their versions since the beginning of Mint.  It is just a reference archive.

>&quot;Why should you need backups to go from 22.1 to 22.2 to 22.3?&quot;

You don&#39;t HAVE to make a backup, the system just

Wow in-place updates between point releases used to require a complete reinstall? Yikes.

Sorry I mispoke.  &quot;dnf update&quot; not &quot;upgrade.&quot;  As for &quot;upgrade&quot; I assume that&#39;s a full OS replacement.  dnf update just updates packages[1] like apt does on debian and ubuntu.  Always the latest point version. AlmaLinux 9.7, etc.  On Mint though apt sticks within the minor version near as I can tell unless you change the apt.sources.

I guess I just don&#39;t see the logic in the way Mint does it.  I think they&#39;ll have to aban

>&quot;Outside of needed security fixes, the rapid release cycle can get to be a real pain in the ass.&quot;

I concur.  If the choice is between giving up on some of Mint&#39;s goodness (like important native packages offered instead of damn containers only), or stretching the cycle to a little later, the latter makes more sense to me.  Mint has been a fantastic distro.

Yeah it&#39;s not a bad idea, it seems like there&#39;s not a whole lot of difference between major versions and they&#39;re probably making a lot of work for themselves to deliver a &quot;major version update&quot; that&#39;s just like the previous one but with slightly newer packages and maybe 1 meaningful functional difference, meanwhile the version older than either of those still works just fine and can run totally up-to-date packages as well...

Things are pretty stable is Linux right now too I think.

There was a 10-20 year period where things were rapidly changing (good 3D, new audio systems, gnome 3/kde4, Wayland) and the newest often brought big changes vs running 6 month-year old packages.

But it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve felt I needed to update a package to get new features working (even Wine/Proton don&#39;t seem to be making major major improvements as they&#39;ve gotten pretty danged good).

It&#39;s good to see Linux having survived this massive shift and

Agree completely. Mint is perfectly suitable for a daily driver. I found answers quickly in the forums, and I provided answers to the forum in the hopes that it would help others. Only real issue I remember having is pulseaudio sometimes burning 7% cpu on an idle laptop with no sound playing (but apparently I&#39;m reading now that pipewire is a successor)Yes, the forums have changed a lot from when I started. Still have to be careful. Some people make solutions more complicated than need be.

Ohh, I will need to look into pipewire. I&#39;ve never been all that into pulseaudio.

Fedora or Fedora Atomic based OSes. https://bazzite.gg/ [bazzite.gg] or https://getaurora.dev/en [getaurora.dev] for windows-like desktop and/or gaming. https://projectbluefin.io/ [projectbluefin.io] if you don&#39;t mind a more traditional Linux/MacOS look and don&#39;t care about gaming at all.

The community over at Linux Mint is showing the pressure. Under the gun, and unable to process even basic issues, they turn on users and blame them for problems and bugs they experience, telling them their use case is flawed when the reality is they just don&#39;t have the resources to deal with the issue.  Now, not having the resources is one thing, and a fair response.  But turning it back on the user and telling them their use case is flawed when they experience is the tail wagging the dog.

Another community I saw this in for a long time, and I really thought the project would implode, was the Palemoon browser.  They got behind when webcomponents became a thing and they could keep up with changes.  They too would blame the user when yet another web site that didn&#39;t work on the browser was encountered, telling them they should be using the site, should complain about the site, and why would they need a site like that anyway??

Palemoon dragged themselves out of it.  They buckled down, and it&#39;s almost back to being a useful browser again.  But the community at Mint concerns me.  They are on the down swing.  User blaming and load shedding are just symptoms of a larger issue.  Too much work for too few volunteers.  They also don&#39;t have a good end-to-end workflow strategy.   By that I mean in many cases they don&#39;t seem to treat the OS as a coherent whole that is used for actual workflows from beginning to end.  Pieces that have no replacement are deprecated while resources are spent on pieces that have many duplicates.

I can&#39;t even get Mint to boot, and haven&#39;t for years.  It stubbornly keeps telling me that my media isn&#39;t a bootable system drive.  Apparently, the Mint team is doing something custom with the boot process that requires you to add security keys in the BIOS for it to start properly, but they don&#39;t tell you this on the download page and the community has been remarkably quiet and unhelpful about this issue.

I have four other Linux distros on flash drives that boot no problem, and I use Clonzilla on a regular b

It&#39;s called trusted computing and your BIOS requires that keys be added, not mint. You can disable it in the BIOS.

I have tried disabling Secure Boot, and I still have the issue.  There are tutorials that show you how to add custom keys, but that&#39;s well beyond the capabilities of an ordinary person.

The key point is that no other Linux distro I&#39;ve ever tried -- ever -- has has this problem.  Mint people run into this issue, and the community just kind of shrugs their shoulders.  Not to mention the fact that when you try to update an old system, you suddenly find your updated machine is suddently unbootable with no idea o

Fortunately Clement Lefebvre didn&#39;t go full blown the GNOME style anti-user attitude, and recognized the issue is valid at the end. A damage control from JosephMcc calling it &quot;isn&#39;t a bug&quot; and &quot;no plans to change it&quot; in https://github.com/linuxmint/c... [github.com]

>&quot;Mint isn&#39;t even that great of a distro.&quot;

Compared to what?  Mint is stable, polished, reliable, and functional.  Its updates and upgrades have all been extremely well-done.  They offer native packages for important software.  They put out an easy and functional desktop that is still compatible with Ubuntu so it has instant mind-share.  Millions of people use it.  It is on the top or near the top of nearly every list of best distros I have seen, for years.

Mint is just Ubuntu with a bunch of pre-installed, pre-configured software aka bloat that often times regular people don&#39;t even need.

Debian -> Ubuntu -> Mint. Mint IS the downstream. Cinnamon, MATE, and Xfce are all ass. And while I don&#39;t like GNOME, it&#39;s better than those 3.

Bazzite seems to be the new hotness for user friendly Linux distributions, which seems to be stealing Mint&#39;s thunder in that space.

Businesses will probably continue to stick with the stable and reliable Linux distros like Ubuntu, Debian, and RHEL. So, who is Mint for, exactly?

Bazzite is fantastic and my current daily driver since it&#39;s basically a Fedora based SteamOS plus all standard desktop features. I also like it because it is an immutable OS so neither I nor a random program can accidentally fuck up the OS.

The creators of Bazzite also have two other projects, Aurora and Bluefin. Bluefin is designed for workstations only, so it would make for a good business OS as well.

However I&#39;m not a gamer and do not use Nvidia GPUs.

If I was to complain it would be that the Libreoffice version is not very recent and was not updated on the 22.3 release. That probably applies to other programs in the library as well.

There are also some broken links for the /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 program when I was trying to figure out whether the older PCs I have are V1, V2, or V3. The link is there or not there depending on the machine, and when I hunted down the actual fil

This sounds like enough complaints that I would find a new distro that doesn&#39;t have those problems (or any newer ones). And I would mainly look at Fedora based projects aimed for workstations like https://projectbluefin.io/ [projectbluefin.io].

The new improved System Information shows the CPU but the old display of all the instructions is gone so It&#39;s had to figure out what is and is not supported. Hopefully they will put the X86-64 feature version level on the display on a future update. Apparently kernels are going to start caring.To get the old system information corpus, press the &quot;copy&quot; button and paste it into a text editor or anywhere that can type text.

Would be LMDE without systemd.  I&#39;m intrigued by Xlibre, maybe that would be cool too, but I don&#39;t have experience with it yet.  I&#39;m not expecting anybody to do it.  But if somebody has the chops and the energy to pull it off, maybe this&#39;ll plant the idea in their head.

A filter excluding any story titles starting with the word &quot;Is&quot;?

Yep. Another &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; problem is sensationalist bullshit headline, like this one.

Mint has a small team, and right now, Linux is in a time of rapid development for gaming on PCs with Steam, Wayland, enhanced gaming drivers, and such. I think it makes sense for them to pull back and maybe even just release based on Ubuntu LTS releases every 2 years.

I was a big fan of Mint for a long time because Cinnamon was such a nice alternative to Gnome and Unity. I eventually left for Kubuntu because the Mint devs had ZERO plans to work on Wayland. They wouldn&#39;t even entertain a discussion about a plan to make a plan to even think about working on Wayland while every other DE was in active development and even pushing for its release as default over X11 in upcoming releases. Now, they&#39;re busy playing catch-up bolting support for Wayland onto Cinnamon.

Maintaining a distro is a lot of work, especially for a small team, and they&#39;ve got a LOT to improve on before I could recommend them to any of my gamer friends that are interested in trying out Linux - They&#39;re playing with Bazzite, Kubuntu, CatchyOS, and others.

Long term, I really think Mint should just fold itself into being an official Cinnamon Ubuntu flavor and work on just improving Cinnamon... or they could rebase on a different flavor entirely, like they did with the Debian version. I mean, they can and will do whatever they want, but my experience with them was that they couldn&#39;t see the writing on the wall that Wayland was super important for the future of Linux DEs, and I can&#39;t recommend them right now to anyone as other distros have caught up and gotten so much better. What&#39;s the point of maintaining Mint these days? Who&#39;s the target market that wouldn&#39;t do better on another option? I dunno.

>&quot;because the Mint devs had ZERO plans to work on Wayland&quot;

Yeah.  To me, that is a feature, not a flaw.  I want stability and functionality.  Wayland hasn&#39;t been that and I don&#39;t want to be forced into it right now.  They are of a similar mindset.  It might be there eventually.

Thank fucking God someone is being sane in the GNU/Linux community on this. It&#39;s absolutely unbelievable that a half-assed display system that&#39;s far from finished or feature complete, and is actually less efficient and has higher latency, than X11, is being adopted long after the entire reason for proposing it became obsolete (in 2001 it was difficult to graft a security system onto X11 because t

I have been using Linux Mint on almost all the Linux boxes I have except for Debian on headless servers. Reasons:1) Mint doesn&#39;t change things for no reason, especially UI (unlike Ubuntu used to do)2) it is compatible with Debian and Ubuntu3) all the defaults make sense4) snaps are off by default

They may have seen quality dropping or reaction times going up or, yes, a potential &quot;burnout&quot; in the future. Smart people can predict things and prevent getting hit. Only reducing workload when you are already struggling hard is amateur-level. Mint does not strike me as amateur level.

Is it burning out, or is the longer release cycle just the right thing to do with a smaller team? The phrasing sounds way more negative than needed, in particular when they decide to use a longer cycle before something may burn out.

Yes, we are fucked in the ass. The worst case scenarios are likely if not optimistic.

The paywall really puts a damper on the doomsaying, though.  Reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from Stargate:

Dr. Rodney McKay: Why wait? Why does the guy show up a day-and-a-half after this all starts to do his whole &quot;Prepare to meet your doom&quot; thing?Major Samantha Carter: I don&#39;t know. Maybe he wanted to make sure it was gonna work.Dr. Rodney McKay: Yeah, that would be embarrassing, wouldn&#39;t it? &quot;Nothing can stop the destruction that I bring upon you!&quot; Then the gate shuts down. &quot;Oops, sorry. Never mind.&quot;

And take the most successful line of EVs with him?

Maybe? It&#39;s arguable that his support of this admin helped them win power and that has offset much of the good hos EVs have done at this point.  Probably not true but it&#39;s also not zero, he&#39;s burned through a lot of his goodwill and the admin is setting the issue backwards by some amount.

Teslas cratering sales in Europe, the mediocrity of the Cybertruck, the paring down of their product lines, they continue to lose self driving ground to Waymo, Tesla isn&#39;t failing but it isn&#39;t doing great either and I think Musk himself eats a lot of that.   My prediction is that Tesla is sticking around with within the next 5 years they will have squandered their enormous first mover advantage.   Once the other car companies are able to produce affordable battery packs Tesla will have to compete on more than price and they will lose that fight

A whole lot of people across the world will no longer buy a Tesla, and a whole lot of Tesla drivers are embarrassed to drive them.

And your priority for the $20,000 price differential is to spend it on a luxury vehicle? I would prioritize rent, land, or retirement.

So, you would rather drive a Chinese EV than a Tesla? I do not know where you are from, but I still think you have some wrong priorities.If you are implying that Tesla is a better option because China is not trustworthy, then sure - there are reasons to be suspicious about China, but I wouldn&#39;t trust Musk as far as I could throw him.

Quite a few Chinese-made cars came before Biden and Trump blocked them.

I recall in the very early days of the Covid pandemic, months before lockdowns hit the US, a post I read on Slashdot.

It was looking at the evidence coming out of China and some other early spots, all pointing to the inevitability of the disease ripping through the rest of the world. It concluded with something like, &quot;We&#39;re fucked.&quot;

In 50 years I think I&#39;ll be remembering this post the same way.

What&#39;s not really said in a lot of alarmist climate change stories is that this stuff doesn&#39;t happen all at once. It&#39;s not like we cross 2 degrees and then we&#39;re in a perpetual 300 degree oven. No. What actually happens is the areas that are already deserts, cook, and that self-perpetuating cooking starts spreading northward and southward as the doldrums widen and change density. So everywhere that&#39;s currently a tropical climate becomes impossible to live in, and place

Easiest planetary body in our Solar System to terraform would be the Earth. Even after a climate catastrophe, nuclear winter, and asteroid impact all at once.

There&#39;s no where to run. The only choice is how expensive y&#39;all want to make Earth&#39;s recovery.

Is this going to happen before, or after I retire?

Yep, gerontocracy has consequences. Ignoring global warming, a failing economic system, and other problems that should be tolerable to the comfortably retired for a few more decades are among them.

While this may seem logical on the surface, real-life older people do actually care about the future of their own children and grandchildren.

You would think so, and if you ask them they&#39;ll certainly claim they do, but this claim is not supported by the voting data.

Based on my own older family members who voted for Trump, I don&#39;t believe they did so because they didn&#39;t care, but because they were deceived.

Based on my own older family members who voted for Trump, I don&#39;t believe they did so because they didn&#39;t care, but because they were deceived.The thing is, they wanted to be deceived -- that gave them an out.  Now they can go to their graves with a clear conscience, because they &quot;know&quot; global warming is a myth and therefore they didn&#39;t really doom their grandchildren.  That&#39;s all they wanted, is some comforting lies that would give them permission to not worry about it.

We all lie to ourselves to make ourselves feel better, do we not?

No, we don&#39;t. Don&#39;t judge everyone by your ways.

As with all things it&#39;s a question of degree and who&#39;s affected. There&#39;s a difference between complaining about the tumble drier shrinking my waistband and destroying the habitable world.

Oh don&#39;t get on your high horse, we are all susceptible to deception. We&#39;re just susceptible to different *kinds* of deception.

I disagree, the real question is are they ready to ban civilian air travel?

If no one is willing to give up that luxury then whatever posturing they do they are not actually worried.

They can recycle the cruise ships at the same time.

YouTube has a channel for Haulover Inlet. You can watch the big pleasure craft with 4 to 6 20 gph outboards going in and out of harbor. They aren&#39;t worried either.

I disagree.  Are you ready to make a real difference and ban personal automobiles?

Itâ(TM)s easy to attack other peopleâ(TM)s choices when you donâ(TM)t have to make a sacrifice yourself.  Me? I sold my car in 2008 and havenâ(TM)t replaced it.  One of the best things I ever did.

You do realize they&#39;ll never &quot;eat&quot; those costs, right? They&#39;ll pass them on to you the consumer and maintain their profits and bonuses. I dislike being that cynical, but the tariffs have shown us extra costs are passed on.

We (for a value which does not include maggots) already knew that about tariffs and also about everything else.

I do not understand why people see the concept of costs being passed on to consumers as controversial. If a corporation ceases to make a profit, it ceases to exist. If a corporation is taxed into oblivion and cannot meet the payroll, people stop working there and it stops creating goods and services. Their only existential option is to pass new costs onto consumers.Why is this difficult for people to understand?

I dislike being that cynical, but the tariffs have shown us extra costs are passed on.You are indeed being overly cynical.   You&#39;re right that they don&#39;t want to eat those costs, but you&#39;re missing that they also don&#39;t want to lose market share (and therefore sales) to a competitor who is able to charge less because the competitor doesn&#39;t incur those costs.Which is to say, if there is an alternative way to provide the same (or similar) product cheaper by reducing/avoiding expensive CO2 emissions, they&#39;ll switch to that, as a way to remain competitive.  Which is the desired outcome.

Change so that the ice caps do not melt for a third time in the last 20 years?ok, now you&#39;re just lying.

But also, that&#39;s not as clear anyway. Tipping points are constantly evolving. Critically- they could already be passed. It&#39;s not like Earth throws up a flag and says, &quot;yup- in 85 years, you are fucking done, morons.&quot;

History is well populated by traces of civilizations brought low by climate change, possibly including the moment when the entire human population was reduced to perhaps 1000 individuals (i.e., we almost didn&#39;t make it). So it is interesting thatthere was much rejoicing that almost the entire collection of climate change efforts, such as they were, have been eliminated by the current administration. Strange that -- almost as though MAGA meant &#39;make america go away&#39;. Now I have never been one to think that a

The species will survive but civilization as we know it most certainly will not survive. A small subset (read rich people) will have the money to build secure, self-sustaining and very likely fully autonomous areas. Some already own islands large enough for purpose.

For a short while, sure. But who will be available to replenish their wine cellars?

Should drop worldwide temperatures by 10-20 degrees. Will also help depopulate and deindustrialize the world a bit. It&#39;s a win/win.I wouldn&#39;t describe the deaths of billions as &quot;win/win&quot;.  More like &quot;lose/lose/lose/lose/lose/lose/win/lose/lose/lose/lose&quot;, maybe.

Will it be this utter hell some are predicting? Probably not. But it will be toasty. An odd thing is some places will get colder.

There will be increased rainfall, there will be a bit of a wildcard as pent-up subsoil methane is released. The big wild card is if oceanic methane clathrates somehow get released.

There were events in the last half million years that changed the temperature by up to 16 degrees C in fairly short time periods. Well, about 12 degrees [researchgate.net], but that aside, every species that exists, evolved with the current inter-glacial, glaciation cycle of the past couple and a half million years. 
The current warming is different in two ways.  One: The warming is from the top of an interglacial. Many ecosystems that could move to address a cooling from the top of an interglacial will not be able to move in the other direction, because they will hit the top of mountains of the edge of continents.  Two: This warming is much faster. You

I keep in my heart Carl Sagans monologue about how every petty little human being who ever lived, lived on this tiny blue dot, while showing the picture of earth as shown by Voyager millions of miles away from earth.  The end of his Cosmos show.

It breaks my heart how we are pissing it all away now.   It seems to be a &quot;battle&quot;  between people who want to cooperate, and people who want to destroy.

2012 was the record minimum for Artic sea ice. So someone&#39;s model seemed to be onto something.

Now the journalist that wrote the science piece dumbed down so that you could understand it likely did a poor job of explaining it.

But there are so many models and theories that offer up different specifics but similar generalities that it can be frustrating for laypeople to make sense of it all.

2012 was the record minimum for Artic sea ice.For extent, yes it was. For volume, it may have been 2018 [uw.edu].

>> They have been CATASTROPHICALLY wrong every single time.

So, the ice caps will again disappear like they were supposed to in 2012?That was one prediction by Dr Wieslaw Maslowski of the Naval Postgraduate School in California. And not for either ice cap. Nor for 2012. It was for the northern summer sea ice, and was based on the 28% drop in minimum extent between summer 2006 and summer 2007  being a tipping point rather than, as it turned out, a bad year. 

And the prediction was &quot;inside five to seven years&quot; which was about 2013-2014 not 2012. 
And while the denialiosphere will use one paper and claim that it discredits the entire fields of thermodynamics, optics and earth science, it doesn&#39;t. 
But even then they don&#39;t usually claim that it was a prediction of total ice loss of Greenland (Which would raise sea levels about 7 metres), much less Antarctica (Which would raise sea levels a further 58 metres). 
Congratulations. You&#39;ve managed to hit a whole new level of wrong.When are people going to stop falling for thisOh, the irony.They have been CATASTROPHICALLY wrong every single time.Wrong again. The models have been improving, but even Hansen&#39;s 1981 model is pretty close, if a little conservate. Since the late 80s, they&#39;ve been pretty much bang on the nose. [realclimate.org]

They actually found that antarctic ice (as a whole) is increasing due to increased water-vapor in the atmosphere and more snow falling.Are you sure? The measurements are showing a pretty heavy mass loss in Antarctica [nasa.gov]. 
I think you might have just made that up yourself.

Mars is already a completely unlivable hellscape of a planet.  Economically and technologically speaking, it&#39;s far easier to just not screw up Earth any worse than it already is than terraform Mars.

Such an atmosphere could &quot;easily&quot; be protected indefinitely from erosion by installation of a handful of superconducting rings around the planet.  Only a few GW of power would be required to power the rings.

Name one climate prediction over the last 40 years that came close to truth. Here&#39;s an analysis of how the major models have preformed [realclimate.org], with respect to global mean surface temperature predictions. 

The one from the early 80s was a bit conservative, but they&#39;ve all been pretty close since then. 

Perhaps you can link to a few of these papers you think got it wrong?In 2006, former vice-president Al Gore projected that unless drastic measures were implemented, the planet would hit an irreversible “point of no return” by 2016. Game over.We&#39;ve past 350 ppm of CO2, which is the level that will come with the high-cost high casualty impacts of greater than 1.5C of warming.  Currently we&#39;re at 427 ppm. 
So Gore hasn&#39;t been shown to be wrong. Perhaps the problems is that you don&#39;t understand that it takes decades for half the warming from an increase in CO2 to have occurred. Ice-albedo feedback in particular takes centuries. 
Nor Pachuri.James Hansen, drew a line in the sand testifying before Congress in June 2008, on the dangers of greenhouse gases: “We’re toast if we don’t get on a very different path. This is the last chance.”Do you have any evidence that he was wrong? Or are you hoping, without basing that hope on any facts that you can point to?

So, are you saying that you think that there is no longer any action we can take that would avoid a complete disaster?Every kilogram of CO2 makes it worse.

His background is engineering and economics. The IPCC is half a dozen people. The EXPERTS are the thousands of scientists who volunteer their time to the working groups. 

But he&#39;s wasn&#39;t wrong either.X year passes, same statements made, only change is now it is Y year!Can you please link me to a couple or few instances of where the same statements have been published by a scientific body, but the year backdated? 
Because a lot of the other stuff you&#39;ve said here has been opposite to the facts, so I worry that you&#39;re mistaken about this too.Look at what they implement if you want to know why they yell. Massive, dirty lithium mines, and other heavy metal mining operations stripping the earth for electric car batteries.Oh, good to see you&#39;re concerned about the environment. Is it only the impact of lithium mines that concerns you, and those heavy metals that are used for batteries? Because Humanity uses many resources for many things.A single 3 Megawatt (MW) wind turbine requires 335 tons of steel, 4.7 tons of copper, 3 tons of aluminum, 2 tons of rare earths and 1,200 tons of concrete.Infrastructure takes resources. Roads. Coal Plants. Bridges. Wind Turbines. Wind turbines produce the cheapest electricity there is with no fuel costs, no fuel logistics, and without greenhouse emissions during operation. You&#39;re welcome to be a luddite, but if you&#39;re concerned about concrete, shouldn&#39;t you start complaining about roads?They cost more in energy, created mostly by fossil fuels to create than they will ever offset.Nope.  The embodied energy in a wind turbine, that is, the energy used in its manufacture, transport, erection and operation is generally paid back within 6-12 months of operation. [todayshomeowner.com] Those massive composite blades last 20 -25 years and to this date they have no idea how to recycle any of the blade.Carbon fibre and fibreglass aren&#39;t easy to recycle, but:

It blows me away that you can post in a thread with multiple links to how much the ice sheets are shedding mass, and claim that the Ice sheets are growing. 
[B]etween 2002 and 2025, Antarctica shed approximately 135 gigatons of ice per year [nasa.gov]. 
[B]etween 2002 and 2025, Greenland shed approximately 264 gigatons of ice per year [nasa.gov].

How exactly did you shit that out? Are those OCR errors?

Nobody gives a fuck whether the climate before we existed would have supported us. What matters is now and this is an unprecedented situation with previously unseen rates of change.

Okey dokey coward. Run along and let the adults have a conversation now, I hear your mom calling me.

Is it warming? Probably (hard to tell with all the &#39;smoothing&#39; and &#39;adjusting&#39; of data going on, but I&#39;d agree it probably is.)No, it&#39;s not hard to tell at all.Is it driven by humans? Utterly not, though almost certainly we&#39;re aggravating it.The current trend line&#39;s deviation from the long term cyclical glacial periods of the Quaternary ice age is 100% driven by human activity. Period.Is it faster than ever, historically speaking? Utterly not.That&#39;s actually hard to say, but also not relevant.
In times when it may have, we simply do not have decade-resolution temperature data.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org] = 90% of the last 500m years has been warmer than today.Absolutely true. Humans evolved, basically in whole, during the Quaternary. It&#39;s not clear we will even be able to survive when Earth leaves it.
This has nothing to do with climate change right now

The oceans have also been 3-5m higher than they are now. I agree we shouldn&#39;t make things worse than needed, but let&#39;s not forget that the climate changes on its own up and down over time.

Rate of change matters.  Just because I can use the brakes in my car to reduce speed slowly doesn&#39;t mean stopping by hitting a brick wall at full speed is at all safe.

Ecosystems need time to adjust to new temperatures, so they don&#39;t collapse.

The last ice age has been retreating for the last 20k years. There was a bit of a cooling period from 13,500 to 12,500 years ago, and another form but nothing like a real ice age.

The oil and gas companies you mean? All of it, and all of our lives as well.

>> The usual state for the Earth is tropical all over, with no ice at the poles.

>> Eh. They&#39;re right. You will find that evidence yourself if you go look.

According to wikipedia;&quot;Throughout Earth&#39;s climate history (Paleoclimate) its climate has fluctuated between two primary states: greenhouse and icehouse Earth. Both climate states last for millions of years &quot;

So, not usually &quot;tropical all over, with no ice at the poles&quot;.

So, not usually &quot;tropical all over, with no ice at the poles&quot;.Yes, it is.

Nothing in your quote stated the equivalence of the time periods past &quot;last for millions of years&quot;.
I.e., the quote was correct. You just read what you wanted to read into it.

What I find most bizarre, is that there&#39;s literally a graph directly under where you copy-pasted that showing where, and how long, the Ice Ages lasted.
If you had gone down even further, it would have literally listed them for you, and then you could simply do the math showing that 4160 > 609.

It is not a panic, and it is not a zero sum game.   Certainly you agree on the trends of CO2 in the atmosphere, and the increase in Temperatures?  Yes?

Build &quot;all of the above&quot; energy sources, I think.   Let the market win.

PS. I suspect the coal plants China is building is a hedge against a nuclear war.

Yeah, like the negative temperatures across the entire midwest and upper midwest as well as the mid-atlantic region to New England.

I guess climate for a region is different than for weather in one area.

I think that is partially true.  The gulf stream may stop in the next 50 years.  I think that even this POSSIBILITY is cause for alarm.

The boomers thought pattern is that they got theirs, and screw everybody else.

As part of: &quot;Everybody Else&quot;, I don&#39;t agree, even if you are a Tyrannical Majority.

In January, Florida Rep. Randy Fine made a typically bigoted post on X about his colleague in the House of Representatives, Ilhan Omar. The post was in conversation with a specious right-wing conspiracy alleging that Omar’s net worth had increased, nefariously, through a variety of unspecified means—perhaps cryptically linked back to her Somali heritage. Fine asserted that to “solve all this,” Omar ought to be “denaturalized and deported.” The ugliness of the comment prompted Rick Wilson—former Republican strategist, he of the magnanimous Lincoln Project—to step forward. In earlier eras of discourse, the Lincoln Project attempted to coalesce an anti-Trump movement by appealing to our better angels; brandishing Sorkin-ish platitudes about the Soul of America. (There is a reason the organization name-checks the 16th president.) But Wilson took a much different approach here. Rather than addressing the content of Fine’s character, Wilson homed in on something else: The congressman is very, very fat.

“Hunting you with harpoons and whaleboats would solve all this,” said Wilson, parroting Fine’s diction. Among the responses threaded below Wilson’s retort, one is an edit of promotional materials for a 2011 television adaptation of Moby-Dick. In it, Fine has been photoshopped in place of the whale.

It goes without saying that for a very long time, fat-shaming a politician was previously verboten in the liberal playbook. I also do not possess the wherewithal to cast judgement on whether Fine—who has expressed some genuinely bloodthirsty sentiments about Palestinians—deserves to be bullied in such a way. But what I can say is that, right now, we are in the midst of a marked pivot in the way the Democratic Party interfaces with its opposition. The shift in attitude hasn’t been firmly diagrammed; instead, what’s going on here is mostly subconscious, like a collective unlocking of forbidden territory. There was a period of time in the late 2010s where liberal hostility toward MAGAdom was screened for all potential vectors of transgression, and a seemingly infinite number of potential -isms or -phobias. The philosophy was well-intentioned, but it also solidified the Democrats as the party of pedants (or narcs, or nerds, or rule-followers). Now in the wreckage of the post-Biden era, some liberals have started to alter their approach. If sweeping appeals to our collective empathy have failed to resonate—if the public is not moved by Randy Fine’s intersectional shortcomings—maybe we are better off getting down in the muck.

There is no perfect name for this dynamic, but some have begun to refer to it, somewhat facetiously, as “Dark Woke.” In the most basic definition, Dark Woke is a social covenant that allows for liberals to be extra mean to conservatives, by encouraging a style of avarice that deliberately crosses the red lines previously established within the progressive orthodoxy. The concept is difficult to articulate, but it’s easily felt. Dark Woke manifests when the liberal pundit Kyle Kulinski tweets out an A.I. rendering of Erika Kirk and J.D. Vance standing side by side at a wedding altar, or when the Democratic Party’s X account accuses Stephen Miller of being cuckolded by Elon Musk, or when Pete Hegseth is dressed down for being a drunk. You can sense it manifesting into corporeal space when Virginia Attorney General Jay Jones crushes the field after fantasizing about the death of MAGA-born children, or when Graham Platner—the guy with the Nazi tattoo—remains competitive for Maine’s Senate seat despite his generational baggage. With the midterms growing nearer, it’s becoming clear that some forces within the Democratic apparatus are betting that Dark Woke can be wielded as an effective electoral strategy. One of the lessons of the current political environment is that Americans crave authenticity. Maybe the only way to consummate that desire is by hitting below the belt.

Dark Woke has only been in the bloodstream for a short amount of time. It initially entered the lexicon in the early weeks of 2025, when both the Democratic Party and any sense of American consensus had been shattered by Donald Trump’s comeback victory. Nobody is exactly sure who originally coined the term, but ground zero, according to the internet historians at KnowYourMeme, might be a post made by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez one day before the inauguration. Ocasio-Cortez was replying to LibsofTikTok, a popular X account and one of the more prominent agitators in the MAGA propaganda ecosystem. LibsofTikTok took issue with AOC referring to Trump as a rapist; the congresswoman responded by mimicking the brusque diction of the right. “Oh are you triggered? Cry more,” she wrote, accumulating 17.6 million views in the process.

The candor was refreshing in those confusing times, so much so that one day later, another poster on X theorized that she might have inculcated a new social contract—a “proto Dark Woke”—that liberals could take with them going forward. The poster surmised the texture of the reinvention by positing an instructive question: “Who will the first Democrat to call Republicans retarded be?”

Thus, the Dark Woke thesis was born: Democrats need to open up new persuasive terrain, and by and large, that terrain needs to be unshackled by circumspect language temperance—call it Woke Classic—than ever before. In a way, this conclusion conceded the postelection conclusion of a conservative cultural victory. If the arc of history is indeed tilting rightward, then Dark Woke acknowledges that the Democratic brand had grown too uptight, which must be rectified with a kind of reverse virtue signaling. (It is telling, for instance, that in the weeks before her clapback, Ocasio-Cortez removed the “She/Her” pronouns from her Twitter bio.) Naturally, a number of strivers were early adopters of this brewing vibe shift, branding themselves as heralds for this intrepid age of offense. Chief among those interlopers was Rep. Jasmine Crockett, who is currently running for a Texas Senate seat, and who came to national fame after referring to former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as a “bleach-blonde, bad-built, butch body,” and, later on, the wheelchair-using Gov. Greg Abbott as “Governor Hot Wheels.” Meanwhile, presidential hopeful Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is eternally pliable to whichever way the wind is blowing, popularized California’s redistricting campaign with a Trump-affected shitposting parody. (Newsom has never called Trump the R-word, but he’s easily the odds-on favorite.)

As Dark Woke gained fluency, most pundits concluded that the trend would never amount to anything other than a temper tantrum. “Dark Woke is cringe,” offered New York magazine. “Dark Woke will not work for Democrats,” added the National Review. The fundamentals of the argument were rock solid. For one, Dark Woke is a movement that exists almost entirely online, and it resonates most with highly engaged Democrats rather than with mercurial swing voters who are mostly concerned about the price of eggs. Second, no matter whatever else you say about them, figures like Donald Trump and Stephen Miller are bona fide outsiders. They can claim the mantle of the firebrand, which is forever out of reach for an institutional figure like Newsom.

With all that said, I have been surprised to see certain Dark Woke principles diffuse into the rank-and-file Democratic voting population. The base appears to be demonstrably more bloodthirsty than it ever was during Trump’s first term, almost like they’ve finally been granted an opportunity to satiate a long-unquenched rage, absent any platitudinal hedging. I am reminded of a video that went viral shortly before the November elections, in which a typical MAGA grievance aggregator interviewed a woman holding a cardboard sign at one of those “No Kings” protests. The interviewer is pushing her on the assassination of Charlie Kirk, seeking empathy for the recently departed podcaster. The woman, of course, gives no quarter.

“He was horrible. I’m glad he’s not here,” she said. “He was horrible on the campuses. A horrible person.” The interviewer, taken aback, asked if she’d be happy if the interviewer were assassinated, too.

“Maybe, I’d have to think about it,” she replied.

What was it that Michelle Obama said during Hillary Clinton’s coronation? “When they go low, we go high.” Voicing a sentiment like that today might get you booed out of the building. And yet, it needs to be acknowledged that according to MAGA media enterprises, liberal discourse has long been vulgar and hateful. Given the chance, the thinking went, they’d round up all of us “America First” patriots in a Soviet-style purge.

The right’s narrative of a bloodthirsty Democratic Party was, well, at odds with party voters’ 2020 decision to bypass a host of progressive options in favor of the rigidly moderate Joe Biden. But the right isn’t wrong about the long-standing loathing of Trump and everything he represents. I mean, one of the first controversies that surfaced after Trump’s initial ascension in 2016 centered around a photo shoot starring Kathy Griffin. She was posing with a prop of the president’s severed head.

But if you asked me why the Dark Woke opposition during Trump’s second term feels different, I’d assert that, while opposition to Trump during his first term was intense, it was also championed by a murderers’ row of grifters and mediocrities; Michael Avenatti, Andrew Cuomo, the Krassenstein brothers, and those same Lincoln Project guys. Ultimately, the loudest of those voices wielded anti-Trump advocacy as a vehicle for their own enrichment, buttressing presidential campaigns, podcast networks, and thrice-weekly Substacks. It worked, Trump did lose in 2020, but the #Resistance was left with a distinct careerist sheen—buoyed by discretionary restraint—lacking the organic force of, say, a soul-buckling fat joke. As The Outline saliently noted in 2019, this disposition seemed to suggest a holier-than-thou elitism. Calling the president a Cheeto was fine, but making fun of Charlie Kirk was not.

But the means of engagement have been altered, maybe permanently, in the tumult of this current political armageddon. MAGAdom is the party in power; naturally, their opponents are choosing to meet them on the battlefield of their choosing. With that said, I do think some surprising sensitivities within the conservative doctrine have come into view, as the movement sublimates into the uncomfortable posture of the establishment. This was most clear during Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s occupation of Minnesota, after masked agents killed Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Among the many faulty narratives that orbited out of the government, one asked us to consider the mental anguish suffered by these dispatched officers. J.D. Vance himself wondered if his roving band of goons would “feel safe” during the aftermath of those murders. Put on the defensive, Vance and his contemporaries have occasionally fallen back on the diction of the soft, snowflake liberalism they claim to hate. But in an ironic twist, the right has already provided the perfect blueprint to nullify shrill emotional terrorism. To quote AOC, “Cry more.”

Of course, this gets us back to the central anxiety of the moment. Is Dark Woke good? For the soul? For the body? For the future? I was socialized in the crucible of millennial progressivism. I have long believed that it is unkind to make fun of someone for their weight, that I should prune the slurs out of my lexicon, that I should refrain from laughing at the misfortune of those who have recently met a tragic end. Dark Woke asks us to make special exceptions for the aberrant forces in our midst—to bully insecurities, to express our anger viscerally—because their sins are great enough to eclipse the worst things any of us can say about them. After all, it is difficult to conflate language with violence when the violence itself has become so plainly visible. It remains to be seen if Dark Woke can grow potent enough to outweigh the sun-blotting forces of Dark MAGA, or if fickle centrists find all of this liberal rage more alienating than relatable. But I—and millions of other Americans—do know what it feels like to be alive in 2026. I never want to go high ever again.

After months of watching federal agents terrorize communities all across the country in the name of immigration enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security’s top brass sat before Congress on Tuesday to answer questions about the deaths of Renée Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, the detention of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos, and the fates of countless others who have been caught in the crosshairs of the president’s mass deportation effort. Though Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, mostly deflected any responsibility and insisted that the agency conducts only targeted arrests, Democrats came prepared with receipts to remind us all just how blatantly racist and out of control the White House’s immigration agenda has been.

“You are only here because public outrage has become so unavoidable,” Rep. LaMonica McIver, of New Jersey, said during the House Homeland Security Committee’s oversight hearing. McIver is being prosecuted by the Trump administration over an incident in New Jersey when she was barred from entering a detention facility. “You are here, Mr. Lyons, because white people are getting shot in the face and chest when the cameras are rolling.”

Lyons remained straight-faced, offering no explanation for his agents’ extreme use of force or denial about his agents’ racial profiling of Americans. That profiling is something the Supreme Court essentially endorsed last year, after the justices issued a decision allowing the federal government to stop Hispanic migrants based on their “apparent ethnicity,” as well as other factors, like if they have an accent or work certain types of jobs. This, predictably, has led ICE to overwhelmingly target Black and brown Americans with excessive force.

Indeed, this was one of the main subtexts of the hearing. New Jersey Rep. Nellie Pou, for example, asked, “Mr. Lyons, I speak Spanish. If I wasn’t wearing my member pin, would me being a Latina and speaking Spanish be enough for ICE agents to harass me or shove me into one of your unmarked cars?”

Lyons answered no, but as Pou and other Democratic representatives pointed out, this has not been borne out by the reality on the ground; even off-duty officers have recently been profiled by ICE. When Rep. Troy Carter, of Louisiana, directly asked Lyons if his agency was arresting or deporting Americans, Lyons denied that it was “arresting” Americans, before quickly adding that it did “detain” Americans. As Carter pointed out, this was a distinction without a difference.

When it came to the way agents currently present themselves to Americans, New York Rep. Tim Kennedy asked whether Lyons would instruct his agents to no longer wear masks and institute a uniform that includes visible identification—one of 10 demands congressional Democrats are requesting in the ongoing negotiations over whether to fund DHS beyond Saturday’s deadline. Lyons immediately retorted, “No.”

And when Rep. Eric Swalwell, of California, asked Lyons if he would apologize for his department calling Good and Pretti “domestic terrorists,” he refused. Lyons also insisted that when his agents arrested Ramos as he made his way home from preschool with his father, “the men and women of ICE took care of him.” Later in the hearing, Lyons also claimed that agents played the boy’s favorite song and got him McDonald’s. Meanwhile, it took the intervention of Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro for a visibly unwell Ramos to be released from detention. The administration immediately tried to detain him again.

This was just one of many moments when administration officials offered what felt like a completely different reality from what people on the ground are experiencing with ICE officers.

Rep. Seth Magaziner, of Rhode Island, brought up the case of federal agents in Chicago, who pepper-sprayed a 1-year-old as she sat in the back seat of her father’s car. “Is it proper procedure to aim pepper spray into the window of a moving vehicle?” Magaziner asked Rodney Scott, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, who also testified. “We try to avoid that,” he said.

Magaziner continued to push. “Were any of your agents investigated or disciplined for this?”

“I’ll have to get back to you,” Scott said.

Magaziner then showed a video and zoomed-in photo of an agent firing pepper spray directly into the face of a protester who was pinned to the ground by multiple agents and asked if this was proper procedure for the use of pepper spray. “I cannot respond to that because you’re only showing one piece, and that subject is clearly not compliant,” Scott said, while refusing to confirm whether there was an open investigation into those agents.

“Your agency has been repeatedly caught on tape using violence against civilians, and you can’t even tell me if any of these agents have been investigated or disciplined,” Magaziner said. “You are supposed to be making people safer, and instead your agents are being unnecessarily violent.”

Tuesday’s hearing was the first time ICE leadership has testified before Congress under the second Trump administration, as the White House agreed to the testimony in a clear attempt to contain the fallout from Good’s and Pretti’s deaths. Though it will not immediately solve the current chaos being wreaked by the president and his mass deportation mastermind Stephen Miller, the hearing did serve as a cathartic moment of rage. For a brief period of time, Democrats accurately embodied the feelings of Americans all across the country who are facing ICE in their communities with no real defense.

“Sorry, I don’t mean to interrupt you guys.” The man crunches his way toward us, through this snow-covered field and past rows upon rows of identical wooden tombstones, then gestures back in the direction he came from. “I wanted to make sure you’re aware that there’s ICE right there.”

This is how it happens, I was told the day before. Immigration and Customs Enforcement moves fast in Minneapolis, the way you have to when an entire city is against you. Volunteers call in license plates to volunteers who check those plates against databases created by other volunteers. Once identified, these agents have minutes at best before residents with whistles and horns and furious loud voices gather to alert their neighbors to the threat in their midst. If you’re more than five minutes away from a sighting, odds are you’ll be too late. No, the best way to find ICE in Minneapolis is to stay in one place. Go about your day. Eventually, you’ll see them.

I am standing with two Minneapolis residents who go by Tim and Star, looking out at the Say Their Names memorial. The art installation consists of over 100 tombstones, each with identical black fists and names I remember from 2020. Philandro Castile. Ahmaud Arbery. And, of course, George Floyd, who took his final breath two blocks south of here. Minneapolis is no stranger to tragedy, or to the white-hot spotlight of international media attention, or to banding together in the face of a crisis.

“In some ways, it primed the pump,” Tim told me, referring to the George Floyd protests in the summer of 2020. Like everyone I spoke to, Tim and Star ascribe Minneapolis’ successful mobilization to lessons learned during that time.

“We have a lot of media coming in and asking, ‘Oh, what’s your organization? Who are you with?’ And it’s like, we don’t have an organization. We’re not with anyone,” Star told me.

“We’re just neighbors. That’s how we know each other,” Tim confirmed. “We live here.”

Star nodded. “ One of the things that I’m not sure that people are realizing outside of Minneapolis: The headlines say that Alex Pretti was a protester,” they say. “He wasn’t at a protest. He wasn’t at—”

And then we turned to watch the man approaching us through the snow—the man now telling us ICE has pulled up by an apartment building across the field. “We’ve got the block, we’re situated,” he says. “I just want to make sure—in case anybody’s targetable or something like that.”

None of us are targetable. Tim and Star want to help, and I want to see the action.

Just as roadkill summons vultures, so too does human misery summon journalists, who travel across the country to shove cameras and recorders at people enduring things no one should experience. People in Minneapolis broadly understand that documentation is important, that the world needs to know what’s happening, that journalists can help spread the word. But the line between journalism and pornography grows vanishingly thin at times like these. Newsworthy tales of ICE atrocities can easily become violent entertainment for a ravenous national audience; action-movie sequences carried out by caricatures, grief and trauma commodified for mass consumption.

Star offers me a 3D-printed orange whistle and I open my mouth to say that as a journalist I can’t participate—but the words won’t come out. A sudden vision of myself in the future, talking to grand-nieces and -nephews: Yes, I had a chance to warn people about the secret police coming to abduct them, disappear them, or release them into this dangerous cold without a coat or cell phone, but journalistic ethics, you see …

At last, the cars arrive. The bearded man gives us a count: One, two, three …

The noise is deafening: Horns blare, whistles pierce the piercing cold. “ICE OUT!” the residents chant, over and over again. “We are all Minneapolis!” someone shouts. “We are all Minnesota! We are all the motherfucking United States of America!”

The world might breathe a sigh of relief, but Minneapolis can’t afford it. ICE is here, and ICE has killed, and ICE may kill again. Here the city stands: residents with whistles standing against men with guns and flak vests.

The ICE SUV stays put despite the unrelenting noise and a neighborhood now on high alert. I start shivering five minutes in; the man in sweatpants and Crocs appears unbothered. There are over 30 people here now; residents have heeded the call or arrived from rapid-response patrol. A white Toyota stops between the crowd and the SUV and a man with a mustache leans out the passenger window with a camera: no words, no eye contact, just the indifferent glassy eye of a zoom lens and fingers to focus it on people as they do something others have died doing.

Someone has brought a megaphone; residents take turns leading chants. “My grandmother was a sharecropper in Arkansas, and I know that this is the same thing,” a man shouts at one point as whistles shrill and a handheld siren wails. “The same fight that my people fought, the same fight that my grandma fought, is the same fight that we are fighting to protect our undocumented migrant neighbors!”

ICE-watch reports more agents incoming, but the crowd has only grown and no one is going anywhere. Five minutes becomes 10, 10 becomes 15. “All right folks, we’re going to sing ‘We are not afraid!’ ” someone shouts into the megaphone, and so they do; not shouting or chanting but singing, in tune and with one voice:

We are not afraid We are not afraid We are not afraid today

Oh, deep in my heart I do believe That we are not afraid today

And then, to the sound of sporadic laughter, the amplified voice sings a slightly altered version:

ICE will leave ICE will leave Oh, deep in my heart I do believe ICE will leave RIGHT THE FUCK NOW! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MINNEAPOLIS! THIS IS OUR FUCKING STREET!

Laughter and cheers and the handheld siren wails and the man with the megaphone keeps shouting: “The people are not with you! The people are with us! And they want you to get the fuck out of our city!”

A few minutes later, the SUV lurches forward, then drives slowly down the street. The residents cheer and taunt and follow from a safe distance. Whatever the bastards had planned for the apartment complex will have to wait for another day. “That’s the most exciting laundry I’ve ever done,” a man with a gray beard says dryly, then walks back into everyday life, to the extent that everyday life is possible anymore.

Why do people continue to push back, knowing what it might mean? It’s the question I’m here to ask, and so I approach two people and ask it. “ I’d love to know what inspires you to come out here, knowing that people have been killed doing this shit. You can also tell me to fuck off.”

The resident studies me for several seconds. “I’m not going to tell you to fuck off,” she says at last. “But I don’t think I want to answer.”

“It feels like the only way through it is through it,” Tim says when I ask him the same question a few minutes later. “Some of this is—it’s happening to us. And it’s a choice to stand up, but—” He pauses. “We don’t have a lot of options.”

The day before this standoff on 37th and Columbus, I spent all day in a rapid-response chat with dozens of volunteers: people who had to excuse themselves to pick up kids from school, people on their way home willing to spare an hour to keep their community safe. The tone was matter-of-fact, direct, resolute, but moments of fear crept in. I could hear it in the voice of a woman who reported an ICE agent getting out of his car, and in two watchers who declined to follow an agent who drove “aggressively” toward them in his car. “Stay safe,” they told each other by way of goodbye, with the kind of intensity reserved for people who understand that might not be possible.

Later that night, I went to a “Hotel Wide-Awake” demonstration outside the four-star Hilton in downtown Minneapolis where ICE has rented a block of rooms. Hundreds of protesters stood outside in subzero temperatures and made as much noise as possible—banging pots, blowing whistles, drumming on buckets, blowing trombones and trumpets. Police in riot gear stood menacingly in front of the hotel, then eventually dispersed the protest by force around 10 p.m.

“I’m not as afraid as I thought I would be,” a woman who goes by L told me at the Hilton Wide-Awake. She wore a backpack with a piece of paper taped to the back that said “Free Supplies”: first aid, handwarmers, earplugs. “I guess I just feel like I can take it, so I want to put myself as a body here. They can’t hurt all of us if it’s really big, and there are a lot of people who can’t necessarily be out here or don’t want to take the risk. But because I feel like I can accept that risk, I have to.”

In three days, I will drive out of Minneapolis and back to my home in New York City. Tim, and Star, and the man with the beard, and the woman who did not want to answer—these people are already home. No one asked them if they wanted to be on the front lines of the fight against ICE. They did not volunteer for this assignment. The assignment came to them.

“I wish I had the answer for why are we doing it,” Star says. “It’s an act of service. I don’t know. And it’s—so you can’t save everybody, right? And you maybe can’t even save anybody. Like maybe all we do is frustrate. You know, give someone one more day with their daughter or their dad. But if you lost your dad, or you lost your daughter, you would give anything to have one more day with them. And that’s what we can do.”

            <h2>UK unveils telecoms charter to curb mid-contract bill shocks</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/12/uk_telco_charter/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK government claims a new Telecoms Consumer Charter will stop customers being hit by unexpected bill increases and offer clearer pricing when signing up to deals.

Britain&#39;s Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) says major telco providers - BT, Virgin Media O2 (VMO2), the newly conjoined VodafoneThree, Sky, and TalkTalk - have signed up to new commitments under the charter.

The charter, however, appears to be nothing more than a voluntary code of conduct with no legal enforcement.

The providers attended a Wednesday roundtable hosted by Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall. The move follows a November letter from the pair asking telcos to confirm &quot;customers under contract will not face price rises beyond those that they signed up to.&quot;

The government claims customers will know exactly what they&#39;ll be paying when they sign up for mobile or broadband deal, with no unexpected price hikes midway through a contract. Note: not no price rises - just no unexpected ones. The charter requires providers give clear upfront information about future price changes.

The text of the Telecoms Consumer Charter is available here, so Reg readers can see what it says for themselves, but we&#39;ve included a taster.

Crucially, customers should always receive clear and easily understandable information about their telecoms services and prices, and any changes, so they know exactly what they are paying for and why.

All providers commit that &quot;where a contract includes a mid‑contract price increase, the core subscription price (monthly payment) for their service that customers sign up to is the price that they will pay. Any exception to this is limited strictly to unforeseeable and externally driven events that materially affect the cost of providing services.&quot;

This follows O2&#39;s decision last year to lift prices beyond original contract expectations, which prompted scrutiny from Ofcom. The regulator previously banned mid-contract price rises unless providers let customers leave penalty-free - O2 simply told customers they knew where the door was if they didn&#39;t like it.

The charter states that for customers still on legacy inflation-linked T&Cs, April 2026 will be the final increase expressed this way, after which all contracts are to move to the clearer pounds-and-pence system.

Signatories also commit to easier switching by through One Touch Switching, Text‑to‑Switch, and related processes remain &quot;quick, simple, and seamless.&quot;

However, the relatively short text in the charter doesn&#39;t appear to carry any legal weight, making it simply a voluntary code with no penalties for breaking its terms.

&quot;We remain skeptical about how the Telecoms Consumer Charter will protect customers who have been hit by mid-contract price rises. This appears to be a belated and weak response to providers testing how far they can push price increases during fixed-term deals,&quot; said Alex Tofts, broadband expert at comparison site Broadband Genie.

Paddy Paddison, CEO of the Independent Networks Cooperative Association, took the opposite stance: &quot;INCA welcomes this engagement between government, Ofcom and industry through the Telecoms Consumer Charter.&quot;

&quot;Customers should be able to understand, in plain pounds and pence, what they are signing up to and what they can expect to pay. It is important these commitments are practical and maintain the conditions for continued investment and network competition, because that is what delivers better coverage, service quality and value over time.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) is offering between £270,000 to £300,000 for a senior digital leader who will oversee more than £4.6 billion in spending and more than 3,000 specialist staff.

The Director General Defence Chief Digital & Information Officer – or DG DCD&IO – will &quot;bring board‑level influence, commercial acumen, and the ability to drive cross‑enterprise alignment in service of national security,&quot; according to the job advert.

Information published with the advert adds that the DG DCD&IO will work on creating a single digital strategy for defense, a digital backbone that all military systems will connect to by default and exploiting machine learning and artificial intelligence &quot;for war-fighters&#39; advantage.&quot;

The DG DCD&IO will be a UK national and will have to clear Developed Vetting, the highest of the UK&#39;s five main security clearance levels. They can choose to work at the Defence Digital office in Corsham in Wiltshire or the MoD&#39;s headquarters in Westminster, with frequent international travel required as part of working with NATO and Five Eyes partners. Applications close on March 2.

The pay is similar to the £285,000 recently offered by England&#39;s Department of Health and Social Care for its head of technology, digital and data.

The MoD has a couple of officials on similar amounts with Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin paid £315,000 to £320,000 and Andy Start, Chief Executive of Defence Equipment and Support, receiving £290,000 to £295,000 in the last financial year, according to the MoD&#39;s 2024-25 annual report.

The DG DCD&IO will also be responsible for commercial relationships with IT suppliers. Perhaps the most prominent of these is with US security specialist Palantir, which this week held a reception in Mayfair for around 100 people to &quot;celebrate the next chapter in our partnership with the Ministry of Defence,&quot; according to The Times.

The MoD directly awarded Palantir a three-year data analytics contract worth £240.6 million at the end of December. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most UK government departments have spent little or nothing with social media platform X since July 2024 following an unpublished 2023 evaluation by the Cabinet Office. But the Department for Education has bucked the trend, spending £27,118.

Education minister Olivia Bailey said the department and its agencies spent £4,834.80 with X in the nine months between July 1, 2024, and the company&#39;s acquisition by xAI on March 28, 2025. The department then upped this to £22,283.32 over roughly ten months to January 19.

The money went on &quot;sector comms and awareness,&quot; Bailey said in a written parliamentary answer to Conservative MP Jack Rankin. The Register has contacted the department to ask why it has continued to spend relatively significant amounts with X.

Six departments have spent nothing with X since July 2024, ministers said in response to a series of written parliamentary questions from Jack Rankin and Peter Fortune, another Conservative MP. &quot;Paid advertising on X was suspended in April 2023 following a Safe Framework assessment,&quot; justice minister Jake Richards replied. &quot;X is currently used only for organic (non-paid) content to communicate policies and public services. No expenditure has been made by the Ministry of Justice with X since July 2024.&quot;

Ministers in the Cabinet Office, Department for Work and Pensions, Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, and HM Treasury said their departments had spent nothing with X over the period while the Home Office said this was the case for its communications directorate.

At seven other departments, ministers said they had spent relatively small amounts on the platform&#39;s monitoring services rather than paid advertising. The Department for Transport spent £783.30 on X Premium and X Premium+ services, while the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spent just £9.60 in August 2024 &quot;to use the livestreaming functionality available with X Premium at a departmental event,&quot; according to minister Dame Angela Eagle.

Many ministers mentioned a Safe Framework assessment by the Cabinet Office&#39;s Government Communication Service carried out in April 2023. In a written answer last July, Labour peer Baroness Anderson of Stoke-on-Trent told Liberal Democrat Lord Pack that &quot;Safe is the single, comprehensive framework&quot; used by the government for such assessments, which take place &quot;when there are significant platform updates.&quot; She said that since the most recent assessment in April 2023, X has only been used for unpaid communications activity.

In December, the Cabinet Office refused a Freedom of Information request [PDF] to publish the Safe assessment of X on the grounds that it would undermine the formulation and development of government policy. It did say X had most recently been assessed during 2025, suggesting a review during the second half of last year. Officials had most recently assessed TikTok and YouTube in 2025, Reddit in 2022, and Facebook and Instagram in 2018, while Bluesky had not been assessed.

Some local authorities including Devon County Council and Southampton City Council have stopped posting and monitoring their X accounts.

Oxfordshire County Council and the county&#39;s district councils have said they will close accounts completely over the next few months.

&quot;In recent months, we have seen that X has become less effective as an engagement channel and has contributed to a less safe online environment for local communities,&quot; the county council said in a statement in late January, adding it was &quot;deeply concerned about the rise in online hate speech and abuse targeting women and girls.&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/12/google_china_apt31_gemini/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Chinese government hacking group that has been sanctioned for targeting America&#39;s critical infrastructure used Google&#39;s AI chatbot, Gemini, to auto-analyze vulnerabilities and plan cyberattacks against US organizations, the company says.

While there&#39;s no indication that any of these attacks were successful, &quot;APT groups like this continue to experiment with adopting AI to support semi-autonomous offensive operations,&quot; Google Threat Intelligence Group chief analyst John Hultquist told The Register. &quot;We anticipate that China-based actors in particular will continue to build agentic approaches for cyber offensive scale.&quot;

In the threat-intel group&#39;s most recent AI Threat Tracker report, released on Thursday and shared with The Register in advance, Google attributes this activity to APT31, a Beijing-backed crew also known as Violet Typhoon, Zirconium, and Judgment Panda.

This goon squad was one of many exploiting a series of Microsoft SharePoint bugs over the summer, and in March 2024, the US issued sanctions against and criminally charged seven APT31 members accused of breaking into computer networks, email accounts, and cloud storage belonging to numerous high-value targets.

The most recent attempts by APT31 to use Google&#39;s Gemini AI tool happened late last year, we&#39;re told.

&quot;APT31 employed a highly structured approach by prompting Gemini with an expert cybersecurity persona to automate the analysis of vulnerabilities and generate targeted testing plans,&quot; according to the report.

The adversaries&#39; adoption of this capability is so significant – it&#39;s the next shoe to drop

In one case, the China-based gang used Hexstrike, an open source, red-teaming tool built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to analyze various exploits - including remote code execution, web application firewall (WAF) bypass techniques, and SQL injection - &quot;against specific US-based targets,&quot; the Googlers wrote.

Hexstrike enables models, including Gemini, to execute more than 150 security tools with a slew of capabilities, including network and vulnerability scanning, reconnaissance, and penetration testing. Its intended use is to help ethical hackers and bug hunters find security weaknesses and collect bug bounties – but shortly after its release in mid-August, criminals began using the AI platform for more nefarious purposes.

Integrating Hexstrike with Gemini &quot;automated intelligence gathering to identify technological vulnerabilities and organizational defense weaknesses,&quot; the AI threat tracker says, noting that Google has since disabled accounts linked to this campaign. &quot;This activity explicitly blurs the line between a routine security assessment query and a targeted malicious reconnaissance operation.&quot;

Google&#39;s report, which picks up where its November 2025 analysis left off, details how government-backed groups and cybercriminals alike are abusing Google&#39;s AI tools, along with the steps the Chocolate Factory has implemented to stop them. And it finds that attackers - just like everybody else on the planet - have a keen interest in agentic AI&#39;s capabilities to make their lives and jobs easier.

&quot;The adversaries&#39; adoption of this capability is so significant - it&#39;s the next shoe to drop,&quot; Hultquist said.

He explained there are two areas that Google is most concerned about.

&quot;One is the ability to operate across the intrusion,&quot; he said, noting the earlier Anthropic report about Chinese cyberspies abusing its Claude Code AI tool to automate most elements of attacks directed at high-profile companies and government organizations. In &quot;a small number of cases,&quot; they even succeeded.

&quot;The other is automating the development of vulnerability exploitation,&quot; Hultquist said. &quot;These are two ways where adversaries can get major advantages and move through the intrusion cycle with minimal human interference. That allows them to move faster than defenders and hit a lot of targets.&quot;

In addition, using AI agents to find vulnerabilities and test exploits widens the patch gap - the time between the bug becoming known and a full working fix being deployed and implemented.

&quot;It&#39;s a really significant space currently,&quot; Hultquist said. &quot;In some organizations, it takes weeks to put defenses in place.&quot;

This requires security professionals to think differently about defense, using AI to respond and fix security weaknesses more quickly than humans can on their own.

&quot;We are going to have to leverage the advantages of AI, and increasingly remove humans from the loop, so that we can respond at machine speed,&quot; Hultquist noted.

The latest report also found an increase in model extraction attempts - what it calls &quot;distillation attacks&quot; - and says both GTIG and Google DeepMind identified miscreants attempting to perform model extraction on Google&#39;s AI products. This is a type of intellectual property theft used to gain insights into a model&#39;s underlying reasoning and chain-of-thought processes.

&quot;This is coming from threat actors throughout the globe,&quot; Hultquist said. &quot;Your model is really valuable IP, and if you can distill the logic behind it, there&#39;s very real potential that you can replicate that technology – which is not inexpensive.&quot;

This essentially gives criminals and shady companies the ability to accelerate AI model development at a much lower cost, and Google&#39;s report cites &quot;model stealing and capability extraction emanating from researchers and private sector companies globally.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">APRICOT 2026 Starlink can sometimes shift data more quickly than is possible on terrestrial networks, and improves connectivity in remote areas. But the space broadband service also presents new technical and regulatory challenges, according to speakers who took to the stage on Tuesday at the Asia Pacific Regional Internet Conference on Operational Technologies (APRICOT) in Jakarta, Indonesia.

The first discussion of Starlink at the event came from Karina Stefanovic, a wireless access network optimization engineer with Telekom Srbija, who used a conference session dedicated to network management explains she used the RIPE Atlas internet measurement network to compare data transmission speeds between Europe and Asia using Starlink and connections that started with 4G/5G networks.

Stefanovic found that Starlink carried data more quickly than connections that started on European cellular networks, despite the space broadband service often requiring more network hops and not using Tier 1 networks. She hypothesized that Starlink’s performance can be attributed to the satellite-to-satellite laser connections SpaceX employs, which route traffic across the satellite network so it can reach the most appropriate terrestrial egress point. That laser network, she suggested, should perhaps be considered a new routing layer for the internet.

In a later conference panel dedicated to the operational, policy, and resilience implications of internet access services delivered from low-Earth orbit, APNIC chief scientist Geoff Huston pointed out that Starlink can’t always land traffic in countries where its service is available. He said the countries surrounding Mongolia – China and Russia – are hostile to Starlink, so the space ISP lands traffic for Mongolian users in Japan then uses terrestrial links to reach the central Asian country.

Huston thinks that creates another issue, as Mongolian Starlink users therefore become reliant on Japanese regulators. He also asked conference attendees to consider that commercial aircraft are subject to the laws of whichever nation it touches down in, until its wheels leave the ground and the plane enters the jurisdiction of an airline’s home country. A Starlink user aboard the flight can therefore change jurisdiction during flight. Meanwhile, no nation has jurisdiction in space, where Starlink’s satellites circle.

Huston thinks regulators are aware that Starlink poses unusual legal challenges – and perhaps even a challenge to sovereignty – but that governments are mostly happy to ignore those issues because the service conveniently solves the problem of delivering broadband services to remote areas, an expensive job few nations have nailed.

Also on the panel, Doctor Ir. Ismail, the secretary general of Indonesia’s Ministry of Communications and Digital Affairs, confirmed the lure of space broadband for the nation, which spans 17,000 islands.

“The investment case is quite bleak for rural areas,” he said. Starlink offers a tantalizing alternative, and Dr. Ismail said SpaceX engaged sincerely with Indonesia’s government to address concerns about space broadband services allowing locals to circumvent regulations that prohibit online gambling, explicit material, and content felt to promote terrorism.

He said Starlink built a local network operation center and agreed to comply with Indonesian laws.

Job done? Not quite. Karina Stefanovic said her research showed she can see 13 Starlink satellites available from Serbia, population 6.5 million, but just four in Jakarta to serve a city of over 40 million souls.

And Huston pointed out that Starlink reconnect users to a different satellite every 15 seconds, nearly always drops packets during that process, and that IP routing looks for alternative routes when networks don’t offer clean paths. “You need a protocol that can adapt to Starlink,” he suggested. ®

            <h2>Cisco hikes prices to cover memory cost rises, says you don’t much care</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/12/cisco_q2_2026/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cisco has increased the prices for its hardware to cover the increased cost of memory and says the resulting bigger bills are not changing customers’ buying habits.

The networking giant discussed the price hikes on its Q2 2026 earnings call, during which CEO Chuck Robbins said Cisco has already announced price increases and will “continue to monitor market trends and make additional adjustments as necessary.” The CEO said Cisco is also “revising contractual terms with channel partners and customers to address evolving component prices,” and is using its scale to “help us negotiate favorable terms and secure supply to fulfill current and future demand.”

Robbins noted that networking appliances require less memory than servers, “So the price increases are more nominal” and he thinks buyers understand bigger bills aren’t Cisco’s fault.

“Customers get it. And while they may not like it, they understand that it&#39;s a dynamic that we&#39;re all dealing with,” he said.

CFO Mark Patterson said buyers haven’t changed plans due to memory price impacts.

“I haven&#39;t talked to any customers that are really willing to delay or defer any sort of strategic investments,” he said. Nor did customers try to get in early to buy kit at low prices before memory storage prices surged. “I think, frankly, also a lot of them understand that we&#39;ll probably be able to manage this a lot better than some of our peers, too.”

Cisco won $15.3 billion revenue for the quarter, a company record and a ten percent year-over-year jump.

Robbins said Cisco is surfing the AI wave in two ways.

One is selling upgrades to existing networks. “Legacy infrastructure was not designed for the performance, speed and security needs of AI,” he said.

The other is selling to hyperscalers, and that’s more complicated because Robbins said they are “lumpy” buyers. Cisco announced it won $2.1 billion of orders from hyperscalers in the quarter and said that represents “a significant acceleration in growth” as that sum was $800 million higher than the previous quarter, and higher than all orders from hyperscalers in the previous financial year.

Financial analysts on the earnings call, however, felt those are tiny sums compared to the $635 billion that Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft plan to spend on infrastructure this year.

Robbins said hyperscalers like Cisco’s optics portfolio and its programmable Silicon One processors, and that sovereign clouds and neoclouds represent new opportunities.

Cisco has opportunities beyond AI. Robbins said buyers are at the beginning of a major multi-year, multi-billion-dollar campus networking refresh cycle. He also pointed to double-digit datacenter switching sales growth across in six of the last eight quarters.

The company forecast Q3 revenue of $15.4 to $15.6 billion, and a full-year haul of $61.2 to $61.7 billion. If achieved, both figures would be records for the company.

Investors weren’t satisfied. The company’s shares drifted down by almost one percent on Wednesday, then sent it tumbling 7.5 percent in after-hours trading. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After ICE raids, tear gassing protestors, and two killings, DHS “border czar” Tom Homan arrived in the Twin Cities to announce a winding down of immigration enforcement. But the battle has merely moved from the streets to the underground, and the city remains under siege.

Minneapolis was not the war zone I expected to find. Depending on who you are and where you live, things can seem, for a few fleeting moments, almost normal, like a few blocks or neighborhoods over people aren’t being tear gassed or rounded up by ICE or, in two tragic cases, being gunned down by federal agents. Even now some people walk their dogs, run errands and buy groceries, meet friends for dinner and drinks. Daily life has become sinister in its banality, because Minneapolis remains a city under siege. ICE and CBP agents roam the streets, though their tactics have shifted as of late: No longer acting like an occupying army, the Department of Homeland Security now operates like secret police. They do their best to blend in, to look like the people they terrorize, and in this, they often fail. Everyone knows that they’re there, that they’re watching. But they aren’t everywhere — not at once. The fear is that they will arrive at any moment, that they will take someone, that they will arrest or attack or kill anyone who gets in their way.

These fears have been realized. Children and parents have been snatched off the street while walking to school. People have been taken from their jobs and grabbed mid-commute, their empty cars left on the streets, hazard lights still flashing. And so those who are most vulnerable — immigrants at risk of deportation, US citizens who have learned that DHS will, depending on the color of a person’s skin, detain first and ask questions later — have retreated into their homes.

DHS has met unprecedented pushback in Minnesota. Residents of the Twin Cities have done everything in their power to hinder the occupation. Locals follow ICE on the streets, jeer agents outside their hotel rooms, and kick them out of restaurants. A robust mutual aid network has emerged virtually overnight to provide the most basic resources to families that have been forced into hiding. This widespread resistance has fueled a triumphalist narrative, one in which the community has banded together to protect their immigrant neighbors and Minnesota Nice has triumphed over fascism and xenophobia.

This is true and yet it isn’t. ICE has been slowed but not thwarted. Most national reporters, myself included, have left, but the story isn’t over. The siege is ongoing, and it has created a noticeable void. ICE may have lost the battle for public opinion, and its operation in the Twin Cities may be hampered by local pushback, but it has succeeded in one respect: It has instilled terror in Minnesota’s immigrant communities, forcing them into the shadows. The question that remains is how long this can go on, and how the community can rebuild once it ends.

“‘Odd’ doesn’t seem like a good enough word, but it’s the one I have, and it’s a very Minnesotan one, but it’s odd to live here right now,” Kai Shelley, a senior policy aide for Minneapolis City Council member Aisha Chughtai, told me. Chughtai, the council majority leader, represents Whittier, the neighborhood where Renee Good and Alex Pretti were killed.

“You walk down the street of Alex Pretti’s memorial and every business has a sign that says ‘ICE OUT’ or ‘Come in and get warm’ or is offering free water bottles and opening up their restrooms. There’s a lot of unity and resistance in that,” Shelley said. “So many people have stepped up to do rapid response and mutual aid. But the undercurrent of all of that, and the reason it’s happening, is because our immigrant neighbors can’t leave their homes, are afraid to send their kids to school, are afraid to do pickup and drop-off at schools, are afraid to go to work, can’t go to work, are afraid to be in the neighborhood. Immigrant-owned businesses are closing or are going to close. We won’t know the full toll for months.” Each person grabbed off the street and removed from the community causes a ripple effect. Every arrest is a warning: You could be next.

“There’s a real contradiction here right now. It’s eerie and it’s terrifying, and it’s inspiring and there’s resistance here. It’s always both.”

The occupation is inescapable. It’s all anyone can talk about. It’s visible on every street and every storefront, as is the community’s response. Signs on every door warn ICE not to enter without a warrant. Bundled-up people stand like sentinels, whistles hanging from their necks, watching over their blocks despite subzero temperatures. Groups of friends drive around their neighborhoods in search of ICE agents who troll around in unmarked cars. Each morning and afternoon, volunteers in neon vests station themselves outside the city’s schools to ensure students and parents make it home safely. No one person is doing everything, but nearly everyone who is out on the street is doing something.

“I couldn’t be a bystander anymore,” Sid, one of three people patrolling a corner of Lake Street, told me on a sunny, freezing afternoon. Sid, Kay, and a friend who declined to be named were stationed outside Karmel Mall, a once-bustling Somali shopping center just blocks from the site of Pretti’s killing. The vilification of the cities’ Somali residents, Kay said, is “disgusting, especially because the immigrant community here — and I’m sure across the nation — is so vibrant and supportive.” As we spoke, a Somali man exited Karmel Mall and thanked the patrollers for their work, offering them sambusas and chai to keep warm. “We can fight ICE, but we can’t fight the winter,” he told us. “I moved here because of the people. Really nice people, really good-hearted people.”

Some of this infrastructure was in place long before DHS kicked off Operation Metro Surge, its campaign in the Twin Cities. The American Indian Movement, founded in 1968, resumed armed patrols shortly after ICE descended on Minneapolis. Mutual aid organizations that sprung up around the city amid the racial justice protests of 2020 have reported an upsurge in demand, both from volunteers and people in need of support. This fact, too, is inescapable: People are missing. Cut off from the world, immigrants throughout the Twin Cities have been forced to turn over some of the most mundane and intimate parts of daily life to their neighbors: school pickup and drop-off, grocery shopping, and, in neighborhoods where ICE has been especially active, even trash collection, to avoid the possibility that agents will grab someone in the few yards between their front door and the curb.

Jae Yates, an organizer with the Community Aid Network, first noticed a shift in mid-January. The organization, founded in the wake of the George Floyd uprising, has distributed food and diapers to hundreds of families each week since the summer of 2020. Early this year, some regulars stopped showing up. “Now it’s mostly white folks picking up groceries on behalf of their neighbors,” Yates said. “Everyone who’s not white is terrified to go outside if they have any kind of precarity around citizenship.”

Even those who feel secure in their citizenship are at risk. White skin and American birth did not protect Renee Good or Alex Pretti. The government has suggested that observers are part of a vast conspiracy, and some protesters have been arrested on federal charges, while others say ICE has followed them to their homes. Because of this heightened surveillance, the majority of people I spoke to asked to be referred to by pseudonyms, often to discuss otherwise unremarkable activities like buying groceries for their neighbors or forming community watch programs.

Parallel ways of life have emerged. Nearly everyone I met said they feel more connected to their community than ever, but they also spoke of a glaring absence. Untold numbers of people are now cut off from the world beyond their doorstep. These are twin cities, operating in tandem; one cannot exist without the other.

For Jamila Keisar, a lifelong resident of the Twin Cities, the ICE occupation is reminiscent of past government abuses. “Minnesota isn’t new to this,” she told me. “I think of George Floyd, I think of Philando Castile, of Daunte Wright, of Jamar Clark. These were all super high-profile murders at the hands of law enforcement in our city. And these are just the ones we know about because they were caught on body cameras.”

Keisar, a Somali American therapist, said the DHS presence has resurfaced old traumas among some of her clients, many of whom were already victims of racial profiling. The vibrant community response to this latest crisis, she told me, is bittersweet. “I hear a lot of people say, ‘Why can’t things go back to how they were before?’” she said, “but when you ask communities of color how things were then, they’ll say, ‘Not great!’ But I’m hopeful.”

If this feels like a breaking point, it may be sobering to remember that there have been other ruptures before. George Floyd’s murder sparked worldwide protests, but eventually, for some people, life went on. “I think it’s really easy to go back to the status quo,” Keisar said. “My hope is that all the folks who seem to be waking up now can sustain themselves in a way that allows them to participate in this movement, because work still needs to be done even after ICE leaves.”

Last December, shortly after DHS announced Metro Surge, Keisar started offering free Sunday sessions for immigrants. “The number one thing I’m seeing is isolation and a lack of social connection folks are now experiencing because they’re sheltering in place,” she told me. Her clients are no longer “able to just stop at the coffee shop and have a small conversation in the way that you’re doing here today,” she said. “I fear what the ramifications will be of this moment and if things continue in this way.” Life has become so unbearable for some of her clients, Keisar told me, that they’ve started thinking about self-deporting.

A vital segment of the city’s population is now missing. Immigrant-owned businesses along Central Avenue have closed their doors; a few restaurants have cautiously reopened, shifting to takeout-only to protect workers and patrons alike. On a recent Sunday, Karmel Mall was nearly deserted. “It’s been empty the past few weeks,” the owner of a women’s clothing shop told me. The mall’s largely Somali American clientele has stopped coming, and its businesses are struggling. At a dinner in Minneapolis’ Standish neighborhood, a woman sidled up to me after learning I was a reporter, telling me her niece teaches English as a second language at a school that has been targeted by “right-wing agitators.” She showed me her latest attendance numbers: Out of 26 kids in her first-period class, just one showed up. A new tag has popped up, a haunting complement to the “FUCK ICE” and “ICE OUT” graffiti that has become ubiquitous throughout the city. Stenciled on walls and street signs, it reads: “A NEIGHBOR WAS TAKEN HERE.”

“I deliver food to families that have not left their house in six weeks,” Pam, who asked that her last name be withheld, told me over breakfast. She and seven friends had just left a movement class — “You have to bring down your nervous system if you’re going to be out there,” one of them explained — and were back to discussing the inescapable. Nearly everyone in Minneapolis, they said, was fighting back. They weren’t the first to tell me about Smitten Kitten, a local sex shop that had started collecting diapers, nonperishable food, and other essentials to distribute to the community. “I bought two gift cards for my friends,” one of them told me, “and a little something for myself too, but I won’t tell you what it was.”

That morning, Tom Homan, the Trump administration’s “border czar,” had held a press conference announcing an ICE “drawdown,” with the caveat that he’d be “staying till the problem’s gone.” Homan had recently replaced Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol official in charge of the Minneapolis operation, after pushback. (The press conference had been scheduled for 7AM, likely to keep protesters at bay; unable to get on the media list before the RSVP cutoff, I watched the stream from my hotel room.) According to an internal ICE memo that leaked to Reuters, agents had been instructed to focus on immigrants with criminal records and advised to refrain from engaging with “agitators,” a practice that had clearly only succeeded in “inflaming the situation.”

The gaggle of women didn’t buy it. Homan “is just Stephen Miller with a potbelly and Bovino in a suit,” one of them said. “They’re just trying to control the narrative. They’re trying to say things have changed, and they haven’t changed.”

At the press conference, a sycophantic correspondent for the right-wing news outlet Real America’s Voice had thanked Homan on behalf of “all the folks out there in America that voted for this, that want mass deportations.” He also asked whether the administration planned on arresting “the leadership on the Signal chats or the WhatsApp chats that are organizing the attacks against you, obstruction against you.” Homan declined to answer. “I’m not going to show our hand,” he said, “but they’re going to be held accountable. Justice is coming.”

The administration has characterized Minnesotans’ resistance as organized, hierarchical, externally funded, and above all, dangerous. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem accused Renee Good of engaging in “domestic terrorism.” Stephen Miller, one of Donald Trump’s closest advisers and the architect of much of his immigration policy, called Alex Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and “would-be assassin.” The FBI is reportedly investigating the Signal chats locals use to monitor ICE activity.

Beatrice Adler-Bolton, a Minneapolis resident and host of the leftist podcast Death Panel, told me ICE showed up to her house on two consecutive afternoons while she was alone with her 11-month-old baby. Adler-Bolton, who said she’s been showing up for her neighbors “in really boring ways,” believes she was targeted for speaking out against ICE, not for her mutual aid work. Two days after I met Adler-Bolton in Powderhorn Park, federal agents tear gassed observers there, just yards from where we had stood.

The first time ICE came by, “there was a guy in the front in hideous fucking Oakleys, he had a big rifle in his lap, and he was holding the barrel of the rifle. He looked right at me, pulled out his phone, and took a picture,” she said. Five cars showed up the next day. This time, she said, the agents got out of their cars, walked around her house, and took pictures through her windows. “They were making their presence known. It was obviously intimidation.”

In addition to a custom-built Palantir tool ICE relies on to identify deportation targets, DHS is reportedly using two facial-recognition tools to track protesters and observers. One woman who was photographed by an ICE agent had her Global Entry privileges revoked three days after the encounter, according to court filings. Both DHS and the Department of Justice have posted photos of detained protesters on social media, calling them “rioters.”

Everyone I met in Minneapolis pushed back against the government’s characterizations of the resistance. Instead, they described informal networks of friends coming together to support their neighbors. “What we’re building is a movement outside the traditional nonprofit sector,” Pam, one of the women I met at the diner, said. “It’s so much more nimble, and it’s hyper-local.”

Pam told me she had helped crowdfund rent for five families on her block. Another told me that after the man who plows snow on her street got picked up by ICE, their neighbors pooled money to hire him a lawyer. When a friend from out of town asked her for a list of nonprofits to donate to, she told her to send it to a trusted local who could pass it directly to people in need. “Send cash to people on the ground,” she said. “The entire thing is about trust.”

On the morning of Alex Pretti’s killing, Mac*, a retired Army medic, was putting together a grocery list. She popped into one of her Signal chats, saw the news, and immediately headed over. “Things got really spicy really fast,” Mac told me. After declaring an unlawful assembly, the police alternated between firing tear gas into the crowd and pushing protesters back. The protesters had been boxed in — the Minneapolis Police Department surrounded them on one side, the Minnesota State Patrol on the other. “It’s what I call a fatal funnel,” Mac said. “One way in, one way out.”

Protesters started calling for medics. “That was when we got into the fray,” Mac said. “We run in, and I just see this person holding their hand — they had caught, likely, a rubber bullet, a nonlethal round. Their hand was shattered. We bandaged them up, and then EMS arrived and we got them out.”

A couple dozen protesters were arrested at the site of Pretti’s killing. After being released from the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, some may have run into Julie Prokes, one of the many volunteers who has become a fixture in Whipple’s parking lot. I spoke to Prokes on a frigid morning as he loaded a folding table with hot chocolate, instant noodles, and assorted snacks to distribute to protesters and released detainees alike. “I took the week off work,” he said, adding that he suspects most of the people who come out of Whipple are US citizens. “I don’t necessarily know their citizenship status. I don’t ask. I’m just out here to offer aid however I can.”

As we spoke, Prokes pointed to a building across the way, which he said was an apartment complex for homeless veterans. “These guys over there are dealing with PTSD, and now you’ve got people out here playing military, throwing chemical irritants, and disrupting their normal flow of life,” Prokes said, adding that the food vendors that typically work with veterans’ services are now afraid to send their drivers near Whipple.

I ran into Prokes again on Friday morning, the day of the second mass anti-ICE protest in as many weeks, at his usual spot in the Whipple parking lot. Five hundred or so protesters had gathered outside the federal building, behind the concrete-and-steel barriers that had been set up in the aftermath of Alex Pretti’s killing; their numbers had dwindled to a couple hundred by the time I arrived. A small group sang: “This is for our families who are locked inside / Together, we will abolish ICE / This is for our friends who are locked inside / Together, we will abolish ICE.” A man yelled at two Hennepin County sheriff’s deputies: “You’re protecting ICE! Liam is in a concentration camp because of ICE. You know who I’m talking about. You’re protecting his captors!” Constellations of ice formed on people’s beards and eyelashes. Despite the cold, there was a drum circle. Two protesters in matching pink gas masks told me I had just missed all the action. There had been no tear gas, but plenty of flash-bangs. I asked how many people had been there earlier. “A shit ton,” one of them said.

Two ICU nurses in medic gear told me they had flown in from Colorado to offer support. “I’m a former military nurse, and I have a strong sense of patriotism. Seeing the government turn on the people, as a veteran, really upset me,” one of them told me. “Alex was an ICU nurse. I couldn’t just sit idly and watch it all unfold.”

The medics carried tourniquets, dressing, and oxygen bags. Mac told me she takes her medic bag everywhere, just in case. She volunteers as a medic “when the situation calls for it” and tries to go out commuting four or five times a week. Lately there’s been a greater need for commuters than for medics, and so that’s what Mac does. Commuters tend to stick to their own neighborhoods and adhere to a set of best practices, but there are no leaders, only volunteers. “I come from the military, from a very hierarchical, bureaucratic system,” Mac told me, “and this is completely foreign to me to the degree that I sometimes struggle, because I’m not familiar with operating in a system that doesn’t have a chain of command.”

In some ways, commuting is less high-adrenaline than treating people who have been tear gassed and shot with pepper bullets, but following ICE around is not without its risks. Several observers told me ICE has threatened them with arrest. Sometimes commuters will trail ICE through familiar streets, only to end up in front of their own homes; they suspect ICE has run their plates through a database, identified where they live, and led them there as a warning. One woman showed me a video of agents approaching her car and threatening her with bear mace. She was able to capture it thanks to a dashcam she had been given days earlier.

“It stressed me out so bad,” Nick Benson, a resident of the nearby town of Burnsville, told me of his first commuting experience. Benson ultimately decided commuting wasn’t for him, but he’s found other ways to get involved. “Everyone is finding their lane and kicking ass in it,” he told me. An airplane photography enthusiast, Benson has started tracking ICE’s charter flights out of Minneapolis. I met him on a sunny Monday afternoon on the top floor of the airport parking garage, where he stations himself every day to document ICE’s efforts to transport immigrants out of the state.

Benson and I watched as a bright-blue plane operated by GlobalX, a charter airline, descended into one of the terminals. In addition to ICE, GlobalX contracts with private companies and college sports teams. “A few weeks ago, another one of these GlobalX flights flew handcuffed people down to Texas, then did a ferry flight to Houston, where they picked up the University of Wisconsin women’s volleyball team and then flew them back to Madison,” Benson told me. “Same day, same airplane.”

His telephoto lens pointed at the terminal, Benson explained what we were looking at: two vans pulled up to the plane. A few people, presumably federal employees, emerged from the vehicles and ascended the airplane stairs. Then came the detainees, each of them shackled at the wrists and ankles. One of them moved slowly. Another needed help getting on the plane. There were 23 of them in all, each of them still in the clothes they wore when they got picked up by ICE. One wore a pink jacket. “Once in a while you’ll see people that look like construction workers or tradespeople, because they’re wearing bright-green hoodies. A few weeks ago, we saw someone who was still in their Amazon uniform get on one of the flights,” Benson told me. “They’re just taking our neighbors off the street and shipping them out.”

Benson told me his role in all of this is to document what happens “at the narrow end of the funnel.” This is the moment between abductions and deportations, when the people ICE rips from the community are shuttled to detention centers in Texas or elsewhere. In addition to tracking these flights, Benson has started distributing dashcams to locals so they can document their own interactions with ICE. Since early January, Benson has given out more than $65,000 worth of dashcams to his fellow Minnesotans.

Mac, the medic, told me she has a dashcam she’s been meaning to install for weeks. She and the other commuters have had too many close calls to count. On a recent patrol, ICE led Mac and another commuter into an unfamiliar neighborhood. “I was behind the other commuter,” Mac recalled. “They brake-checked him, got out of the vehicle, guns drawn, and started threatening him. They were like, ‘We will arrest you if you honk your horn or blow your whistle.’”

I had no such experiences in my week in Minneapolis, though I tried to go commuting almost every morning. On my first day in the field, the people who let me tag along with them commented on how sleepy it was: We saw exactly one ICE agent on our three-hour patrol through Whittier, and he was napping in his car. “I’ve been rattled,” Thomas, the driver, told me while maneuvering the car through the neighborhood, but he had also started feeling anxious when he wasn’t out there. “Yesterday I was sitting in the back seat and I was the one on the call, and I was like, ‘This is not my role!’” His friends had started calling him Baby Driver.

Today, his friend Larry was on Signal duty. He had one earbud in to monitor the call, a litany of intersections, car descriptions — “Wagoneer” repeated over and over with Minnesotans’ characteristic long vowels — and plate numbers. “I’m sick of getting tear gassed,” he told me. “There was a period where I was getting tear gassed literally every day.” This was a reprieve, but the relative stillness made us all uneasy.

Things hadn’t exactly slowed down, but they had shifted. The next morning we parked outside of Whipple and watched as ICE’s convoys of unmarked cars left for the day. Where they previously rolled out in groups of five to seven, this morning they left in pairs. We drove around Whittier in circles searching in vain for ICE. That night, someone showed me a video taken around the same time, just one neighborhood over: Observers leap out of their cars, blowing their whistles to alert their neighbors of an arrest in progress. A man flails as ICE agents struggle to force him over a chain-link fence. Agents yell at the observers, liberally deploy pepper spray into the crowd. One man, clearly marked as press, stands off to the side. An agent pulls down his gas mask, sprays him in the face, and leaves.

“They’re evolving,” Mac told me. “As soon as we catch on to them, they evolve. And they know that we’re onto them, because they keep putting out new restrictions, saying, ‘You can’t make noise, you can’t film us, we don’t need a warrant.’”

The opposition’s tactics are evolving, too. Some South Minneapolis residents have begun setting up “filter blockades,” makeshift roundabouts designed to slow traffic and keep an eye out for ICE. On a recent Saturday, a dozen or so people stood in the middle of Cedar Avenue surrounded by signs, mattresses, and pallets of wood. Farther up the road, volunteers in neon vests handed out flyers to drivers, most of whom honked and fist-pumped in approval.

People are fighting surveillance with surveillance. Garrett Guntly, a tech executive who has lived in Minneapolis for a decade, told me he’s installed a network of more than 20 cameras across the city. “I’ve been out there in negative 15 weather trying to install these things,” he said.

At first, Guntly felt awkward about asking his neighbors if he could set up cameras on their property. The response has been almost universal assent. Their reasoning, he explained, is simple: “The government’s already watching me. Why not my neighbors?” Unlike consumer-grade doorbell cameras, Guntly’s network isn’t connected to the cloud. It’s a network-based internet protocol system. “In layman’s terms, think of it as a CCTV system,” he said. “If the landowner agrees to have a camera on their building facing out onto the street, only then do they have access to the broader camera matrix. It’s a skin-in-the-game approach. If you’re part of the network, you have the network.”

The cameras are installed on private property, but they’re pointed at “critical areas” with lots of foot traffic, like bus stops and busy intersections. “With these cameras, we’ve been able to get a lot more surgical and rapid at getting people onto the streets. One human can cover one and a half square miles of street, where they wouldn’t have been able to before,” he told me. “We’ve been able to thwart close to a dozen attempted abductions.”

I’d heard rumors of the ways DHS agents tried to disguise their otherwise conspicuous vehicles: dirtying up rental cars with snow; putting stuffed animals on their dashboards, just visible through windows tinted to near-opacity. On Saturday, we followed an unmarked car up and down Hiawatha Avenue, where it stopped in the middle of traffic, presumably in an attempt to deter us. I fiddled with my gas mask, trying to tighten the straps so it would fit snugly against my head. The tags were still on; I hadn’t needed it thus far. We had seen lights flash inside the car, visible even through the pitch-black windows. This was a law enforcement vehicle of some kind, and it was running a light to get away from us. Hours earlier, we had trailed an SUV with Florida plates. It sped away from us, and we followed, passing a small group of anti-ICE protesters stationed outside an Enterprise Rent-a-Car. When we caught up to the SUV, which had gotten on the highway that leads back to Whipple, I noticed it had a bumper sticker: “BABY ON BOARD.”

I met Myles, a Minneapolis resident of 19 years, on a Friday afternoon. His affluent pocket of Southwest Minneapolis felt almost like a parallel universe: A pair of elementary schoolers walked home unaccompanied, unworried about being stopped by ICE, discussing their favorite kinds of sushi. Myles’ foyer, however, quickly brought me back to reality. In addition to the requisite winter boots and pile of coats, the entryway was full of paper grocery bags, each loaded to the brim with toiletries and nonperishable food.

Myles started fielding individual requests from neighbors last December. “At first it was helping with one-off needs, like if a kid needed a ride to school or someone needed groceries,” he said. When the DHS operation began, “we were doing small-scale mutual aid and planning for a significant invasion” down the line. He assumed ICE would descend upon Minneapolis like it had on Chicago, Portland, or Los Angeles, other so-called sanctuary cities where the agency has conducted large-scale raids since Trump’s inauguration — but Metro Surge is DHS’s biggest operation yet, one that residents of the Twin Cities have met with an unprecedented degree of pushback.

“Everyone seems really willing to step up,” Myles said. “If they’re not already involved, they’re eager to get involved.” What started as a handful of neighbors organizing one-off grocery runs is now a network of about 20 volunteers supporting 150 families. Myles told me he’s had to discuss the additional grocery trips — and everything else — with his two young children. “I have to explain why we’re doing it,” he said of the deliveries, “and that people are afraid to leave their homes, people are being assaulted and taken just because of the way that they look. Having to explain all of those dynamics to a five- and an eight-year-old, I wish I didn’t have to do that.”

Lyn, a doctor, told me her two teenagers have been “distraught, angry, and deeply saddened” by what’s going on. Many of her son’s classmates are first- or second-generation immigrants from Africa and Latin America. “Some of his friends aren’t going to school,” she said. “One friend’s dad was just abducted, which is what I call it.”

I met Lyn at a Mexican grocery store on the west side of St. Paul, where she was shopping for two families she had been connected with through Neighbors Helping Neighbors. The organization started in mid-December as a local mutual aid project run by a group of friends and has since evolved to a network of more than 500 volunteers who run errands, buy groceries, and crowdfund and deliver rent to families throughout the metropolitan area.

Like nearly every business in the Twin Cities, the grocery store had signs on the door denying ICE agents entry without a judicial warrant. A security guard noticed my photographer’s equipment and asked us to wait in the vestibule while he asked management whether we could enter. This whole nightmare, after all, had started with a right-wing provocateur armed with little more than a front-facing camera. Inside, Lyn loaded up two carts with a week’s worth of essentials — onions, beans, eggs, plantains, cooking oil — and a few treats. “I like to get something sweet for the kids,” she said, reaching for a package of chocolate cookies.

Other customers seemed to be doing the same thing. A woman wearing a hoodie that must have been printed recently — “It’s a Pretti Good day to defend the Constitution,” it read — asked a man whether he needed help with deliveries today. He introduced himself as Marco, and showed me a GoFundMe he’s put together that has raised more than $90,000, which he and a team of volunteers have used to buy groceries and other essentials — diapers, cat litter, dog food — to some 300 families. Marco has taken on other responsibilities, too. One of the women he delivers food to is pregnant and in hiding; Marco told me he connected her to a midwife. He’s seen no signs of the “drawdown” Homan announced.

“They’re still here,” he said. “They’re still brutalizing people.”

Even here, life must go on. Rent was due February 1st, just like it always is. Eight days had passed since Alex Pretti’s killing. In that time, at least 265 people had been sent to Texas on ICE’s charter flights, according to Benson’s daily airport observations. Desperate to avoid the same fate, an unknowable number of people have confined themselves to their homes; their absence is unquantifiable because there’s no reliable way to measure a void.

“We know of countless people who were unable to make rent this month,” Kai Shelley, the city council aide, told me. “There are folks who have received eviction notices, folks who have just been able to eke by this month but know they won’t be able to make it next month. We’re looking at a pretty dire situation.”

The city council unanimously called for a moratorium on evictions in mid-January — in the weeks between Good’s and Pretti’s killings, while ICE arrests continued to climb — but the power to halt evictions lies with Gov. Tim Walz, who has yet to indicate whether he’ll do so. At a city council meeting last Friday, Chughtai, the majority leader, challenged the idea that the city could “GoFundMe its way” out of crisis.

“That doesn’t mean we should stop doing mutual aid, but the only thing that’s for sure going to keep people in their homes right now is if we put a pause on evictions,” Shelley said. “The mutual aid is great, but the mutual aid is there because the government can’t or won’t step up in certain circumstances.”

For now, it’s up to the residents of the Twin Cities to look out for each other. It’s clear no one else will.

Three days before rent was due, I accompanied Kat, a volunteer with Neighbors Helping Neighbors, as she dropped off an envelope full of cash for a family in Midtown Minneapolis. Alex Pretti’s name was spray-painted on the highway barrier walls. “Something that feels particularly salient right now is how much daily life has changed,” she told me, “both from the danger of ICE presence and all the helping that’s going on. People have completely reoriented their day-to-day and week-to-week.”

The occupation isn’t over. Guntly, the activist who set up the surveillance camera network, told me he thinks ICE is biding its time until mid-March, when Temporary Protected Status is set to expire for Somali nationals. DHS is reportedly scouring the suburbs for empty warehouses to convert into detention centers. The day before I arrived in Minneapolis, the department asked to use an Army Reserve base at Fort Snelling, a decommissioned military base next to the airport, to house agents and store weapons. On my last night in town, I met a small group of Indigenous activists who had set up camp across from the historic fort, which is now a museum. The two acres we were standing on had somehow been overlooked in the series of federal treaties that funneled Dakota and Ojibwe lands to the United States. This land still belongs to the Dakota.

They had built a fire, and they planned on staying. The idea was to provide a warm place for protesters and released detainees from Whipple, located less than a mile away, to rest and recharge. Wasu Duta, a Dakota activist, described a clear link between the ICE operation in Minnesota and the dispossession of Native land.

“We have to hold these people accountable for their actions,” he told me. “They actually, under the Constitution, broke their oath and have committed acts of war on our people.” Tribal governments, including the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Navajo Nation, had members questioned and detained by ICE even after showing identification proving their citizenship. In mid-January, a Mdewakanton Dakota woman had been detained by ICE while observing agents from her car. One of the agents reportedly smashed her windows, and she was held at Whipple for 48 hours before being released.

Four tepees have been erected on the snowy ground across the way from Fort Snelling. They stand in the shadow of the old garrison, where a little less than 200 years ago, 1,658 prisoners, most of them women and children, were held during a brutal winter as punishment for the Dakota uprising of 1862. Hundreds died of hunger and disease. An Episcopalian priest pleaded for clemency, and when spring came the government loaded most of the prisoners onto steamboats and deported them to reservations in Nebraska and South Dakota. Henry Whipple couldn’t save them all; of the 303 initially sentenced to death, 38 Dakota men were hanged in what remains the largest mass execution in American history. The Whipple Federal Building opened in 1969, and activists have been trying to get the bishop’s name scrubbed from its walls  since Trump’s first term. Government attorneys are working around the clock to keep immigrants locked up in Whipple, where detainees say they’ve been denied food and medical care.

In 1872, a decade after the Dakota War, the painter John Gast unveiled what would become his most famous work yet. American Progress was Gast’s celebration of manifest destiny, a visual representation of settlers’ triumph. A white angel dominates the small canvas, guiding pioneers farther and farther west. Civilization trails her, and Native people flee in her wake. This new world of railroads and telegraph lines cannot coexist with what came before. The parallels between past and present are obvious to anyone who bothers to look. DHS posted the Gast painting on its X account last summer. This, the department wrote, is “a Heritage to be proud of, a Homeland worth Defending.”</div>

Wildlight Entertainment says it is parting ways with ‘a number’ of its employees.

Highguard, a new multiplayer shooter from developers who worked on games like Apex Legends and Call of Duty, launched just over two weeks ago, but developer Wildlight Entertainment is already cutting jobs at the company, according to posts from affected staffers on LinkedIn. Former Wildlight level designer Alex Graner says that “most of the team at Wildlight” was laid off today, which was backed up by former lead tech artist Josh Sobel.

”Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game,” Wildlight says in a statement. “We’re proud of the team, talent, and the product we’ve created together. We’re also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community.”

Highguard was first announced as the final reveal at The Game Awards in December with a splashy reveal trailer promoting a January 26th launch date. The game reportedly hit nearly 100,000 concurrent players on Steam on launch day, but it has a “Mixed” rating on the platform and has just over 2,400 concurrent players as of this writing, according to SteamDB. The game launched with three-player teams, but shortly after, Wildlight added a limited time 5v5 mode that it made permanent a few days later.

This week, Riot Games also made cuts on a major live service project, laying off about 80 people from its recently-launched 2XKO fighting game set in the League of Legends universe.

Update, February 11th: Added statement from Wildlight.

The way forward for xAI involves four divisions: Grok, Coding, Imagine, and Macrohard.

Since the xAI-SpaceX merger announced last week, which combined the two companies (as well as social media platform X) for a reported $1.25 trillion valuation — the biggest merger of all time — a handful of xAI employees and two of its co-founders have abruptly exited the company, penning long departure announcements online. Some also announced that they were starting their own AI companies.

Co-founder Yuhai (Tony) Wu announced his departure on X, writing that it was “time for [his] next chapter.” Jimmy Ba, another co-founder, posted something similar later that day, saying it was “time to recalibrate [his] gradient on the big picture.” The departures mean that xAI is now left with only half of its original 12 co-founders on staff.

It all comes after changing plans for the future of the combined companies, which Elon Musk recently announced would involve “space-based AI” data centers and vertical integration involving “AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform.” Musk reportedly also talked of plans to build an AI satellite factory and city on the moon in an internal xAI meeting.

Musk wrote on X Wednesday that “xAI was reorganized a few days ago to improve speed of execution” and claimed that the process “unfortunately required parting ways with some people,” then put out a call for more people to apply to the company. He also posted a recording of xAI’s 45-minute internal all-hands meeting that announced the changes.

“We’re organizing the company to be more effective at this scale,” Musk said during the meeting. He added that the company will now be organized in four main application areas: Grok Main and Voice, Coding, Imagine (image and video), and Macrohard (“which is intended to do full digital emulation of entire companies,” Musk said).

On Wednesday, Apple released its latest iOS 26 update, which includes a new process for switching from an iPhone to an Android phone, as previously reported by 9to5Mac. The updated transferring tool can move over data like apps, photos, messages, and even a user’s phone number by sitting the two phones side by side. Previously, users typically needed to either download Apple and Google’s data transfer apps on each device or manually copy all their apps and data over.

iPhone users in the EU also now have an option for “notification forwarding” with third-party wearables in iOS 26.3. This update allows users to view the full contents of notifications on third-party wearables and control which apps they get notifications from, bringing the third-party smartwatch experience more in line with the Apple Watch. Improving interoperability between iPhones and non-Apple wearables, including features like notification functionality, was one of several requirements for Apple to comply with the EU’s Digital Markets Act.

To install iOS 26.3 on your phone, open the Settings app and go to “General” then “Software Update.” If iOS 26.3 is available on your iPhone, you should see an option to download and install it. If that option isn’t showing up, double-check that your iPhone is compatible with iOS 26.

Valentine’s Day is often thought of as the quintessential Hallmark holiday — and why wouldn’t it be? Most of the time, it’s marketed to us with massive floral arrangements and heart-shaped chocolates, both of which can come off as borderline twee. But no one says you have to play by the rulebook when it comes to holidays, especially if your husband or boyfriend couldn’t care less about the classics.

If you’re hoping to express your affection for the man in your life with something a little different this year, we have some thoughts. Quince’s cashmere crewneck is quickly becoming a staple in our closet, while past favorites like Glocusent’s necklamp and Image3D’s custom viewfinder make for excellent substitutes if you want something less cliché. Hell, name a roach after him. We guarantee no one else will.

What follows is an array of Verge-approved ideas spanning multiple categories and price points, so you can easily find a gift for your friend, romantic partner, or any other self-proclaimed “dude” in your life.

From calls to playlists, the AirPods 4 make everything sound a little better. Apple’s latest earbuds deliver improved audio and voice call quality that’s on par with the Pro models, ensuring you come through clearly no matter what’s going on around you. The included charging case even has a built-in speaker, making them juuuust a little harder to lose.

With Hot Ones’ latest trio pack, you can subject your valentine to the same fiery gauntlet that Jason Segel, Will Arnett, and other guests were recently forced to endure. It includes the second, fifth, and final hot sauces in the series — including the iconic “Last Dab,” which is a soul-scorching blend of Apollo, Pepper X, Carolina Reaper, and Scorpion peppers.

Hazelight Studios’ follow-up to It Takes Two is, without a doubt, one of the best co-op games of the last several years. The split-screen mashup of sci-fi and fantasy pinballs between genres at breakneck speed, introducing new ideas and novel gameplay elements at every turn. Now, let’s hope you and your partner have a good working relationship.

Not every massage gun needs to exert an exorbitant amount of pressure. The five-speed Mebak 3 takes a more subtle approach, which, unlike other models, prevents it from drowning out your TV. It’s also unique in that comes with seven (!) distinct add-ons, including a blade-like shovel attachment and a flat cushiony head aimed at more sensitive tissues and joints.

Given the number of books in the world, sometimes it’s nice to have somebody narrow down the list on your behalf. A Book of the Month membership lets your giftee periodically choose from a curated selection of up to seven titles, including literary classics, bestsellers, and early releases spanning a variety of well-known genres.

Nomad’s Leather Mag Wallet is two gifts in one. Not only does the slick snap-on wallet let you store up to four cards at once, but it also doubles as an AirTag, allowing you to locate your wallet via Apple’s Find My network. The magnetic, iPhone-friendly accessory also charges wirelessly, enabling up to five months of battery life.

Your most sentimental photos with your valentine will pack an extra punch with Image3D’s RetroViewer. The retro-styled viewfinder comes with a code to upload seven photos — whether they’re of your first date, wedding, or latest vacay — which you can then edit and package into your own DIY reel for when those nostalgic moments overtake you.

Powerful power banks don’t have to be cumbersome. Iniu’s 10,000mAh P50 is about as thick as a deck of cards, but features 45W charging speeds, two USB-C ports, and one USB-A port. Its braided lanyard also doubles as a USB-C cable, providing everything you need to keep all of your electronics fully juiced on the go.

Whether your valentine collects Funko Pops or not, gifting them a custom model is sure to delight them. Using an online module, you can fine-tune a variety of features — including their hairstyle, skin tone, and getup — and each custom Funko comes in a box, just like the collectible ones based on Star Wars and other iconic fandoms.

It’s easy enough to run the vacuum in the living room and call it a day. But other areas where your valentine might enjoy spending their time — at the computer, in the car, etc. — can be tougher to clean. That’s where Hoto’s sleek, 20,000Pa handheld vacuum and its slew of attachment heads come in.

Quince is quickly becoming a household name, particularly for wool basics. And if your valentine doesn’t have any cashmere in their collection, the company’s ultra-soft crewneck is a fantastic gift that can keep them warm and stylish during the coldest months of the year. The fact that it’s available in 15 different colors is just a plus.

A subscription to The Criterion Channel is the ultimate gift for a movie lover. The service lets you stream some of the greatest movies of all time, from The Shining to Once Upon a Time in America. It also includes access to Criterion 24/7, an endless stream of movies that you can watch when you don’t want to make a decision.

The past few months might not have been as life-shattering for most as 2020, but we’d argue life doesn’t have to be pure chaos for a stress ball to come in handy. The NeeDoh Nice Cube, like all of Schylling’s colorful dough-filled shapes, makes for an inexpensive release that can be squeezed, squashed, and pulled to your heart’s content.

Let’s face it, many of us have called roaches unsavory things, typically from a place of fear. However, if you want to redeem yourself somehow, the Bronx Zoo will let you name your very own Madagascar hissing cockroach in the name of love. You can even schedule a “virtual encounter” for your giftee, if they’re feeling up for it.

Got a boyfriend or husband who loves to golf? Paper Apps Golf is a pocket-sized game that lets them hit the proverbial green just about anywhere. The 60-page notebook features three randomly generated courses, each with 18 holes, along with a brief overview of how to play. Just be sure to grab a Pencil dice (sold separately) to go with it.

If you’re okay with shelling out on a console, look no further than the Switch 2. Nintendo’s latest hybrid boasts a spacious 7.9-inch display, a comfortable design, and backward compatibility with most OG Switch titles, some of which have even been updated to run at higher resolutions and frame rates. Fair to say, Donkey Kong has never looked better.

Whether you’re relaxing at home or braving the elements, keeping your extremities warm is paramount. Fortunately, Unihand’s rechargeable hand warmers can keep your digits limber for up to 20 hours on a single charge; they also feature three distinct warmth levels, the most powerful of which can hit 130 degrees Fahrenheit.

Apple’s latest AirTags feel purpose-built for the forgetful boyfriend. The second-gen item tracker features an upgraded ultra-wideband chip for more precise location tracking, a noticeably louder speaker, and an expanded Bluetooth range. You’ll still need an iPhone to make the most of it, though, as well as a separate accessory to attach it to your belongings.

Lego’s smiling, potted plants might be intended for kids, but they make for a fun piece of desk decor that’s sure to lighten up any space without requiring additional aftercare. The cutsey duo is easy to assemble, and each plant is interchangeable with either pot, letting you mix and match as you see fit.

Fender has made it easy for guitarists to feel like they’re plugged in wherever they are. The Micro Plus is a compact headphone amp with 50 effects that lets you rock out using the headphones you already own, whether they’re a pair of shoddy earbuds or studio-caliber cans. Best of all, it works with a range of guitar types, from straight-sided to the angular variety.

Attending a dedicated first aid or CPR class through the Red Cross probably isn’t high on your list of date-night activities. However, it’s pretty cool to know that, after a few self-paced online courses and an hour or two of in-person practical instruction, both you and your partner can be heroes should you encounter someone who needs life-saving help.

The key to making a truly spectacular cocktail isn’t just the combination of ingredients — though, we admit that’s part of it. In Liquid Intelligence, Dave Arnold makes the case that the smallest details are what make all the difference, especially in terms of taste and appearance. And who are we to argue with bar-backed science?

What’s mightier than the pen? A pen that can also serve as an LED flashlight, a ruler, a bubble level, a screwdriver, a bottle opener, and a smartphone-ready stylus. The 9-in-1 Builder Pen might just be the most capable tool you can add to your everyday carry, even if you never write a thing with it.

If your partner likes to burn the midnight oil reading, like, actual books, Glocusent’s wearable necklamp could be a godsend. The handy gizmo provides a soft, warm glow and several brightness settings, letting your loved one comfortably read in the dark without waking you up with a deluge of lumens.

Cards Against Humanity is overrated. Wingspan, however, plays as beautifully as it looks, while offering just the right amount of strategy and a unique way to learn about various species. If you and your valentine are looking to move beyond the basics, this bird-themed engine-building board game is a must, whether you like birds or not.

The Amazfit Active 2 is the kind of smartwatch that defies the odds. It’s equipped with a bright 2,000-nit OLED display and an array of upgraded health sensors, along with offline maps and a slick strength training mode that can auto-detect sets, reps, and rest. It even supports its own AI assistant, Zepp Flow, which is wild for a watch that retails for less than $100.

The Backbone might be the most flexible mobile controller out there. The USB-C gamepad lets you play games on your iPhone or Android device using physical buttons, joysticks, and triggers. The Pro model takes things one step further, however, allowing you to connect to everything from a Steam Deck to an iPad via Bluetooth.

Sonido Cosmico is a vibe. The latest LP from Hermanos Gutiérrez brims with lush instrumental guitar and a range of otherwordly influences, including Latin percussion, warm strings, and just the right amount of psychedelia. None of that should come as a suprise, though, given the duo recently opened for the likes of The Black Keys and Khruangbin.

Most of us at The Verge are hooked on coffee, and the winter months are a terrible time to be surprised by a cold cup of the black stuff. Thankfully, Ember’s ceramic Smart Mug keeps your beverage heated to your preferred temperature for up to 80 minutes (or indefinitely when it’s resting on the included charging coaster).

Lego delivered a gigantic dose of nostalgia with a near-perfect replica of Nintendo’s 1989 handheld. The 421-piece set captures the Game Boy’s many buttons, grilles, and curves remarkably well, while the lenticular screen inserts give the illusion of a working unit. It even comes with several brick-ified cartridges you insert into a slot in the back.

The Fanttik X8 Apex is the kind of gift that keeps on giving, even if you’d prefer to never use it. The compact tire inflator features a built-in LCD display and can deliver up to 150psi, allowing your giftee to quickly top off their car or road bike with the right amount of air. It even functions as a power bank and charges via USB-C, just to make things easy.

The Notes app in iOS is great, but sometimes pen and paper are where it’s at. Field Notes are small enough to fit in your pocket or a small bag, yet spacious enough to house all your big ideas and errant thoughts. The “1943” Edition — the company’s first with two staples on the short side — can even add a much-needed pop of color to any desk setup.</div>

Facing growing backlash over energy-hungry data centers, Anthropic joins other tech companies in its promises to limit costs.

Anthropic is the latest AI company promising to limit the impact its data centers have on nearby residents’ electricity bills.

The company said it would pay higher monthly electricity charges in order to cover 100 percent of the upgrades needed to connect its data centers to power grids. “This includes the shares of these costs that would otherwise be passed onto consumers,” the announcement says.

Anthropic didn’t provide details today about any agreements it has inked with energy companies in order to accomplish these goals. In November, it shared a $50 billion plan to build data centers in New York and Texas “with more sites to come.”

Rising electricity rates have become a top election priority in the US, and local opposition to the construction of new energy-intensive data centers has led to projects across the country being canceled or delayed. Now we’re seeing companies including Microsoft and Meta making commitments to at least partially cover the costs stemming from new energy infrastructure built to accommodate their data centers.

As part of its pledge, Anthropic says it’ll support efforts to get new power sources online to meet growing electricity demand from AI. It also claims it’ll be willing to cut its power consumption during demand peaks, a step that could help relieve pressure on power grids during a heatwave or cold snap. Recent winter storms have already raised concerns about how data centers might further stress power grids and increase energy costs during extreme weather.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anton Cherepanov is always on the lookout for something interesting. And in late August last year, he spotted just that. It was a file uploaded to VirusTotal, a site cybersecurity researchers like him use to analyze submissions for potential viruses and other types of malicious software, often known as malware. On the surface it seemed innocuous, but it triggered Cherepanov’s custom malware-detecting measures. Over the next few hours, he and his colleague Peter Strýček inspected the sample and realized they’d never come across anything like it before.

The file contained ransomware, a nasty strain of malware that encrypts the files it comes across on a victim’s system, rendering them unusable until a ransom is paid to the attackers behind it. But what set this example apart was that it employed large language models (LLMs). Not just incidentally, but across every stage of an attack. Once it was installed, it could tap into an LLM to generate customized code in real time, rapidly map a computer to identify sensitive data to copy or encrypt, and write personalized ransom notes based on the files’ content. The software could do this autonomously, without any human intervention. And every time it ran, it would act differently, making it harder to detect.

Cherepanov and Strýček were confident that their discovery, which they dubbed PromptLock, marked a turning point in generative AI, showing how the technology could be exploited to create highly flexible malware attacks. They published a blog post declaring that they’d uncovered the first example of AI-powered ransomware, which quickly became the object of widespread global media attention.

But the threat wasn’t quite as dramatic as it first appeared. The day after the blog post went live, a team of researchers from New York University claimed responsibility, explaining that the malware was not, in fact, a full attack let loose in the wild but a research project, merely designed to prove it was possible to automate each step of a ransomware campaign—which, they said, they had.

PromptLock may have turned out to be an academic project, but the real bad guys are using the latest AI tools. Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.

The likelihood that cyberattacks will now become more common and more effective over time is not a remote possibility but “a sheer reality,” says Lorenzo Cavallaro, a professor of computer science at University College London.

Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers say this claim is overblown. “For some reason, everyone is just focused on this malware idea of, like, AI superhackers, which is just absurd,” says Marcus Hutchins, who is principal threat researcher at the security company Expel and famous in the security world for ending a giant global ransomware attack called WannaCry in 2017.

Instead, experts argue, we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams. Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money. These AI-enhanced cyberattacks are only set to get more frequent and more destructive, and we need to be ready.

Attackers started adopting generative AI tools almost immediately after ChatGPT exploded on the scene at the end of 2022. These efforts began, as you might imagine, with the creation of spam—and a lot of it. Last year, a report from Microsoft said that in the year leading up to April 2025, the company had blocked $4 billion worth of scams and fraudulent transactions, “many likely aided by AI content.”

At least half of spam email is now generated using LLMs, according to estimates by researchers at Columbia University, the University of Chicago, and Barracuda Networks, who analyzed nearly 500,000 malicious messages collected before and after the launch of ChatGPT. They also found evidence that AI is increasingly being deployed in more sophisticated schemes. They looked at targeted email attacks, which impersonate a trusted figure in order to trick a worker within an organization out of funds or sensitive information. By April 2025, they found, at least 14% of those sorts of focused email attacks were generated using LLMs, up from 7.6% in April 2024.

In one high-profile case, a worker was tricked into transferring $25 million to criminals via a video call with digital versions of the company’s chief financial officer and other employees.

And the generative AI boom has made it easier and cheaper than ever before to generate not only emails but highly convincing images, videos, and audio. The results are much more realistic than even just a few short years ago, and it takes much less data to generate a fake version of someone’s likeness or voice than it used to.

Criminals aren’t deploying these sorts of deepfakes to prank people or to simply mess around—they’re doing it because it works and because they’re making money out of it, says Henry Ajder, a generative AI expert. “If there’s money to be made and people continue to be fooled by it, they’ll continue to do it,” he says. In one high-­profile case reported in 2024, a worker at the British engineering firm Arup was tricked into transferring $25 million to criminals via a video call with digital versions of the company’s chief financial officer and other employees. That’s likely only the tip of the iceberg, and the problem posed by convincing deepfakes is only likely to get worse as the technology improves and is more widely adopted.

Criminals’ tactics evolve all the time, and as AI’s capabilities improve, such people are constantly probing how those new capabilities can help them gain an advantage over victims. Billy Leonard, tech leader of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, has been keeping a close eye on changes in the use of AI by potential bad actors (a widely used term in the industry for hackers and others attempting to use computers for criminal purposes). In the latter half of 2024, he and his team noticed prospective criminals using tools like Google Gemini the same way everyday users do—to debug code and automate bits and pieces of their work—as well as tasking it with writing the odd phishing email. By 2025, they had progressed to using AI to help create new pieces of malware and release them into the wild, he says.

The big question now is how far this kind of malware can go. Will it ever become capable enough to sneakily infiltrate thousands of companies’ systems and extract millions of dollars, completely undetected?

Most popular AI models have guardrails in place to prevent them from generating malicious code or illegal material, but bad actors still find ways to work around them. For example, Google observed a China-linked actor asking its Gemini AI model to identify vulnerabilities on a compromised system—a request it initially refused on safety grounds. However, the attacker managed to persuade Gemini to break its own rules by posing as a participant in a capture-the-flag competition, a popular cybersecurity game. This sneaky form of jailbreaking led Gemini to hand over information that could have been used to exploit the system. (Google has since adjusted Gemini to deny these kinds of requests.)

But bad actors aren’t just focusing on trying to bend the AI giants’ models to their nefarious ends. Going forward, they’re increasingly likely to adopt open-source AI models, as it’s easier to strip out their safeguards and get them to do malicious things, says Ashley Jess, a former tactical specialist at the US Department of Justice and now a senior intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity company Intel 471. “Those are the ones I think that [bad] actors are going to adopt, because they can jailbreak them and tailor them to what they need,” she says.

The NYU team used two open-source models from OpenAI in its PromptLock experiment, and the researchers found they didn’t even need to resort to jailbreaking techniques to get the model to do what they wanted. They say that makes attacks much easier. Although these kinds of open-source models are designed with an eye to ethical alignment, meaning that their makers do consider certain goals and values in dictating the way they respond to requests, the models don’t have the same kinds of restrictions as their closed-source counterparts, says Meet Udeshi, a PhD student at New York University who worked on the project. “That is what we were trying to test,” he says. “These LLMs claim that they are ethically aligned—can we still misuse them for these purposes? And the answer turned out to be yes.”

It’s possible that criminals have already successfully pulled off covert PromptLock-style attacks and we’ve simply never seen any evidence of them, says Udeshi. If that’s the case, attackers could—in theory—have created a fully autonomous hacking system. But to do that they would have had to overcome the significant barrier that is getting AI models to behave reliably, as well as any inbuilt aversion the models have to being used for malicious purposes—all while evading detection. Which is a pretty high bar indeed.

So, what do we know for sure? Some of the best data we have now on how people are attempting to use AI for malicious purposes comes from the big AI companies themselves. And their findings certainly sound alarming, at least at first. In November, Leonard’s team at Google released a report that found bad actors were using AI tools (including Google’s Gemini) to dynamically alter malware’s behavior; for example, it could self-modify to evade detection. The team wrote that it ushered in “a new operational phase of AI abuse.”

However, the five malware families the report dug into (including PromptLock) consisted of code that was easily detected and didn’t actually do any harm, the cybersecurity writer Kevin Beaumont pointed out on social media. “There’s nothing in the report to suggest orgs need to deviate from foundational security programmes—everything worked as it should,” he wrote.

It’s true that this malware activity is in an early phase, concedes Leonard. Still, he sees value in making these kinds of reports public if it helps security vendors and others build better defenses to prevent more dangerous AI attacks further down the line. “Cliché to say, but sunlight is the best disinfectant,” he says. “It doesn’t really do us any good to keep it a secret or keep it hidden away. We want people to be able to know about this— we want other security vendors to know about this—so that they can continue to build their own detections.”

And it’s not just new strains of malware that would-be attackers are experimenting with—they also seem to be using AI to try to automate the process of hacking targets. In November, Anthropic announced it had disrupted a large-scale cyberattack, the first reported case of one executed without “substantial human intervention.” Although the company didn’t go into much detail about the exact tactics the hackers used, the report’s authors said a Chinese state-sponsored group had used its Claude Code assistant to automate up to 90% of what they called a “highly sophisticated espionage campaign.”

“We’re entering an era where the barrier to sophisticated cyber operations has fundamentally lowered, and the pace of attacks will accelerate faster than many organizations are prepared for.”

But, as with the Google findings, there were caveats. A human operator, not AI, selected the targets before tasking Claude with identifying vulnerabilities. And of 30 attempts, only a “handful” were successful. The Anthropic report also found that Claude hallucinated and ended up fabricating data during the campaign, claiming it had obtained credentials it hadn’t and “frequently” overstating its findings, so the attackers would have had to carefully validate those results to make sure they were actually true. “This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks,” the report’s authors wrote.

Existing controls within any reasonably secure organization would stop these attacks, says Gary McGraw, a veteran security expert and cofounder of the Berryville Institute of Machine Learning in Virginia. “None of the malicious-attack part, like the vulnerability exploit … was actually done by the AI—it was just prefabricated tools that do that, and that stuff’s been automated for 20 years,” he says. “There’s nothing novel, creative, or interesting about this attack.”

Anthropic maintains that the report’s findings are a concerning signal of changes ahead. “Tying this many steps of an intrusion campaign together through [AI] agentic orchestration is unprecedented,” Jacob Klein, head of threat intelligence at Anthropic, said in a statement. “It turns what has always been a labor-intensive process into something far more scalable. We’re entering an era where the barrier to sophisticated cyber operations has fundamentally lowered, and the pace of attacks will accelerate faster than many organizations are prepared for.”

Some are not convinced there’s reason to be alarmed. AI hype has led a lot of people in the cybersecurity industry to overestimate models’ current abilities, Hutchins says. “They want this idea of unstoppable AIs that can outmaneuver security, so they’re forecasting that’s where we’re going,” he says. But “there just isn’t any evidence to support that, because the AI capabilities just don’t meet any of the requirements.”

Indeed, for now criminals mostly seem to be tapping AI to enhance their productivity: using LLMs to write malicious code and phishing lures, to conduct reconnaissance, and for language translation. Jess sees this kind of activity a lot, alongside efforts to sell tools in underground criminal markets. For example, there are phishing kits that compare the click-rate success of various spam campaigns, so criminals can track which campaigns are most effective at any given time. She is seeing a lot of this activity in what could be called the “AI slop landscape” but not as much “widespread adoption from highly technical actors,” she says.

But attacks don’t need to be sophisticated to be effective. Models that produce “good enough” results allow attackers to go after larger numbers of people than previously possible, says Liz James, a managing security consultant at the cybersecurity company NCC Group. “We’re talking about someone who might be using a scattergun approach phishing a whole bunch of people with a model that, if it lands itself on a machine of interest that doesn’t have any defenses … can reasonably competently encrypt your hard drive,” she says. “You’ve achieved your objective.”

For now, researchers are optimistic about our ability to defend against these threats—regardless of whether they are made with AI. “Especially on the malware side, a lot of the defenses and the capabilities and the best practices that we’ve recommended for the past 10-plus years—they all still apply,” says Leonard. The security programs we use to detect standard viruses and attack attempts work; a lot of phishing emails will still get caught in inbox spam filters, for example. These traditional forms of defense will still largely get the job done—at least for now.

And in a neat twist, AI itself is helping to counter security threats more effectively. After all, it is excellent at spotting patterns and correlations. Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security, says that every day, the company processes more than 100 trillion signals flagged by its AI systems as potentially malicious or suspicious events.

Despite the cybersecurity landscape’s constant state of flux, Jess is heartened by how readily defenders are sharing detailed information with each other about attackers’ tactics. Mitre’s Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems and the GenAI Security Project from the Open Worldwide Application Security Project are two helpful initiatives documenting how potential criminals are incorporating AI into their attacks and how AI systems are being targeted by them. “We’ve got some really good resources out there for understanding how to protect your own internal AI toolings and understand the threat from AI toolings in the hands of cybercriminals,” she says.

PromptLock, the result of a limited university project, isn’t representative of how an attack would play out in the real world. But if it taught us anything, it’s that the technical capabilities of AI shouldn’t be dismissed.New York University’s Udeshi says he wastaken aback at how easily AI was able to handle a full end-to-end chain of attack, from mapping and working out how to break into a targeted computer system to writing personalized ransom notes to victims: “We expected it would do the initial task very well but it would stumble later on, but we saw high—80% to 90%—success throughout the whole pipeline.”

AI is still evolving rapidly, and today’s systems are already capable of things that would have seemed preposterously out of reach just a few short years ago. That makes it incredibly tough to say with absolute confidence what it will—or won’t—be able to achieve in the future. While researchers are certain that AI-driven attacks are likely to increase in both volume and severity, the forms they could take are unclear. Perhaps the most extreme possibility is that someone makes an AI model capable of creating and automating its own zero-day exploits—highly dangerous cyber­attacks that take advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities in software. But building and hosting such a model—and evading detection—would require billions of dollars in investment, says Hutchins, meaning it would only be in the reach of a wealthy nation-state.

Engin Kirda, a professor at Northeastern University in Boston who specializes in malware detection and analysis, says he wouldn’t be surprised if this was already happening. “I’m sure people are investing in it, but I’m also pretty sure people are already doing it, especially [in] China—they have good AI capabilities,” he says.

It’s a pretty scary possibility. But it’s one that—thankfully—is still only theoretical. A large-scale campaign that is both effective and clearly AI-driven has yet to materialize. What we can say is that generative AI is already significantly lowering the bar for criminals. They’ll keep experimenting with the newest releases and updates and trying to find new ways to trick us into parting with important information and precious cash. For now, all we can do is be careful, remain vigilant, and—for all our sakes—stay on top of those system updates.

            <h2>Why EVs are gaining ground in Africa</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/12/1132790/evs-progress-africa/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">EVs are getting cheaper and more common all over the world. But the technology still faces major challenges in some markets, including many countries in Africa.

Some regions across the continent still have limited grid and charging infrastructure, and those that do have widespread electricity access sometimes face reliability issues—a problem for EV owners, who require a stable electricity source to charge up and get around.

But there are some signs of progress. I just finished up a story about the economic case: A recent study in Nature Energy found that EVs from scooters to minibuses could be cheaper to own than gas-powered vehicles in Africa by 2040.

If there’s one thing to know about EVs in Africa, it’s that each of the 54 countries on the continent faces drastically different needs, challenges, and circumstances. There’s also a wide range of reasons to be optimistic about the prospects for EVs in the near future, including developing policies, a growing grid, and an expansion of local manufacturing.

Even the world’s leading EV markets fall short of Ethiopia’s aggressively pro-EV policies. In 2024, the country became the first in the world to ban the import of non-electric private vehicles.

The case is largely an economic one: Gasoline is expensive there, and the country commissioned Africa’s largest hydropower dam in September 2025, providing a new source of cheap and abundant clean electricity. The nearly $5 billion project has a five-gigawatt capacity, doubling the grid’s peak power in the country.

Much of Ethiopia’s vehicle market is for used cars, and some drivers are still opting for older gas-powered vehicles. But this nudge could help increase the market for EVs there.

Other African countries are also pushing some drivers toward electrification. Rwanda banned new registrations for commercial gas-powered motorbikes in the capital city of Kigali last year, encouraging EVs as an alternative. These motorbike taxis can make up over half the vehicles on the city’s streets, so the move is a major turning point for transportation there.

Smaller two- and three-wheelers are a bright spot for EVs globally: In 2025, EVs made up about 45% of new sales for such vehicles. (For cars and trucks, the share was about 25%.)

And Africa’s local market is starting to really take off. There’s already some local assembly of electric two-wheelers in countries including Morocco, Kenya, and Rwanda, says Nelson Nsitem, lead Africa energy transition analyst at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

Spiro, a Dubai-based electric motorbike company, recently raised $100 million in funding to expand operations in Africa. The company currently assembles its bikes in Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, and Rwanda, and as of October it has over 60,000 bikes deployed and 1,500 battery swap stations operating.

Assembly and manufacturing for larger EVs and batteries is also set to expand. Gotion High-Tech, a Chinese battery company, is currently building Africa’s first battery gigafactory. It’s a $5.6 billion project that could produce 20 gigawatt-hours of batteries annually, starting in 2026. (That’s enough for hundreds of thousands of EVs each year.)

Chinese EV companies are looking to growing markets like Southeast Asia and Africa as they attempt to expand beyond an oversaturated domestic scene. BYD, the world’s largest EV company, is aggressively expanding across South Africa and plans to have as many as 70 dealerships in the country by the end of this year. That will mean more options for people in Africa looking to buy electric.

“You have very high-quality, very affordable vehicles coming onto the market that are benefiting from the economies of scale in China. These countries stand to benefit from that,” says Kelly Carlin, a manager in the program on carbon-free transportation at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy think tank. “It’s a game changer,” he adds.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/12/1132811/whats-next-for-chinese-open-source-ai/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The past year has marked a turning point for Chinese AI. Since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, Chinese companies have repeatedly delivered AI models that match the performance of leading Western models at a fraction of the cost.

Just last week the Chinese firm Moonshot AI released its latest open-weight model, Kimi K2.5, which came close to top proprietary systems such as Anthropic’s Claude Opus on some early benchmarks.  The difference: K2.5 is roughly one-seventh Opus’s price.

On Hugging Face, Alibaba’s Qwen family—after ranking as the most downloaded model series in 2025 and 2026—has overtaken Meta’s Llama models in cumulative downloads. And a recent MIT study found that Chinese open-source models have surpassed US models in total downloads. For developers and builders worldwide, access to near-frontier AI capabilities has never been this broad or this affordable.

These models differ in a crucial way from most US models like ChatGPT or Claude, which you pay to access and can’t inspect. The Chinese companies publish their models’ weights—numerical values that get set when a model is trained—so anyone can download, run, study, and modify them.

If open-source AI models keep getting better, they will not just offer the cheapest options for people who want access to frontier AI capabilities; they will change where innovation happens and who sets the standards.

When DeepSeek launched R1, much of the initial shock centered on its origin. Suddenly, a Chinese team had released a reasoning model that could stand alongside the best systems from US labs. But the long tail of DeepSeek’s impact had less to do with nationality than with distribution. R1 was released as an open-weight model under a permissive MIT license, allowing anyone to download, inspect, and deploy it. On top of that, DeepSeek also published a paper detailing its training process and techniques. For developers who access models via an API, DeepSeek also undercut competitors on price, offering access at a fraction the cost of OpenAI’s o1, the leading proprietary reasoning model at the time.

Within days of its release, DeepSeek replaced ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app in the US App Store. The moment spilled beyond developer circles into financial markets, triggering a sharp sell-off in US tech stocks that briefly erased roughly $1 trillion in market value. Almost overnight, DeepSeek went from a little-known spin-off team backed by a quantitative hedge fund to the most visible symbol of China’s push for open-source AI.

China’s decision to lean into open source isn’t surprising. It has the world’s second-largest concentration of AI talent after the US. plus a vast, well-resourced tech industry. After ChatGPT broke into the mainstream, China’s AI sector went through a reckoning—and emerged determined to catch up. Pursuing an open-source strategy was seen as the fastest way to close the gap by rallying developers, spreading adoption, and setting standards.

DeepSeek’s success injected confidence into an industry long used to following global standards rather than setting them. “Thirty years ago, no Chinese person would believe they could be at the center of global innovation,” says Alex Chenglin Wu, CEO and founder of Atoms, an AI agent company and prominent contributor to China’s open-source ecosystem. “DeepSeek shows that with solid technical talent, a supportive environment, and the right organizational culture, it’s possible to do truly world-class work.”

DeepSeek’s breakout moment wasn’t China’s first open-source success. Alibaba’s Qwen Lab had been releasing open-weight models for years. By September 2024,  well before DeepSeek’s V3 launch, Alibaba was saying that global downloads had exceeded 600 million. On Hugging Face, Qwen accounted for more than 30% of all model downloads in 2024. Other institutions, including the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence and the AI firm Baichuan, were also releasing open models as early as 2023.

But since the success of DeepSeek, the field has widened rapidly. Companies such as Z.ai (formerly Zhipu), MiniMax, Tencent, and a growing number of smaller labs have released models that are competitive on reasoning, coding, and agent-style tasks. The growing number of capable models has sped up progress. Capabilities that once took months to make it to the open-source world now emerge within weeks, even days.

“Chinese AI firms have seen real gains from the open-source playbook,” says Liu Zhiyuan, a professor of computer science at Tsinghua University and chief scientist at the AI startup ModelBest. “By releasing strong research, they build reputation and gain free publicity.”

Beyond commercial incentives, Liu says, open source has taken on cultural and strategic weight. “In the Chinese programmer community, open source has become politically correct,” he says, framing it as a response to US.dominance in proprietary AI systems.

That shift is also reflected at the institutional level. Universities including Tsinghua have begun encouraging AI development and open-source contributions, while policymakers have moved to formalize those incentives. In August, China’s State Council released a draft policy encouraging universities to reward open-source work, proposing that students’ contributions on platforms such as GitHub or Gitee could eventually be counted toward academic credit.

With growing momentum and a reinforcing feedback loop, China’s push for open-source models is likely to continue in the near term, though its long-term sustainability still hinges on financial results, says Tiezhen Wang, who helps lead work on global AI at Hugging Face. In January, the model labs Z.ai and MiniMax went public in Hong Kong. “Right now, the focus is on making the cake bigger,” says Wang. “The next challenge is figuring out how each company secures its share.”

Chinese open-source models are leading not just in download volume but also in variety. Alibaba’s Qwen has become one of the most diversified open model families in circulation, offering a wide range of variants optimized for different uses. The lineup ranges from lightweight models that can run on a single laptop to large, multi-hundred-billion-parameter systems designed for data-center deployment. Qwen features many task-optimized variants created by the community: the “instruct” models are good at following orders, and “code” variants specialize in coding.

Although this strategy isn’t unique to Chinese labs, Qwen was the first open model family to roll out so many high-quality options that it started to feel like a full product line—one that’s free to use.

The open-weight nature of these releases also makes it easy for others to adapt them through techniques like fine-tuning and distillation, which means training a smaller model to mimic a larger one.  According to ATOM (American Truly Open Models), a project by the AI researcher Nathan Lambert, by August 4, 2025, new model variations derived from Qwen were “more than 40%” of new Hugging Face language-model derivatives, while Llama had fallen to about 15%. This means that Qwen has become the default base model for all the “remixes.”

This pattern has made the case for smaller, more specialized models. “Compute and energy are real constraints for any deployment,” Liu says. He told MIT Technology Review that the rise of small models is about making AI cheaper to run and easier for more people to use. His company, ModelBest, focuses on small language models designed to run locally on devices such as phones, cars, and other consumer hardware.

While an average user might interact with AI only through the web or an app for simple conversations, power users of AI models with some technical background are experimenting with giving AI more autonomy to solve large-scale problems. OpenClaw, an open-source AI agent that recently went viral within the AI hacker world, allows AI to take over your computer—it can run 24-7, going through your emails and work tasks without supervision.

OpenClaw, like many other open-source tools, allows users to connect to different AI models via an application programming interface, or API. Within days of OpenClaw’s release, the team revealed that Kimi’s K2.5 had surpassed Claude Opus and became the most used AI model—by token count, meaning it was handling more total text processed across user prompts and model responses.

Cost has been a major reason Chinese models have gained traction, but it would be a mistake to treat them as mere “dupes” of Western frontier systems, Wang suggests. Like any product, a model only needs to be good enough for the job at hand.

The landscape of open-source models in China is also getting more specialized. Research groups such as Shanghai AI Laboratory have released models geared toward scientific and technical tasks; several projects from Tencent have focused specifically on music generation. Ubiquant, a quantitative finance firm like DeepSeek’s parent High-Flyer, has released an open model aimed at medical reasoning.

In the meantime, innovative architectural ideas from Chinese labs are being picked up more broadly. DeepSeek has published work exploring model efficiency and memory; techniques that compress the model’s attention “cache,” reducing memory and inference costs while mostly preserving performance, have drawn significant attention in the research community.

“The impact of these research breakthroughs is amplified because they’re open-sourced and can be picked up quickly across the field,” says Wang.

The adoption of Chinese models is picking up in Silicon Valley, too. Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, has put a number on it: Among startups pitching with open-source stacks, there’s about an 80% chance they’re running on Chinese open models, according to a post he made on X. Usage data tells a similar story. OpenRouter,  a middleman that tracks how people use different AI models through its API, shows Chinese open models rising from almost none in late 2024 to nearly 30% of usage in some recent weeks.

The demand is also rising globally. Z.ai limited new subscriptions to its GLM coding plan (a coding tool based on its flagship GLM models) after demand surged, citing compute constraints. What’s notable is where the demand is coming from: CNBC reports that the system’s user base is primarily concentrated in the United States and China, followed by India, Japan, Brazil, and the UK.

“The open-source ecosystems in China and the US are tightly bound together,” says Wang at Hugging Face. Many Chinese open models still rely on Nvidia and US cloud platforms to train and serve them, which keeps the business ties tangled. Talent is fluid too: Researchers move across borders and companies, and many still operate as a global community, sharing code and ideas in public.

That interdependence is part of what makes Chinese developers feel optimistic about this moment: The work travels, gets remixed, and actually shows up in products. But openness can also accelerate the competition. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, made a version of this point after DeepSeek’s 2025 releases: He wrote that export controls are “not a way to duck the competition” between the US and China, and that AI companies in the US “must have better models” if they want to prevail.

For the past decade, the story of Chinese tech in the West has been one of big expectations that ran into scrutiny, restrictions, and political backlash. This time the export isn’t just an app or a consumer platform. It’s the underlying model layer that other people build on. Whether that will play out differently is still an open question.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

That might explain why the first breakthrough LLM personal assistant came not from one of the major AI labs, which have to worry about reputation and liability, but from an independent software engineer, Peter Steinberger. In November of 2025, Steinberger uploaded his tool, now called OpenClaw, to GitHub, and in late January the project went viral.

OpenClaw harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out. The risks posed by OpenClaw are so extensive that it would probably take someone the better part of a week to read all of the security blog posts on it that have cropped up in the past few weeks. The Chinese government took the step of issuing a public warning about OpenClaw’s security vulnerabilities.

In response to these concerns, Steinberger posted on X that nontechnical people should not use the software. (He did not respond to a request for comment for this article.) But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and it’s not limited to people who can run their own software security audits. Any AI companies that hope to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research.

OpenClaw is, in essence, a mecha suit for LLMs. Users can choose any LLM they like to act as the pilot; that LLM then gains access to improved memory capabilities and the ability to set itself tasks that it repeats on a regular cadence. Unlike the agentic offerings from the major AI companies, OpenClaw agents are meant to be on 24-7, and users can communicate with them using WhatsApp or other messaging apps. That means they can act like a superpowered personal assistant who wakes you each morning with a personalized to-do list, plans vacations while you work, and spins up new apps in its spare time.

But all that power has consequences. If you want your AI personal assistant to manage your inbox, then you need to give it access to your email—and all the sensitive information contained there. If you want it to make purchases on your behalf, you need to give it your credit card info. And if you want it to do tasks on your computer, such as writing code, it needs some access to your local files.

There are a few ways this can go wrong. The first is that the AI assistant might make a mistake, as when a user’s Google Antigravity coding agent reportedly wiped his entire hard drive. The second is that someone might gain access to the agent using conventional hacking tools and use it to either extract sensitive data or run malicious code. In the weeks since OpenClaw went viral, security researchers have demonstrated numerous such vulnerabilities that put security-naïve users at risk.

Both of these dangers can be managed: Some users are choosing to run their OpenClaw agents on separate computers or in the cloud, which protects data on their hard drives from being erased, and other vulnerabilities could be fixed using tried-and-true security approaches.

But the experts I spoke to for this article were focused on a much more insidious security risk known as prompt injection. Prompt injection is effectively LLM hijacking: Simply by posting malicious text or images on a website that an LLM might peruse, or sending them to an inbox that an LLM reads, attackers can bend it to their will.

And if that LLM has access to any of its user’s private information, the consequences could be dire. “Using something like OpenClaw is like giving your wallet to a stranger in the street,” says Nicolas Papernot, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Toronto. Whether or not the major AI companies can feel comfortable offering personal assistants may come down to the quality of the defenses that they can muster against such attacks.

It’s important to note here that prompt injection has not yet caused any catastrophes, or at least none that have been publicly reported. But now that there are likely hundreds of thousands of OpenClaw agents buzzing around the internet, prompt injection might start to look like a much more appealing strategy for cybercriminals. “Tools like this are incentivizing malicious actors to attack a much broader population,” Papernot says.

The term “prompt injection” was coined by the popular LLM blogger Simon Willison in 2022, a couple of months before ChatGPT was released. Even back then, it was possible to discern that LLMs would introduce a completely new type of security vulnerability once they came into widespread use. LLMs can’t tell apart the instructions that they receive from users and the data that they use to carry out those instructions, such as emails and web search results—to an LLM, they’re all just text. So if an attacker embeds a few sentences in an email and the LLM mistakes them for an instruction from its user, the attacker can get the LLM to do anything it wants.

Prompt injection is a tough problem, and it doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon. “We don’t really have a silver-bullet defense right now,” says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley. But there’s a robust academic community working on the problem, and they’ve come up with strategies that could eventually make AI personal assistants safe.

Technically speaking, it is possible to use OpenClaw today without risking prompt injection: Just don’t connect it to the internet. But restricting OpenClaw from reading your emails, managing your calendar, and doing online research defeats much of the purpose of using an AI assistant. The trick of protecting against prompt injection is to prevent the LLM from responding to hijacking attempts while still giving it room to do its job.

One strategy is to train the LLM to ignore prompt injections. A major part of the LLM development process, called post-training, involves taking a model that knows how to produce realistic text and turning it into a useful assistant by “rewarding” it for answering questions appropriately and “punishing” it when it fails to do so. These rewards and punishments are metaphorical, but the LLM learns from them as an animal would. Using this process, it’s possible to train an LLM not to respond to specific examples of prompt injection.

But there’s a balance: Train an LLM to reject injected commands too enthusiastically, and it might also start to reject legitimate requests from the user. And because there’s a fundamental element of randomness in LLM behavior, even an LLM that has been very effectively trained to resist prompt injection will likely still slip up every once in a while.

Another approach involves halting the prompt injection attack before it ever reaches the LLM. Typically, this involves using a specialized detector LLM to determine whether or not the data being sent to the original LLM contains any prompt injections. In a recent study, however, even the best-performing detector completely failed to pick up on certain categories of prompt injection attack.

The third strategy is more complicated. Rather than controlling the inputs to an LLM by detecting whether or not they contain a prompt injection, the goal is to formulate a policy that guides the LLM’s outputs—i.e., its behaviors—and prevents it from doing anything harmful. Some defenses in this vein are quite simple: If an LLM is allowed to email only a few pre-approved addresses, for example, then it definitely won’t send its user’s credit card information to an attacker. But such a policy would prevent the LLM from completing many useful tasks, such as researching and reaching out to potential professional contacts on behalf of its user.

“The challenge is how to accurately define those policies,” says Neil Gong, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke University. “It’s a trade-off between utility and security.”

On a larger scale, the entire agentic world is wrestling with that trade-off: At what point will agents be secure enough to be useful? Experts disagree. Song, whose startup, Virtue AI, makes an agent security platform, says she thinks it’s possible to safely deploy an AI personal assistant now. But Gong says, “We’re not there yet.”

Even if AI agents can’t yet be entirely protected against prompt injection, there are certainly ways to mitigate the risks. And it’s possible that some of those techniques could be implemented in OpenClaw. Last week, at the inaugural ClawCon event in San Francisco, Steinberger announced that he’d brought a security person on board to work on the tool.

As of now, OpenClaw remains vulnerable, though that hasn’t dissuaded its multitude of enthusiastic users. George Pickett, a volunteer maintainer of the OpenGlaw GitHub repository and a fan of the tool, says he’s taken some security measures to keep himself safe while using it: He runs it in the cloud, so that he doesn’t have to worry about accidentally deleting his hard drive, and he’s put mechanisms in place to ensure that no one else can connect to his assistant.

But he hasn’t taken any specific actions to prevent prompt injection. He’s aware of the risk but says he hasn’t yet seen any reports of it happening with OpenClaw. “Maybe my perspective is a stupid way to look at it, but it’s unlikely that I’ll be the first one to be hacked,” he says.

A “QuitGPT” campaign is urging people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions

In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. And while it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, there’s no denying QuitGPT is getting attention. Read the full story.

EVs could be cheaper to own than gas cars in Africa by 2040

Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: How next-generation nuclear reactors break out of the 20th-century blueprint

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste.The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

There are obvious upsides to using this kind of technology: AI could help take the guesswork out of the judging technicalities. It could even help to eliminate biases, making the sport both more fair and more transparent.At the same time, others fear AI judging will take away something that makes gymnastics special. Gymnastics is a subjective sport, like diving or dressage, and technology could eliminate the judges’ role in crafting a narrative.For better or worse, AI has officially infiltrated the world of gymnastics.

            <div id="article-text">Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.

There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. As a result some previous analyses have suggested that fossil-fuel vehicles would dominate in Africa through at least 2050.

But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building. Electric two-wheelers, cars, larger automobiles, and even minibuses could compete in most African countries in just 15 years, according to the new study, published in Nature Energy.

“EVs have serious economic potential in most African countries in the not-so-distant future,” says Bessie Noll, a senior researcher at ETH Zürich and one of the authors of the study.

The study considered the total cost of ownership over the lifetime of a vehicle. That includes the sticker price, financing costs, and the cost of fueling (or charging). The researchers didn’t consider policy-related costs like taxes, import fees, and government subsidies, choosing to focus instead on only the underlying economics.

EVs are getting cheaper every year as battery and vehicle manufacturing improve and production scales, and the researchers found that in most cases and in most places across Africa, EVs are expected to be cheaper than equivalent gas-powered vehicles by 2040. EVs should also be less expensive than vehicles that use synthetic fuels.

For two-wheelers like electric scooters, EVs could be the cheaper option even sooner: with smaller, cheaper batteries, these vehicles will be economically competitive by the end of the decade. On the other hand, one of the most difficult segments for EVs to compete in is small cars, says Christian Moretti, a researcher at ETH Zürich and the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.

Because some countries still have limited or unreliable grid access, charging is a major barrier to EV uptake, Noll says. So for EVs, the authors analyzed the cost of buying not only the vehicle but also a solar off-grid charging system. This includes solar panels, batteries, and the inverter required to transform the electricity into a version that can charge an EV. (The additional batteries help the system store energy for charging at times when the sun isn’t shining.)

Mini grids and other standalone systems that include solar panels and energy storage are increasingly common across Africa. It’s possible that this might be a primary way that EV owners in Africa will charge their vehicles in the future, Noll says.

One of the bigger barriers to EVs in Africa is financing costs, she adds. In some cases, the cost of financing can be more than the up-front cost of the vehicle, significantly driving up the cost of ownership.

Today, EVs are more expensive than equivalent gas-powered vehicles in much of the world. But in places where it’s relatively cheap to borrow money, that difference can be spread out across the course of a vehicle’s whole lifetime for little cost. Then, since it’s often cheaper to charge an EV than fuel a gas-powered car, the EV is less expensive over time.

In some African countries, however, political instability and uncertain economic conditions make borrowing money more expensive. To some extent, the high financing costs affect the purchase of any vehicle, regardless of how it’s powered. But EVs are more expensive up front than equivalent gas-powered cars, and that higher up-front cost adds up to more interest paid over time. In some cases, financing an EV can also be more expensive than financing a gas vehicle—the technology is newer, and banks may see the purchase as more of a risk and charge a higher interest rate, says Kelly Carlin, a manager in the program on carbon-free transportation at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy think tank.

The picture varies widely depending on the country, too. In South Africa, Mauritius, and Botswana, financing conditions are already close to levels required to allow EVs to reach cost parity, according to the study. In higher-risk countries (the study gives examples including Sudan, which is currently in a civil war, and Ghana, which is recovering from a major economic crisis), financing costs would need to be cut drastically for that to be the case.

Making EVs an affordable option will be a key first step to putting more on the roads in Africa and around the world. “People will start to pick up these technologies when they’re competitive,” says Nelson Nsitem, lead Africa energy transition analyst at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

Solar-based charging systems, like the ones mentioned in the study, could help make electricity less of a constraint, bringing more EVs to the roads, Nsitem says. But there’s still a need for more charging infrastructure, a major challenge in many countries where the grid needs major upgrades for capacity and reliability, he adds.

Globally, more EVs are hitting the roads every year. “The global trend is unmistakable,” Carlin says. There are questions about how quickly it’s happening in different places, he says, “but the momentum is there.”

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <div id="article-text">Imagine the moment you bring a new dog or cat into your life. That mix of excitement and responsibility. Vet visits, vaccines, learning what food suits them, managing check-ups, and always wondering how to keep them healthy as they grow.

Most pet insurance only steps in after a costly accident or illness. It doesn’t help you avoid the situation in the first place. Lassie’s product is built around a different insight: giving owners the tools to look after their pets every day, not just when something goes wrong.

Now, Stockholm-based insurtech Lassie has secured $75 million in a Series C round as it moves to scale its automated, preventive-first pet care platform across Europe. The financing follows a strong commercial run in which Lassie surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), a notable milestone for a pet-focused underwriting business.

The round drew support from prominent European investors, including Balderton Capital, Felix Capital, Inventure, Passion Capital, and Stena Sessan, signaling broad interest in technologies that blur the line between insurance and day-to-day wellbeing.

Lassie was founded to rethink pet insurance not as a passive safety net but as an active partner in animal health. Its app encourages owners to track diet, activity, and preventive health behaviours, earning rewards and lowering premiums along the way.

At the same time, its backend uses automation and AI to streamline claims, in some cases completing reimbursements within minutes after users upload a bill.

Surpassing $100 million in ARR positions Lassie among the faster-growing insurtechs in Europe. Its core markets include Sweden, Germany, and France, and the fresh capital will accelerate further rollout into key European territories.

Moreover, the company plans to invest in its AI claims and preventive health stack, deepen partnerships with brands such as Lidl and Tractive, and explore adjacent services within the broader pet care category.

At its core, Lassie’s rise is a reflection of how people now think about pets: not as occasional expenses but as family members whose health matters every day. It is shaping an ecosystem where care, knowledge, and proactive habits are as much part of the offering as reimbursement for vet bills.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a technology M&A deal, whether you are acquiring or selling a tech or software business, valuation rarely hinges on a single dimension.

Financial performance, growth efficiency, and cash flow durability remain the backbone of any transaction. In practical terms, this means metrics such as revenue and ARR, retention as a proxy for revenue quality, margin structure, and capital intensity continue to anchor how buyers price risk.

However, alongside these tangible indicators sits another layer of value, one that does not always surface cleanly in financial statements and may even remain invisible if it is not properly understood or articulated: intangible assets.

Put simply, intangible assets are the non-physical elements a company has built that enable it to generate revenue, scale efficiently, or defend its market position. In technology companies, this typically includes proprietary software, intellectual property, datasets, customer relationships, brand equity, and internal systems or processes.

Many of these assets do not fully appear in financial statements. Others are only partially captured through accounting treatment. Yet in a transaction context, they often influence how sustainable, transferable, and defensible a company’s performance really is.

Understanding how tangible performance and intangible value interact, rather than compete, is key to interpreting how modern technology deals are ultimately priced. For founders in particular, recognising and articulating this invisible layer of value can meaningfully influence how buyers assess upside and risk.

When evaluating the opportunity to acquire a business, before any discussion of intellectual property or strategic upside enters the room, investors and acquirers start by looking at the fundamentals. These typically include:

These financial metrics ultimately determine whether a deal fits within an acquirer’s investment thesis, its baseline valuation range, and, where relevant, its financing capacity (think LBOs). In this sense, they shape downside protection for both buyers and lenders.

This also explains why a company with weak financial fundamentals will struggle to command an above-market valuation, or even sustained interest, purely on the strength of its technology or brand.

However, once those fundamentals are established, buyers begin looking beneath the performance. That is where intangible assets have the opportunity to influence perception and pricing.

Two companies may show similar revenue, growth, and margin profiles on paper. Yet one may command a higher valuation than the other. The difference often lies in how durable and transferable their performance really is, and how well their story aligns with an acquirer’s strategic priorities. That is the kind of value reflected in a well-structured narrative of intangible value.

In software businesses, value creation is embedded in systems rather than physical infrastructure. Recurring revenue is supported by intellectual property, scalable processes, integrations, switching costs, customer success frameworks, and brand trust. None of these sit neatly on a balance sheet, yet all shape how defensible revenue will be post-acquisition.

From a buyer’s perspective, the question is not only how the company has performed, but how repeatable that performance will be under new ownership.

To analyse intangible assets more systematically, specialist consulting teams such as COFI solutions, often group them into four different components of intellectual capital. This helps structure due diligence and isolate risk.

Customer capital reflects the value embedded in commercial relationships.

This includes contracted recurring revenue, retention dynamics, expansion pathways, brand loyalty, and market access. In many technology acquisitions, buyers underwrite the predictability and growth potential of the customer base as much as the product itself.

There are transactions where access to customers or distribution is the primary driver. A buyer may already have comparable technology but lack penetration in a specific vertical or geography. Acquiring that customer ecosystem can accelerate growth far faster than building it organically.

Talent concentration is another defining characteristic of software companies. This is why the term “acquihire” is often used to describe acquisitions primarily driven by the desire to secure talent, a dynamic more common in lower- to mid-market transactions.

From a deal standpoint, engineering expertise, product vision, and institutional knowledge often sit with relatively small teams. This makes human capital highly valuable, but also fragile.

Key considerations in M&A transactions typically include founder dependency, retention risk, leadership depth, and cultural alignment. If too much knowledge sits with a handful of individuals, buyers will structure protections accordingly.

In acquihire scenarios, for instance, retention structures and incentive packages become central to preserving deal value.

Structural capital refers to the institutionalised knowledge that remains within the company, independent of specific individuals.

Examples include proprietary codebases, documented product architecture, patents, data infrastructure, operating playbooks, and internal tooling.

For acquirers, structural capital is often the most transferable form of intangible value. Well-documented systems reduce post-acquisition integration risk and allow buyers to scale the platform without relying on any single employee.

Partnership ecosystems can also influence valuation where they unlock revenue or create defensibility. This includes channel partnerships, platform integrations, supplier agreements, and marketplace relationships.

Acquirers will assess how durable these partnerships are and whether they transfer contractually post-transaction. Agreements containing change-of-control clauses, for instance, can introduce risk.

Where alliances materially drive growth, they can become an embedded component of enterprise value when supported by a robust strategic rationale.

Despite their abstract nature, intangible assets are not valued purely on narrative. Acquirers typically triangulate across several methodologies to ground their assessment. The three more common approaches are:

In software, this includes engineering time, development cost, data accumulation, and opportunity cost. If a platform represents years of R&D investment, its replacement cost can establish a meaningful valuation baseline.

2. Income approach: Here, the focus shifts to future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset.

For example, proprietary technology that enables premium pricing or higher retention may justify incremental valuation. The same applies to automation systems that structurally improve margins. This approach directly links intellectual property to financial performance.

3. Transferability analysis: Not all intangible value transfers equally.

Assets embedded in code, contracts, or documented processes move relatively cleanly. Knowledge held informally by founders or key employees is harder to transfer and, therefore risk-adjusted in pricing.

This is why documentation depth, process institutionalisation, and talent retention planning feature so prominently in diligence.

For founders, the practical importance of intangible assets often emerges during negotiation rather than the initial valuation setting.

While financial metrics explain historical performance and anchor valuation ranges, intangible assets help frame future potential and defensibility, often supporting outcomes towards the upper end of those ranges.

When clearly articulated, they can influence deal structure, including earn-out frameworks, rollover equity, and retention incentives.

They also help buyers underwrite post-deal risk. If revenue durability depends heavily on undocumented processes or founder relationships, that risk will be priced in.

Conversely, companies that institutionalise knowledge and diversify customer exposure tend to command stronger negotiating positions.

In founder-led processes, advisers such as L40 often see valuation inflection points emerge when intellectual property, customer capital, and operational infrastructure are clearly mapped and evidenced during diligence.

The most sophisticated technology valuations do not treat tangible and intangible assets as competing forces. Instead, they assess how the two reinforce one another.

In other words, intangible assets help create alignment. Financial statements explain the past and the present performance of a business, and to some extent its sustainability, but intangible assets provide a lens through which to frame its future potential.

Strong financial performance without defensible intellectual property may limit strategic upside. Equally, strong technology without revenue traction rarely commands premium pricing.

The highest valuations tend to emerge where:

In that balance sits the true enterprise value of a software company. Performance establishes credibility. Intangible assets shape how far that performance can extend under new ownership.

M&A advisory firms specializing in tech deals, such as L40, work with technology founders to translate intangible assets into clear, defensible value during M&A processes, ensuring negotiations reflect what truly drives the business forward.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For families living with neurodegenerative disease, the hardest part is not always the diagnosis. It is the slow erosion that follows: memory fading, personality shifting, independence shrinking.

It unfolds quietly. First, forgotten appointments. Then repeated questions. Then moments when a familiar face no longer feels familiar.

The illness does not isolate itself to one body. It rearranges the lives around it. Partners become caregivers. Children become decision-makers. Conversations grow shorter. Patience grows thinner. Guilt creeps in, for being tired, for wishing things were easier, for missing the person who is still physically there.

Neurodegeneration is rarely a single patient story. It is a family condition, stretching across kitchens, hospital corridors, and years that feel longer than they should.

Dublin-based Aerska has raised $39 million in fresh funding to battle one of the biggest scientific barriers standing between patients and meaningful treatment: getting advanced genetic medicines into the brain.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The round was co-led by EQT Life Sciences and age1, two investors known for backing high-risk, high-impact biotech. Their bet is not just on a platform, but on the possibility that diseases once managed only at the margins could eventually be slowed at their root.

Think of the brain as a house with very strict security at the door. That security system, called the blood-brain barrier, protects us from harmful substances in the blood. The problem is that it is so strict that it also blocks many medicines.

So even if scientists create a smart treatment that can “turn off” a harmful gene linked to diseases like Alzheimer’s, the drug often cannot physically get inside the brain cells where it needs to work.

Aerska is trying to solve that access problem.

Instead of injecting medicine directly into the brain, which is invasive and risky, they are developing a way to send it through the bloodstream like a normal injection. Their technology acts like a special pass that lets the treatment cross the brain’s security gate. Once inside, the medicine can reduce the production of the proteins that drive disease.

In simple terms, the science to switch off bad genes already exists. The hard part is delivery. Aerska is building the delivery vehicle.

The company’s early focus includes genetic drivers of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Both remain incurable. Existing drugs largely manage symptoms rather than altering the course of decline.

RNA interference, by contrast, aims to reduce the production of disease-causing proteins themselves. It is a strategy that addresses biology upstream, not downstream.

Longevity has become the “American dream” in European biotech, yet most serious investors are looking less at life extension and more at healthspan,  years lived with clarity and autonomy.

That is the space Aerska is positioning itself in. The goal is not abstract immortality. It is more time at home, more recognisable faces, and more preserved dignity.

The $39 million will fund preclinical development and early clinical steps. The scientific obsacle remain significant, and neurological drug development has humbled many before. But systemic RNA delivery to the brain, if proven safe and effective, would mark a structural shift in how these diseases are approached.

For now, Aerska represents something simpler: a European biotech choosing to confront one of medicine’s most stubborn frontiers,  not with incremental symptom control, but with the ambition to change the trajectory itself.

            <div id="article-text">We stand at one of history’s most exhilarating crossroads. Artificial intelligence is rewriting the rules of work, business, and human potential at breathtaking speed. The very capabilities that make us most human, our creativity, our imagination, our ability to dream up what doesn’t yet exist, are becoming our most valuable assets.

This is not a story about humans versus machines. It’s a story about human potential unleashed. It’s about a future where technology handles the tedious so we can focus on the transcendent.

Where the dreamers, the questioners, the bold thinkers who color outside the lines are not just welcomed, they are essential.

Imagine a world where you never again have to spend hours on mind-numbing data entry, formatting documents, or wrestling with spreadsheets, where the repetitive tasks that drain your energy and dull your spirit are handled instantly by AI, freeing you to focus on work that genuinely excites you.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What we are witnessing is not the replacement of human workers; it is the liberation of human potential. AI is taking on the equivalent of heavy lifting, and in doing so, it’s creating space for something extraordinary: a global renaissance of creative thinking.

Think about what becomes possible when you’re freed from the mundane. When a graphic designer no longer spends half their day on production tasks, they can explore ten bold creative directions instead of one safe option.

When a teacher is not buried in administrative work, they can devise innovative ways to spark curiosity in every student. When operational details do not consume an entrepreneur, they can envision entirely new possibilities for serving their customers.

This is the gift AI is giving us: time and mental space to be more fully human, more creative, more imaginative than ever before.

Here is what the smartest organisations are discovering: when everyone has access to the same powerful AI tools, the differentiator is not the technology. It’s the human wielding it.

Two companies can use identical AI platforms. One generates competent but forgettable content. The other creates campaigns that move people to tears, spark movements, and transform markets. The difference? Creative vision. Human imagination. The ability to ask questions that AI would never think to ask.

The most successful people in the AI era won’t be those who compete with machines at what machines do well. They will be those who ask better questions.

The creative thinker who asks “What if we completely reimagined this?” instead of “How can we make this 10% better?” The visionary who wonders “What problem are we not seeing?” instead of “How do we solve this defined problem?” The innovator who questions “Why are we doing this at all?” instead of “How can we do this more efficiently?”

These questions change trajectories. They open new possibilities. They create breakthroughs. And they can only come from curious, creative human minds willing to challenge assumptions and imagine alternatives.

It is true that AI will displace certain positions, as noted by the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report. It projects that 92 million roles will be displaced by 2030, with positions like graphic designers and administrative assistants among those facing decline due to automation and generative AI.

This technological disruption is simultaneously unleashing a creative renaissance. The same WEF report reveals that 170 million new roles will be created, resulting in a net gain of 78 million jobs, with creative thinking, resilience, flexibility, and agility emerging as some of the fastest-growing skills in demand alongside technical capabilities.

Forbes has noted that innovation and creativity rank among the top skills needed for the future, with employers recognising that while AI may displace 14% of jobs by 2030, the aspects of innovation that revolve around human empathy and deeper consciousness cannot be replicated by machines.

The message is clear: as AI handles the repetitive and predictable, human creativity becomes not just valuable but essential. Organisations are not looking for people who can compete with AI at computational tasks; they are seeking creative thinkers who can imagine entirely new possibilities and ask questions machines would never consider.

The uniquely human qualities of intuition, empathy, and visionary thinking to solve problems that have not even been defined yet.

Here is the beauty about creative thinking: it’s not a single skill or talent. It’s a constellation of capabilities, and each person’s constellation is unique.

Maybe you are brilliant at seeing patterns others miss, connecting dots across completely different domains. Perhaps you have an uncanny ability to understand what people truly need, even when they can’t articulate it themselves.

You might be exceptional at taking a spark of an idea and developing it into something magnificent, or at bringing people together in ways that generate creative breakthroughs.

Some creative thinkers are wildly imaginative, dreaming up possibilities that seem to come from nowhere. Others are integrative, synthesizing diverse ideas into coherent wholes. Some challenge every assumption; others build masterfully on existing foundations. Some think in images, others in systems, still others in stories.

Every version is valuable. Every version is needed.

The AI era does not demand that you become someone you’re not. It invites you to become more fully yourself: to lean into your natural creative strengths and develop them intentionally. Your particular way of thinking creatively is your signature, your competitive advantage, your gift to offer the world.

The creative thinkers of the next decade won’t be lone geniuses toiling in isolation. They will be collaborative creators, working alongside both humans and AI to achieve things neither could accomplish alone.

Imagine participating in creative collaborations where AI handles the analytical heavy lifting while you and your colleagues focus on vision, judgment, and inspiration. Where technology expands what’s possible while human creativity provides direction and meaning.

Where diverse perspectives combine with computational power to solve challenges that once seemed insurmountable.

This is already happening. Architects are using AI to explore thousands of design possibilities, then applying their creative judgment to create buildings that inspire.

Scientists are using AI to identify patterns in vast datasets, then applying creative thinking to formulate revolutionary hypotheses.

Artists are using AI as a creative tool, generating works that express uniquely human perspectives in entirely new ways. You can be part of this creative renaissance. Your ideas, your questions, your unique perspective matter more than ever.

The accelerating pace of change in our world makes creative thinking not just valuable but essential for adaptation and survival. The challenges we face: climate change, resource scarcity, social fragmentation, and emerging technologies with unpredictable consequences don’t have predetermined solutions in any playbook.

They require the kind of flexible, imaginative thinking that can break free from established frameworks and conventional wisdom. Moreover, as the half-life of specific technical skills continues to shrink, the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn ( which is itself a creative process) becomes more important than mastery of any particular tool or technique.

Those who can think creatively can pivot between domains, see opportunities in disruption, and continuously reinvent themselves and their contributions.

Perhaps most importantly, creative thinking will be crucial for maintaining meaning and purpose in an increasingly automated world.

As machines handle more of our productivity, human value will increasingly derive from our capacity for original expression, cultural creation, emotional resonance, and the kind of meaning-making that gives life richness beyond mere efficiency.

The future is not about those who compete with machines at “machine like” tasks, but to those who can amplify their humanity by asking better questions, imagining more beautiful possibilities, and creating connections that matter.

The AI revolution is here, and it’s revealing a profound truth: the most powerful technology humans have ever created still can’t replicate the magic of human creativity. It can’t dream up what doesn’t exist. It can’t make intuitive leaps that defy logic. It can’t feel what matters, imagine what’s possible, or create meaning from chaos.

The next decade will belong to the creative thinkers because they are doing what AI cannot. They will ask better questions and make unexpected connections. Solving problems that have not been defined. Creating experiences that move people. Imagining futures worth building.

The next decade belongs to the creative thinkers. Make sure you are one of them.

            <h2>Naboo raises $70M to turn AI event planning into corporate procurement platform</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/naboo-raises-70m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-headquartered Naboo has raised a $70m in Series B as it accelerates its ambition to become the operating layer for how large companies plan, book, and control corporate events. The round is led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, the same investor that backed Mistral AI in 2023, and lands just a year after Naboo closed a €20m Series A.

Naboo positions itself as an AI-powered procurement platform for corporate events, covering everything from venue booking and travel to supplier coordination and budget control.

Founded in 2022, Naboo built its name on simplifying how companies organise and run corporate events,  from booking venues and catering to logistics and attendee management, using an all-in-one platform that brings speed and transparency to a typically fragmented process.

By folding AI into what is traditionally a fragmented, manual process, the company says it has become Europe’s leading purchasing platform for corporate events, a corner of the broader $400bn global events market that has long resisted software consolidation.

The timing matters. Corporate events sit at the intersection of travel, finance, and operations, yet they are often managed outside standard procurement systems.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Naboo’s pitch is that events should be treated like any other strategic spend, measurable, optimised, and governed through a single platform. That logic has resonated with large enterprises, particularly in the UK, which has become Naboo’s biggest market outside France following the opening of its London office in 2025.

With fresh capital in hand, Naboo is now stepping more decisively onto the global stage. The company is opening a new hub in New York as part of a broader US expansion, betting that multinational clients want a single system to manage events across regions, teams, and currencies.

Within just three years, Naboo has grown into one of the more visible players in the category, helped by enterprises looking for better control over decentralised spending.

The bigger shift, however, goes beyond events. Naboo plans to extend its AI procurement platform into “tail spend”, the long tail of smaller, harder-to-track purchases that typically fall outside core procurement tools.

In enterprise finance, this is often labelled Class C spending, and while each transaction is small, the total adds up fast. Naboo’s goal is to give companies a unified, AI-driven view of this spend, starting with events and branching outward.

The targets are ambitious. Naboo says it aims to triple revenue in 2026 and to exceed $1bn in business volume by 2027.

Whether it gets there will depend on how far enterprises are willing to centralise spending that has historically lived in spreadsheets and inboxes. What’s clear is that Naboo is betting that the next wave of enterprise AI won’t just analyse data, it will quietly reshape how money is spent.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Databricks is having one of those years that most enterprise software companies would quietly envy. The data and AI platform says it has reached a $5.4bn annual revenue run rate, growing 65% year over year, at a time when growth across the sector has cooled noticeably.

For a private company, that pace is rare. And it helps explain why investors have continued to pour money into Databricks, even as funding has become more selective.

The company says it has now raised more than $7bn in total capital, including recent equity funding that values the business at $134bn, alongside a large debt facility to support long-term expansion.

What’s driving the numbers isn’t just classic data analytics. Databricks says around $1.4bn of its revenue run rate now comes from AI-related products, reflecting how quickly companies are trying to turn large datasets into something usable for machine learning and generative AI. Instead of building separate stacks for data and AI, many customers are opting for platforms that combine both.

In practice, that means Databricks is leaning into tools that make complex data systems easier to use. Products like Genie, which lets people query data using plain language, and Lakebase, a new operational database designed for AI-driven applications, are meant to lower the barrier between raw data and real-world use.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

While Databricks is still private, its scale increasingly puts it in the same conversation as public cloud giants.

“We’re seeing overwhelming investor interest in our next chapter as we go after two new markets,” said Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO of Databricks. “With this new capital, we’ll double down on Lakebase so developers can create operational databases built for AI agents. At the same time, we’re investing in Genie to let every employee chat with their data, driving accurate and actionable insights.

Databricks’ numbers also cut through a lot of the noise around enterprise AI. While many companies are still talking about transformation, this growth suggests businesses are already spending on the unglamorous parts, cleaning data, connecting systems, and making AI usable inside real organisations.

If that trend holds, the next phase of AI won’t be defined by new models or flashy demos, but by which platforms quietly become impossible to replace. Databricks is clearly betting it can be one of them.
