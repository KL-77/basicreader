            <h2>Netflix says users can cancel service if HBO Max merger makes it too expensive</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/netflix-claims-subscribers-will-get-more-content-for-less-if-it-buys-hbo-max/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There is concern that subscribers might be negatively affected if Netflix acquires Warner Bros. Discovery’s (WBD’s) streaming and movie studios businesses. One of the biggest fears is that the merger would lead to higher prices due to Netflix having less competition. During a Senate hearing today, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos suggested that the merger would have an opposite effect.

Sarandos was speaking at a hearing held by the US Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights, “Examining the Competitive Impact of the Proposed Netflix-Warner Brothers Transaction.”

Sarandos aimed to convince the subcommittee that Netflix wouldn’t become a monopoly in streaming or in movie and TV production if regulators allowed its acquisition to close. Netflix is the largest subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) provider by subscribers (301.63 million as of January 2025), and WBD is the third (128 million streaming subscribers, including users of HBO Max and, to a smaller degree, Discovery+).

Speaking at today’s hearing, Sarandos said:

Netflix and Warner Bros. both have streaming services, but they are very complementary. In fact, 80 percent of HBO Max subscribers also subscribe to Netflix. We will give consumers more content for less.

During the hearing, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) asked Sarandos how Netflix can ensure that streaming remains “affordable” after a merger, especially after Netflix issued a price hike in January 2025 despite it adding more subscribers.

Sarandos said the streaming industry is still competitive. The executive claimed that previous Netflix price hikes have come with “a lot more value” for subscribers.

“We are a one-click cancel, so if the consumer says, ‘That’s too much for what I’m getting,’ they can cancel with one click,” Sarandos said.

When pressed further on pricing, the executive argued that the merger doesn’t pose “any concentration risk” and that Netflix is working with the US Department of Justice on potential guardrails against more price hikes.

Sarandos claimed that the merger would “create more value for consumers.” However, his idea of value isn’t just about how much subscribers pay to stream but about content quality. By his calculations, which he provided without further details, Netflix subscribers spend an average of 35 cents per hour of content watched, compared to 90 cents for Paramount+. The Netflix stat is similar to one provided by MoffettNathanson in January 2025, finding that in the prior quarter, on average, Netflix generated 34 cents in subscription fees per hour of content viewed per subscriber. At the time, the research firm said Paramount+ made an average of 76 cents per hour of content viewed per subscriber.

Netflix views WBD as “both a competitor and a supplier,” Sarandos said when subcommittee chair Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) asked why Netflix wants to buy WB’s film studios, per Variety. The streaming executive claimed that Netflix’s “history is about adding more and more” content and choice.

During the hearing, Sarandos argued that streaming is a competitive business and pointed to Google, Apple, and Amazon as “deep-pocketed tech companies trying to run away with the TV business.” He tried to downplay concerns of Netflix becoming a monopoly by emphasizing YouTube’s high TV viewership. Nielsen’s The Gauge tracker shows which platforms Americans use most when using their TVs (as opposed to laptops, tablets, or other devices). In December, it said that YouTube, not including YouTube TV, had more TV viewership (12.7 percent) than any other SVOD service, including second-place Netflix (9 percent. Sarandos claimed that Netflix would have 21 percent of the SVOD market if it merged with HBO Max.

We’re in the midst of what’s expected to be a long series of arguments as Netflix and Paramount Skydance attempt to own WBD’s assets. In the most recent developments, Netflix amended its $72 billion offer to be all-cash. Netflix is looking to buy HBO Max and WB’s film studios for $27.75 per share, or an enterprise value of $82.7 billion. Paramount is seeking a hostile takeover and has sued WBD over its Netflix deal. It has offered $108.4 billion at $30 per share for all of WBD, including its cable channels.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last month, Apple TV released a teaser for the second season of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters, part of Legendary Entertainment’s MonsterVerse, which brought Godzilla, King Kong, and various other monsters (kaiju) created by Toho Co., Ltd into a shared narrative. But we only got the most fleeting glimpse of the promised new mythical Titan threatening the human race. The full trailer just dropped and rectifies that: it’s a gigantic tentacled undersea being dubbed Titan X—and only Kong and Godzilla can stop it.

As previously reported, the first season picked up where 2014’s Godzilla left off, specifically the introduction of Project Monarch, a secret organization established in the 1950s to study Godzilla and other kaiju—after attempts to kill Godzilla with nuclear weapons failed. In the S1 finale, Godzilla fights off an Ion Dragon, tossing it through a rift back to the Hollow Earth, and Lee Shaw (Kurt Russell) seemingly sacrifices himself to save his colleagues. Per the official Season 2 premise:

Season two will pick up with the fate of Monarch—and the world—hanging in the balance. The dramatic saga reveals buried secrets that reunite our heroes (and villains) on Kong’s Skull Island, and a new, mysterious village where a mythical Titan rises from the sea. The ripple effects of the past make waves in the present day, blurring the bonds between family, friend and foe—all with the threat of a titan event on the horizon.

In addition to Russell, returning cast members include Wyatt Russell (son of Kurt) as the younger Shaw; Anna Sawai as Cate Randa; Kiersey Clemons as May; Ren Watabe as Kentaro Randa; Joe Tippett as Tim; Elisa Lasowski as Duvall; and Anders Holm playing the younger version of Monarch researcher Bill Randa. Takehiro Hira, Amber Midthunder, Curtiss Cook, Cliff Curtis, Dominique Tipper, and Camilo Jiménez Varón will join the S2 cast as guest stars.

The full trailer opens with our plucky team realizing that whatever kaiju is causing the latest havoc isn’t Kong, or Godzilla, but something even bigger. And it has massive tentacles that the kaiju uses to wrap around a manned boat and drag it down to the ocean depths. Cate blames herself for pressing the button that opened the rift, thereby unleashing this new menace on humankind. Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk, so our only hope is to call on Kong and Godzilla, according to Shaw, because “to destroy a monster takes another monster.” But they might just make things worse. At least we get to see a roaring Kong deliver a powerful punch to the new Titan’s face.

The second season of Monarch: Legacy of Monsters premieres on Apple TV on February 27, 2026. New episodes will be released every Friday through May 1, 2026. And the MonsterVerse is still expanding: Apple TV recently greenlit a spinoff prequel series featuring Wyatt Russell’s younger Shaw, set during the Cold War.

            <h2>Nvidia's $100 billion OpenAI deal has seemingly vanished</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/02/five-months-later-nvidias-100-billion-openai-investment-plan-has-fizzled-out/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In September 2025, Nvidia and OpenAI announced a letter of intent for Nvidia to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI’s AI infrastructure. At the time, the companies said they expected to finalize details “in the coming weeks.” Five months later, no deal has closed, Nvidia’s CEO now says the $100 billion figure was “never a commitment,” and Reuters reports that OpenAI has been quietly seeking alternatives to Nvidia chips since last year.

Reuters also wrote that OpenAI is unsatisfied with the speed of some Nvidia chips for inference tasks, citing eight sources familiar with the matter. Inference is the process by which a trained AI model generates responses to user queries. According to the report, the issue became apparent in OpenAI’s Codex, an AI code-generation tool. OpenAI staff reportedly attributed some of Codex’s performance limitations to Nvidia’s GPU-based hardware.

After the Reuters story published and Nvidia’s stock price took a dive, Nvidia and OpenAI have tried to smooth things over publicly. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X: “We love working with NVIDIA and they make the best AI chips in the world. We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time. I don’t get where all this insanity is coming from.”

The September announcement described a wildly ambitious plan: 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems for OpenAI, requiring power output equal to roughly 10 nuclear reactors. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC at the time that the project would match Nvidia’s total GPU shipments for the year. “This is a giant project,” Huang said.

But the deal was always a letter of intent, not a binding contract. And in recent weeks, Huang has been walking back the number. On Saturday, he told reporters in Taiwan that the $100 billion was “never a commitment.” He said OpenAI had invited Nvidia to invest “up to” that amount and that Nvidia would “invest one step at a time.”

“We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI,” Huang said. “Sam is closing the round, and we will absolutely be involved. We will invest a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we’ve ever made.” But when asked if it would be $100 billion, Huang replied, “No, no, nothing like that.”

A Wall Street Journal report on Friday said Nvidia insiders had expressed doubts about the transaction and that Huang had privately criticized what he described as a lack of discipline in OpenAI’s business approach. The Journal also reported that Huang had expressed concern about the competition OpenAI faces from Google and Anthropic. Huang called those claims “nonsense.”

Nvidia shares fell about 1.1 percent on Monday following the reports. Sarah Kunst, managing director at Cleo Capital, told CNBC that the back-and-forth was unusual. “One of the things I did notice about Jensen Huang is that there wasn’t a strong ‘It will be $100 billion.’ It was, ‘It will be big. It will be our biggest investment ever.’ And so I do think there are some question marks there.”

In September, Bryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, noted the circular nature of such investments to CNBC. “Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia,” Talkington said. “I feel like this is going to be very virtuous for Jensen.”

Tech critic Ed Zitron has been critical of Nvidia’s circular investments for some time, which touch dozens of tech companies, including major players and startups. They are also all Nvidia customers.

“NVIDIA seeds companies and gives them the guaranteed contracts necessary to raise debt to buy GPUs from NVIDIA,” Zitron wrote on Bluesky last September, “Even though these companies are horribly unprofitable and will eventually die from a lack of any real demand.”

Outside of sourcing GPUs from Nvidia, OpenAI has reportedly discussed working with startups Cerebras and Groq, both of which build chips designed to reduce inference latency. But in December, Nvidia struck a $20 billion licensing deal with Groq, which Reuters sources say ended OpenAI’s talks with Groq. Nvidia hired Groq’s founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with other senior leaders as part of the arrangement.

In January, OpenAI announced a $10 billion deal with Cerebras instead, adding 750 megawatts of computing capacity for faster inference through 2028. Sachin Katti, who joined OpenAI from Intel in November to lead compute infrastructure, said the partnership adds “a dedicated low-latency inference solution” to OpenAI’s platform.

But OpenAI has clearly been hedging its bets. Beyond the Cerebras deal, the company struck an agreement with AMD in October for six gigawatts of GPUs and announced plans with Broadcom to develop a custom AI chip to wean itself off of Nvidia dependence. When those chips will be ready, however, is currently unknown.</div>

            <h2>Newborn dies after mother drinks raw milk during pregnancy</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/newborns-death-spurs-raw-milk-warning-in-new-mexico/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A newborn baby has died in New Mexico from a Listeria infection that state health officials say was likely contracted from raw (unpasteurized) milk that the baby’s mother drank during pregnancy.

In a news release Tuesday, officials warned people not to consume any raw dairy, highlighting that it can be teeming with a variety of pathogens. Those germs are especially dangerous to pregnant women, as well as young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems.

“Raw milk can contain numerous disease-causing germs, including Listeria, which is bacteria that can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, or fatal infection in newborns, even if the mother is only mildly ill,” the New Mexico Department of Health said in the press release.

The health department noted that it could not definitively link the baby’s death to the raw milk the mother drank. But raw milk is notorious for transmitting Listeria monocytogenes bacterium. The Food and Drug Administration has a “Food Safety for Moms-to-Be” webpage about Listeria, in which it poses the question and answer: “How could I get listeriosis? You can get listeriosis by eating raw, unpasteurized milk and unpasteurized milk products… .”

Listeria is a particular danger during pregnancy. When exposed, pregnant people are 10 times more likely to develop a Listeria infection than other healthy adults because altered immune responses during pregnancy make it harder to fight off infections. Further, Listeria is one of a few pathogens that are able to cross the placental barrier and infect a developing fetus.

The American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists warns patients that if babies survive getting infected during pregnancy, they may be born with “serious infections of the blood or brain.”

“Listeriosis can cause lifelong health problems for your baby, including intellectual disability, paralysis, seizures, blindness, or problems with the brain, kidneys, or heart,” ACOG warns. “Listeriosis can also cause death in newborns.”

While a Listeria infection during pregnancy is one specific risk of raw milk, health officials warn that raw milk can cause serious, potentially life-threatening infections in anyone. Without pasteurization—a process of briefly heating milk to a temperature high enough to kill germs—milk and dairy products can also contain Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, E. coli, Brucella, and Salmonella, among other pathogens.

Still, the unsanitary dairy has grown in popularity among devotees of the wellness industry, including those in the Make America Healthy Again movement. Anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has personally endorsed drinking raw milk and, prior to taking up the position, claimed he would end the FDA’s “war on public health,” including its “aggressive suppression” of raw milk.</div>

            <h2>X office raided in France's Grok probe; Elon Musk summoned for questioning</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/x-office-raided-in-frances-grok-probe-elon-musk-summoned-for-questioning/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">French law enforcement authorities today raided X’s Paris office and summoned Elon Musk for questioning as part of an investigation into illegal content. The Paris public prosecutor’s office said the yearlong probe was recently expanded because the Grok chatbot was disseminating Holocaust-denial claims and sexually explicit deepfakes.

Europol, which is assisting French authorities, said today the “investigation concerns a range of suspected criminal offenses linked to the functioning and use of the platform, including the dissemination of illegal content and other forms of online criminal activity.” Europol’s cybercrime center provided “an analyst on the ground in Paris to assist national authorities.” The French Gendarmerie’s cybercrime unit is also aiding the investigation.

French authorities want to question Musk and former X CEO Linda Yaccarino, who quit last year amid a controversy over Grok’s praise of Hitler. Prosecutors summoned Musk and Yaccarino for interviews in April 2026, though the interviews are being described as voluntary.

The office of Paris public prosecutor Laure Beccuau said today that the potential crimes being investigated include complicity in possession and distribution of pornographic images of minors; infringement of personal image rights via sexual deepfakes; denial of crimes against humanity; fraudulent extraction of data from an automated data processing system; falsification of the operation of an automated data processing system; and operation of an illegal online platform by an organized group.

We contacted X today and will update this article if it provides any comment. The company criticized the investigation at an earlier stage, alleging in July 2025 that France was conducting “a politically motivated criminal investigation into X” that “threatens our users’ rights to privacy and free speech.”

X said in July 2025 that it was “in the dark” over what specific allegations it faced related to manipulation of the X algorithm and fraudulent data extraction. X said it would not comply with France’s request for access to its recommendation algorithm and real-time data about all user posts.

The Paris prosecutor’s office today said the investigation is taking a “constructive approach” with the goal of ensuring that X complies with French laws “insofar as it operates on national territory.” In addition to Musk and Yaccarino, the prosecutor’s office is seeking interviews with X employees about the allegations and potential compliance measures.

Separately, UK communications regulator Ofcom today provided an update on its investigation into Grok’s generation of sexual deepfakes of real people, including children. Ofcom is “gathering and analyzing evidence to determine whether X has broken the law” and is “progressing the investigation as a matter of urgency,” it said. Ofcom is not currently investigating xAI, the Musk company that develops Grok, but said it “continue[s] to demand answers from xAI about the risks it poses.”

The UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which regulates data protection, said today it opened a formal investigation into X regarding the “processing of personal data in relation to the Grok artificial intelligence system and its potential to produce harmful sexualized image and video content.”

“We have taken this step following reports that Grok has been used to generate non‑consensual sexual imagery of individuals, including children,” the ICO said. “The reported creation and circulation of such content raises serious concerns under UK data protection law and presents a risk of significant potential harm to the public.”</div>

            <h2>Nintendo Switch is the second-bestselling game console ever, behind only the PS2</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/original-nintendo-switch-passes-the-ds-to-become-nintendos-bestselling-console/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Although it was finally replaced last year by the new Switch 2, the orginal switch isn’t done just yet. Many recent Switch games (and a handful of major updates, like the one for Animal Crossing) have been released in both Switch and Switch 2 editions, and Nintendo continues to sell all editions of the original console as entry-level systems for those who can’t pay $450 for a Switch 2.

The 9-year-old Switch’s continued availability has helped it clear a milestone, according to the company’s third-quarter financial results (PDF). As of December 31, 2025, Nintendo says the Switch “has reached the highest sales volume of any Nintendo hardware” with a total of 155.37 million units sold, surpassing the original DS’s lifetime total of 154.02 million units. The console has sold 3.25 million units in Nintendo’s fiscal 2026 so far, including 1.36 million units over the holidays. Those consoles have sold despite price hikes that Nintendo introduced in August of 2025, citing “market conditions.”

That makes the Switch the second-bestselling game console of all time, just three years after it became the third-bestselling game console of all time. The only frontier left for the Switch to conquer is Sony’s PlayStation 2, which Sony says sold “over 160 million units” over its long life. At its current sales rate (Nintendo predicts it will sell roughly 750,000 Switches in the next quarter), it would take the Switch another couple of years to cross that line, but those numbers are likely to taper off as we get deeper into the Switch 2 era.

As for the Switch 2, it’s off to a strong start. It had sold 15 million units by the end of December, making it the “fastest-selling dedicated video game platform released by Nintendo to date,” and it had sold a total of 17.37 million units by the end of the quarter. That’s impressive for a console that hasn’t even been out for a year yet, and it already puts the Switch 2 ahead of the Wii U’s lifetime sales (13.56 million) and not far off from the GameCube’s (21.74 million units).

The huge Switch install base means that the older console is still driving most of Nintendo’s software sales. Nintendo says it sold 47.37 million Switch games in the third quarter of its fiscal 2026, compared to 17.31 million Switch 2 games. Nintendo’s bestselling game for the year so far is Mario Kart World with 14.03 million units—doubtlessly helped along by its status as a pack-in game for many Switch 2 consoles—but Pokémon Legends Z-A (12.3 million units across Switch and Switch 2 editions) and Donkey Kong Bananza (4.25 million units) also got shoutouts.

Nintendo also recorded 129 million “annual playing users” across its consoles for 2025, a number that has been essentially flat for the last three years (Nintendo recorded 128 million active users in 2023 and 130 million in 2024).</div>

            <h2>Reddit Mod Deleted Breathtaking Photo Taken by NASA Astronaut From Space Because It Was “Blurry”</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Veteran NASA astronaut Don Pettit returned from his 220-day mission on board the International Space Station in April 2025, the day of his 70th birthday, making him the oldest active astronaut on the space agency’s roster.

During his seven-month stint on board the aging orbital outpost, his fourth trip to space, Pettit took the time to photograph some dazzling views of the Earth below.

On October 20, 2024, he took a stunning picture of an airplane that was passing by at cruising altitude hundreds of miles below him, a perspective only a handful of people get to enjoy. The plane was likely at around 7.5 miles in altitude, while the ISS orbits the Earth at around 250 miles.

But a moderator at the r/aviation subreddit didn’t look too kindly on the shot after Pettit posted it to the forum over the weekend, deeming it too “blurry” and taking it down as a result. According to a circulating screenshot posted by a user who first brought attention to the takedown, the mod team pointed to the subreddit’s rules to justify its decision, which state that “all blurry or low quality pictures are removed.”

The controversial decision kicked off a heated discussion — and prompted an interjection by a different moderator.

“We brought some new people onto the mod team and unfortunately there are some Learning curves,” the moderator wrote, apologizing for the takedown. “I caught the issue and fixed it. Thanks to everyone who let me know that this happened.”

“I’d say the quality of the picture is pretty dang good considering that it’s from about 250 miles away,” the mod added in a separate apology addressed to Pettit directly.

A quick perusal of Pettit’s submissions to Reddit shows several other fascinating vantage points from the ISS, from atmospheric distortion of the Moon that makes it appear squashed to the Milky Way glinting behind the Earth at night. Another long exposure shows the trails left behind by SpaceX’s Sun-reflecting Starlink satellites.

Other Reddit users were far more impressed than the mod who pulled the post down.

“Can’t believe I got flexed by someone on ISS,” one user wrote.

“Tower, can we get a speed check?” another user joked. (The ISS orbits the Earth at a ground speed of 17,100 mph, while an average passenger jet travels at around 500 to 700 mph, depending on conditions.)

Nonetheless, many users on the subreddit were left with a bad taste in their mouths, with one user describing the unfortunate takedown as “Reddit in a nutshell, baby!” — in an apparent reference to the often-pedantic nature of the people who moderate niche interest subreddits.

“Dear mods, please show NASA how to take better pictures from space so you don’t have to delete them,” the user, who initially raised the issue, wrote.

“What a joke,” another user mocked. One of the most epic pics of aviation from the coolest possible place from an actual astronaut.”

“‘This post breaks our rules,&#39;” they added. “Give me a break, man.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, the United States stock market has been a juggernaut on the international stage. The US dollar has been — and still is — the de facto currency globally.

But for how much longer that will be the case is now looking uncertain. As the New York Times reports, investors are starting to look elsewhere as the Trump administration continues to threaten the independence of its central bank, start a trade war with Europe, and implement self-conflicting monetary policies. As a result of it all, the US dollar continues to weaken, making foreign investments in Europe and Asia far more lucrative.

Meanwhile, Wall Street continues to make enormous bets on artificial intelligence, a highly risky gambit, as tech companies still have plenty to prove and a return still appears to be many years out. The AI boom has sent tech company valuations soaring: the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, NVIDIA, and Tesla) now account for just over a third of the entire S&P 500, with experts warning that the industry could be propping up a rough-looking US economy.

The International Monetary Fund warned that the weakening hype surrounding AI could be among the biggest risks to global economic growth, noting that if expectations about AI turn out to be too optimistic, a market correction could send shockwaves across global markets.

President Donald Trump’s nomination for the next chair of the central banking system, Kevin Warsh, appeared to do little to stop the continued weakening of the US dollar, which hit a four-year low last week. The Euro and British pound saw their values soar when measured against the US dollar this year.

Trump —also a huge AI booster, underlining the circular nature of the whole situation — celebrated the weakening dollar, arguing it would make products more affordable, in comments that alarmed investors. Officials had to step in to smooth things over, the NYT reported, arguing that despite Trump’s comments, the US government still supports a strong dollar.

Whether Wall Street’s enormous appetite for AI continues to be a weakening economy’s saving grace, for how long remains to be seen. Investors are sending a clear signal: riskier bets are no longer a hot commodity, as demonstrated by the recent plummet in the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Instead, historically safer bets like gold are proving far more lucrative, reaching record highs of $5,500 an ounce in January. Despite a massive drop last week, gold is trading 70 percent higher year over year, indicating investors are seriously on edge.

            <div id="article-text">Like a hurricane that tears down even the sturdiest storm shelters, the Epstein files have cut a path through a vast swath of America’s intellectual, political, and financial elite.

The latest tranche of emails related to the notorious sex predator have been particularly devastating. Fans of the left-libertarian academic Noam Chomsky are in shambles after learning the two were in close contact until around 2017, while tech luminaries from Bill Gates to the Google cofounders were similarly caught schmoozing with the disgraced financier.

Cypto bros are no exception. After the Department of Justice released three million files over the weekend, blockchain enthusiasts were quick to discover a certain Jeffery Epstein was an active and prominent figure in crypto during its formative years.

One file highlighted by crypto investor Patrick Riley shows an email chain between Epstein and Joichi Ito, the former head of MIT’s Media Lab whose Digital Currency Initiative played an integral role in helping crypto grow into the giant it is today. As the email exchange makes clear, Epstein’s backing was a key pillar in establishing the DGI.

“FYI,” Ito told Epstein, “used gift funds to underwrite this which allowed us to move quickly and win this round. Thanks.”

“At the time this letter was written, there were around 12,000 commits to Bitcoin’s code,” Riley remarked in a post on social media. “Today there are 47,583 commits to Bitcoin’s code. That means that 74.79 percent of the Bitcoin core development and code was committed after Jeffery Epstein took over the defacto senior management role as benefactor.”

That news didn’t go over well with crypto enthusiasts, to put it lightly.

“75 percent of bitcoins code comes directly from [Epstein’s] investments,” a crypto account called Crypto Bitlord agonized in response. “We’ve basically funded an elite global pedophile ring since 2015. I feel sick.”

Another crypto account lamented that “BTC has been funding a global elite pedo group since 2015… great.”

The email chain from Ito also suggests that Bitcoin’s mysterious developer — the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto — may have in fact been five “core developers,” each of whom was in talks with Epstein.

One of those core devs may have been early Bitcoin contributor Adam Back, who invented the proof-of-work algorithm cited by “Nakamoto’s” original whitepaper on crypto. A separate email chain shows Ito suggesting the convicted sex criminal meet with Back and other tech luminaires to discuss this revolutionary new currency.

“I think we should have a meeting with Jeremy Rubin, Adam Back (or other core developer of bitcoin), Seth [Lloyd], Martin Nowak, you and a few others soon about money and the future of finance,” a 2015 email from Ito reads.

As these files seem to suggest, Back had sought a meeting with Epstein to secure funding for his crypto company, Blockstream. Unsealed records show Back along with Blockstream CEO Austin Hill trying to schedule a trip to meet Epstein in St. Thomas — one of the main US Virgin Islands located a little over six miles away from the infamous islet, Little Saint James.

“Sunday in NY I think is a no-go because of our commitments on the west coast, but Fri/Saturday on the Island are still possible,” Hill told Epstein.

“great. ,” the financier replied in typo-filled prose, “you will need to fly to st thomas. just let me know times. looking foward to it.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was only yesterday that Elon Musk announced that SpaceX had acquired his AI company xAI, a merger that catapulted the rocket maker into being the most valuable private company in the world, but raised significant questions about bringing two firms with vastly different missions under the same wing.

Now, the freshly-joined entity is facing one of its first major tests. On Tuesday, French authorities raided the offices of X, Elon Musk’s social media site owned by xAI, as part of its ongoing criminal investigation into the sexual deepfakes generated by its AI chatbot Grok. Following the acquisition, of course, those X offices are now SpaceX offices.

The raid was carried out by the Paris Public Prosecutor Office’s cybercrime unit, in collaboration with French police and Europol. And it’s perhaps an early warning sign of how all the baggage that SpaceX is inheriting by bringing Musk’s controversial AI efforts into the fold may haunt the company going forward.

In an announcement, the Paris prosecutors said it was investigating criminal offenses related to the distribution of “child pornography images,” the infringement of personal rights through the generation of “sexual deepfakes,” and the denial of “crimes against humanity,” per NBC News.

In addition to searching X’s offices, Musk and X’s former CEO Linda Yaccarino were issued a voluntary summons to appear and answer questions the week of April 20.

SpaceX is not without controversy: its Starship rocket has generated plenty of scrutiny and public backlash from its frequent explosions, which critics argue threaten public safety and flout environmental laws. But by and large, it’s the most beloved Musk venture, as space exploration is something that earns a lot of public goodwill, serving some greater mission for all of humankind. Now, its image is undoubtedly being tainted by its association with xAI and Grok.

Grok in particular is no stranger to making the wrong kinds of headlines. Last month, French prosecutors opened an investigation into Musk’s platform after the AI chatbot was used to generate nonconsensual sexualized images of real people, many of them appearing to be minors, in a weeks-long spree that started at the end of December and stretched into January.

The digital “undressing” trend was so out of control that the AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated Grok was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute. In all, the Center for Countering Digital Hate estimated that as many as 3,000,000 of these sexualized images were produced, including more than 23,000 images of children.

The prosecutor office also said it was investigating the distribution of Holocaust denial content on the platform. Far-right accounts have flourished under Musk’s ownership of X, formerly Twitter, with Musk often resharing racist conspiracy theories and antisemitic rhetoric — a habit mirrored by Grok, which gained notoriety for calling itself “MechaHitler” during a particularly racist posting spree last summer.

Governments abroad have seemed to take Grok’s AI nudes of women and children more seriously. Indonesia and Malaysia banned access to Grok, though the former has just lifted its ban “conditionally.” UK prime minister Keir Starmer vowed to crackdown on the chatbot and showed support for the nation’s communications regulator Ofcom, after it announced its own investigation into Grok.

Mirroring developments across the channel, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office announced its own probe into Grok on Tuesday, over its “potential to produce harmful sexualized image and video content,” per the BBC. “The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people’s personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,” William Malcolm, the ICO’s executive director for regulatory risk and innovation, said in a statement.

The renewed regulatory pressure abroad comes after fresh reporting from the Washington Post detailed how some xAI employees were appalled by the startup’s abrupt pivot into embracing heavily sexualized content, as Musk pushed to make Grok as engaging as possible. Employees said that the company rolled back guardrails on sexual material and ignored repeated warnings that Grok could allow users to churn out sexualized images of children and celebrities that could be illegal. xAI’s safety team reportedly consisted of just two or three people for most of 2025.

Though Starship and a revenge-porn generating Grok would seemingly have little in common, Musk explained in an announcement about the acquisition that space-based AI was the “only way to scale” the technology in the long-term because of the vast amounts of solar energy that could be harvested and all the untapped real-estate that putting data centers in orbit opens up. He also stated that he wants to populate the Earth’s orbit with AI satellites to build what he likened to a “sentient sun.” These are ambitions that will be years in the making — but in the meantime, SpaceX will have to survive its now close association with CSAM-generating AI.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Along with being used to generate nonconsensual sexual images of women and girls, spread racist rhetoric, and doxx the home addresses of both celebrities and non-public figures, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok is struggling to get a grip on reality.

The mercurial billionaire’s social media platform X, which was folded into his AI startup xAI last year — and subsequently acquired by SpaceX this week — has once again been thrust into the center of the ongoing scandal surrounding the Justice Department’s release of millions of files pertaining to its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Musk has been in full damage control mode, struggling to reconcile his attempts to downplay his personal relationship with the notorious predator with some damning emails that suggest he was actively trying to invite himself to Epstein’s island in the Caribbean.

Adding to the chaos is Musk’s xAI chatbot Grok, which he’s advertised as “maximally truth-seeking” — but which is instead sowing chaos into the explosive revelations about Epstein.

The result may be one of the most amazing AI responses we’ve ever seen. No, seriously: when a X account asked Grok to calculate the “probability” that New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani is somehow related to Epstein, based on perceived similarities in the shapes of their eyebrows and mouths, the AI chatbot had a downright baffling answer.

The account showed Grok two headshots of the two men side by side, with two arrows pointing to their eyebrows and circles around their respective mouths, as if to suggest they were genetically related. The odd request may have been related to recently released documents implicating Mamdani’s mother, Mira Nair, who attended a 2009 afterparty at the house of convicted sex trafficker and Epstein’s close collaborator Ghislaine Maxwell. However, there’s currently no evidence to suggest that Nair knew about or was involved in any criminal activity.

All that flew far above the AI chatbot’s head, though, as it failed to even accurately identify Mamdani.

“Based on the image, these seem to be [late-night TV host] Jimmy Kimmel (left) and Jeffrey Epstein (right),” the chatbot responded. “They share minor similarities in eyebrow arch and mouth shape, but differences in age, hair, and features are clear.”

Yes, that’s right: the chatbot that Musk has deployed to untold millions of users on X, which now operates as a de facto fact-checking machine used to settle arguments on the chaotic site, can’t even tell the difference between Zohran Mamdani and Jimmy Kimmel, who look nothing alike.

At least it admitted its error — though only after prodding.

“Correction: That’s actually Zohran Mamdani on the left, not Jimmy Kimmel — my bad on the initial ID,” the chatbot conceded. “Similarities in eyebrows and smiles are there, but no known family ties to Epstein. Probability of relation: under one percent based on public info.”

The chatbot’s gaffe shows yet again how even a seemingly straightforward task like identifying a well-known figure, who has been photographed many thousands of times, from a well-lit headshot appears to be beyond the tech’s capabilities — despite xAI pouring billions of dollars into its development.

Coincidentally, Mamdani used his powers as New York City’s mayor to shut down a “functionally unusable” AI chatbot just last week. The chatbot was set up by disgraced former mayor Eric Adams to help small business owners navigate local regulations, costing the administration “around half a million dollars,” per Mamdani. Not unlike Grok, Adams’ chatbot was shown to be incredibly unreliable, often contradicting actual labor law.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last month, the four daring NASA astronauts who are scheduled to venture around the Moon and back as part of the agency’s historic Artemis 2 mission entered quarantine.

Their ride, a small Orion capsule mounted atop the agency’s enormous Space Launch System rocket, has already been rolled onto Launch Pad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

But the agency’s remaining checks ahead of the launch — a gauntlet of tests called the “wet dress rehearsal” that involves running through the full launch sequence without a crew on board — didn’t quite go as planned, forcing the agency to officially push back the launch date from its already ambitious early February timeline.

In an official statement this morning, NASA revealed that we may have to wait another four weeks for humanity’s return to the Moon, with the agency now eyeing a second wet dress rehearsal for “March as the earliest possible launch opportunity.”

The crew is officially released from quarantine, the agency said, as it awaits the next launch window.

It may not be the news we wanted to hear — but at least now, NASA’s Artemis 2 mission won’t have to compete with the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics for media attention.

According to a February 2 statement, NASA found that the rocket’s core stage had sprung a leak and that efforts to correct it “proved unsuccessful.”

“The leak rate at the interface of the tail service mast umbilical continued to exceed the allowable limits,” the update reads. “Liquid hydrogen filling operations on both the core stage and upper stage are paused as the team meets to determines next steps.”

As a result, the tentative February 8 launch date is no longer on the table.

Fortunately, the leak appeared to be the only major hiccup during this week’s test. NASA engineers “pushed through several challenges during the two-day test and met many of the planned objectives,” according to the agency.

However, teams had to battle the elements, as cold winter temperatures “caused a late start to tanking operations.”

Engineers got to roughly five minutes left in the countdown when the ground launch sequencer noticed a “spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate,” automatically stopping the countdown as a result.

Besides the hydrogen leak, teams also had to troubleshoot “dropouts of audio communication channels across ground teams in the past few weeks leading up to the test.”

The agency will be holding a press release later today to address the latest developments.

It’s an unfortunate development, forcing us to once again be patient to see humanity’s historic return to the Moon. The next launch dates fall in early March. If NASA misses those dates, it could be pushed back to early or late April, according to Space.com — the month NASA was originally targeting before September 2025, when the launch date was pushed up to February.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Semiconductor startup Positron has secured $230 million in Series B funding, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The semiconductor startup plans to use the capital to speed up deployment of its high-speed memory chips, a critical component for the chips used for AI workloads, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.

Investors in the round include Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the country’s sovereign wealth fund, which has been increasingly focused on building out AI infrastructure, the sources said.

The Reno-based startup’s Series B comes as hyperscalers and AI firms push to reduce their reliance on longstanding leader Nvidia. These firms include OpenAI, which, despite being one of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers, is reportedly unsatisfied with some of the firm’s latest AI chips and has been seeking alternatives since last year.

Meanwhile, Qatar, through QIA, has been accelerating a broader push into so-called “sovereign” AI infrastructure – a priority repeatedly underscored at Web Summit Qatar in Doha this week. Several sources told TechCrunch the country views compute capacity as critical to staying competitive on the global economic stage, and is positioning itself as a leading AI services hub in the Middle East, fueling interest in startups like Positron.

The strategy is already taking shape through major commitments, including a $20 billion AI infrastructure joint venture with Brookfield Asset Management that was announced in September.

Positron’s fundraise brings the three-year-old startup’s total capital raised to just over $300 million. The startup previously raised $75 million last year from investors including Valor Equity Partners, Atreides Management, DFJ Growth, Flume Ventures and Resilience Reserve.

The company claims its first-generation chip Atlas, manufactured in Arizona, can match the performance of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs for less than a third of the power. Positron is focused on inference – computing needed to run AI models for real-world applications – rather than training large language models, positioning the company as demand surges for inference hardware as businesses increasingly shift focus from building large models to deploying them at scale.

Sources tell TechCrunch that beyond its memory capabilities, Positron’s chips also perform strongly in high-frequency and video-processing workloads.

TechCrunch has reached out to Positron for more information.

            <h2>Epstein-linked longevity guru Peter Attia leaves David Protein, and his own startup ‘won’t comment’</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/epstein-linked-longevity-guru-peter-attia-leaves-david-protein-and-his-own-startup-wont-comment/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The founder of David Protein, maker of popular high-protein nutrition bars, announced on X on Monday that longevity guru Dr. Peter Attia “has stepped down from his role as Chief Science Officer at David.”

The announcement comes after Attia’s name appeared in more than 1,700 documents, including email correspondence, released on Friday as part of a massive file dump related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to The New York Times. Attia served on the executive team of the food startup and was also an early investor.

For those unfamiliar, Attia is a Canadian American physician who has become one of the most prominent voices in longevity and preventive health. He’s best known for his bestselling book “Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity” and his now seven-year-old podcast, wherein he explores optimization strategies. He was also hired just last month as a contributor to CBS.

Three-year-old, New York-based David Protein raised a $75 million Series A funding round in May of last year led by Greenoaks, with participation from Valor Equity Partners. The company has experienced significant growth since launching its flagship protein bar in September 2024, a product it describes as having 28 grams of protein, zero sugar, and 150 calories.

In a lengthy post on X, Attia wrote that he was “ashamed” of some of the crude content in his emails with Epstein, but he also said he was not involved in criminal activity and never visited Epstein’s island or traveled on his plane. Attia also discussed at length how he came to know Epstein and why he stayed involved with him even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction.

The fallout appears to extend beyond David Protein. It also appears that Biograph, the healthcare testing and longevity startup that Attia co-founded with entrepreneur John Hering, may be distancing itself from the physician. The company declined to comment on Attia’s ongoing participation with the startup or about the pages on its website that used to mention him but now omit his name or return a “file not found” error.

Biograph came out of stealth a year ago, TechCrunch previously reported, with backing from investors that include Vy Capital, Human Capital, Alpha Wave, and WndrCo, along with angel investors, including Balaji Srinivasan. Like a growing number of concierge medical service companies, Biograph offers premium preventive health services to subscribers who pay between $7,500 and $15,000 per year. Attia was previously named on the company’s press release and site as a co-founder.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-03</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/indias-varaha-bags-20m-to-scale-carbon-removal-from-the-global-south/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Varaha, an India-based climate tech startup, has raised $20 million in fresh funding as it looks to scale carbon removal projects from the Global South and position itself as a lower-cost supplier for verified emissions reductions.

The investment marks the first portion of a planned $45 million Series B round led by WestBridge Capital, the venture firm’s first investment in climate tech, with participation from existing investors including RTP Global and Omnivore. Founded in 2022, Varaha has raised about $33 million in equity to date, alongside $35 million in project financing and $500,000 in grants, as it builds carbon removal projects across Asia and Africa.

India has emerged as an increasingly important base for carbon removal projects, offering lower operating costs, deep agricultural supply chains, and a large pool of technical talent as corporate demand for verified removals rises, including from companies facing growing energy use from data centers and AI workloads. Varaha is positioning itself to capitalize on those advantages, arguing that its execution-focused model allows it to deliver carbon removal at lower cost while meeting the same international verification standards as higher-priced competitors in Europe and North America.

Varaha’s advantage lies less in proprietary technology and more in execution, said co-founder and chief executive Madhur Jain in an interview, arguing that high operating costs could become a constraint for carbon removal developers in wealthier markets as prices come under pressure.

“If carbon credit is a cost to the businesses that are buying these carbon credits … it’s a cost on their balance sheet. It’s not a CSR item,” Jain told TechCrunch. “And hence, if the cost of a certain geography is going to be so high by an order of magnitude of like, 1.5x to 3x credit production, it is going to be extremely hard for those companies to survive.”

Varaha develops carbon removal projects across four main pathways: regenerative agriculture, agroforestry, biochar, and enhanced rock weathering, working largely with smallholder farmers and industrial partners in emerging markets. The startup generates and sells verified carbon removal credits through international registries, including Puro.earth, Isometric, Verra, Gold Standard, and Switzerland-based Carbon Standards International, positioning itself as a supplier to global corporations seeking durable and independently validated emissions reductions.

To date, Varaha has removed more than 2 million tons of carbon dioxide across 14 active projects, generating around 150,000 carbon removal credits, Jain said. He added that the startup was the first in India to issue carbon credits from biochar projects and the first in Asia to issue credits from enhanced rock weathering through an international registry.

Varaha reported revenue of ₹430 million (about $4.76 million) last financial year from delivered credits and expects revenue to rise to nearly ₹1 billion (around $11.06 million) this year, while remaining profitable after tax.

The startup has signed long-term offtake agreements with global buyers including Google and Microsoft, as well as corporates such as Lufthansa, Swiss Re, and Capgemini.

Varaha currently operates across India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Ivory Coast, working with about 170,000 to 175,000 farmers over roughly 1.7 million acres, Jain said. The latest funding will be used to expand into additional markets in South and Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Indonesia, while deepening its presence in existing geographies.

The startup is also rolling out an Industrial Partners Program, which allows industrial operators with access to sustainable biomass and gasification capacity to generate verified biochar-based carbon removal credits using Varaha’s measurement, reporting, and verification systems. The program is already operational with partners in West Africa and India, including agribusinesses and a steel producer, as Varaha looks to scale carbon removal through partnerships rather than owning all assets itself.

“The problem is so big that tech, etc., will become open source over a period of time,” Jain said. “So what matters the most is the execution.”

Varaha employs about 225 to 230 people, including roughly 55 across technology, science, product and data roles, with more than 80% of its workforce based in India. While the startup does not maintain offices overseas, it has staff in markets including Nepal, Germany, the U.S., and Australia, reflecting its growing international customer base.

“We believe Varaha is uniquely positioned to build a global carbon-removal platform from India, combining integrity, scale, and impact,” said Sandeep Singhal, co-founder and managing partner, WestBridge Capital. “This investment reflects our conviction in the team and their potential to shape the next phase of climate infrastructure worldwide.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The city’s tech scene is reeling as U.S. immigration agents have escalated their crackdown in Minneapolis, killing several people, including at least two U.S. citizens.

Eight Minneapolis-based founders and investors told TechCrunch that they have put much of their work on hold and now spend their days focused on their communities, volunteering at churches, and helping buy food. It’s part of a grassroots effort, across race and class, that is seeing people speak out, donate money, protest, and offer emotional support to one another.

“There’s a lot of commonality between how a teacher is reacting right now and how a tech professional is reacting,” Scott Burns, an investor in the area, told TechCrunch. He said people are “very fatigued.” Burns is going to church more often to help pack food to deliver to those too frightened to leave their homes. “It was like what happens after a natural disaster,” he said of the effort.

Burns and other members of the Minneapolis tech industry told TechCrunch that the immigration raids have been very disruptive to their lives, describing a city that has seen itself united in the last several weeks in the face of escalating violence from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

How can building a company remain a focal point when ICE agents appear to be everywhere, plainclothed and armed with military-grade weapons? Federal agents have been seen searching public transportation and prowling around workplaces. They are outside homes and in parking lots. They have been spotted circling schools.

One Black founder, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect members of his staff, said he now carries his passport with him everywhere he goes. He is a U.S. citizen but has seen people of color throughout the city profiled and picked up by ICE and border patrol agents.

“People aren’t exaggerating how hard it has been. It’s hard to focus; it’s been a challenge just navigating even my team through it,” he said.

He recalled a routine phone meeting with a colleague who suddenly fell silent. Lost for words, the colleague said she was watching ICE detain someone in the neighborhood, the same one his mother lived in.

“I had to get off the phone and call my mom to make sure she had her passport on her,” the founder said.

Efraín Torres, a Latino founder, works from home, listening tentatively to the immigration raids that happen in his neighborhood. “You can’t not hear them,” he told TechCrunch. Cars will beep. Protestors whistle alerts. “And if you miss it, you’ll see signs saying, ‘My neighbor was taken by ICE.’”

Officials even perform “citizen checks,” stopping people and asking them to prove immigration status — which the Supreme Court said last year can be done based on details like race or if a person has an “accent.” These checks have been conducted on people performing even mundane tasks, Torres said, like snow-blowing the lawn. He said he’s had a few run-ins himself with ICE, which is why he likes to stay low.

“The line separating me from being a victim of assault is just a chance encounter,” he said, adding that he knew people who were followed by ICE — something others have reported is happening alongside raids.

The Trump administration has escalated its immigration raids throughout the country, though the force deployed in the Twin Cities is especially large, with more than 3,000 federal agents deployed to Minnesota as part of the Trump administration’s “Operation Metro Surge.” ICE and border patrol agents now outnumber local police in Minneapolis almost 3 to 1, Senator Amy Klobucharof Minnesota has said.

The state is home to one of the largest populations of immigrants from Somalia, a group the administration has targeted before. That includes U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, who has sparred with President Trump. Minnesota’s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, has also seen himself targeted by the president, as has the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, who is also a Democrat.

The surge in immigration enforcement is part of President Trump’s campaign promise to curb illegal immigration, though some argue that Trump has been specifically targeting cities and states that didn’t vote for him. More than 2,000 people have been arrested by ICE in Minnesota since Trump took office last January.

“It’s been difficult,” said one Black investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He, too, is a U.S. citizen and can trace his roots in the country back for a century. Still, living just outside the city, he carries his passport with him just in case.

“Where I go to the gym, they’re in rural Minnesota,” he said, meaning agents aren’t only in the city. “It’s just been a strange time.”

Everyone is doing what they can, however, to help others. This investor, for example, works with founders in college, many of whom are immigrants. He buys them food so they don’t have to risk going to the grocery store themselves. He also tries to work from home, when possible, as do many of the other people TechCrunch spoke with.

“It’s a tense and difficult time on the ground,” Mary Grove, another investor in the area, told TechCrunch.

Investor Reed Robinson, who has also been helping community members financially, said some of his founders with children have created a volunteer system to watch each other’s kids at school or daycare. It’s so common for ICE to detain the daycare staff, he said, adding that ICE agents frequently violate the law and court orders.

“It feels unnecessary, it feels intrusive, it feels like a violation of rights,” Robinson said about the immigration operation.

Like Robinson, many people feel anger beneath the unease and fear.

The emotional toll makes it hard to build, investors and founders said. Torres, for example, said his company now has a no-ride-sharing-app policy. Some of his engineers are on H-1B visas (which the Trump administration has also attacked) and have reported being followed by immigration officials.

“Each time, it was three to four armed men in tactical outfits,” Torres said, adding that he and his wife have spoken about fleeing the state. “They’re inflicting trauma everywhere they go.”

The Minneapolis tech scene is still quite small, with companies raising just over $1 billion in the past few years. There are some notable companies in the ecosystem, such as the fintech Sezzle (now public), the clean water company Rorra, and the medtech Reema. There is an incredible history of innovation, Robinson said. “It’s not going to stop; we’re going to continue to do the work while we figure out this current situation.”

The Twin Cities — Minneapolis and St. Paul — are the headquarters of some of the biggest American companies, such as Target, Optum, Best Buy, UnitedHealthGroup, and General Mills, to name a few. Some founders and investors criticized the leadership of these big companies, mainly for their vague responses to the chaos gripping the cities, even as many of their own employees are detained.

“We haven’t had an adequate response,” one startup investor said.

Sixty top executives from the state signed a statement that called for an “immediate de-escalation of tensions” after ICE agents killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti. Large companies in the state have also come together to fund millions in grants through the Minneapolis Foundation for businesses impacted by the immigration operation.

But compared to what is happening on a grassroots level, many founders and investors said these actions are not enough. A recent CNBC poll found that a third of the executives they polled have stayed silent because they didn’t find speaking out relevant to the business. Eighteen percent were worried about “backlash from the Trump administration,” while 9% said they were still figuring out how to respond.

“When you see the failure of community institutions to demonstrate any kind of bravery, that’s really where it’s probably most disappointing,” Tim Herby, a local investor, told TechCrunch, calling the past two months heart-wrenching.

Grove, the investor, said her team routinely checks in with others in the community, including her portfolio companies, to ensure they are doing well. She said people are helping each other pay rent, while restaurants are offering free meals. A local tech nonprofit, Minnestar, is set to host a community event to bring people together and discuss next steps.

One Black investor said he found it ironic that today, the police are alongside many people in speaking out against the government, just a few years after people in the city were protesting against them after the murder of George Floyd. It’s a new day-to-day.

Another Black founder, meanwhile, said some of his white friends have started to drive him around the city for safety. He recalls one day sitting in a restaurant chatting with friends, when the television started giving live updates of ICE shooting another person. The mood fell somber, a reminder of how these raids have consumed every moment of life.

“I saw a friend yesterday,” he said. “It was the first time he left the house since New Year’s.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Intel continues to try to turn itself around, its CEO promised that the company will start producing a new type of chip, one that has been made very popular by rival Nvidia.

At the Cisco AI Summit on Tuesday, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced that the company will start producing graphics processing units (GPUs). These are more specialized processors, compared to the CPUs Intel traditionally produces, and are used for gaming and tasks like training artificial intelligence models.

TechCrunch reached out to Intel for more information.

The project will be overseen by Kevork Kechichian, the executive vice president and general manager of Intel’s data center group, according to reporting from Reuters. Kechichian was hired in September among a slew of new engineer-focused hires.

Intel also hired Eric Demers for the effort in January. Demers was previously at Qualcomm for more than 13 years, most recently serving as a senior vice president of engineering.

This initiative seems to be in relatively early stages as Tan said the company plans to develop its strategy around customer demands and needs.

While Nvidia didn’t invent the GPU, that specific kind of chip has played a large role in its success. Its GPUs for AI systems are so advanced and popular, the chipmaker currently holds a commanding market lead.

It’s interesting to see Intel expand into this area now as Tan said the company would be consolidating and focusing on its core businesses when he took the helm as CEO last March. While GPUs are still semiconductors, of course, this is still a notable expansion.

            <div id="article-text">All startups accepted into YC will soon have the option to receive their seed checks via stablecoins, crypto YC partner Nemil Dalal told The Block.

YC’s famous “standard deal” is that it invests $500,000 into startups accepted into its program in exchange for 7% of their companies. Now that deal is hitting the blockchain (Base, Solana, and Ethereum, to be exact), starting with the upcoming spring batch.

Dalal said that stablecoin transfers are often more effective, specifically for founders working in emerging markets. But also, YC is putting its money where its mouth is, so to speak. Last fall, YC partnered with Base and Coinbase Ventures to encourage founders to build more blockchain-related companies.

Interest in blockchain tech is on the rise again in Silicon Valley as the U.S. has taken steps toward more formal, crypto-friendly regulation of the industry.

            <h2>Why This Shutdown Is Different</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/02/ice-government-shutdown-minnesota/685874/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">During the previous government shutdown, President Trump reveled in the chance to fire federal workers, expand his executive authority, and steer taxpayer dollars toward his allies and away from his perceived political enemies. After a record-setting 43 days of gridlock—during which Trump pursued those goals with varying degrees of success—several Democrats abandoned their quest to force Republicans to negotiate a health-care deal, and voted to end the shutdown. As he signed the bill, flanked by congressional Republicans, who had largely unified around the idea that they would not entertain a policy negotiation while the government was closed, Trump congratulated his party on a “very big victory” over the Democrats.

The second government shutdown of Trump’s second term ended today with much less fanfare and bravado from the commander in chief. This time, Trump negotiated both before and after the government was closed, going so far as to call Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to work out a deal on the main point of contention: his administration’s mass-deportation campaign.

Trump is largely the same person that he was four months ago, when the previous shutdown began. (If you need evidence, in recent days, he has abruptly announced plans to close and completely rebuild the Kennedy Center, suggested that he wants to “nationalize” the midterm elections, and threatened Iran with an attack from “a massive Armada.”) But his push to quickly resolve the latest shutdown highlights how much the political landscape on immigration has shifted following daily, videotaped clashes between masked federal agents and Minneapolis residents, two of whom were killed last month.

“I’m glad we got this done,” Trump said from the Oval Office as he signed the bill and hailed the various programs the legislation would fund. He didn’t address the difficulties that come next: negotiations over accountability measures for federal immigration agents and a lapse in funding for the Department of Homeland Security if a deal can’t be reached within 10 days.

Although Republicans have generally opposed considering policy concessions as a prerequisite for opening the government, Trump and his allies had little choice but to treat this shutdown differently, Doug Heye, a Republican strategist, told me. Plunging public support for Trump’s immigration crackdown has reoriented the politics of government shutdowns; the political shift is a culmination of “all the things that we’ve seen on video, everything that America has reacted to in the past few weeks, when we’ve had two American citizens who have been killed,” he said. “Now, when you talk about immigration, it is essentially being defined as what’s happening in Minneapolis, and most Republicans know that it’s bad for them.”

On January 24, Alex Pretti became the second American killed by federal agents in Minneapolis. Since then, the Trump administration has been looking for ways to contain the political fallout. Trump has dispatched the administration’s “border czar,” Tom Homan, to Minneapolis with explicit orders to calm tensions, had positive phone calls with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and expressed openness to de-escalating the aggressive tactics used by some federal agents. The president, though, has since begun to retreat from his conciliatory tone, taking to social media to attack Pretti and telling reporters that he is “not at all” pulling back from Minnesota.

But even as he began shifting away from de-escalation, Trump made clear that he was willing to  work with Democrats to avoid another government shutdown. The bill that Trump signed today funds most of the government through the end of September and continues funding for the Department of Homeland Security until February 13. Lawmakers and the White House are supposed to use the next 10 days to negotiate broader reforms to DHS’s operations that Democrats say would be necessary before they vote for additional funding for the agency that is carrying out Trump’s mass-deportation effort.

Democrats, who emerged from the previous shutdown without achieving their goal of extending subsidies for health care, say that they are now determined to extract concrete changes in how the nation’s immigration authorities operate. “Immigration and border protection are core responsibilities of our government, but this version of ICE has strayed far beyond that core function,” Representative Kristen McDonald Rivet, a Democrat from Michigan, wrote in a statement today after voting against the funding bill. She said that Congress should demand that DHS shift away from the “chaos and deadly consequences” of its current operations.

Democrats have threatened to withhold their votes on funding DHS beyond next week if their demands are not met. Although the department’s immigration push has been infused with tens of billions of dollars in funds from legislation Congress passed last year, a shutdown of operations could affect other parts of the department’s budget, including TSA and FEMA. Democrats are calling for changes that include requiring ICE agents to stop wearing masks and to obtain judicial warrants in immigration operations. They also want independent investigations of the killings of Pretti and Renee Good. Some are calling for the resignation of DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who has drawn bipartisan criticism for accusing Pretti and Good of “domestic terrorism” hours after each was killed.

Democrats’ push may already be making an impact. Noem said yesterday that ICE agents working in Minneapolis will begin wearing body cameras immediately and that agents across the country will be doing the same once funding becomes available. But Democrats are likely to face more resistance to their other demands. Asked about judicial warrants today, Trump was noncommittal. “I haven’t even thought about it,” he told reporters. “I’m not thinking about search warrants.”

He deferred to Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who said that he opposed the call for judicial warrants. Graham pivoted to calling for a ban on sanctuary cities, something Trump said he will be pushing for as negotiations take place in the coming days. Other Republicans have rejected several Democratic requests as unrealistic or unworkable. Senate Majority Leader John Thune predicted that lawmakers would need to pass another extension of DHS funding before February 13, calling the prospect of making significant reforms by next week an “impossibility.”

But, buoyed by the newfound leverage they have to draw Trump to the negotiating table, many Democrats are looking to exert maximum pressure in the coming days. There is disagreement between the Senate and the House, as well as between more moderate and more progressive Democrats, about how hard of a line to draw in the upcoming discussions. House Democrats largely opted not to support the funding agreement negotiated by their Senate counterparts, with some saying that funding DHS at current levels even for a few days would be inappropriate. But Democrats—who have at times opposed government shutdowns due to the potential harm to federal workers and those who rely on the social safety net—are navigating new terrain as they try to rein in Trump.

Recent changes narrowing the kinds of tasks agencies can perform when funding lapses also mean that shutdowns have the potential to hit a larger number of Americans more harshly than before, Abigail André, the executive director of the Impact Project, told me. “The changes some agencies made to shutdown protocols made shutdowns more painful for communities and, therefore, more politically costly,” she said.

Trump has acknowledged that shutdowns can be a political liability. When Democrats claimed big victories in Virginia, New Jersey, Georgia, and elsewhere last year on an Election Day that fell during a shutdown, Trump told his fellow Republicans that the government’s closure had played “a big role” in the results. When Trump called Schumer last month to negotiate, the president said: “I hate shutdowns,” the minority leader told The New York Times. Schumer suggested that they cut a deal to rein in ICE. Trump was also hearing from members of his own party, who were reaching out privately to express their dismay over the scenes emerging from Minnesota. Several have spoken out publicly as well, laying the groundwork for negotiations.

When I asked the White House about Trump’s willingness to negotiate this time rather than dig in his heels as government funding lapsed, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson did not acknowledge the shift, instead blaming Democrats. “President Trump has been consistent—he wants the government open,” she told me. “Democrats should not try to use the American people as leverage to achieve their policy goals.”

But many Democrats say that they are simply following the lead of their constituents, who have shifted sharply against Trump’s immigration policies in recent weeks as masked federal agents have descended on American cities. A Fox News poll released last week found that 59 percent of voters say that ICE has been “too aggressive” in its deportation tactics, a 10-point jump since July.

Andrew O’Neill, the national advocacy director for Indivisible, a progressive organizing group, said in a statement that Republicans are now “on their back foot,” and warned Democrats that voting for any legislation that does not overhaul DHS would constitute a “failure to meet this moment.” Alluding to the street protests that have frustrated ICE’s efforts in Minneapolis and elsewhere, he said: “The public has done its part, and now Congress must do theirs.”

Heye, the Republican strategist, told me that although Trump has an ability to control the news cycle around him, the immigration debate is dominating in an election year that Republicans had promised they would use to address voters’ concerns about the cost of living. Avoiding a prolonged shutdown over unpopular immigration tactics is part of a broader effort to refocus as the midterms approach, he said: “The fact that Americans have been killed means that this will have a longer political memory,” he said. “Republicans should be talking about, Here’s what we’re trying to do to fix costs, and all of this gets in their way.”

            <h2>Trump’s New Threats to American Elections</h2>

With nine months to go until the midterm elections, President Trump’s campaign to subvert them is escalating. His administration has recently taken a series of steps that have election officials, observers, and administrators deeply and rightfully concerned about the prospects for improper interference with the election process.

In October, I published an in-depth article on how the president could interfere (and already was interfering) with the midterm elections. Since then, the reasons for worry have become more urgent. In the past two weeks, the FBI conducted a search in a major Democratic county in a swing state, in service of debunked theories about fraud in the 2020 election; the Justice Department attempted to extort voter rolls from another Democratic state under threat of armed occupation; and the president floated plans to “nationalize” elections. Trump has tried to subvert an election before, but these efforts are earlier, more organized, and—crucially—employing the power of the federal government to help him achieve his personal political goals.

Yesterday, Trump spoke with Dan Bongino, the podcaster turned FBI deputy director turned podcaster, and called for his party to seize control of voting in states. “These people were brought to our country to vote, and they vote illegally,” Trump said, reprising an oft-used and incorrect claim. (Voting by noncitizens is rare and does not amount to enough to swing elections.) “The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over’—we should take over the voting in at least, many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that are so crooked, and they’re counting votes. We have states that I won that show I didn’t win.”

The federal government has no constitutional or statutory role in states’ election administration, so the call for “nationalization” is an assertion of power that the federal government does not have, a hallmark of other recent White House ploys. Trump’s declaration that “Republicans” could do it may be a suggestion that Congress take action, but it also points to the partisan aims of his attack.

Trump’s efforts to prove that he won in 2020 are all premised on false claims, yet he continues to try to drum up evidence for a conclusion he’s already reached. “You’re gonna see something in Georgia,” he told Bongino, referring to a search this past Wednesday at the Fulton County election center, in Atlanta, where agents looked for records including ballots, tabulator tapes, and voter rolls from the 2020 election. Immediately after that election, Trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that he won Georgia, and when his legal efforts to challenge the result fell short, he called the Republican secretary of state and asked him to “find” almost 12,000 votes. (Trump and some associates were charged with racketeering in Fulton County as a result, but the case was dismissed last year.) The search is a stunning intrusion into local election administration. “It’s a five-alarm fire,” as one Arizona Republican election official told my colleagues Sarah Fitzpatrick and Yvonne Wingett Sanchez.

Since the search, more troubling information has emerged. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who has no obvious role in the FBI or domestic-election oversight but has been a proponent of bogus fraud claims about the 2020 election, was present for the operation, which she said in a letter to Congress was at Trump’s behest. The New York Times reports that Gabbard met with some of the FBI officers the following day and put Trump on speakerphone for a chat with them—a serious departure from normal practice, and a move that emphasizes the appearance of inappropriate pressure: a federal law-enforcement agency acting as a political agent of the president in a nakedly partisan operation. (Bongino’s own return to partisan podcasting, just weeks after leaving his post as No. 2 at the FBI, demonstrates how politics has infected the bureau.)

As Trump continues to clash with local officials in Minnesota, he also claims that he was cheated out of votes there. “I feel that I won Minnesota—I think I won it all three times,” he said. “I won it all three times, in my opinion.” On January 24, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Governor Tim Walz demanding that the state turn over its voter rolls to the Justice Department as a condition of the federal government ending its violent crackdown in Minneapolis. Since May 2025, the DOJ has ordered 44 states and the District of Columbia to hand over voter rolls, though it has no statutory right to them. Many states, including Minnesota, have resisted.

Bob Bauer, a veteran Democratic election lawyer, argues that although Bondi’s letter appears to yoke together two unrelated questions—election integrity and immigration enforcement—the Trump administration may not see them as separate, but rather as an opening to interfering with elections using federal agents. “The administration’s lawyers might view the potential deployment of ICE as an option allowing for the fielding of what one advocate describes as ‘essentially an army’ charged with ensuring election security through immigration law enforcement,” he wrote this week.

As bleak as these developments are, a few hopeful signs for the midterms have emerged. First, Trump has been publicly setting expectations for poor results for Republicans, a sign that he may be resigning himself somewhat to a loss. Second, the president’s attempt to force gerrymanders in GOP-controlled states, in order to help preserve the House majority, seems to be ending up as basically a wash, after Democrat-controlled states responded in kind. Third, an election is at greatest danger of interference when the margin of victory is narrow, and Americans’ growing disapproval of the president’s handling of immigration and the economy has buoyed Democrats on the generic ballot for Congress. An old joke goes that the election administrator’s prayer is, “Lord, let this election not be close.” Even as Trump tries to tamper with elections, his actions in office make it more likely that the prayer is answered.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

The Problem With Using AI in Your Personal Life

More and more, large language models are relieving people of the burden of reading and writing, in school and at work but also in group chats and email exchanges with friends. In many areas, guidelines are emerging: Schools are making policies on AI use by students, and courts are trying to settle the law about AI and intellectual property. In friendship and other interpersonal uses, however, AI is still the Wild West. We have tacit rules about which movies you wait to see with your roommate and who gets invited to the lake house, but we have yet to settle anything comparable regarding, for example, whether you should use ChatGPT to reply to somebody’s Christmas letter. That seems like an oversight.

Take a look. It’s so cold in Florida that iguanas are falling out of trees. Alan Taylor compiled photos of trappers gathering the cold-stunned invasive reptiles by the thousands.

Read. “My extraordinary great-great-grandfather obtained his liberty at some point before the Civil War,” Eugene Robinson writes. But how did Henry Fordham become a free man?

            <h2>Which Washington Landmark Will Donald Trump Destroy Next?</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Alas, the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts! We barely knew ye!

The president announced on Truth Social that the recently renamed center will close on July 4 for two full years of renovations. No better way to celebrate 250 years as a nation than by shutting down our center for the performing arts! Most high schools, given the opportunity to shut down their performing-arts departments, don’t view it as an exciting, patriotic celebration, and prefer to have a bake sale. But I am told that this is just how the Founders hoped we would celebrate. (If you remember that John Adams note about how to commemorate the Fourth of July, right after “fireworks,” he suggested “or making it difficult, if not impossible, for people to see Opera, Ballet, Symphonic Performances, Touring Productions of Broadway Musicals, and Sometimes Shen Yun.”)

Everywhere you look in Washington, D.C., buildings are getting their names rejiggered (the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace), their wings clipped (RIP East Wing of the White House), or both. And of course, we must not forget the Triumphal Arch—a possibly 250-foot-tall edifice (One foot for each year! We’d better hope the country doesn’t go on much longer!) that, when complete, will reportedly dwarf the Lincoln Memorial.

Is any building safe? I fear it’s only a matter of time before the inevitable Donald J. Trump AND is slapped on every marquee—but what happens after that? Here are my best guesses.

Donald J. Trump and Washington National Cathedral: Why should George Washington be the only one to have his name on a house of prayer? Trump’s team will also improve all of the windows, which currently are full of lots of little tiny bits of “stained” glass (was new, pristine glass not available?) that make it difficult to see in or out.

Also, instead of a large, depressing wooden carving of some Middle Eastern man in a loincloth being justly punished by the state, we will have something uplifting, like a big golden letter T, maybe a big R, possibly a U, and then a nice MP to round the whole thing off. (This move might result in audiences deserting the building, but then we can demolish it and put in a golf course.)

Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace: The roof of this building will be repainted as a world map, with all of the territories Trump is eyeing for the United States marked for viewers’ convenience. It will be used to house the members of the Nobel Peace Prize committee, who will have been kidnapped by an elite squadron of Trump Peacekeeping Forces and threatened with repeat screenings of Melania until they produce a Nobel Prize for Mr. Trump.

Donald J. Trump Federal Bureau of Investigations: This building will be torn down on the grounds that it is an eyesore from the 1960s, an era when it was believed that a single Watergate-level scandal would be enough to end a presidency, and replaced with either the actual Parthenon from Athens (the ultimate in classical architecture) or the fake Parthenon from Tennessee (Kash Patel and his girlfriend can bring it back on their government jet so that they will be able to mark their latest Nashville excursion as “business travel.”)

The Donald J. Trump and Washington Monument: At first, I thought Trump would simply slap his name on this noteworthy obelisk, but I actually think he will do another Triumphal Arch move and build a much bigger one, all in brass, right next to it. But not too close. Any deaths of birds that fly into it will be offset by the fact that Trump is saving their relatives from windmills.

The Donald J. Trump United States Treasury: Simply putting Donald Trump’s name on the whole Treasury will save everyone the trouble of stashing money in special accounts in Qatar; they should have thought of it earlier.

The Donald J. Trump and Jefferson Memorial: The quotations about how “indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just: that his justice cannot sleep forever” will be allowed to remain, but a little animatronic statue of Stephen Miller will be installed next to them, shaking his head to show he doesn’t agree.

The Donald J. Trump Pentagon: Donald Trump wants this to be a hexagon for reasons he won’t articulate, and Pete Hegseth lives to oblige!

The Donald J. Trump and Vietnam Veterans Memorial: What is this big, depressing V made from dark stone covered in little tiny names? Suckers and losers, no doubt. Make it a big T instead, all white marble, with the names of donors in gold letters.

The Donald J. Trump Supreme Court: Instead of blind justice standing on the steps (we can do better than some kind of visually impaired woman who is probably dispensing justice to any and all comers without fear or favor), this building will now feature one of those guys covered in gold paint who pretends to be a statue, so he can see who is trying to get justice and let the majority know Trump’s feelings about him so they can vote accordingly.

The Korean War Veterans Memorial: Trump will leave this one alone because he forgot it was there.

The Donald J. Trump and Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial: Demolished, obviously.

The Donald J. Trump National Archives: These will first be closed to the public and then scanned carefully for any maps leading to treasure; they will be reopened free to the public only if they contain nothing of value.

The Donald J. Trump U.S. Capitol: This will also be closed for the next two years for “renovations,” except to peaceful and patriotic tour groups. See if Mike Johnson dares to object!

The Donald J. Trump and Smithsonian Institution: After all of the exhibitions have been clawed through to remove all evidence of a very objectionable, political thing called “history,” these buildings will be left temporarily intact until reduced crowds drive a move for renovations. Then Trump will announce that they are being closed on July 4 as a special patriotic tribute (“Those who don’t learn history will … make America great again!”), to be reopened after two years as an imperial palace. Just as the Founders would have wished!

The Donald J. Trump and Lincoln Memorial: Trump will add a large gold statue of himself standing with his hand on Abraham Lincoln’s shoulder to imply that Lincoln is sitting in Trump’s chair and Trump is being patient about it, but his patience might run out soon. Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address will remain visible, but just barely, because the text of Trump’s Second Inaugural Address will be superimposed on it in a very small font to make room for all of the text, completely obscuring any reference to the better angels of our nature.</div>

Every year since 2003, the umbrella organization for quizzing outfits around the globe has put on the granddaddy of knowledge competitions. Nothing in the tiny, nerdy world of trivia confers more authority than winning the World Quizzing Championships.

Competitors must attempt to answer 240 questions, such as the following, from 2022: “Playing for Bangalore against Pune in the IPL in April 2013, who set a new record for the fastest century in professional cricket by reaching 100 off 30 balls?”

If it makes you feel better, the median number of correct answers the year of that test was 64. Then again, the following was a question in that championship too: “What is the seven-letter name of the signature burger that can be ordered in every Burger King?”

The next contest is this summer, but in the meantime, you have a few whoppers waiting for you in this week’s Atlantic Trivia. Consider them training.

And by the way, did you know that the world’s oldest continuous art tradition is the rock painting of Australia’s Aboriginal people? The earliest artworks discovered on the island are estimated to be 30,000 years or older, and many Aboriginal artists still paint on rock walls.

In fact, it wasn’t until the 1970s that Aboriginal art began to be captured on anything more portable than stone or more durable than sand. The art on canvas is beautiful—but it will take quite the preservationist to keep it looking good in 42,206 C.E.

And by the way, did you know that since going up in the late 1880s, the Eiffel Tower has been painted more than half a dozen different colors? The structure was “Venetian red” at its construction and over the years has been brown, “yellow-brown,” “brownish-red,” and “reddish brown,” according to the monument’s official website.

All right, so not that different on the colors. However, each hue is really three shades apiece; the bottom third of the tower is painted darker than the middle third, and the middle darker than the top so that the paint job looks uniform against the gradient of the blue(ish) sky.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Republicans have had a tough stretch. They were defeated in elections in the fall and find themselves at risk of losing control of one or maybe both chambers of Congress later this year. Their standard-bearer, President Trump, has tumbled in the polls and finds himself underwater on his two signature issues, the economy and immigration. There has been unrest in a major American city, and blood shed by Trump’s federal agents. Republicans’ whispers have grown louder in recent weeks: Trump is distracted; he’s focused on the wrong things; the chaos is hurting us. And then a thunderclap from deep-red Texas: a state-Senate race in a district that Trump won by 17 points just over a year ago flipped by more than 30 points over the weekend and elected a Democrat for the first time since 1978.

Now, that is a bad sign for a party in a midterm year. Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick deemed it “a wake-up call,” and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a possible presidential hopeful, acknowledged that “a swing of this magnitude is not something that can be dismissed.” And then, hours later, Trump took to social media with an urgent call to action.

“I have determined,” the president wrote, “that the fastest way to bring The Trump Kennedy Center to the highest level of Success, Beauty, and Grandeur” is to close it for about two years before a “Grand Reopening that will rival and surpass anything that has taken place with respect to such a Facility before.”

Trump has never been much for resets. But right now, despite the political peril his party faces, instead of recalibrating he is doubling down. Consider a few of the stories that have dominated the headlines and cable chyrons over the past month: Anger about the scenes of unrest and violence amid ICE deportation operations in Minnesota? Well, the Trump administration has telegraphed that it would like to carry out a crackdown on Haitians in Ohio next. Concern about brandishing military force after the U.S. removed the leader of Venezuela and then threatened Greenland? Trump has sent an “armada” of warships to the Persian Gulf to intimidate Iran. A sense that the president has lost focus on what got him elected as he takes on vanity projects such as the White House ballroom? Well, he’ll see you that and raise you both the Kennedy Center renovation and the construction of a giant arch that no one seems to want.

Trump has always trusted his gut, and his unorthodox political instincts led to one of the most unlikely victories in American politics in 2016 and then, eight years later, its most improbable comeback. He and his White House continue to preach confidence. But will he be proved wrong this time?

For many Republicans, what happened in Fort Worth and its suburbs was the loudest alarm yet. Republican Leigh Wambsganss lost to Democrat Taylor Rehmet despite significantly outspending him. Early analysis has suggested that Republicans have lost some of the gains they had made with Latino voters. Wins like this one are fueling Democratic dreams of stealing congressional seats held by Republicans in states such as Iowa, North Carolina, Maine, and, yes, Texas.

Trump tried to distance himself from the Lone Star State result, telling reporters on Sunday, “I’m not involved with that” (he’d endorsed Wambsganss on Truth Social and urged his supporters to vote for her) and “I’m not on the ballot” (maybe not by name, but MAGA infuses all elections these days). Never before has a president so thoroughly dominated the political landscape and national discourse. That is to Trump’s delight, but it potentially works less well for Republicans who are left to defend a series of unpopular decisions and policies, most notably one that was formerly a strength: the president’s immigration agenda.

Many voters liked his plan to fortify the southern border and deport violent criminals who were in the U.S. illegally. But, pushed by the powerful White House aide Stephen Miller to meet huge daily arrest quotas, the administration’s efforts expanded greatly. ICE’s budget was supercharged and officers began to target migrants who, in many cases, had lived in the country peacefully for years, sometimes even decades, and were valued employees, neighbors, and friends. Polls showed that Americans were souring on the effort even before ICE surged 3,000 officers into Minneapolis. What followed: a series of confrontations that left two Americans—Renee Good and Alex Pretti, both 37 years old—dead at the hands of federal agents. The killings, particularly Pretti’s, seemed to play on loop on television and social media for a nation that was largely stuck indoors during a frigid, stormy January.

An uproar followed, and even some Republicans (quietly) let it be known that changes were needed. Trump appeared as though he might back down. He held cordial calls with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (both under investigation by his Department of Justice), banished the incendiary Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino, and dispatched Tom Homan, his border czar, to the region in the unlikely role of agent of de-escalation. But within days, Trump began climbing down from his climb-down. He once again blasted the Democratic leaders on social media, suggested that he may add more officers, and blamed the state for fostering the atmosphere of violence. And then yesterday, while on a loyalist’s podcast, Trump declared, “Minnesota is a mess. There’s something in the water up there. I won the state three times but I got no credit for it … It’s a rigged state.” (He lost all three elections there.)

Many in the West Wing believe January 3 was a turning point for Trump’s second term, a moment when a presidency that limped to the finish of 2025 was given a jolt of life. That was the day U.S. forces seized the Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a Caracas raid carried out with Hollywood-esque precision. Although questions remain about the operation’s aftermath—including the fate of Venezuela’s oil, the role of the United States in running the country, and whether it improved the lives of any Americans—the overwhelming military success astounded Trump. Even now, a month later, he brings it up unprompted to friends and lawmakers, and even during his call with Walz two weeks ago, much to the governor’s confusion.

Trump seems to have a taste for more. He backed down, at least for now, from his threats to invade Greenland after receiving strong pushback from NATO allies and some Republican leaders (including private calls from Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee, a person familiar with the conversations told me). But he has become fixated on Iran. Though diplomatic talks are scheduled this week, Trump has not ruled out a military operation against Tehran—and he has grown enamored with the idea of toppling the Iranian regime, thereby achieving something his predecessors could not, an aide and an outside adviser told me. Like others I spoke with, they did so on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the president’s thinking.

Few Trump supporters, however, cast their ballots for international adventurism and gunboat diplomacy. A number of Republicans and MAGA influencers have urged the president to shift his focus back home and on the elections ahead of their party, not the ones behind them. But the president has only ramped up that rhetoric, celebrating the FBI raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, elections office and calling for Republicans to “nationalize the voting.”

In an attempt to keep the president on track, aides have rolled out events on mortgages and housing prices. A senior administration official told me that a prescription-drug announcement is slated for Thursday. White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles has urged the president to focus on the economy and last month promised that Trump, who rarely traveled to rally with his supporters last year, would make one trip a week to campaign for Republicans; Trump dutifully held events in Michigan and Iowa. And he didn’t mock the concept of an affordability crisis every time he talked about it.

The White House spokesperson Kush Desai defended the president’s approach, telling me in a statement that he “can walk and chew gum at the same time, and that’s especially true of policy priorities such as immigration and crime that also yield meaningful economic benefits.”

But Trump’s goals remain loftier, and centered on making a permanent imprint on the nation’s capital. His original idea for a White House ballroom abruptly escalated to the complete demolition of the East Wing. His construction spree now seems set to include a triumphal arch, as a gateway to Washington from Arlington National Cemetery. The president suggested that it should be 250 feet tall, which would dwarf the nearby Lincoln Memorial and dramatically alter the city’s low-rise skyline.

Then there’s the Kennedy Center. The performing-arts center, on the banks of the Potomac River, is a grand American stage and home to the National Symphony Orchestra. It’s also the official memorial to a slain president, named by an act of Congress in 1964 to honor John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated in Dallas just a few months earlier. It was meant to carry the spirit of a young president who, along with his wife, valued the arts and believed they could inspire a nation.

Yet Trump was jealous. He has long wanted to be embraced by the nation’s cultural elite and biggest stars and has been incensed when he was belittled (or ignored) by them, even after achieving the highest office in the land. He took control of the center’s board last year and then, to the outrage of many, added his own name to the memorial. That caused a number of the acts still on the center’s schedule to withdraw, leaving it with little programming (or maybe no programming at all). Trump abruptly announced on Sunday evening that the Kennedy Center would, as of July, close for approximately two years for renovations, even though it had just gone through a $250 million expansion in 2019. Some fear that the revered building will meet the same fate as the East Wing; Trump told reporters yesterday that the center would not be razed, but then again, that’s what he originally said about the future ballroom site.

Before the closure was announced, the center hosted the premiere of the $40 million documentary Melania, about the first lady. Trump donned a black tie for the event. This week, he also has meetings slated with the leaders of Colombia and Honduras. Not on his schedule? A trip out into the nation he leads.</div>

At about two this morning, the familiar howl of air-raid sirens woke me in the center of Kyiv, followed by the low thuds of anti-aircraft cannons attempting to shoot down Russian drones. The news alerts followed, citing the city’s mayor: Russian strikes had left more than 1,000 apartment buildings without power and heat as temperatures fell below zero degrees Fahrenheit.

Vladimir Putin was not going to miss his chance to use winter as a weapon. In recent weeks, Russian missile strikes have hammered the power grid and neighborhood heating systems, leaving both on the verge of collapse. Last week, President Trump appealed to Putin to pause these attacks for a week, long enough for the cold snap to pass and peace talks to move forward. Putin initially appeared to acquiesce—then launched one of the worst attacks on Ukraine’s energy network since the start of the war.

No one I met in Kyiv over the past few days expected anything different. As the Russian invasion of Ukraine approaches the four-year mark this month, Putin’s strategy has shifted to one that stands in blatant violation of the international laws of war, which prohibit the bombing of civilian infrastructure. Ukrainians aptly call it “energy terror,” and its goal is to freeze them into a state of hopelessness and soften them up for capitulation.

That goal, like most of his aims in this war, has remained out of Putin’s reach. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky continues to push for peace on terms that his people can accept, including firm guarantees from the United States and its allies that they would act decisively to stop any future Russian attack. Over the weekend, as Ukraine’s negotiators met with Zelensky to plan for U.S.-mediated talks with the Russians this week in Abu Dhabi, hundreds of people gathered for a daytime rave on the frozen surface of the Kyiv reservoir, dancing, skating, and racing their cars.

The images from this defiant party masked a deepening exhaustion in the capital. “People are really on the edge,” Yana Markova, the principal of a primary school in Kyiv, told me when I visited her yesterday. The city’s schools have largely stopped holding classes this winter, and Markova has turned her building into a temporary shelter, its cafeteria serving thousands of meals to people whose apartments have no gas, water, power, or heat. “People have different reactions to all this,” she said over a cup of chicken soup. “Some point their anger at the Russians for doing this. Some blame our authorities for failing to protect us.”

On January 9, after the first massive attack of the year on Kyiv’s energy system, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, urged residents to leave their homes in search of “alternative sources of power and heat.” Temperatures dropped far below freezing that night, and the impact of the bombing “was the most devastating for the capital’s critical infrastructure,” he said in a statement on social media. In many neighborhoods, people sought shelter in subway stations, shivering as they tried to catch a few hours of sleep on yoga mats and camping chairs.

But the metro system does not extend to all parts of the city. The working-class district of Desnianskyi, home to more than a quarter of a million people, consists mostly of high-rise apartment blocks. The blackouts shut down elevators in those buildings, trapping some elderly residents in their freezing homes.

Yesterday evening, about eight hours before the latest wave of strikes on Kyiv, I went to see the head of the district, Maksym Bakhmatov, on the third floor of its administrative building. The ground floor houses the equivalent of a DMV, where people sat around in bulky coats and woolen scarves, some waiting to register their complaints about the lack of basic services. One man used the room’s relative warmth to take a nap.

Bakhmatov sat in his office in three layers of clothes, bracing for the next barrage of Russian strikes. A former television producer, he made his name as a performer on the same comedy circuit as Zelensky, who appointed Bakhmatov to run the Desnianskyi district in May. The official had little hope for the peace talks Trump initiated last year, because the Kremlin has shown no willingness to respect any calls for a cease-fire. “Putin will not stop,” Bakhmatov told me. “His rockets will not run out this year or next year.”

Though his anger was mostly reserved for the Russians, he also had harsh words for the local government, a sign of the political divisions that have deepened as living conditions in Kyiv become more difficult. “The city has sent us zero generators, zero food,” he said. Federal authorities have stepped in to provide emergency assistance, setting up heated tents and food pantries for people in his district.

Read: Ukraine latest attacks showcase its desperation.

After every bomb that hits the nearby power plant, Bakhmatov follows a frantic routine. He gets a call in the middle of the night, warning him of the impending blackouts. The water in every apartment tower in his district—roughly 800 of them—then needs to be drained from the central heating system before it freezes. Failing to do that within two hours could rupture the pipes inside the walls. It might then take years, he says, for the repairs needed to make the buildings livable again. “They have the same heating system in Russia,” Bakhmatov said. “It was all built in the Soviet Union. Putin knows all its weak spots. He knows exactly where to strike.”

The unfolding catastrophe has long been clear to the people who run Ukraine’s energy sector. In the middle of November, one of its top executives, Maxim Timchenko, traveled to Washington, D.C., to brief U.S. officials and members of Congress. “It’s an absolute disaster,” he told me during that visit. “It’s definitely going to be the worst winter of the war, and there is no solution other than an energy cease-fire. That’s the main message I’m bringing here to all levels.”

As the head of DTEK, the largest private energy company in Ukraine, Timchenko could see that the Russians had carefully selected their targets to maximize the damage not only to Ukraine’s power grid but to its sense of unity. Throughout the fall, their missile strikes destroyed the substations that move electricity from the nuclear-power plants in the western part of Ukraine to the east, where most of the population and heavy industry are concentrated. “They wanted to divide us down the middle,” Timchenko explained. “And in the electricity space, they succeeded.”

Without high-voltage lines to move power across the country, many parts of western Ukraine saw a surplus of electricity this fall and early winter, while the eastern half of the country experienced blackouts lasting as long as 18 hours a day.

As the strikes continued in January and temperatures fell, Zelensky intensified his calls for a partial cease-fire, under which both sides would agree not to target the other’s energy infrastructure. Trump put his weight behind the proposal last week. “I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that,” he said on January 29. The Ukrainians, Trump added, almost “didn’t believe it, but they were very happy about it.”

The pause in Russian attacks on Kyiv held over the weekend, while other parts of Ukraine suffered more acts of barbarism. On Sunday afternoon, Russian drones attacked a civilian bus owned by DTEK and carrying miners, killing at least 12 people as they rode home from their shift in the Dnipropetrovsk region, in eastern Ukraine. Still, the weekend saw no Russian missile strikes against Kyiv’s power plants, and Zelensky expressed hope that the respite would lay the groundwork for the next round of talks.

They are due to start tomorrow in Abu Dhabi, and Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff, as well as his son-in-law Jared Kushner, will be there to mediate. On Saturday, both men met in Florida with the Kremlin’s envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, to discuss the terms of a possible deal. “We are encouraged by this meeting that Russia is working toward securing peace in Ukraine,” Witkoff wrote afterward on social media. The Russians, he added, are grateful for Trump’s “critical leadership in seeking a durable and lasting peace.”

But that gratitude did not count for much against Putin’s desire to extend the suffering of Ukrainians. He sees the coldest days of winter as instruments of war, and he will use them no matter what mercies Trump may request. As the sun set over Kyiv today, the air-raid sirens started to wail again across the city center. People got dressed and headed to the shelters, determined to wait out the cold for one more night.</div>

I cancelled my chatgpt subscription earlier this month. Their product is frankly quite bad. My work bought me a claude pro max whatever subsription and... I don&#39;t need/want OpenAI&#39;s products any more? Whatever lead they had, they&#39;ve completely lost.

They could have built at least a litte moat, I belive, if they&#39;d invested in making good software that works with chatgpt. Integrating chatgpt into your workflow isn&#39;t hard if you&#39;re a coder but very few people who use it are, and coders are the first to learn about the alternative ai&#39;s and start using them - and the mountains of shitty, scammy, insecure, subscription based chatgpt wrappers vibecoded in the last year by random weirdos trying to get rich without doing any work don&#39;t help built user&#39;s confide

I know that I rather go anywhere else than WM, because stuff like underwear, headlight bulbs, even batteries are locked up, and good luck getting a store person to even bother walking over to help with that.  Even when they do, it means the end of your shopping visit, as you have to follow them to the register.  Mail order?  Amazon.

I can see them getting a captive audience if they are the only grocery store in a town, but in cities with an ALDI, HEB (a Texas chain that doesn&#39;t suck), or other stores, people tend to go there.

I miss the days when they had some reason to stick around, be it a McDonald&#39;s their own store, or even a Subway.  Now, without the secondary stores, it just sucks, and even Targets have a Pizza Hut and a mini Starbucks that I can get a drink at.

Wish things would change so that we had real department stores again.  IMO, WM shopping is pure drudgery now.

A switch on the wall that you can use to turn lights on and off. We live in truly magical times.

All jokes aside, this is more useful as &quot;a button next to my bed that shuts off all the inside and outside lights, closes all the doors, activates the alarm, turns down the heat, makes sure the tv is off, and disables notifications until the morning.&quot;

I&#39;ve also seen one used as &quot;a button to hit on your way to work to shut off all the things you forgot to shut off.&quot;

A panic button next to your bed could be &quot;turn on all the outside lights, save all the security camera footage somewhere extra, and tell me if any

This. The person who focuses on the lights in the room is completely missing the point and should not invest in or even talk about smart home. The smart home is a replacement for any project that would require you to run more than 3 wires to a fitting.

I&#39;ve never used google home, so I&#39;m totally in the dark here--but if they haven&#39;t previously implemented a feature as simple as a button or switch, how can it do anything else at all? It&#39;s the most basic of input methods.At any rate, occupancy sensors / motion sensors basically operate on the same premise as a physical switch in any home automation system I&#39;ve ever used. Without that capability can it even be called a smart home system?

Indeed. Labor to install switches in new locations can be very expensive, especially if you need long runs and also have to open, patch, repaint and texture drywall. It can easily add up to 30x the cost of a wireless battery operated smart button, usually referred to a scene controller.

However, it should still work without the cloud needing to be up. I had a 24 hour Comcast outage recently. No reason my smart lights and switches should stop working during the outage. And they did not, since I use Home assis

Great! So there&#39;s a non-zero chance Portuguese speakers get &#39;Continued Conversation&#39; before 2030?Just kidding... Everyone knows Google Brazil is just a law firm with a cafeteria. :/

> meaning one button can do multiple things.

At last, we know how the console buttons of Padme&#39;s ship work.

Google then announced that they&#39;d be shuttering all Google Home products and services on July 1st, 2026 because an in-house review found that Google Home was popular and useful.

.. Google Home has been nerfed in so many ways over the past few years, it&#39;s almost useless now save for turning my lights on and off.

- They killed the Apps SDK, and all games and custom stuff- They killed Google Music, and &#39;play X from my Library&quot;, only Youtube Premium Music now or ads in between every damn track- They killed all podcast feeds other than Youtube Music (many podcasts aren&#39;t on Youtube).- They have borked most radio stations (used to be able to play almost any station via TuneIn)

The video doorbells (which are part of Google Home) have been using the same software for a decade now. They are clearly not investing in upgrades to the usability of the app and web interface. It often takes a minute or two to get a live video feed when somebody rings the doorbell, and that&#39;s despite having Wifi 6 and 5G fiber. And half the time, instead of the video feed, you get a nag message trying to offer some upgrade or other service, and then it won&#39;t show you the actual notification that triggered

Seriously, when you consider this type of product, you LOOK at it. And a home automation solution that does not support buttons? That is just a bad joke to stay away from.

&quot;Google refused to explain why all supported buttons were required to contain microphones.&quot;

To all agree that children should not go hungry. The last fucking thing we should be worrying about is ultra processed foods. Fuck anyone on the left who is worried about this for anyone but themselves.We have hundreds of thousands of children who are going to go hungry tonight because child hunger is a political issue and a sizable number of voters like to tell themselves that food insecurity breeds character.And you know who you are and I bet you have mod points. Go ahead I&#39;ve got karma to burn.But getting back to the left wing we have this really nasty habit of getting our asses kicked by the right wing on stuff that matters and then they let us go off and do whatever the fuck on shit that doesn&#39;t matter and then we look like idiots and morons because of it.So you get people complaining about kids eating chicky nuggies instead of kids having sleep for dinner.I think you often have something useful to say, but your rage causes a kind of stream-of-anger output which detracts from comprehensibility.Serious suggestion: Don&#39;t think of karma as currency.

To add to your point, it&#39;s worth remembering that ultra processed foods are still inherently foods underneath. So why is it that a bag of chicken nuggets is cheaper than buying a whole chicken of the same weight. The answer is in the economic system setup to incentivize this production of UPF. If you can direct that at incentivizing healthy food instead the poor people may actually be healthier than the wealthy.

I can see you are extremely emotional about this issue.

I doubt the opposition to feeding children is based on some &quot;out group&quot; bias, but more in the practicalities. The argument is two fold; quality and cost.  Free food for children will prompt more parents to simply rely on the government to feed their children, resulting in worse health outcomes for the children.  That&#39;s the quality argument, and it&#39;s not a bad one truth be told.

Cost is, of course, as I mentioned; I have yet to meet a government program w

Most humans are emotional about feeding children. Some are emotional about making sure they eat while others are emotional about not paying a few dollars in taxes per year so that they can do so.

Remember when &quot;it&#39;s for the children&quot; was rightly derided for being manipulative and meaningless?  When did people start falling for that nonsense?

None of that has anything to do with what I posted unless...wait...have I been arguing with a bot?

I have yet to see anyone argue that feeding children no food versus junk food is an improvement.Why are you treating this issue like feeding the kids junk food or letting them starve are the only two options? Programs like WIC provide healthy food to parents and can not be used for junk food for instance.

I don&#39;t know the solution, but I know giving the government more and more power/money leads to worse outcomes, not better.I don&#39;t know about you but this is type of thing Republicans say while they take actions to make sure this is the end result, we get the government we deserve.  Lest I remind everyone Michelle Obama tried to give kids more vegetables and the Republicans flipped the fuck out, “Your America is turning into a nanny state thanks to the Obama administration’s efforts to rein in the junk food industry,” said Sean Hannity.Mike Bloomberg wanted to ban giant sodas and Sara Palin get&#39;s on stage with a Big Gulp.  Elect clowns and expect clownery.The expanded Child Tax Credit reduced childhood poverty to it&#39;s lowest level ever before it was rescinded.  Social Security keeps 1/3 of our elderly from living in destitution and allows their children to produce more output during their working years.   The government can do lots of good if we elect people who believe it can do those things.

You failed to read or understand what he wrote if you think that&#39;s the takeaway.

If you have a smoking gun which proves politics is purely a show for our benefit, present it. Otherwise fuck off with your equivocation.

I pick and choose how I respond, but let&#39;s clarify something; do you really think millions if not billions wouldn&#39;t be political theatre?

Oh.  Oh princess.  How very &quot;brave&quot; and &quot;stunning&quot; you are.  Now run along and eat your crayons, the adults are talking.

Fuck right off with this both-sides shit. When&#39;s the last time the Democrats ever advocated putting children in jail, separated from the parents, en masse, or sending thousands of secret police to terrorize and murder the citizens of cities run by republicans (no, they no longer deserve to be capitalized)? Oh, that&#39;s right: NEVER. That&#39;s because Democrats actually do care about the people and the rule of law. They aren&#39;t a crazy death cult run by a tyrannic fascist. Do they have problems? Sure. Are they on

It&#39;s an interesting thought experiment to look at moral trends, and consider what activities which are currently legal may become illegal in the future.

e.g. If you were playing this game in the past, you might have correctly predicted dog fighting, or legal descrimination based on race.

Looking 100 years into the future, we might wonder about the sport of boxing, or factory farming of animals. But I hadn&#39;t considered ultra-processed food...

Oh, no one wants to play that game, or we&#39;d be having a serious discussion about hormone therapy and medically unnecessary surgeries ( maiming ) for minors.Won&#39;t be 100 years though, more like 10, maybe 20.Imagine what kind monsters people in the future will think we were for allowing that to be done to little ones.  And they&#39;ll be 100% accurate.There is certainly precedent for medical procedures which were introduced, but later banned. The lobotomy is such an example.

I didn&#39;t notice a big change when I quit drinking Coke.If you think that was the difference between a diet of UPF and a non-UPF diet then your problem isn&#39;t that the science is shit, but that your understanding of it is shit.I&#39;m not surprised you didn&#39;t notice a big change, because you didn&#39;t make a big change, it&#39;s the equivalent from smoking 20 cigarettes a day to smoking 19. I will bet a Marsbar you consume a constant stream of UPF because avoiding UPF is currently INCREDIBLY FUCKING DIFFICULT.

You&#39;ll find a definition including abstract characteristics as well as examples.

The definition isn&#39;t particularly coherent.  Cane and beet sugar are Group II, but &quot;sugar, oils, and fats for domestic use&quot; are Group IV?  Which is it?  Ice cream is Group IV despite being milk (Group), cream, sugar, and salt (all Group II)... are they complaining about the often-present emulsifier ,which as a vegetable extract should also be Group II?  Certainly it should be Group III at worst.  Sausage is Group IV despite the processing in sausage being pretty much purely physical; perhaps they don&#39;t know

It&#39;s coherent enough. When classifying a broad spectrum like foods, you will always find ambiguity at the edges. If you want specificity you face to make a definitive list. But if you want definitions, you have to abstract, and abstractions are always imperfect.

The question is whether the classifications are meaningful and useful, and I would argue that they are.

For your specific comparison of sugar, oils, and fats, when read in context it&#39;s pretty clear what is meant.

Group II of these are derived in a single step. Olives to olive oil. Milk to butter. Cane sugar to rock sugar. Group IV require further processing. White sugar, hydrogenated oils, etc.. these things are not direct derivations. They require additional processing.

&quot;Ultra-processed foods include... sweets and chocolates...&quot;

Chocolate is included... I don&#39;t know what you think you&#39;re reading but you&#39;re reading it wrong.

I believe this is the link to the original article, it appears to be open access / no paywall.https://onlinelibrary.wiley.co... [wiley.com]

I need to read it again, but it feels like it reads more like an essay or whitepaper than a scientific article.  I am not sure the author actually conducted any testing or comparing tobacco to ultra-processed food.  I am also not sure the author offered a concrete definition of ultra-processed food.  The author does identify foods that are very high in simple carbohydrates (e.g. candy, M&Ms, Peeps), but I don&#39;t think anyone believes that candy is healthy.

I wish the author had provided their working definition of ultra-processed food.  The way I understand, even things like home-made bread qualify as ultra-processed food.  The problem is that unless you are eating only raw fruits and vegetables; pretty much everything else is processed to some degree, even if it just involves cooking.  I want to understand how ultra-processing is being conceived other than &quot;traditional&quot; junk food, or just anything to come out of an &quot;evil&quot; industrial kitchen.

Well, exactly.  I am not trying to defend crap food, but really, what are we talking about?  Pancakes?  Homemade grilled cheese (defining, for the moment, &quot;american cheese&quot; as cheese)?  Breakfast cereals?  Hot breakfast oatmeal? &quot;TV&quot; dinners?  (of which there are a vast range, from obviously shite to plausibly good.)

One would hope that there&#39;s a gap between, say, bagged pork rinds vs no-frills baked pretzels.  Just saying &quot;:UPF bad, not-UPF good&quot; is unavailing, especially if there&#39;s no consumer useful defin

&quot;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have more in common with cigarettes than with fruit or vegetables&quot;

>&quot;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have more in common with cigarettes than with fruit or vegetables&quot;

Well, I, for one, don&#39;t plan to smoke my Cheez-Its.  (But, they have to be the &quot;extra toasty&quot; ones, those are really good).

There is absolutely nothing wrong with food that has been processed via a variety of means and the term is confusing for EVERYONE as a result. Did you have a tofu wrap with kimchi? Congrats, you had &quot;ultra-processed&quot; food and now your life is in danger. (Ok, no, not really.) Let&#39;s just look at what the article itself says:

Ultra-processed food involves extremely high levels of manufacturing to produce. It includes all formula milk, many commercially produced baby and toddler foods, fizzy drinks and sweets, fast food, snacks, biscuits and cakes, as well as mass-produced bread and breakfast cereals, ready meals and desserts.* Fizzy drinks - Carbonation isn&#39;t a problem, it&#39;s the sugar.* Sweets - Apricots are not a problem, candy is.* Fast Food - Quickly produced grilled chicken is a non-issue. High-salt, high-fat meets and sugary breads are.* Mass-Produced Bread - There&#39;s nothing wrong with making a LOT of bread. The cake-levels of sugars are.What do these foods contain? Ultra-processed ingredients include fruit juice concentrates, maltodextrin, dextrose, golden syrup, hydrogenated oils, soya protein isolate, gluten, “mechanically separated meat”, organic dried egg whites, as well as rice and potato starch and corn fibre. Additives such as monosodium glutamate, colourings, thickeners and glazing agents are also ultra-processed.* There&#39;s nothing bad about fruit juice concentrates except when they use insufficient water to reconstitute the concentrate or if they remove too much pulp.* Dextrose? Dextrose is used to treat hypoglycemia.* Golden Syrup? Again... It&#39;s sugar!* Gluten? Gluten is the problem? WTF?* What in the world is wrong with dried egg whites?* Monosodium glutamate is just a salt!!Why does it matter? Ultra-processed food contains higher levels of salt, sugar, fat and additives that are associated with obesity, cancer, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. They also tend to have lower levels of protein, zinc, magnesium, vitamins A, C, D, E, B12 and niacin necessary for a child’s optimal growth and development. It is also thought that other mechanisms are at play in UPFs being associated with worse health outcomes, including negative effects on the development of gut microbiota.And here&#39;s where we get to what it&#39;s ACTUALLY all about-- HIGH salt, HIGH sugar, HIGH fat. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the problem.There is nothing intrinsically unhealthy about mass produced food.There is nothing intrinsically unhealthy about dehydrated food.There is nothing intrinsically unhealthy about quickly produced food or with food with a long preparation process.The ONLY ACTUAL problems are the unhealthy levels of SALT, SUGAR, and FAT.So again, I assert We Need to Drop the Term &quot;Ultra-Processed&quot;. Most people don&#39;t understand it and thus it&#39;s a useless term to improve peoples&#39; lives.

We have ample evidence that a large number of additives used in UPF production are unhealthy, in some cases actually carcinogenic.You seem to base your view on what you want to believe is true to help self-justify what you eat. Science doesn&#39;t work like that.

I&#39;ve seen any number of articles recently bewailing the evils of UPF&#39;s, but nothing that says exactly WHAT counts as an ultra-processed food.  Wheaties?  Fully-cooked sausages (e.g. GIlbert&#39;s)?  Hot dogs?  Pretzels?   or just what exactly?  There&#39;s no point in telling people that X is bad if you don&#39;t properly define what X is.

Did you bother to read any of the articles or their sources, or search the internet?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_classification [wikipedia.org]

I did.  Did you?  and anyone looking for &quot;UPF&quot; isn&#39;t likely to land on &quot;Nova classification&quot;, not that the latter will tell them anything useful.

So I googled &quot;what are ultra processed foods&quot;, and the nova system was the second image, and referenced from the pages of the top three results. I&#39;m not sure why you think it&#39;s unlikely.

And what do you find to not be useful about the definitions? They&#39;re about as useful as classification definitions can be. They don&#39;t tell you what to do with the information, but that&#39;s not the point of the classification. You need guidance that references it.

Literally all articles about UPF talk about how its classified.

Wheaties? Fully-cooked sausages (e.g. GIlbert&#39;s)? Hot dogs? Pretzels? or just what exactly?All of the above are classified as IV in the Nova system and would count as UPF. But really the problem is your understanding of the classification. It&#39;s not about the food itself, it&#39;s about how it&#39;s made. If you buy a sausage off the shelf for your hot dog it most definitely fits the UPF classification perfectly. If you google a recipe online, get out you mincer, buy appropriate ingredients and make it yourself then it won&#39;t be UPF. But it als

If you google a recipe online, get out you mincer, buy appropriate ingredients and make it yourself then it won&#39;t be UPF. But it als

Sure, it is easier to get the people in charge to agree to collect more (sin) taxes, but it would remove the barely affordable sustenance options for many.

There are really simple and obvious reasons people avoid unprocessed foods today.  Solve those instead.  Don&#39;t poison the existing imperfect solutions out of some self righteous messiah complex.

Create a way to know exactly how ripe or &quot;good&quot; something will be (before I buy it).  Make it like buying something off a shelf.  I always get the same thing I pai

&quot;Why aren&#39;t we training every public school student in safe food handling, and giving them a certificate for it?&quot;

That class was called home economics but was only open to girls. The boys were in shop. Really both genders should have been in both classes, but the school year was pretty full already.

But I couldn&#39;t get the damn cornflakes to stay lit!

Homemade bread is ultraprocessed, but it&#39;s unquestionably good for you.Wonder bread is equally ultraprocessed, and is far less healthful.

It&#39;s not the processing, it&#39;s non-food ingredients like chemical preservatives and food dyes made of petroleum.

Stop giving processing a bad name. Many processes, like cooking, generally *improve* the quality, safety, and healthfulness of food.

You can still buy cigarettes, and while there was once an attempt to ban alcoholic beverages, that didn&#39;t last.  So, the most likely outcome is a big ugly warning label on the package that says in so many words &quot;THIS SHIT BE UNHEALTHY, YO&quot;.

Which of course, people will just ignore just as they do the warnings on cigarettes and alcohol.  Because ultimately, if you wanna put garbage in your body, that really should be your choice so long as you&#39;re fully informed.

It is impossible to know why you got cancer. It could be the school lunch served to you when you were in middle school or a the cold cuts your grandparent&#39;s generation ate their entire life but just happened to give you stomach cancer.

It could be... The Sun. (Which, unfortunately, is a hard thing to regulate.)

Jesus was NOT a socialist.  Socialism (and Communism) are systems of GOVERMENT that take goods from some individuals to give to others, by force if necessary.Not actually true. That is the definition of state socialism [wikipedia.org], which is the variety of socialism that we see at the country-scale in the 20th century, but, no, it&#39;s just one type of socialism. Take a look at Bakunin or Kropotkin for some varieties of socialism that are diametrically opposite. Not actually workable ideas, mind, but completely different from state socialism. (Bakunin, for what it&#39;s worth, detested Marx&#39;s ideas. His comment about Marx&#39;s &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; was that it would quickly devolve into dictatorship, period. Got that one right!)

Jesus is pretty clear that the kingdom of heaven demands that you give your wealth away in order to enter it. Is Jesus not the king and ultimate goverment of the earth? Does he not tell you repeatedly to give up your possessions to the poor? If that isn&#39;t like socialism it is even less like capitalism. Many times have I seen rich people read passages from the bible that directly say &quot;Do not be rich&quot;. The words seem to flow around them like a vapor.

I mean, Jesus wasn&#39;t anything. He never existed IRL. But, setting that aside, if we look at the &quot;teachings&quot; of Jesus as a whole, it is a serious stretch to believe that Jesus would be a capitalist. If anything, he&#39;d be a Socialist or a full-out Communist.&quot;Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.&quot; - Matthew 19:24Jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him, “One thing you lack.

Many places have limitations on what you can add to a cigarette, specifically flavourings. There are also restrictions on advertising and who can buy them.

The US FDA has proposed limiting nicotine content.

The flavoring bans are ostensibly a &quot;think of the children&quot; thing.  The idea being that it&#39;s illegal to market cigarettes to children, and flavors can be perceived as trying to appeal to children.  The stupid thing about that is, it&#39;s also kind of an admission that the age gates don&#39;t work, because if the product isn&#39;t supposed to be sold to anyone under 21, the fact that flavors have been added should be irrelevant.

Ironically, a similar argument was made against alcoholic beverages with fruity flavors and

Indeed.  Plenty of minimally-processed foods can be quite unhealthy (and addictive).

No, real food is cheap. I regularly get real zucchini and real potatoes and onions etc from my garden, practically for free.And how are you under the impression that poor people live in residences where they can grow their own garden? Do you see a lot of personal gardens in apartment complexes, y&#39;know, with their complete lack of yards?

One can certainly attempt to kill the poor. But when facing an existential crisis, I can&#39;t really blame the poor if they rise up and kill the middle class and rich. Even if that includes me, especially if it does!So I would rather avoid peak capitalism scenarios that end in civil unrest and myself being first against the wall when the revolution comes.Other political chatterboxes I interact with tell me I&#39;m a socialist for not wanting to be murdered by the proletariat.If everyone has a job and enough to eat

People often misunderstand the works of Karl Marx. You, sir, understand perfectly. I mean, he was wrong about the whole Communism thing, but the idea that if the rich piss the poor off enough, the poor will rise up and kill them is pretty solid and has happened plenty of times. It&#39;s starting to happen right now again, it seems.

Dude what. You think &quot;the poor&quot; will rise up and kill wealthier individuals because someone over-regulated their Cheetos?!?

During tanking, engineers spent several hours troubleshooting a liquid hydrogen leak in an interface used to route the cryogenic propellant into the rocket&#39;s core stage, putting them behind in the countdown. Attempts to resolve the issue involved stopping the flow of liquid hydrogen into the core stage, allowing the interface to warm up for the seals to reseat, and adjusting the flow of the propellant.  

Teams successfully filled all tanks in both the core stage and interim cryogenic propulsion stage before a team of five was sent to the launch pad to finish Orion closeout operations. Engineers conducted a first run at terminal countdown operations during the test, counting down to approximately 5 minutes left in the countdown, before the ground launch sequencer automatically stopped the countdown due to a spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate.

There&#39;s always at least 1 hydrogen valve issue. Perhaps they should redesign their valves?

Perhaps they should redesign their rocket.Valves, connectors, o-rings shrinking from cold temperatures, loose pins blowing out at high speed causing tiny nicks in tubing that hydrogen leaks through very easily... these are just a few of the many ways hydrogen can go wrong.Hydrogen is not the answer.  Hydrogen is the question.  &quot;H*ll, no&quot; is the answer.  In any sane universe, it&#39;s far better to have to lift 80% more fuel for your upper stages than to keep canceling or delaying launches for months at a time to avoid blowing up... and still blow up once (Challenger) and almost twice (Columbia in 1999).IMO, it was a big mistake to go with hydrogen as the main engine fuel, and anyone who studied the history of the shuttle should have reached that conclusion long before Artemis was planned, or even Ares.  But it was more important to keep jobs in the districts where the Space Shuttle main engines were manufactured than it was to build something reliable, so we got the best design that a committee of career politicians could produce.Now we&#39;re stuck with it, at least until SpaceX has a human-rated Starship launch vehicle.  And at that point, I hope the remaining Artemis hardware will be quietly scrapped as the mistake that it was.

One could also argue that, in a sane universe, it&#39;s far worse to have to lift 80% more fuel for your upper stages (and not to mention the required additional fuel on the lower stages to life the extra fuel for your upper stages) than to delay a launch. Hell, one could argue it&#39;s fucking absurd, unless one also gets super excited about it taking a month of orbital refueling to get your rocket.... well, fucking anywhere.

Part of the reason (not all) that Starship will require so much fuel is because of its size and payload capability, which is FAR greater than any other design has proposed thus far.  That&#39;s not to say that Hydrogen isn&#39;t a more efficient fuel relative to methane.  It is, 2x-3x more energy efficient by weight, but not necessarily by Volume which also matters.

I only say this because the details matter.  It&#39;s not as if swapping Methane for Hydrogen lends itself to an Apples-to-Apples comparison.  It&#39;s more complicated than that.

Part of the reason (not all) that Starship will require so much fuel is because of its size and payload capabilityI&#39;d say more so it&#39;s construction from steel.

However, the efficiency increase would be enough to turn an Earth-to-Moon Starship mission from &quot;Every trip is an appreciable fraction of the logistical difficulty of building the fucking ISS&quot; to, &quot;alright- that&#39;s not bad.&quot;

We&#39;re not talking about orders of magnitude here.  We&#39;re talking about a relatively small difference in the amount of energy per unit of mass.  And in exchange for that relatively small reduction in payload capacity, launches have to endure constant failures that more traditional launch systems don&#39;t.Even ignoring the risk of embrittlement causing an in-space disaster, I&#39;m pretty sure nobody is seriously considering using hydrogen for orbital refueling because of the leaks alone.  There&#39;s no way to fix them in space, so you&#39;d have to launch your fuel right before you need it.  For that reason alone, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re even seriously considering it for refueling on Mars.  Hydrogen is being used for getting humans into orbit and lifting payloads.  The only refueling that I&#39;m aware of is by Starship, whose in-orbit parts are methane-based.Realistically, we need to get better at handling hydrogen.Realistically, NASA and its contractors have been struggling to achieve that for more than fifty years and still haven&#39;t pulled off.  I mean sure, people who don&#39;t try again after a failure never succeed, but if you keep trying over and over and still don&#39;t succeed, at some point, it makes sense to acknowledge that you&#39;re never going to be good enough and stop trying.  Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  And here we are 50 years later, and hydrogen leaks still are repeatedly unmanageable.  They&#39;re not even trying to stop leaks completely — just keep them below the threshold where the rocket would blow up.  Yikes.For orbital refueling to be possible with hydrogen, you&#39;d need to stop leaks completely, and have the whole system remain leak-free after enduring the shock of getting launched into space.  I would not want to place bets on that happening any time soon.I&#39;m aware of its problems, but I think much of the extant problems are because it&#39;s too easy to just &quot;work around them&quot;, rather than really fix them.To some degree, sure.  On the flip side, other than the engines themselves, somebody designed this thing from scratch relatively recently.  They could have designed it to be slightly bigger with methane for the top stage fuel, and you wouldn&#39;t *need* to solve any of those problems, because they would be solved by virtue of the fuel not being such a pain in the a** to work with.It&#39;s one thing to solve problems that have to be solved.  It&#39;s another to spend huge amounts of money to solve problems primarily because politicians insisted on reusing leftover shuttle parts to keep jobs in their districts.

A human-rated Starship... isn&#39;t going *anywhere* fucking close to the moon, unless we&#39;ve also got a magical fuel depot waiting in orbit for it, itself fueled by a dozen or so launches, waiting for it.A human-rated Starship is exactly what they&#39;re planning to land on the moon.

For orbital refueling to be possible with hydrogen, you&#39;d need to stop leaks completely, and have the whole system remain leak-free after enduring the shock of getting launched into space.  I would not want to place bets on that happening any time soon.

I&#39;m aware of its problems, but I think much of the extant problems are because it&#39;s too easy to just &quot;work around them&quot;, rather than really fix them.To some degree, sure.  On the flip side, other than the engines themselves, somebody designed this thing from scratch relatively recently.  They could have designed it to be slightly bigger with methane for the top stage fuel, and you wouldn&#39;t *need* to solve any of those problems, because they would be solved by virtue of the fuel not being such a pain in the a** to work with.It&#39;s one thing to solve problems that have to be solved.  It&#39;s another to spend huge amounts of money to solve problems primarily because politicians insisted on reusing leftover shuttle parts to keep jobs in their districts.  If throwing a little bit more fuel at the problem solves a problem, I say throw more fuel at the problem.at least until SpaceX has a human-rated Starship launch vehicle.lol... A human-rated Starship... isn&#39;t going *anywhere* fucking close to the moon, unless we&#39;ve also got a magical fuel depot waiting in orbit for it, itself fueled by a dozen or so launches, waiting for it.A human-rated Starship is exactly what they&#39;re planning to land on the moon.  And it uses methane.  And yes, they&#39;re planning to use multiple refueling launches to get it into the correct orbit.

A 1.8x increase in fuel consumption is not going to make it take a month unless it was already going to take 18 days with hydrogen. We&#39;re not talking about orders of magnitude here. We&#39;re talking about a relatively small difference in the amount of energy per unit of mass. And in exchange for that relatively small reduction in payload capacity, launches have to endure constant failures that more traditional launch systems don&#39;t.No- it&#39;s a matter of having to refuel, and not.
If you can use non-hydrogen to complete your mission without refuelling, then you&#39;re fine and dandy.

The Starship&#39;s payload is a problem they are actively working on. The original goal was 200 tons to LEO, but the Starship v2 was only theoretically capable of ~30 tons (v2 will never actually go into orbit anyways). The v2 that has flown to-date did not have a workable payload for the size of the vehicle. The problem is/was dry mass being too high. Supposedly v3 (set to launch next month) can do 100 tons and v4 (which does not yet exist) sets the original target of 200 tons. Whether they have achieved even

We&#39;re not talking about orders of magnitude here. We&#39;re talking about a relatively small difference in the amount of energy per unit of mass.

Ah, the tyranny of the rocket equation strikes again.

Not when the partially solid first stage of SLS is as inefficient as it is.  Like I said elsewhere, the total fuel mass is pretty similar.  At worst, with methane all the way, you might be lifting more of it slightly farther than you otherwise would have been, but even that part, I&#39;m not so sure about.The only question is whether methane could realistically be used for the additional stage that transfers from LEO to NRHO.

Challenger was a problem with a solid fuel booster. No hydrogen involved. Columbia was an issue with ice, which would be a problem for any cryogenic fuel... basically anything other than solid fuel.

Challenger was a problem with a solid fuel booster. No hydrogen involved.Gah.  My bad.  I mixed up my o-rings.

Hydrogen is atomically as small as a fuel can get.It is prone to leak out somewhere and that is why the hydrogen conversion for cars isn&#39;t taking off.Even Edison set a submarine on fire with his hydrogen leaking batteries a century ago.

Freezing temperatures in Florida. Leaking o-rings. Fuel leak.

For the record, I fully expected the launch to be delayed. just Artemis things.

Freezing temperatures in Florida. Leaking o-rings. Fuel leak.Why do I have this sense of deja vu?Yeah, deja view all over again. I saw an article yesterday from a fluff site saying something like &quot;NASA picked the worst week to fly Artemis&quot;, and I immediately thought about temps and polar vortices. Not at all. They went on about how the Olympics are starting, Superbowl is Sunday, and Artemis is going to be knocked out of the news/viewing cycle. I thought, &quot;That&#39;s it? That&#39;s all?&quot;.My last thought leaving the article was wondering if that was a valid conclusion. Tagging in with the world&#39;s biggest TV show

Heh. Interesting interpretation to &quot;We do not do these things because they are easy, we do these things because they are hard!&quot;

We do these things not because they make sense, but to try to prop up a failing defense contractor

That&#39;s why we deliberately choose hydrogenMeh. So do the Chinese. So do the Europeans.
Its only downside is density. Its mass efficiency is ridiculously better.
For a traditional staged rocket- that just makes sense. 

Lifting methane to space in order to burn it there borders on stupid.
Also, we&#39;ve had exactly zero hull losses caused by the use of hydrogen. It is more complicated and more expensive, though. And in order to increase the difficulty yet again we choose to use politically picked contractors who are not really competent to do the job in order to build our big ass rocket.I think this is probably our primary problem.

No, another downside is that it&#39;s damned hard to make the fuel system hydrogen-tight.  Other fuels are easier for a fuel system to handle.  As this incident has just demonstrated.

Kind of disappointing, but not surprising. They had the same issues with Artemis-1, so why are they still having problems? Seems like they didn&#39;t solve the problems at all, just &quot;try enough times until you get fuel flow without leaks&quot;.

The Shuttle used LH2. The second and third stages of the Saturn-V rocket used LH2. The Centaur upper stage uses LH2 since 1962 and is still in service. A modified version or Centaur is even the upper stage for SLS. Forget all the BS from Boeing about how &quot;LH2 is hard to handle

Correction. The SLS upper stage &quot;ICPS&quot; is based off of Delta Cryogenic Second Stage, not Centaur. Although it does also use LH2.

... to get to orbit. We should have at least one ClarkeTower/Beanstalk up by now. (aka space elevator)

The last remaining U.S.–Russia nuclear arms–control treaty, New START, expires on Feb. 5—and, with less than 48 hours to go, President Donald Trump hasn’t done anything about it.

Asked about the impending deadline in his New York Times interview last month, Trump replied, “If it expires, it expires. We’ll do a better agreement,” maybe one that brings in China—which has a growing nuclear arsenal—as a participant.

If past is precedent, a new treaty would take at least a year to negotiate; if China takes part, something that has never happened before, it would take many years.

In the meantime, we may well see the renewal of a nuclear arms race, reversing a trend of the past half-century. The stunning thing is that, by all accounts, Trump and his advisers haven’t so much as held a conversation about the possibility or its implications for U.S. policy or the safety of the world.

It’s worth recalling that when Trump scuttled the Iran nuclear deal back during his first term as president, he said that he—master of the “art of the deal”—would goad Tehran into accepting a “better” deal. This never happened. There is no reason to believe, especially given Washington’s tense relations with both Moscow and Beijing, that he’ll bring about a superior substitute for New START either.

New START—the acronym stands for Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty—was signed by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev in February 2011, as a follow-on to previous accords, START and START II, which George H.W. Bush had signed with Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin, respectively. The Obama–Medvedev treaty went further than the earlier accords, forcing each side to cut its long-range nuclear arsenals to 1,550 warheads—a 30 percent reduction from START II’s limits, a 75 percent cut from START’s. It also allowed very intrusive on-site inspections of each side’s arsenals to verify that they were in compliance.

New START was set to expire after 10 years. Obama envisioned negotiating, well before then, a follow-on accord that would make still deeper cuts, including short- and medium-range missiles. But it never happened. The U.S. had long ago dismantled almost all of those weapons, for good reason, while Russia retained about 2,000, which it wanted to keep to counter NATO’s superiority in conventional armies (just as, during much of the Cold War, the U.S. and NATO kept thousands of nukes in Western Europe to counter the Soviet Union’s conventional edge). Plus, after Putin returned as Russia’s president and started rattling sabers in eastern Ukraine and elsewhere, the political climate for arms control chilled.

So when Joe Biden came to the White House in January 2021, New START—which he had worked on as Obama’s vice president—was about to expire. The treaty did allow a one-time five-year extension, so he and Putin quickly made it so.* Diplomatic channels were still very much open (Putin wouldn’t launch his full-scale invasion of Ukraine for another year); both leaders saw it in their interests to keep a cap on a possible arms race.

Now five years have passed, and here we are. Putin recently proposed a quick accord—it could be drawn up and signed in very short order—to extend New START’s ceilings on nuclear-armed missiles, bombers, and warheads for another year. Trump has not replied, at least not in public.

Here’s why this is important: A major purpose of arms control is to put boundaries on the threat—to keep each side from spinning and acting upon “worst-case scenarios” of how many nukes the other side might build and, therefore, how many nukes it needs to build in response.

For instance, in the late 1950s, the intelligence branch of the U.S. Air Force estimated that the Soviet Union would have 500 intercontinental ballistic missiles by 1962, maybe by as soon as 1961. By contrast, the U.S. would have just 65 ICBMs. In other words, there would soon be a “missile gap.” As a result, the Pentagon proposed, and Congress readily approved, our own crash buildup of missiles (which would be built by the U.S. Air Force).

Then, in 1960, photos taken above the USSR, first by U-2 spy planes and then by Discoverer spy satellites, revealed a different story. Independent intelligence analysts at the CIA estimated that the Soviets would have just 50 ICBMs in the next couple of years. In reality, the Soviets turned out to have just four ICBMs. There was a missile gap, but very much in the United States’ favor.

However, by this time, the Pentagon had already embarked on its crash missile buildup. Air Force officers were still arguing they needed 2,000 ICBMs over the long haul. White House aides to President John F. Kennedy argued that the new intelligence data suggested the nation could get by with just 600. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara told Kennedy that, as a political compromise, to keep the Joint Chiefs of Staff from rebelling, he needed 1,000. Kennedy, who at the time was inclined to side with his Cabinet secretaries, approved 1,000.

As a result, the Soviets, seeing this American buildup, responded with a very real buildup of their own. Had there been better information, a more bounded threat, the arms race of the missile age might have been squelched before it took off.

The parallels with current times aren’t precise. Intelligence analysts don’t have to rely so much on guesswork. Even without on-site inspection, they can learn or infer a great deal—almost everything—from high-resolution satellites, communications intercepts, and a wide range of technical and human sources. (In 2023, Putin stopped allowing on-site inspections, but the U.S. still has very high confidence that he hasn’t deployed more nuclear weapons than New START allows.)

Still, one can easily imagine even today’s officers and analysts with vested interests or hawkish inclinations arguing that, freed from the restraints of New START, the Russians could build many more missiles and warheads—and, therefore, we need to build many more to match. It’s even easier to imagine Russian officers and analysts, who tend to be more paranoid than ours, doing the same. A stepped-up arms race is likely indeed.

This action-reaction complex stems not just from a psychological need to appear equal (though that is part of what goes on). There’s a tangible element here too. The planners at U.S. Strategic Command—and probably their counterparts in Russia—maintain a “counterforce” strategy. Most of our missiles are aimed at their missiles—and, most likely, vice versa. The warheads on our missiles also have sufficient accuracy and explosive power to destroy or disable the Russian missiles in their blast-hardened silos—and, again, most likely vice versa.

By the logic of this strategy, if the Russians build more missiles, we have to build more missiles too—so that we’re still able to hit all of the targets.

This is where the new dimension of arms-race scenarios comes into focus—China. When Obama and Medvedev signed New START 15 years ago, China barely had enough nuclear weapons to warrant attention. Now they have about 600; within a few years, they’ll approach parity with the U.S. and Russia. Nobody quite knows why; Chinese officers, who used to write a fair amount about nuclear strategy, have gone silent. Whatever the motive, if China is seen as an adversary, and if counterforce is still a centerpiece of U.S. nuclear strategy, then we don’t have enough warheads to cover all of the targets.

This is why some defense analysts say it’s just as well that New START is expiring. They say that the U.S. needs more nuclear weapons than New START permits.

But this is where the discussion should begin, not end. Do we really need to be able to destroy all of the Russian and Chinese missile sites? This is a two-part question: First, what are the chances that we’ll face not just war but all-out nuclear war against Russia and China simultaneously? Second, do we need to have the ability to knock out all of their missile sites in order to deter nuclear war?

Deterring nuclear war is the aim here. If the plan is to fight, maybe win a nuclear war, how does that game go? Would we launch a first strike against Russia and China? If we did, and we aimed to destroy their missile silos, would they launch the missiles on warning, before our warheads struck—in which case, they’d inflict more damage on us than might otherwise be the case? Finally, there’s “nuclear winter“—the theory that a certain number of nuclear explosions (the calculations vary, but some are as low as a few hundred) will ignite so many fires and kick up so much dust that much of life on Earth will end. There is no winner in this war.

These are controversies that have gone on for many decades. In previous administrations, the Pentagon, StratCom, the National Security Council, and sometimes the president himself, have engaged in this discussion. They have published a Nuclear Posture Review, in classified and unclassified forms, that spelled out the policy.

Trump has not done this. It is very unlikely that he or anyone else at a high level has discussed this at all, or is even aware of the dilemmas and imponderables. Nor is there likely to be a discussion of this sort in the next few years. In the meantime, Trump and Putin should sign a one-page document extending the terms of New START. It’s an imperfect accord, but it’s better than crying “Havoc!” and letting slip the dogs of a nuclear arms race.

Correction, Feb. 3, 2026: This piece originally misstated Obama’s exit date from office.

On Sept. 15, my family and I arrived for our routine Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-in appointment at the New York City immigration courthouse. My 6-year-old daughter was wearing her school uniform and her backpack. My husband and I planned to drop her off at school afterward.

Instead, the three of us were arrested and detained.

ICE officials held us at the courthouse all day with no food before transferring us to temporary housing for the night. At around 3 the next morning, officers woke us and put us on a commercial flight. Against our will, we were flown across the country to the family detention center in Dilley, Texas. The next two months we spent there were a living nightmare.

When my family and I had fled Colombia in October 2022, we believed that the United States would be a place of refuge. Back home, we had been targeted by an armed guerrilla group—the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia—and over time, the death threats and physical violence became impossible to hide from. We had no choice but to flee for our lives.

On our way to the U.S., armed smugglers confined my daughter and me in a guarded safe house for days. I was forced to cook and clean for them, along with the other women. I was warned to watch my daughter closely so she would not be kidnapped. Only after being passed between multiple vehicles and handlers were we finally able to cross the border in November 2022.

After we arrived in the United States, we built a new life in Queens, New York. My daughter started school. She enjoyed art class and adored her teacher. She loved our cat. She was happy.

We applied for asylum. We were denied. But the dangers we faced in Colombia had not ended. From abroad, we learned that my husband was still receiving threats.

Because of my experience in Mexico, we then filed an application for a T visa, a form of humanitarian protection for victims of human trafficking. While that application was pending, we continued to comply with immigration authorities because we believed that following the law mattered.

That is why, even after being warned that attending our Sept. 15 check-in could lead to detention, we went anyway. But our compliance did not matter to ICE.

After we were taken to the Dilley detention center, my husband was held in a separate area from my daughter and me. Starting the first day, officers began using family separation as a threat. We were told that if we refused deportation, we would be fined $1,000 a day. We were warned that if we continued to resist deportation in any way, my husband and I could face criminal charges and our daughter could be taken from us. The officers also threatened to put us all on separate deportation flights.

The conditions at the facility only intensified the horror. People were constantly sick. Bathrooms were filthy. The food was often inedible, and the water was discolored. My daughter began losing weight because she could not eat.

Every Wednesday, deportation flights left for Colombia. Every Wednesday, we waited in fear for our names to be called. Officers unsuccessfully tried to deport us twice.

The constant threats took a toll on my health. I began experiencing regular panic attacks driven by the fear that my family would be separated or deported. I also suffer from chronic migraines, which worsened over time because the facility would not provide the medication I needed. I lived for weeks with steady pain, fainting spells, nosebleeds, and vision changes that made it difficult to function.

My daughter’s health deteriorated even faster.

At Dilley, she went from full-time school to just one hour of instruction a day. She contracted a cough, which only got worse. She cried at night and asked when we would go back to our apartment in New York. She asked about her teacher and our cat every day. My daughter was once an extroverted, healthy, and happy first grader. But at Dilley, she regressed behaviorally, wetting herself after years without accidents and begging to breastfeed again despite being 6 years old. When we sought mental health care, a psychiatrist blamed me for her distress and accused me of poor parenting.

A facility staff member accidentally struck her eye with a mop. Blood came from her eye. At the medical center, the injury was falsely recorded as a fall. Despite my daughter’s continued complaints of blurred vision, light sensitivity, and hearing problems, doctors dismissed us.

After over a month of delays, an ophthalmologist who evaluated my daughter warned that she may have suffered trauma to her eye and needed further evaluation, as well as a referral to an ENT specialist because the injury could also be affecting her hearing. My husband and I repeatedly begged the facility to provide this care, but officers insisted that it was not their responsibility—even though the injury had been caused by a staff member.

In the days before our deportation, my husband and daughter began experiencing stomach illnesses. Both suffered from vomiting and diarrhea. My husband was placed in the medical unit. He was pale and visibly unwell. For a moment, I believed that because he was so sick, ICE would not deport us.

On Wednesday, Nov. 12, ICE officers entered our room and ordered us to pack, saying we were leaving that day. My husband was taken out of the medical unit to be deported. My daughter was still coughing and vomiting. When I explained that they were too sick to travel, the agents accused me of inventing my husband’s illness, refused to let me call our lawyers, and denied my request to see a doctor. Despite my daughter’s untreated eye injury and serious cough, the officers insisted she was fine and said her health was not their responsibility.

Nearly 10 ICE agents with chains and handcuffs surrounded us and cautioned that we could leave “the easy way or the hard way.” My daughter was terrified. When she saw the chains, she screamed and cried. Officers again refused to let us contact our lawyers. There was no real choice but to comply.

They put us on a bus, along with one other woman, to transport us to Louisiana for our deportation flight. About an hour into the drive, the bus stopped, and dozens of men in chains and handcuffs got on, along with another handcuffed woman, who looked at my child and asked aloud how anyone could allow a little girl to witness this. My daughter began to cry again.

The bus ride to Louisiana was over 18 hours. We were not able to use the bathroom the entire time. At 9 a.m., while we were still on the bus, I fainted and hit my head. After I begged for medical help, the paramedic who evaluated me suggested I go to a medical center. But ICE officers refused, telling me I had no right to see a doctor.

My daughter also began to vomit on the bus that morning. For hours, despite our requests, the officers refused to give her food or water.

She received no food or water until later that afternoon, on our flight back to Colombia. I had pleaded with the officers not to put us on the plane, explaining that the pressure would worsen our health conditions, but they did not care.

My daughter vomited the entire flight. When we landed in Bogotá, she was still vomiting and coughing and was severely dehydrated. She wanted to know why we were not in New York, but I had no answers—only fear.

Today we live in hiding in Colombia. Armed groups still control our region. We cannot safely access medical care.

My daughter continues to suffer from serious vision and hearing problems but has not been able to see a specialist. Her stomach issues also have not improved, and a doctor in Colombia has diagnosed her with a severe bacterial infection. I continue to suffer from chronic migraines and anxiety, without medication. My husband and I are terrified every day that we will be murdered and our daughter will be kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.

My daughter is only 6 years old. She should not know chains or handcuffs or the terror of her family being torn apart. She should never have been swept off the streets of New York or locked in a detention facility for two months. She should be in school in the United States, playing with her friends and receiving the medical care she needs.

Instead, ICE treated us like animals. Officers intimidated, restrained, and deported us without regard for our humanity. Our basic rights were violated, with no accountability or justice. My daughter is traumatized and cries every day.

We don’t know what our future will hold. But we are grateful for the time we had in America, and we will keep fighting for a better future for our daughter.

There is a uniquely American kink that holds that what really matters in terms of presidential policies and conduct is the question of whether something is “legal” as opposed to moral. In an essay for the Boston Review headlined “The Moral Stupefaction of the American Public,” professor Joseph Margulies argues that if conduct is deemed permissible simply because a mediocre law student can pen a mediocre legal memo justifying it, the country is in far deeper trouble than it presently comprehends. On this week’s Amicus podcast, he explained to Dahlia Lithwick that the inclination to fetishize that which can be justified legally has a way of opening the door to atrocities that cannot be tolerated. Their conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: In your article, you draw out the fact that lawyers are extremely uneasy about invoking the language of morality, because morality is either too malleable or just sanctimonious and annoying. I think your point is that the law—disaggregated from morality—becomes an endless series of hollow CYA memos to be deployed by any given administration to justify absolutely anything from torture at Gitmo to blowing up fishing vessels in the Caribbean?

Joseph Margulies: Yes. And that which is taking place in Minneapolis—and not simply in Minneapolis, but most pointedly in Minneapolis—ought not be framed as: “Is that lawful?” It ought to be framed as: “Is that right?” Are we going to allow a masked, heavily armed secret police force to march through the city all but unchecked, and checked only by the voluntary surveillance—to the extent they are checked—by plain citizens at their peril? A secret police force that, at least it appears at this point, enjoys absolute impunity?

Those are profoundly moral questions. Those are moral judgements. Have we lost the capacity to say this is simply wrong? That this is a grotesque obscenity and cannot be allowed to continue?

This is no longer simply a question of, “Is it a violation of the 10th Amendment?” That’s what they’re litigating in front of Judge Menendez. Or, “Is ICE violating judicial orders?” Answer: “Yes, there’s 96 of them.” The lawyers are fighting that out. Stop it. This is a horrible, grotesque, and ongoing wrong, and that’s the level at which we need to engage.

Why is it that we substitute what I call our legal voice for our moral voice? This is a country that purports to worship, and I use that term advisedly, the rule of law. We tend to believe that legality establishes rightness, establishes legitimacy. So when a question is posed: “Can they do that?” The answer is usually given in terms of: “Yes, of course, it’s all perfectly legal.” Over time, we lose the capacity to render moral objections, even when what is being done is unspeakably grotesque, because we simply don’t engage these muscles.

I read your piece with my lawyer glasses on, and two objections arose for me. One is that morality, as you and I both know, is not just subjective and inchoate, morality was also used to justify segregation—the anti-miscegenation laws were rooted in “morality.” That means, in a good sense, that morality evolves—that which was considered immoral is now urgently moral. But also, there can’t be any broad agreement about what is moral. What we like about the law, particularly in America, is the story we tell about the Framers creating a church of the law, then creating a religious document that is the Constitution, and then agreeing on certain principles that are legal and not moral. When I read your piece, while I agreed emphatically with it, I found myself getting stuck on the point of: How are we ever going to come to some kind of consensus or scientific agreement about what is moral? How should we think about the fact that what is moral today is egregiously immoral in 10 years’ time?

The myth is that by writing it down in a Constitution, we will achieve some consensus, and the myth is that that consensus will be desirable, that it will be reflective of society’s best impulses. You have an argument, I have an argument, and the debate goes no further. Lawyers seem to disagree, but lawyers in the Justice Department, or lawyers in the Trump administration or the Bush administration before that, say: “We have our document that says this is good,” and that’s just going to have to be enough. Unfortunately, if you engage only in “law-speak,” you’re done. You have nothing to say, unless you want to hold up an opposing memo.

The best example of this is the memos that John Yoo wrote that purported to justify torture. The Supreme Court calls it torture. Let’s just call it that. What we are talking about is strapping a person, with his head lowered on an inclined board, with his face covered, and then pouring water up his nose and down his throat, and holding him there until he breathes water, to bring him within sight of his own death. That is the purpose of waterboarding. You are deliberately bringing him within sight, so that he believes that he is about to die. It’s that moment of sheer terror. That’s what waterboarding is. And doing it over, and over, and over again, 86 times in my client’s case. Well, according to those memos, not only is it not torture, it’s not illegal. “I have a document that says so!”

If they can always write that, and they can always write that, then this pretense, this myth that the law will settle disputes in a fair and neutral way, is just gobbledygook and we shouldn’t pretend otherwise. And those lawyers who, or those law students who think, “I went into the law because it’s certain, it’s definite”—well, get over yourself.

I’m hearing what feels like your peak frustration with the “John Yoo special”: As long as it’s not organ failure, it’s not torture. The critique I’m hearing here is that any lawyer, any 1L with a Westlaw account, could magic up a document to justify anything. But the flip of it, of course, is that we are living in a moment where it’s really essential to know what is legal. And as you’re noting, judges around the country are drawing very firm lines in the sand and saying, “No! That’s unlawful, that’s illegal.” In other words, the thing that you are most worried about is also the thing that is saving us.

We have had district court judges and appellate court judges around the country, out on the hustings, facing death threats, and threats of impeachment, but nonetheless very clearly saying, “No. What you’re doing is unlawful.” So you’re not saying that that is a pointless exercise, that the pushback is futile because none of this has meaning. You’re saying something subtler than that. Right?

When you are trying to bend the will of society to reflect a different reality, trying to achieve a different vision for the world, the law has a role. Going into court, going to Congress, going to your statehouses—law has a role. But what we also know from decades of experience is that the law cannot play its role alone. You must have a popular movement behind it, that speaks in a moral voice, and leverages that moral voice, then lawyers who work with that community can translate that moral voice into a set of legal claims. What matters is the existence of that moral claim, that moral voice. If all you had in Minneapolis were a bunch of lawyers going into court and saying, “This violates the 10th Amendment!” you would not get whatever movement we are going to have. What we are seeing is because there are tens of thousands of people, ordinary citizens, ordinary folks who do not think of themselves as rabble-rousers or activists, who are appalled and who are waking up and are registering this in their moral voice: I will not allow this to happen. This is wrong and I’m gonna brave 20-below weather.

I love what you’re saying, because you are not, in fact, unbraiding the law from morality. You’re actually tethering them more closely together.

I don’t know what the folks who are out there in Minneapolis are thinking exactly. Whether they are defending legal rights or a thing they call the Fourth Amendment or the First Amendment. I don’t know whether they can recite the language of the Fourth Amendment. I don’t know whether some of them are making purely moral claims, that “This is an obscenity, and I’m not going to let this happen. You are murdering my neighbors. You are shooting my friends in the back. I’m not going to let you do that.” There may be some combination of both legal and moral claims here, because we are trained to think in legal terms. They may think: “I’m not going to let you do that, and the way I’m going to keep that from happening is to protest, and I’ve got a First Amendment right to protest.” We reflexively, unfortunately, think in these kinds of legal terms, but my point in this piece is that we let the dominance of law-speak gradually silence our moral voice.

You had another chillingly prescient piece in the Boston Review back in September of 2021, which feels like a million years ago. The title of the piece was “9/11 Forever.” The point was that our failure to reckon with the legacy of what happened to the law after 9/11 is absolutely the reason we are living in the slipstream of that today. If we had not been willing to tolerate the things we did to the law after 9/11 in the name of safety, or national security, what we tolerated in terms of torture and cruelty, and surveillance, and the conception of privacy that we gave away, and border security as this existential question about national survival. You wrote about all of those things as the price we were willing to pay to feel safe at the time. And a key element of that architecture was the notion that we were in a “war.” That the war on terror hoovered up the language of war instead of crime, and moved us into a world where as long as you could call it a “war,” everything would be OK. That’s the move?

That’s the move. And now in the Trump administration they have decided to declare war, which is just a rhetorical step, against an endless stream of “others.” None of the real horrors that took place post- 9/11, and those taking place now, could have been possible without a thorough embrace of demonization, without a willingness to cast some people outside the sphere of human regard. “We can do what we want with that person because they are not us. I do not see them in me. I do not see myself in them. ” That’s what demonization is. That’s the first move.

What the Bush administration did so well is to begin with that and then articulate a legal framework to justify it. Law-speak that says, “We don’t need to stop with this demonizing language. That can exist as the context, the background, but given that we all recognize that those who perpetrated this are not us and are monsters, we are allowed to do certain things, and here’s the law that shows it’s OK.”

Nobody is as good at demonizing as Donald Trump. He is the master of it. This is his worldview. “Those who are opposed to me are subhuman. They are not of my species.” Once you embrace the idea that there is a category of people whose existence threatens who I am, and that I can do whatever I want with them, and I call that war, or I call that terrorism—it doesn’t really matter what you call it, but you can always find a lawyer to cloak it in law. That’s the easiest part. The hard part is convincing people that the Mexican immigrant who has been your neighbor for 40 years and who makes your economy run, convincing people that that person is a monster. That’s the hard part, and that’s where his success is. And that’s 9/11 forever. That’s what they’ve achieved. The more you do this, the easier it gets. The more often you repeat this, the easier it becomes.

Not every example of this ends in the same place, but we all know where that dark alley ends. That dark alley ends in all the most vicious pogroms and genocides and holocausts that the world has ever known. They all start with this move. And this is what Trump is doing and he’s really good at it. And he’s got a lot of people who agree.

President Donald Trump on Monday escalated his rhetoric against the American electoral system, telling his former FBI deputy director and serial podcaster Dan Bongino that he wants to “nationalize” American elections in 15 “crooked” states. “These people were brought to our country to vote, and they vote illegally,” Trump said. “And it’s amazing the Republicans aren’t tougher on it. The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over, we should take over the voting in at least 15 places.’ ” I too used to think we should nationalize our elections, though not for the insane reasons Donald Trump offers. It is Trump himself who convinced me that I was wrong.

American elections are hyperdecentralized, as they are run on the state, and mostly county, level. States have ultimate responsibility for voter registration rolls, the kind of machinery used to conduct balloting, the rules for contesting elections, laws prescribing how candidates qualify to appear on the ballot, and much more. Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution provides that states, through their legislatures, get to set the times, places, and manners of conducting congressional elections, “but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.” Congress sometimes exercises that power to override state rules. For example, a federal statute requires that members of Congress are elected from single-member districts, not from larger districts where multiple members of Congress could be elected.

Given that authority in what is known as the “elections clause” of the Constitution, Congress could do much more to nationalize elections, for example setting uniform rules for voter registration, the approval of voting machinery, and potentially much more. For a long time I thought Congress should use that power to set up a system of national nonpartisan election administration. Indeed, that was the central argument in my 2012 book, The Voting Wars.

If you look around the world at advanced democracies from Australia to Canada, they have an independent governmental body in charge all national elections. The body imposes uniform standards for registration, ballot access, voting machinery, and much more. One can walk into a polling place in Ottawa or Vancouver and have virtually the same experience.

These nonpartisan election administrators are headed by a civil servant or group that does not answer to the government. They and their workers have allegiance to the integrity of the election system, not to any political actor. In contrast, in the United States partisan actors play important roles in our election process, such as secretaries of state who run for office as Democrats or Republicans.

In The Voting Wars, I argued that by joining other advanced democracies we could decrease the amount of partisan fighting and litigation over election rules, increase the competence of election administration, and assure we have a system run with integrity and fair access to voting.

Donald Trump has caused me to abandon this argument. As I wrote in the New York Times last summer, when the president tried to impose his authority over various aspects of American elections via an executive order: “What I had not factored into my thinking was that centralizing power over elections within the federal government could be dangerous in the hands of a president not committed to democratic principles.” At this point, American democracy is too weak and fragile to have centralized power over elections in the hands of a federal government that could be coerced or coopted by a president hell-bent, like Trump, on election subversion. Courts have ruled that parts of Trump’s executive order are unconstitutional because the president has no role to play in the administration of elections.

Trump’s comments on nationalizing elections ironically prove the point that we should not nationalize elections. He apparently wants to target the administration at blue states, doing who-knows-what to make it harder for people to vote for Democrats. He desperately fears a Congress controlled by Democrats that could check his and his administration’s power. As he did in 2020, when he unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the results of the fair presidential election that he lost to Joe Biden, Trump hangs it all on voter fraud. His comments to Bongino about noncitizens voting, just like his comments about mail-in balloting, show Trump as either a liar or delusional. The amount of election fraud of this type is extremely rare. We know it because states, including red ones like Georgia—where Trump’s administration recently raided election offices in a serious threat to the 2026 vote—have gone hunting for fraud and found very little.

The Supreme Court provides another reason for not nationalizing our elections. The court could soon fully embrace that “unitary executive” theory that there can be no exercise of executive power by the federal government that ultimately does not report to the president. (It’s an argument with an exception likely to be applied to the United States Federal Reserve, in order to protect the value of the justices’ 401(k)s.) The unitary executive theory, if adopted, would mean that presidential control over an election body might be constitutionally required. The Trump experience shows why that would be far too risky.

We should now look to states to step up the competence, integrity, and accessibility of their election systems. They serve as the front line against election subversion. Diffusion of power in the states makes it much harder for Trump to mess with the midterm elections. Whether or not the Framers intended it, our messy, decentralized, partly partisan, uneven system of administering elections turns out to be the best bulwark against would-be authoritarian presidents.

On Monday, the New York Times reported a bizarre and shocking update to news of an FBI raid last week on a Georgia election office: It turns out that immediately after the federal raid, the FBI officers involved spoke directly with President Donald Trump. To say that this is unusual would be an understatement—it is without precedent. It has long been known that the 2020 election in Georgia is a personal obsession of Trump’s, but the extent to which he is actively, openly, and personally meddling in the state’s elections system is still surprising and new. One big question looming over this entire episode, though, is why—of all the states where Trump falsely claimed there was fraud in 2020—has Georgia become ground zero for the president ahead of the 2026 midterms that election experts feel are potentially threatened by Trump’s latest actions? We think we have a few answers.

Those answers have to do as much with 2026 as they do with 2020. And, perhaps surprisingly, a big motivation for Trump’s assault on Georgia’s election infrastructure now has as much to do with the Republican primaries in the state as with November’s general election. Allow me to explain.

Georgia’s race for governor is considered a toss-up, though Republicans have consistently held the job since 2002. Polling has shown the top Republican contenders are Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones. Trump has endorsed Jones, who served as a fake elector in 2020 and was tied up in Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ election interference investigation, which charged Trump and several co-conspirators with a criminal conspiracy to steal Georgia’s 2020 election. Jones has focused his campaign on attacking Raffensperger over that election. Raffensperger, as you may recall, has been a longtime personal target of Trump’s after a 2021 phone call with the president in which he was asked to “find” 11,780 votes for Trump in order to flip the state’s 2020 election results.

In order to understand how the race between Rafensperger and Jones relates to the FBI’s raid on Fulton County, it’s necessary to recognize that Georgia’s voting system has been mired in controversy for nearly a decade. Back in 2017, a group of Georgia voters and the Coalition for Good Governance sued the state over its use of Dominion Voting Systems’ electronic ballot-marking devices. These devices are like a tablet and don’t create a paper copy of a voter’s ballot selections; instead they print a paper QR code that can be scanned to see a digital image of a ballot. This, the lawsuit alleged, opens up serious security vulnerabilities that can not only be hacked, but also make it nearly impossible to verify the software accurately recorded a voter’s ballot. When the lawsuit eventually went to trial in 2024, a computer scientist demonstrated live, in court, how he was able to rig Dominion’s voting tablet by rewriting its code and printing out as many ballots as he wanted. In a hypothetical election, the hacking was successful in flipping the outcome of a race.

During that trial, the plaintiffs also pointed to Georgia’s Coffee County data breach that occurred in 2021, where pro-Trump activists physically entered the small, rural county’s election office and copied election system software. A lawyer for the Coalition for Good Governance claimed at the time that the compromised software was not isolated to Coffee County, and that hackers could have access to voting software used in all 159 counties in Georgia. Plus in 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, under the Biden administration, also advised that Dominion’s electronic ballot-casting software presents security vulnerabilities. None of this validated Trump’s phony claims of election fraud in 2020, but it does make the state’s election systems more vulnerable to the sort of episode we witnessed last week.

Ultimately, the Coalition for Good Governance’s 2017 lawsuit failed, with a judge dismissing it just last year, partly because there wasn’t evidence to suggest there had actually been a successful hack of Georgia’s voting software and the state Legislature appeared to have remedied some of the security concerns the lawsuit raised. For instance, the Georgia Legislature approved a bill that would replace its previous QR code system with a readable text to verify a voter’s ballot entry. The new law is supposed to take effect July 1, 2026, though during a series of budget hearings last month, Georgia lawmakers didn’t appropriate any state dollars to implement the change. No budget was allocated to upgrade Georgia’s voting system software either, which would have patched any security holes.

While all of these legal challenges questioned the integrity of Georgia’s voting systems, Raffensperger consistently affirmed his state’s 2020 election results were accurate. His office conducted three separate recounts, including a statewide audit that manually re-tallied every single vote cast, plus another recount requested by the Trump campaign. In the end, Gov. Brian Kemp certified his state’s election results for Biden, though the president has continued to insist he is the rightful winner. As part of this vendetta, Trump even made Kemp and Raffensperger prime targets during the 2022 elections, trying to inspire his MAGA base to vote them both out of office. At the time, he failed miserably.

Now, though, it seems that Trump has found a new way to try to punish Raffensperger. The Trump administration is undoubtedly going to use the baggage surrounding Georgia’s voting system to cast doubt on its 2026 elections and possibly beyond, with the FBI’s recent raid evidence that this is already underway. Georgia provides a three-for-one, from the Trump perspective: He gets to again question the legitimacy of the 2020 election; he gets to again cast blame on Raffensperger, his 2020 antagonist in the state; and he gets to potentially meddle with an election which he desperately wants Raffensperger to lose.

The day after FBI agents raided Fulton County’s election office last week, officials there said federal agents took over 700 boxes of physical voter records, while officials were kept out of the room as it was happening. Fulton County Commission Chair Robb Pitts told reporters he had no clue what the FBI was going to do with all the information it seized. “I don’t know where they are, I don’t know who has them, I don’t know what they’re doing with it,” Pitts said. “I have no clue. I could use my imagination.”

It’s no small stretch of the imagination to foresee Trump’s FBI manipulating Fulton County’s voting records to fit his agenda. “What Trump is trying to do is create a narrative that you can’t trust the voting system in Georgia,” Marilyn Marks, vice president and executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, told Slate. “He’s going to be able to show these ballots that say they were counted wrong and they were cheated, and all of that: ‘You can’t trust Georgia’s voting system, therefore the feds have to come in and help control the voting system.’ ”

Right now Trump is beginning his attack on Georgia’s voting system by inserting federal action, knowing that in a few short months, the state will be holding its gubernatorial primary election on May 19. If Raffensperger secures a win, the White House will be on fertile ground to dispute the results of his election, leveraging information obtained from the FBI’s raid, plus the nearly decade-long legal challenges Georgia’s voting system has faced.

Another added benefit to Trump’s scheme is the threat to the state’s critical U.S. Senate race, where Democrat Jon Ossoff is running for reelection. Ossoff’s narrow win in a 2021 runoff gave Senate Democrats the slimmest majority at the start of Joe Biden’s presidency, while Trump took the brunt of the blame for the GOP defeat at the time. Constantly attacking the integrity of the 2020 election seemed to put voters off.

What ends up shaking out in Georgia remains to be seen, but it’s fair to say that the president is signaling that he is willing to use all the powers of the U.S. government to satisfy his vendetta against those he believes have wronged him. During his speech in Davos, Switzerland, last month, Trump ominously announced that “people will soon be prosecuted for what they did,” while again insisting that the 2020 presidential election he lost was rigged. And just this week, Trump, while speaking on a podcast hosted by former U.S. Deputy Director of the FBI Dan Bongino, openly admitted that he believes Republicans “ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that I won that show I didn’t win. You’re gonna see something in Georgia.”

As someone deeply familiar with the inner workings of Trump’s mind, former special counsel Jack Smith, said during his Congressional testimony last month, Georgia was “ground zero” for the president’s alleged criminal misconduct just five years ago. It could be so again this November.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has launched a probe into Elon Musk’s xAI, after its Grok chatbot produced sexual images of real people, without their consent.

ICO sent xAI a “please explain” note in early January. The regulator hasn’t yet said how, or if, Elon Musk’s AI outfit responded. But on Tuesday the regulator escalated by opening a formal investigation.

“Our investigation will assess whether XIUC and X.AI have complied with data protection law in the development and deployment of the Grok services, including the safeguards in place to protect people’s data rights,” said ICO executive director for regulatory risk and innovation William Malcolm, in a canned statement. “Where we find obligations have not been met, we will take action to protect the public.&quot;

Also on Tuesday, UK communications regulator Offcom announced “We continue to demand answers from xAI about the risks it poses,” but is still “examining whether to launch an investigation into its compliance with the rules requiring services that publish pornographic material to use highly effective age checks to prevent children from accessing that content.”

While the UK’s regulators wrung their hands, Spain’s prime minister Pedro Sánchez took to the stage of the World Governments Summit annual meeting and delivered a speech [PDF] in which he described social media as “a failed state” and “a place where laws are ignored and crime is endured. Where disinformation is worth more than truth, and half of users suffer hate speech. A failed state in which algorithms distort the public conversation and our data and images are defied and sold.”

He cited Grok’s ability to create sexualized images as another example of social networks failing, and called out Elon Musk for amplifying disinformation about a recent Spanish government decision to create a pathway to obtain residency permits for over 500,000 undocumented migrants.

Sánchez said his government will respond with a ban on children under 16 using social media, laws that make social media executives responsible for illegal acts on the platforms they manage, and criminalize algorithmic manipulation and amplification of illegal content.

The PM said hateful content online is “invisible and untraceable” and pledged to create a tool to expose its sources and use it to inform investigations conducted by Spain’s public prosecutor. Sánchez named Grok, TikTok and Instagram as the targets of those investigations.

Musk later used his X account to describe Sánchez as “a tyrant and a traitor” and a “fascist totalitarian.”

And he wonders why governments in France, Australia, the EU, Canada, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia have a problem with his platform. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-04</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’re brave enough to want to run the demonstrably insecure AI assistant OpenClaw, several clouds have already started offering it as a service.

OpenClaw, the name its developer Peter Steinberger settled on after changing from Clawdbot to Moltbot, is a platform for AI agents. Users can provide it with their credentials to various online services and prompt OpenClaw to operate them by issuing instructions in messaging apps like Telegram or WhatsApp. Steinberger says it “clears your inbox, sends emails, manages your calendar, checks you in for flights.”

Using OpenClaw’s AI features requires access to an AI model, either by connecting to an API or by running one locally. The latter possibility apparently sparked a rush to buy Apple’s $599 Mac Mini.

OpenClaw is new and largely untested – just the sort of workload that cloud operators have long said they excel at hosting so users can gather some experience before moving to production.

Clouds were therefore quick to develop OpenClaw-as-a-service oferings.

China’s Tencent Cloud was an early mover, last week delivering a one-click install tool for its Lighthouse service – an offering that allows users to deploy a small server and install an app or environment and run it for a few dollars a month.

DigitalOcean delivered a similar set of instructions a couple of days later, and aimed them at its Droplets IaaS offering.

Alibaba Cloud launched its offering today and made it available in 19 regions, starting at $4/month, and using its simple application server – its equivalent of Lighthouse or Droplets. Interestingly, the Chinese giant says it will soon offer OpenClaw on its Elastic Compute Service – its full-fat IaaS equivalent to AWS EC2 – and on its Elastic Desktop Service, suggesting the chance to rent a cloudy PC to run an AI assistant.

Analyst firm Gartner has used uncharacteristically strong language to recommend against using OpenClaw.

In new advice titled “OpenClaw Agentic Productivity Comes With Unacceptable Cybersecurity Risk,” the firm describes the software as “a dangerous preview of agentic AI, demonstrating high utility but exposing enterprises to ‘insecure by default’ risks like plaintext credential storage.”

“Shadow deployment of OpenClaw creates single points of failure, as compromised hosts expose API keys, OAuth tokens, and sensitive conversations to attackers,” the firm adds, before recommending that businesses should immediately block OpenClaw downloads and traffic and stop traffic to the software.

Next, search for any users accessing OpenClaw and tell them to stop because using the software probably involves breaching security controls.

If you must run it, Gartner recommends doing so only in isolated nonproduction virtual machines with throwaway credentials.

“It is not enterprise software. There is no promise of quality, no vendor support, no SLA… it ships without authentication enforced by default. It is not a SaaS product that you can manage via a corporate admin panel,” Gartner advises.

The firm also recommends rotating any credentials OpenClaw touches, as the AI tool’s use of plaintext storage and shabby security mean there’s a chance malefactors can use the login details for evil. So maybe don’t rush to use those cloudy OpenClaw services at work? Or anywhere? ®

            <h2>For once, Supermicro has dodged drama and just delivered datacenters</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/04/for_once_supermicro_has_dodged/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In recent years, Supermicro’s regulatory filings often have delivered dramas such as losing its listing on the NASDAQ stock exchange, an admission its books may not be accurate, another possible delisting, and missing the AI boom.

On Tuesday, the company delivered something pleasingly different: a no-dramas update in which it reported that AI infrastructure builders are queuing up to buy its products with pens poised over chequebooks, and revenue is therefore growing fast.

In its report on Q2 2026 revenue, Supermicro revealed $12.7 billion revenue, $7 billion up from Q2 2025 and $7.7 billion higher than Q1’s haul.

GPU-based systems used for AI applications delivered 84 percent of Q2 revenue, up up 151 percent year-over-year, and accounted for 90 percent of revenue.

A single un-named customer delivered 63 percent of revenue, but founder, CEO and president Charles Liang said Supermicro has won comparable clients and isn’t worried it’s too reliant on a single buyer. “We are very happy that now we have many more large-scale customers,” he said.

Gross margins fell to 6.3 percent, an outcome Liang attributed in part to the need to pay top dollar to transport new Nvidia Blackwell parts to Supermicro’s factories. Liang said those costs will ease, and that tariffs have also become less of a concern.

The CEO thinks better days lie ahead, because builders of AI infrastructure are in a hurry to bring their systems online and Supermicro’s Data Center Building Block Solutions (DCBBS) offering – a modular system that sees the company deliver racked-and-ready-to-run compute, storage, networking, power, and cooling systems – is designed for fast implementation. Liang said DCBBS accounted for just four percent of Q2 revenue, but said it is the company’s big growth prospect, and Supermicro is therefore developing new modules including transformers, next-generation power generators, an energy backup device, and grid power replacement.

Supermicro has four new factories ramping up, and Liang said they’ll help to meet demand for DCBBS and to reduce costs.

The CEO forecast Q3 revenue of $12.3 billion, and full year revenue of “at least $40 billion.” That figure suggests Q4 revenue could be just $10 billion, a dip he didn’t explain but which didn’t spook investors who sent Supermicro’s share price up 6.5 percent in after-hours trading. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Usually diversity is a sign of a healthy and resilient business. But for the folks on Wall Street, the breadth of AMD&#39;s portfolio is a bug, not a feature – one that sent the House of Zen&#39;s share price down by more than eight percent in after hours trading on Tuesday.

AMD’s scrip slipped despite the company delivering solid Q4 results, with net income surging 213 percent to $1.5 billion on revenues that grew 34 percent year-over-year to reach $10.27 billion. Datacenter and client products both delivered revenue growth, at 39 and 37 percent to $5.4 billion and $3.9 billion respectively. By comparison, the company&#39;s embedded gains were far more modest, with FPGA sales up about three percent for the quarter.

The company forecast revenue will dip to $9.8 billion for Q1 of FY 2026. That figure will represent 32 percent growth, and reflect seasonal weakness in its PC, gaming, and embedded divisions that will offset growing datacenter and AI revenue.

The result is a bit of a catch-22 for AMD. On one hand, the seasonal decline means its datacenter division is doing most of the heavy lifting at a time when fears of an AI bubble are at an all-time high. On the other, AMD&#39;s Q1 growth trajectory could have been even stronger if the rest of the company weren&#39;t weighing it down.

Yet a seasonal dip is nothing nasty for AMD, because PC sales tend to dry up following the holiday season. Meanwhile, demand for AMD&#39;s semi-custom chips used in Microsoft&#39;s Xbox and Sony&#39;s PlayStation have all but dried up because it’s been years since the gaming giants released new consoles.

One phenomenon that could complicate things for AMD headed into the 2026 fiscal year is the ongoing memory shortage. Over the past few months memory prices have more than tripled, with analysts this week warning prices could double again in the first quarter.

Despite this, CEO Lisa Su remains confident AMD can grow its PC business in 2025 by prioritizing the enterprise and high-end PC segments. &quot;Our focus areas are enterprise. That&#39;s a place where we&#39;re making very nice progress in 2025 and we expect that into 2026,&quot; she said.

High-end systems tend to sell in smaller volumes but at higher margins than mainstream PC platforms.

Su is less concerned about a shortage of memory impacting the company&#39;s growing GPU business. &quot;Given the lead times for things like HBM and wafers… we&#39;re working closely with our suppliers over a multi-year timeframe in terms of what we see in demand,&quot; she told analysts.

Much like Nvidia&#39;s Blackwell and Rubin GPUs, AMD&#39;s Instinct accelerators make use of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) which has to be co-packaged alongside the compute logic.

&quot;Independent of the current market conditions, we&#39;ve been planning for a significant ramp in both our CPU as well as our GPU business over the past, you know, couple of years,&quot; Su added. ®

            <h2>VS Code for Linux may be secretly hoarding trashed files</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-04</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/04/vs_code_for_linux_trash_fail/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Linux users who installed Microsoft&#39;s Visual Studio Code as a Snap package may want to check to see whether files they sent to the trash with the app have actually been deleted.

A handful of Linux-based developers have found large amounts of supposedly deleted data on their computers, in some cases consuming hundreds of gigabytes of storage.

The reason for this is Snap – a Linux application packaging format – creates a local Trash folder for each VS Code version, one that&#39;s separate from the system-managed Trash, according to a VS Code bug report dating back to November 11, 2024.

Not only that, but Snap keeps older versions of VS Code after updates, potentially multiplying the number of local Trash folders and the trashed-but-not-deleted files therein. Emptying the system Trash folder doesn&#39;t affect the local instances.

Neither VS Code nor Snap offers a way to manage these local trash folders, though this can be achieved with the command line.

The root cause of the mess, according to a Microsoft engineer, is an unfixed VSCode change from October 11, 2024, that sets the XDG_DATA_HOME environment variable equal to $SNAP_USER_DATA/.local/share.

&quot;This creates a bogus Trash that&#39;s not the system one, and as such is unmanageable (and is carried over from update to update, gradually inflating),&quot; the bug report explains.

The bug may also cause issues beyond unexpected file retention, including messing up fish terminal history, interfering with uv Python installations, and Jupyter Notebook problems, among others.

Robotics engineer Iván López Broceño reports finding almost 200 GB of files that he believed he deleted.

Web developer Chris Hayes said in the discussion thread that he found 44 GB of files in Snap&#39;s local Trash folder dating back two years.

Asked whether it&#39;s unusual for a bug like this to linger unfixed for more than a year, Hayes via email replied, &quot;I&#39;d say this is unusual when the risk is that the user can totally run out of space on their machine. In fact, that&#39;s how I first discovered it. I was running out of space, I pulled open Ubuntu&#39;s &#39;Disk Usage&#39; and was pretty confused by how much space the VS Code snap was using.&quot;

Hayes, however, said he could understand how a bug like this might get lost in a massive repo like VS Code, which has 12,000+ open issues.

He added that the number of Linux VSCode users using Snap is probably not all that small. Snap, he said, the default for the Ubuntu App Store, though the default for VS Code is .deb for Linux users rather than Snap.

&quot;I feel like a lot of people don&#39;t know about this because either they haven&#39;t run out of space or they didn&#39;t dig into their disk space usage,&quot; he said.

&quot;The only other thing I&#39;d add is running out of space on Linux can do some weird stuff, since Linux is so dependent on files for running everything. So, while this isn&#39;t a security vulnerability, it feels like it&#39;s getting lost in the sauce for something that can very much break your Linux machine. Not too long ago I was booting into a USB Linux to restore a corrupted file system on my desktop, it was probably for unrelated reasons, but it can definitely be a problem.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI agents and other systems can&#39;t yet conduct cyberattacks fully on their own - but they can help criminals in many stages of the attack chain, according to the International AI Safety report.

The second annual report, chaired by the Canadian computer scientist Yoshua Bengio and authored by more than 100 experts across 30 countries, found that over the past year, developers of AI systems have vastly improved their ability to help automate and perpetrate cyberattacks.

Perhaps the best, and scariest, evidence of that finding appeared in Anthropic&#39;s November 2025 report about Chinese cyberspies abusing its Claude Code AI tool to automate most elements of attacks directed at around 30 high-profile companies and government organizations. Those attacks succeeded in &quot;a small number of cases.&quot;

&quot;At least one real-world incident has involved the use of semi-autonomous cyber capabilities, with humans intervening only at critical decision points,&quot; according to the AI safety report. &quot;Fully autonomous end-to-end attacks, however, have not been reported.&quot;

Two areas where AI is especially useful to criminals are scanning for software vulnerabilities and writing malicious code.

During DARPA&#39;s AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) – a two-year competition in which teams built AI models to find vulnerabilities in open source software that undergirds critical infrastructure – finalist systems autonomously identified 77 percent of the synthetic vulnerabilities used in the final scoring round, according to competition organizers.

And while that is an example of defenders using AI to find and fix vulnerabilities, rather than attackers using AI to find and exploit them, criminals are using models in similar ways. Last northern summer, we saw attackers on underground forums claiming to use HexStrike AI, an open-source red-teaming tool, to target critical vulnerabilities in Citrix NetScaler appliances within hours of the vendor disclosing the problems.

Additionally, AI systems are getting much better at malware writing, and criminals can trade weaponized models that write ransomware and data-stealing code for as little as $50 a month.

The good news for now, according to the report’s authors, is that AI systems still aren&#39;t great at carrying out multi-stage attacks without human help.

&quot;Research suggests that autonomous attacks remain limited because AI systems cannot reliably execute long, multi-stage attack sequences,&quot; according to the report. &quot;For example, failures they exhibit include executing irrelevant commands, losing track of operational state, and failing to recover from simple errors without human intervention.&quot;

Keep in mind, however, that this all was written before the security dumpster fire that is OpenClaw – the AI agent previously known as Moltbot and Clawdbot – and Moltbook, the vibe-coded social media platform for AI agents.

So it&#39;s also entirely plausible that the world won&#39;t end with a sophisticated, autonomous multi-stage cyberattack dreamed up by a nation-state crew or criminal mastermind, but rather a single agent that goes off the rails. ®

It won’t get new features, but it will still be available.

Adobe is no longer planning to discontinue Adobe Animate on March 1st. In an FAQ, the company now says that Animate will now be in maintenance mode and that it has “no plans to discontinue or remove access” to the app. Animate will still receive “ongoing security and bug fixes” and will still be available for “both new and existing users,” but it won’t get new features.

Many creators expressed frustration after Adobe’s original discontinuation announcement from Monday (here’s a Wayback Machine link), and the application is still used by creators like David Firth, the person behind the animated web series Salad Fingers. Now, Adobe says that “We are committed to ensuring Animate users always have access to their content regardless of the state of development of the application.”

An announcement email that went out to Adobe Animate customers about the discontinuation did “not meet our standards and caused a lot of confusion and angst within the community,” according to a Reddit post from Adobe community team member Mike Chambers.

Animate will be available in maintenance mode “indefinitely” to “individual, small business, and enterprise customers,” according to Adobe. Before the change, Adobe said that non-enterprise customers could access Animate and download content until March 1st, 2027, while enterprise customers had until March 1st, 2029.

            <div id="article-text">One Republican senator accused Netflix of creating the ‘wokest content in the history of the world.’

One Republican senator accused Netflix of creating the ‘wokest content in the history of the world.’

Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos was launched into the middle of a congressional culture war on Tuesday as he testified before a Senate subcommittee about the company’s attempt to buy a large part of Warner Bros Discovery.

The hearing before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee highlighted an array of traditional merger concerns on both sides of the aisle: that the deal could potentially raise costs for consumers, limit their theater experiences, or shrink the market for entertainment jobs. But a large chunk of the session also focused on Netflix’s allegedly “woke” programming, including content that features transgender characters.

Netflix is facing a competing bid from Paramount Skydance, run by CEO David Ellison, the son of President Donald Trump’s close ally and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. WBD has rejected Paramount’s offer, but Republicans are pushing to knock Netflix out of the running.

“Why in the world would we give a seal of approval or a thumbs up to make you the largest behemoth on the planet related to content?” Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) asked. “It seems as though you have engaged in creating not only a monopoly of content, potentially, but the wokest content in the history of the world.”

After subcommittee Ranking Member Cory Booker (D-NJ) began his questioning following Schmitt by saying he’d get back to the topic of antitrust, Sen. Ashley Moody (R-FL) countered that the question of content was relevant to the topic at hand. “If there are folks across America who are already struggling with their limited options,” she said to the executives, “you’re proposing you become even larger, and I am just saying maybe that shouldn’t have been a joke, ‘let’s get back to antitrust,’ let’s truly talk about whether there are going to be options.”

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) made a hard pivot from his questioning on whether Netflix would commit to using union labor and pay residuals on streaming content to ask, “Why is it that so much of Netflix content for children promotes a transgender ideology?” Hawley alleged that “almost half” of its content for minor children, excluding older teens, “promotes a transgender ideology agenda.” Sarandos said he didn’t know where that alleged number came from, and said that “Netflix has no political agenda of any kind.”

The French film Cuties featured heavily at the hearing as an example of oversexualized kids content. The movie, which was created as a commentary on the sexualization of young girls and Sarandos said is rated for mature audiences, not kids, became a symbol of Netflix’s alleged ideologically-driven library. Billionaire and Trump backer Elon Musk previously led a campaign against Netflix over shows like Dead End: Paranormal Park and The Baby-Sitters Club for featuring trans characters. GOP lawmakers also pointed to Netflix’s staff’s primarily Democratic-leaning political donations and content featuring LGBTQ+ characters as other examples of its bias.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) asked Sarandos and WBD Chief Revenue and Strategy Officer Bruce Campbell if they’d watched the Grammys this weekend (only Sarandos caught the “tail end”). “Are we right now on stolen land?” Cruz asked pointedly, referencing artist Billie Eilish’s speech opposing ICE, where she said, “no one is illegal on stolen land.” Both said they didn’t know. (The Grammys were broadcast on CBS, which is owned by Paramount Skydance.)

Ellison declined an invitation to attend the hearing because he believed it wouldn’t be helpful given the circumstances, Booker said. But Ellison met with lawmakers privately, and Booker described his conversation with him as “fruitful.” Paramount’s bid could raise some of the same concerns as Netflix’s, but Ellison’s father’s close tie to President Donald Trump would potentially assuage some of the content concerns for Republicans, and raise them for Democrats.

Booker raised deep concerns about whether any transaction would be reviewed fairly by independent enforcers under the Trump administration. Sarandos admitted he’d met with Trump shortly before the deal was announced, but that the deal was not discussed in detail and was not the primary purpose of the conversation. “I do not trust this administration in their evaluations, and I just pray to God that everything that you all hope might come should this move forward, that you all attested to, comes to pass,” Booker said.

AMD says it’s ready to support Microsoft launching its next Xbox as soon as next year.

Microsoft confirmed last year that it’s working on a next-gen Xbox console in partnership with AMD. Now, AMD is hinting that the next Xbox console, which will use custom AMD chips, could be launching in 2027.

“Development of Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox, featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC, is progressing well to support a launch in 2027,” said AMD CEO Lisa Su on an earnings call today. The brief comment doesn’t confirm Microsoft will launch a new Xbox in 2027, but it does reveal that AMD is ready to support a launch then if Microsoft is also ready.

Microsoft entered a “strategic multi-year partnership” with AMD last year that includes the pair co-engineering silicon “across a portfolio of devices — including our next-generation Xbox consoles in your living room and in your hands.” AMD and Microsoft are also working together to build the next generation of Xbox Cloud Gaming servers.

Microsoft has been teasing that the next-gen Xbox will be some type of hybrid console and PC, with the Xbox Ally devices serving as the initial groundwork towards this end goal. “The next-gen console is going to be a very premium, very high-end curated experience,” said Xbox president Sarah Bond in October.

Microsoft hasn’t put a date on its next-gen Xbox, and documents that leaked as part of the FTC v. Microsoft case originally pointed towards a potential 2028 release. Those documents, which don’t reflect current plans anymore, mentioned using a custom AMD CPU as well as a co-designed AMD GPU.

Google filed its own appeal in the case last month.﻿

On Tuesday, the Department of Justice and the plaintiffs in the antitrust case against Google filed a cross-appeal, as the DOJ Antitrust Division announced in a post on X: “Today, the DOJ Antitrust Division filed notice that it will cross-appeal from the remedies decisions in its case against Google’s unlawful monopolization of internet search and search advertising.”

Just a few weeks ago, Google itself filed a notice to appeal and requested a pause on the remedies ordered by DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta last year. Those remedies included requiring Google to share search data with its rivals and barring Google from making exclusive distribution deals for its search or AI products that could hinder distribution for competitors. However, Google was ultimately not required to sell its Chrome browser and wasn’t barred from paying distribution partners for preloading or premium placement of its search or AI products.

The DOJ’s cross-appeal suggests that neither party is fully satisfied with Judge Mehta’s ruling in the case, or at least the remedies ordered in September.

After triggering an influx of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, right-wing provocateur Nick Shirley is reportedly trying the same stunt in San Diego.

After right-wing YouTuber Nick Shirley’s viral video alleging fraud at Minnesota daycares he said were operated by Somali residents, Donald Trump’s administration responded by flooding the state with federal immigration agents and freezing funding for childcare services. (A judge ruled that the federal government must continue funding childcare subsidies, at least temporarily.) Now Shirley is back loitering outside daycares again, this time in California.

Over the weekend the 23-year-old posted a photo of himself with the caption “Hello California I’ve arrived.” Like with his last video, which featured a “source” later identified by The Intercept as a far-right onetime political candidate and lobbyist, Shirley seems to have had a local tour guide: Amy Reichert, a San Diego right-wing activist who unsuccessfully ran for local election. She said on X that she spent two days with Shirley “checking out learning centers” in the city. An accompanying image appears to show the two of them — a tripod-mounted phone in tow — outside a business.

Shirley’s playbook is essentially to pull public records on licensed childcare facilities, looking for citations or reports from state inspectors that he or his “sources” deem suspicious. He then physically visits daycare facilities and, in the case of the Minneapolis video, demands to “see the children” in the provider’s care. In Minneapolis, a refusal to let Shirley and his team into daycares was taken as evidence that the business was a sham — a claim unsupported by follow-up visits. (Perhaps a good daycare should not allow a random YouTuber near its kids?) Subsequent visits by state inspectors found that children were present at the daycares Shirley visited and that they were “operating as expected.”

Even though Shirley hasn’t yet published a video about San Diego, local childcare providers have already reported harassment. One provider told a local news outlet that she came home with children in her care only to find two men with a camera outside her house who finally left when she entered with the children.

“For over a month, Somali childcare providers have endured harassment by internet vigilantes who are dead set on exposing fraud in California’s highly regulated government child care system,” Doug Moore, executive director of United Domestic Workers of America said in a statement on Tuesday. “In the process, they are stalking and intimidating our members at their homes and places of business. These provocateurs are sowing seeds of hatred and distrust of our neighbors after taking cues from the president who referred to Somalians as ‘garbage.’ We treasure our Somali members and their contributions to our families, our union, and our communities.”

Shirley’s online presence is as much MAGA propaganda as it is algorithm bait — I described him last week as a “slopagandist” similar to yellow journalism of the late 19th century, updated for the influencer age. His content is repetitive, with rehashed video titles and recurring themes and filming locations. Unlike a true ideologue, Shirley will go wherever the audience analytics take him. At the moment, the algorithm is taking him to childcare centers.

﻿The game had already been delayed from a planned October 2025 release date.

Development on the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 is on “pause,” according to a statement from a Take-Two spokesperson given to Variety.

“We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU,” Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis said in the statement published by Variety. “Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game. We’re continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have ‘PGA Tour 2K25’ coming out and ‘WWE 2K26’ [for Switch 2], and we’re incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to that platform in the future.”

The Switch 2’s version of Borderlands 4 was originally announced during Nintendo’s big Switch 2 Direct last April. It had an October 3rd release date before being delayed just days before the planned launch.

Take-Two, which owns Borderlands 4 developer Gearbox, is making the announcement of the pause alongside its Q3 FY 2026 earnings. On Take-Two’s future games lineup included in an earnings press release, Grand Theft Auto VI is still listed for November 19th, 2026. Launch marketing for the game is set to begin this summer, so perhaps it actually won’t be delayed again. The lineup also includes “TBA” launch dates for Judas, which was officially announced in 2022, and the “next iteration” of the BioShock series, which has had a troubled development.

Additionally, Take-Two says that Grand Theft Auto V, which launched in 2013, has sold more than 225 million units so far.

What we’ve been getting wrong about AI’s truth crisis

            <div id="article-text">In a pine forest on Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the only active nickel mine in the US is nearing the end of its life. At a time when carmakers want the metal for electric-vehicle batteries, nickel concentration at Eagle Mine is falling and could soon drop too low to warrant digging.

But earlier this year, the mine’s owner started testing a new process that could eke out a bit more nickel. In a pair of shipping containers recently installed at the mine’s mill, a fermentation-derived broth developed by the startup Allonnia is mixed with concentrated ore to capture and remove impurities. The process allows nickel production from lower-quality ore.

Kent Sorenson, Allonnia’s chief technology officer, says this approach could help companies continue operating sites that, like Eagle Mine, have burned through their best ore. “The low-hanging fruit is to keep mining the mines that we have,” he says.

Demand for nickel, copper, and rare earth elements is rapidly increasing amid the explosive growth of metal-intensive data centers, electric cars, and renewable energy projects. But producing these metals is becoming harder and more expensive because miners have already exploited the best resources. Like the age-old technique of rolling up the end of a toothpaste tube, Allonnia’s broth is one of a number of ways that biotechnology could help miners squeeze more metal out of aging mines, mediocre ore, or piles of waste.

The mining industry has intentionally seeded copper ore with microbes for decades. At current copper bioleaching sites, miners pile crushed copper ore into heaps and add sulfuric acid. Acid-loving bacteria like Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans colonize the mound. A chemical the organisms produce breaks the bond between sulfur and copper molecules to liberate the metal.

Until now, beyond maintaining the acidity and blowing air into the heap, there wasn’t much more miners could do to encourage microbial growth. But Elizabeth Dennett, CEO of the startup Endolith, says the decreasing cost of genetic tools is making it possible to manage the communities of microbes in a heap more actively. “The technology we’re using now didn’t exist a few years ago,” she says.

Endolith analyzes bits of DNA and RNA in the copper-rich liquid that flows out of an ore heap to characterize the microbes living inside. Combined with a suite of chemical analyses, the information helps the company determine which microbes to sprinkle on a heap to optimize extraction.

In lab tests on ore from the mining firm BHP, Endolith’s active techniques outperformed passive bioleaching approaches. In November, the company raised $16.5 million to move from its Denver lab to heaps in active mines.

Despite these promising early results, Corale Brierley, an engineer who has worked on metal bioleaching systems since the 1970s, questions whether companies like Endolith that add additional microbes to ore will successfully translate their processes to commercial scales. “What guarantees are you going to give the company that those organisms will actually grow?” Brierley asks.

Big mining firms that have already optimized every hose, nut, and bolt in their process won’t be easy to convince either, says Diana Rasner, an analyst covering mining technology for the research firm Cleantech Group.

“They are acutely aware of what it takes to scale these technologies because they know the industry,” she says. “They’ll be your biggest supporters, but they’re going to be your biggest critics.”

In addition to technical challenges, Rasner points out that venture-capital-backed biotechnology startups will struggle to deliver the quick returns their investors seek. Mining companies want lots of data before adopting a new process, which could take years of testing to compile. “This is not software,” Rasner says.

Nuton, a subsidiary of the mining giant Rio Tinto, is a good example. The company has been working for decades on a copper bioleaching process that uses a blend of archaea and bacteria strains, plus some chemical additives. But it started demonstrating the technology only late last year, at a mine in Arizona.

While Endolith and Nuton use naturally occurring microbes, the startup 1849 is hoping to achieve a bigger performance boost by genetically engineering microbes.

“You can do what mining companies have traditionally done,” says CEO Jai Padmakumar. “Or you can try to take the moonshot bet and engineer them. If you get that, you have a huge win.”

Genetic engineering would allow 1849 to tailor its microbes to the specific challenges facing a customer. But engineering organisms can also make them harder to grow, warns Buz Barstow, a Cornell University microbiologist who studies applications for biotechnology in mining.

Other companies are trying to avoid that trade-off by applying the products of microbial fermentation, rather than live organisms. Alta Resource Technologies, which closed a $28 million investment round in December, is engineering microbes that make proteins capable of extracting and separating rare earth elements. Similarly, the startup REEgen, based in Ithaca, New York, relies on the organic acids produced by an engineered strain of Gluconobacter oxydans to extract rare earth elements from ore and from waste materials like metal recycling slag, coal ash, or old electronics. “The microbes are the manufacturing,” says CEO Alexa Schmitz, an alumna of Barstow’s lab.

To make a dent in the growing demand for metal, this new wave of biotechnologies will have to go beyond copper and gold, says Barstow. In 2024, he started a project to map out genes that could be useful for extracting and separating a wider range of metals. Even with the challenges ahead, he says, biotechnology has the potential to transform mining the way fracking changed natural gas. “Biomining is one of these areas where the need … is big enough,” he says.

The challenge will be moving fast enough to keep up with growing demand.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

Omar Yaghi thinks crystals with gaps that capture moisture could bring technology from “Dune” to the arid parts of Earth.

And why many scientists are freaked out about the first serious for-profit company moving into the solar geoengineering field.

            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

What would it take to convince you that the era of truth decay we were long warned about—where AI content dupes us, shapes our beliefs even when we catch the lie, and erodes societal trust in the process—is now here? A story I published last week pushed me over the edge. It also made me realize that the tools we were sold as a cure for this crisis are failing miserably.

On Thursday, I reported the first confirmation that the US Department of Homeland Security, which houses immigration agencies, is using AI video generators from Google and Adobe to make content that it shares with the public. The news comes as immigration agencies have flooded social media with content to support President Trump&#39;s mass deportation agenda—some of which appears to be made with AI (like a video about “Christmas after mass deportations”).

But I received two types of reactions from readers that may explain just as much about the epistemic crisis we’re in.

One was from people who weren’t surprised, because on January 22 the White House had posted a digitally altered photo of a woman arrested at an ICE protest, one that made her appear hysterical and in tears. Kaelan Dorr, the White House’s deputy communications director, did not respond to questions about whether the White House altered the photo but wrote, “The memes will continue.”

The second was from readers who saw no point in reporting that DHS was using AI to edit content shared with the public, because news outlets were apparently doing the same. They pointed to the fact that the news network MS Now (formerly MSNBC) shared an image of Alex Pretti that was AI-edited and appeared to make him look more handsome, a fact that led to many viral clips this week, including one from Joe Rogan’s podcast. Fight fire with fire, in other words? A spokesperson for MS Now told Snopes that the news outlet aired the image without knowing it was edited.

There is no reason to collapse these two cases of altered content into the same category, or to read them as evidence that truth no longer matters. One involved the US government sharing a clearly altered photo with the public and declining to answer whether it was intentionally manipulated; the other involved a news outlet airing a photo it should have known was altered but taking some steps to disclose the mistake.

What these reactions reveal instead is a flaw in how we were collectively preparing for this moment. Warnings about the AI truth crisis revolved around a core thesis: that not being able to tell what is real will destroy us, so we need tools to independently verify the truth. My two grim takeaways are that these tools are failing, and that while vetting the truth remains essential, it is no longer capable on its own of producing the societal trust we were promised.

For example, there was plenty of hype in 2024 about the Content Authenticity Initiative, cofounded by Adobe and adopted by major tech companies, which would attach labels to content disclosing when it was made, by whom, and whether AI was involved. But Adobe applies automatic labels only when the content is wholly AI-generated. Otherwise the labels are opt-in on the part of the creator.

And platforms like X, where the altered arrest photo was posted, can strip content of such labels anyway (a note that the photo was altered was added by users). Platforms can also simply not choose to show the label at all.

Noticing how much traction the White House’s photo got even after it was shown to be AI-altered, I was struck by the findings of a very relevant new paper published in the journal Communications Psychology. In the study, participants watched a deepfake “confession” to a crime, and the researchers found that even when they were told explicitly that the evidence was fake, participants relied on it when judging an individual’s guilt. In other words, even when people learn that the content they’re looking at is entirely fake, they remain emotionally swayed by it.

“Transparency helps, but it isn’t enough on its own,” the disinformation expert Christopher Nehring wrote recently about the study’s findings. “We have to develop a new masterplan of what to do about deepfakes.”

AI tools to generate and edit content are getting more advanced, easier to operate, and cheaper to run—all reasons why the US government is increasingly paying to use them. We were well warned of this, but we responded by preparing for a world in which the main danger was confusion. What we’re entering instead is a world in which influence survives exposure, doubt is easily weaponized, and establishing the truth does not serve as a reset button. And the defenders of truth are already trailing way behind.

Update: This story was updated on February 2 with details about how Adobe applies its content authenticity labels. A previous version of this story said content credentials were not visible on the Pentagon’s DVIDS website. The labels are present but require clicking through and hovering on individual images. The reference has been removed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Many organizations rushed into generative AI, only to see pilots fail to deliver value. Now, companies want measurable outcomes—but how do you design for success?

At Mistral AI, we partner with global industry leaders to co-design tailored AI solutions that solve their most difficult problems. Whether it’s increasing CX productivity with Cisco, building a more intelligent car with Stellantis, or accelerating product innovation with ASML, we start with open frontier models and customize AI systems to deliver impact for each company’s unique challenges and goals.

Our methodology starts by identifying an iconic use case, the foundation for AI transformation that sets the blueprint for future AI solutions. Choosing the right use case can mean the difference between true transformation and endless tinkering and testing.

Mistral AI has four criteria that we look for in a use case: strategic, urgent, impactful, and feasible.

First, the use case must be strategically valuable, addressing a core business process or a transformative new capability. It needs to be more than an optimization; it needs to be a gamechanger. The use case needs to be strategic enough to excite an organization’s C-suite and board of directors.

For example, use cases like an internal-facing HR chatbot are nice to have, but they are easy to solve and are not enabling any new innovation or opportunities. On the other end of the spectrum, imagine an externally facing banking assistant that can not only answer questions, but also help take actions like blocking a card, placing trades, and suggesting upsell/cross-sell opportunities. This is how a customer-support chatbot is turned into a strategic revenue-generating asset.

Second, the best use case to move forward with should be highly urgent and solve a business-critical problem that people care about right now. This project will take time out of people’s days—it needs to be important enough to justify that time investment. And it needs to help business users solve immediate pain points.

Third, the use case should be pragmatic and impactful. From day one, our shared goal with our customers is to deploy into a real-world production environment to enable testing the solution with real users and gather feedback. Many AI prototypes end up in the graveyard of fancy demos that are not good enough to put in front of customers, and without any scaffolding to evaluate and improve. We work with customers to ensure prototypes are stable enough to release, and that they have the necessary support and governance frameworks.

Finally, the best use case is feasible. There may be several urgent projects, but choosing one that can deliver a quick return on investment helps to maintain the momentum needed to continue and scale.

This means looking for a project that can be in production within three months—and a prototype can be live within a few weeks. It’s important to get a prototype in front of end users as fast as possible to get feedback to make sure the project is on track, and pivot as needed.

Enterprises are complex, and the path forward is not usually obvious. To weed through all the possibilities and uncover the right first use case, Mistral AI will run workshops with our customers, hand-in-hand with subject-matter experts and end users.

Representatives from different functions will demo their processes and discuss business cases that could be candidates for a first use case—and together we agree on a winner. Here are some examples of types of projects that don’t qualify.

Moonshots: Ambitious bets that excite leadership but lack a path to quick ROI. While these projects can be strategic and urgent, they rarely meet the feasibility and impact requirements.

Future investments: Long-term plays that can wait. While these projects can be strategic and feasible, they rarely meet the urgency and impact requirements.

Tactical fixes: Firefighting projects that solve immediate pain but don’t move the needle. While these cases can be urgent and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and impact requirements.

Quick wins: Useful for building momentum, but not transformative. While they can be impactful and feasible, they rarely meet the strategy and urgency requirements.

Blue sky ideas: These projects are gamechangers, but they need maturity to be viable. While they can be strategic and impactful, they rarely meet the urgency and feasibility requirements.

Hero projects: These are high-pressure initiatives that lack executive sponsorship or realistic timelines. While they can be urgent and impactful, they rarely meet the strategy and feasibility requirements.

Once a clearly defined and strategic use case ready for development is identified, it’s time to move into the validation phase. This means doing an initial data exploration and data mapping, identifying a pilot infrastructure, and choosing a target deployment environment.

This step also involves agreeing on a draft pilot scope, identifying who will participate in the proof of concept, and setting up a governance process.

Once this is complete, it’s time to move into the building phase. Companies that partner with Mistral work with our in-house applied AI scientists who build our frontier models. We work together to design, build, and deploy the first solution.

During this phase, we focus on co-creation, so we can transfer knowledge and skills to the organizations we’re partnering with. That way, they can be self-sufficient far into the future. The output of this phase is a deployed AI solution with empowered teams capable of independent operation and innovation.

After the first win, it’s imperative to use the momentum and learnings from the iconic use case to identify more high-value AI solutions to roll out. Success is when we have a scalable AI transformation blueprint with multiple high-value solutions across the organization.

But none of this could happen without successfully identifying that first iconic use case. This first step is not just about selecting a project—it’s about setting the foundation for your entire AI transformation.

It’s the difference between scattered experiments and a strategic, scalable journey toward impact. At Mistral AI, we’ve seen how this approach unlocks measurable value, aligns stakeholders, and builds momentum for what comes next.

The path to AI success starts with a single, well-chosen use case: one that is bold enough to inspire, urgent enough to demand action, and pragmatic enough to deliver.

Inside the marketplace powering bespoke AI deepfakes of real women

Civitai—an online marketplace for buying and selling AI-generated content, backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz—is letting users buy custom instruction files for generating celebrity deepfakes. Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found.

The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Kyle “KJ” Muldoon Jr. was born with a rare, potentially fatal genetic disorder that left his body unable to remove toxic ammonia from his blood. The University of Pennsylvania offered his parents an alternative to a liver transplant: gene-editing therapies.

The team set to work developing a tailored treatment using base editing—a form of CRISPR that can correct genetic “misspellings” by changing single bases, the basic units of DNA. KJ received an initial low dose when he was seven months old, and later received two higher doses. Today, KJ is doing well. At an event in October last year, his happy parents described how he was meeting all his developmental milestones.

Others have received gene-editing therapies intended to treat conditions including sickle cell disease and a predisposition to high cholesterol. But KJ was the first to receive a personalized treatment—one that was designed just for him and will probably never be used again.

Demand for electric vehicles and the batteries that power them has never been hotter.

In 2025, EVs made up over a quarter of new vehicle sales globally, up from less than 5% in 2020. Some regions are seeing even higher uptake: In China, more than 50% of new vehicle sales last year were battery electric or plug-in hybrids. In Europe, more purely electric vehicles hit the roads in December than gas-powered ones. (The US is the notable exception here, dragging down the global average with a small sales decline from 2024.)

As EVs become increasingly common on the roads, the battery world is growing too. Looking ahead, we could soon see wider adoption of new chemistries, including some that deliver lower costs or higher performance. Meanwhile, the geopolitics of batteries are shifting, and so is the policy landscape. Here’s what’s coming next for EV batteries in 2026 and beyond.

Lithium-ion batteries are the default chemistry used in EVs, personal devices, and even stationary storage systems on the grid today. But in a tough environment in some markets like the US, there’s a growing interest in cheaper alternatives. Automakers right now largely care just about batteries’ cost, regardless of performance improvements, says Kara Rodby, a technical principal at Volta Energy Technologies, a venture capital firm that focuses on energy storage technology.

Sodium-ion cells have long been held up as a potentially less expensive alternative to lithium. The batteries are limited in their energy density, so they deliver a shorter range than lithium-ion. But sodium is also more abundant, so they could be cheaper.

Sodium’s growth has been cursed, however, by the very success of lithium-based batteries, says Shirley Meng, a professor of molecular engineering at the University of Chicago. A lithium-ion battery cell cost $568 per kilowatt-hour in 2013, but that cost had fallen to just $74 per kilowatt-hour by 2025—quite the moving target for cheaper alternatives to chase.

Sodium-ion batteries currently cost about $59 per kilowatt-hour on average. That’s less expensive than the average lithium-ion battery. But if you consider only lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, a lower-end type of lithium-ion battery that averages $52 per kilowatt-hour, sodium is still more expensive today.

We could soon see an opening for sodium-batteries, though. Lithium prices have been ticking up in recent months, a shift that could soon slow or reverse the steady downward march of prices for lithium-based batteries.

Sodium-ion batteries are already being used commercially, largely for stationary storage on the grid. But we’re starting to see sodium-ion cells incorporated into vehicles, too. The Chinese companies Yadea, JMEV, and HiNa Battery have all started producing sodium-ion batteries in limited numbers for EVs, including small, short-range cars and electric scooters that don’t require a battery with high energy density. CATL, a Chinese battery company that’s the world’s largest, says it recently began producing sodium-ion cells. The company plans to launch its first EV using the chemistry by the middle of this year.

Today, both production and demand for sodium-ion batteries are heavily centered in China. That’s likely to continue, especially after a cutback in tax credits and other financial support for the battery and EV industries in the US. One of the biggest sodium-battery companies in the US, Natron, ceased operations last year after running into funding issues.

We could also see progress in sodium-ion research: Companies and researchers are developing new materials for components including the electrolyte and electrodes, so the cells could get more comparable to lower-end lithium-ion cells in terms of energy density, Meng says.

As we enter the second half of this decade, many eyes in the battery world are on big promises and claims about solid-state batteries.

These batteries could pack more energy into a smaller package by removing the liquid electrolyte, the material that ions move through when a battery is charging and discharging. With a higher energy density, they could unlock longer-range EVs.

Companies have been promising solid-state batteries for years. Toyota, for example, once planned to have them in vehicles by 2020. That timeline has been delayed several times, though the company says it’s now on track to launch the new cells in cars in 2027 or 2028.

Historically, battery makers have struggled to produce solid-state batteries at the scale needed to deliver a commercially relevant supply for EVs. There’s been progress in manufacturing techniques, though, and companies could soon actually make good on their promises, Meng says.

Factorial Energy, a US-based company making solid-state batteries, provided cells for a Mercedes test vehicle that drove over 745 miles on a single charge in a real-world test in September. The company says it plans to bring its tech to market as soon as 2027. Quantumscape, another major solid-state player in the US, is testing its cells with automotive partners and plans to have its batteries in commercial production later this decade.

Before we see true solid-state batteries, we could see hybrid technologies, often referred to as semi-solid-state batteries. These commonly use materials like gel electrolytes, reducing the liquid inside cells without removing it entirely. Many Chinese companies are looking to build semi-solid-state batteries before transitioning to entirely solid-state ones, says Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technologies and supply chains at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

The picture for the near future of the EV industry looks drastically different depending on where you’re standing.

Last year, China overtook Japan as the country with the most global auto sales. And more than one in three EVs made in 2025 had a CATL battery in it. Simply put, China is dominating the global battery industry, and that doesn’t seem likely to change anytime soon.

China’s influence outside its domestic market is growing especially quickly. CATL is expected to begin production this year at its second European site; the factory, located in Hungary, is an $8.2 billion project that will supply automakers including BMW and the Mercedes-Benz group. Canada recently signed a deal that will lower the import tax on Chinese EVs from 100% to roughly 6%, effectively opening the Canadian market for Chinese EVs.

Some countries that haven’t historically been major EV markets could become bigger players in the second half of the decade. Annual EV sales in Thailand and Vietnam, where the market was virtually nonexistent just a few years ago, broke 100,000 in 2025. Brazil, in particular, could see its new EV sales more than double in 2026 as major automakers including Volkswagen and BYD set up or ramp up production in the country.

On the flip side, EVs are facing a real test in 2026 in the US, as this will be the first calendar year after the sunset of federal tax credits that were designed to push more drivers to purchase the vehicles. With those credits gone, growth in sales is expected to continue lagging.

One bright spot for batteries in the US is outside the EV market altogether. Battery manufacturers are starting to produce low-cost LFP batteries in the US, largely for energy storage applications. LG opened a massive factory to make LFP batteries in mid-2025 in Michigan, and the Korean battery company SK On plans to start making LFP batteries at its facility in Georgia later this year. Those plants could help battery companies cash in on investments as the US EV market faces major headwinds.

Even as the US lags behind, the world is electrifying transportation. By 2030, 40% of new vehicles sold around the world are projected to be electric. As we approach that milestone, expect to see more global players, a wider selection of EVs, and an even wider menu of batteries to power them.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you look at the press releases and breathless commentary around the recent acquisition of xAI by SpaceX, you might think we’re witnessing a tectonic shift in technological destiny.

A $1.25 trillion “mega-company” is born, poised to reshape artificial intelligence, space infrastructure, satellite internet, and possibly the fate of humanity itself. That narrative, enthusiastically repeated across headlines, serves a purpose: it frames a somewhat messy corporate consolidation as inevitable progress.

But let’s take a closer look and separate actual substance from Silicon Valley myth-making.

At its core, this acquisition solves one problem: xAI needed a place to spend its money. The startup that once raised billions and expanded by swallowing the social platform X was burning cash, an estimated very serious amount, chasing model performance and celebrity.

Folding it into SpaceX gives it access to a deeper capital pool, a broader story, and a more flattering valuation context.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

SpaceX did not acquire xAI because xAI was on the verge of overtaking tech giants in artificial intelligence. It acquired it because running a massively expensive AI operation inside a standalone startup wasn’t sustainable, even for Elon Musk’s legion of investors. A merger with a revenue-generating aerospace company looks a lot like a bailout disguised as synergy.

One of the dominant talking points from Musk’s own statements is that this consolidation enables space-based data centers, because apparently, earthbound power and cooling infrastructure are so last decade. The story goes: launch AI compute into orbit, agglomerate solar energy, and power the future with starlight.

On paper, it’s an imaginative riff. In practice, it’s strategic sci-fi for the markets. Putting data centers in space involves launch costs, radiation-hardened hardware, maintenance logistics that make ISS servicing look pedestrian, and no meaningful economy of scale compared to terrestrial hyperscalers like AWS or Google Cloud. If it were primarily about economics, the industry wouldn’t be scrambling to keep data on Earth.

The truth is simpler: this narrative reframes costly AI ambitions in a cosmic, venture-capital-friendly guise. It makes investors feel like they’re buying into a future where AI runs on sunshine in orbit, rather than into the present where AI training costs are a gating factor.

It’s good PR, dubious engineering economics.

The timing of this merger speaks volumes. SpaceX is preparing for a public offering, potentially as early as mid-2026. Reports say the combined entity could fetch valuations worth of $1.2 trillion.

Here’s what happens when you’re about to IPO:

You package your story in a way that excites both institutional and retail investors. You highlight future potential, especially grand visions like “ethereal solar compute.” You downplay structural weaknesses and uncertainties. And if you can fold in a shiny AI banner, all the better, because AI is the word that unlocks narrative premiums.

From that standpoint, SpaceX’s absorption of xAI makes sense. It’s narrative arbitrage: build a storyline that elevates the combination well beyond its standalone track records. Who wouldn’t want to invest in “AI in space,” even if the commercial case is mostly speculative?

If the goal was to create an AI powerhouse that actually threatens the likes of OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic, we’d see clear indicators: rapid model improvements, developer platform adoption, real enterprise deals, and benchmarks that are competitive on measurable terms.

What we see is an AI startup struggling to define its identity, a chatbot (Grok) known more for quirks and moderation issues than transformative performance, and a social platform that, let’s just say, gives fact-checking teams ulcers. None of this naturally scales into the kind of AI infrastructure leadership that justifies calling this a strategic technological fusion.

That’s not to say xAI has zero potential; it might. But there’s no verifiable evidence that this merger suddenly elevates it to tier-one AI contender status.

One striking consequence of this move is how deeply entwined Musk’s personal corporate empire has become. With SpaceX, xAI, Starlink, X, and multiple ventures all orbiting around the same figure, there’s little left that feels like a separate institution. That concentration raises questions about governance, accountability, and even regulatory scrutiny.

Musk’s critics have made this point before, whether about content moderation on social media platforms, intercompany transfers of resources, or governance decisions around publicly traded entities, and these concerns aren’t going away just because the companies now share a name on a term sheet.

Consolidation under one umbrella might be efficient from a control perspective, but it’s not inherently a prescription for innovation. In fact, it can stifle internal dissent, obscure accountability, and concentrate risk.

Again, there’s a clear pragmatic logic to this merger: xAI gets access to SpaceX’s balance sheet and a narrative boost; SpaceX gets an AI banner to highlight in its IPO pitch; investors get something that looks both futuristic and marketable.

That’s not a strategy grounded in technological merit. It’s a financial and narrative maneuver, carefully calibrated to appeal to markets and media.

In that sense, what just happened feels a lot like a bailout with a shiny new label and an extraterrestrial backstory.

If this were genuinely about advancing AI, we’d be hearing about:

None of those are the dominant themes of the current coverage. What we have instead is a $1.25 trillion headline and a promise that someday, somewhere, perhaps space will be the next frontier for AI compute.

It’s visionary in the way a concept car is visionary, exciting to look at, and flimsy on the economics.

The SpaceX-xAI merger is undeniably a headline-grabbing moment, but it’s not the strategic leap some commentators portray. It’s a capital and narrative optimization, not a clear answer to the question of who leads AI or how AI’s growth is sustainably powered.

If nothing else, it highlights how difficult it is to build a credible, well-funded AI company from scratch, even for someone as resourceful and celebrated as Elon Musk. His answer was not to reforge the fundamentals of AI research, but to fold an ambitious but unproven AI arm into a larger, more established aerospace machine with a glossy story that sounds like science fiction.

That may delight investors. It doesn’t yet convince technologists. Or me.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has given software developers a new desktop toy, and judging by the early reactions, it might feel like someone finally handed coders the Swiss Army knife they’ve been dreaming about or the kind of gadget that makes them wonder if they’re working with a robot coworker now.

The company rolled out the Codex app for macOS, a focused interface for managing AI coding agents, designed to let developers do more than just “generate a few lines of code.” Instead, Codex can juggle multiple tasks in parallel, run background workflows, and act on instructions that span hours or even days.

At its core, the new app is a response to a shift that’s been quietly happening for the past year: AI isn’t just helping write short snippets anymore. It’s taking on whole coding projects, running tests, dealing with pull requests, and even undertaking the kind of repetitive maintenance tasks that make developers groan.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Containers, threads, isolated worktrees, and integrated Git tools support all of this seamlessly within the app, so engineers don’t need to jump between terminals, IDEs, and cloud consoles just to keep a fleet of AI agents moving forward.

OpenAI’s own announcement makes this shift clear: existing tools were built for real-time interaction or single tasks, but today’s coding workflows are multifaceted and sprawling. Instead of coaxing a model to generate code line by line, the Codex app lets you orchestrate agents that work independently on different parts of a codebase.

Each agent runs in its own thread and its own worktree, which means you can explore multiple ideas without fear of one bot overwriting another’s progress. If you want Codex to review diffs, make comments inline, or even open suggested changes in your local editor, it can. If you want it to run in the background while you sleep, it can do that too.

Image: Screenshot shared on Reddit (r/singularity), original post.

There’s even support for what OpenAI calls “skills” and “automations”: reusable workflows that let Codex go beyond raw code generation into things like gathering information, problem solving, carrying out scheduled tasks, or managing routine reviews.

In early internal use cases, Codex has built complete applications, playing the roles of designer, developer, and QA tester in a single string of prompts, an example that hints at what happens when AI stops being an assistant and starts feeling a bit like a team member with infinite coffee.

It’s worth noting that the current release is macOS only, which prompted the usual chorus of developer grumbling about Windows and Linux support. Early adopters on Reddit (and elsewhere) joked that the lack of cross-platform availability feels oddly quaint for an AI tool, even as they praised how much the Codex app can do compared to traditional CLI workflows.

OpenAI is also sweetening the deal: for a limited time, Codex will be accessible to free and Go users, and rate limits for paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu plans have been doubled across all surfaces where Codex runs, whether that’s the app, the CLI, IDE extensions, or cloud threads.

The company’s broader strategy here is unmistakable. AI coding assistants are one of the most competitive battlegrounds in generative AI right now, and rivals like Anthropic’s Claude Code have already reported strong revenue metrics in this space.

The launch of a desktop command center for Codex feels like OpenAI saying, “We’re in this to win,” not just to ship features.

So what does this actually mean for developers? It doesn’t mean humans are about to be replaced overnight. Codex is powerful, but like all AI tools, it still makes mistakes and needs human oversight, especially when the stakes are high and production quality matters.

Seen through that lens, the Codex app is less a magic wand and more a powerful collaboration layer, one that could reshape how engineering teams operate without pretending to fully automate the craft of building software.

In practice, that suggests a near future where managing AI agents becomes as normal as managing packages or Git branches. Instead of the terminal being the center of your workflow, Codex and its agents might take that spot, responding to prompts, running scheduled tasks, and even adopting configurable “personalities” that fit how you prefer to work.

At a time when the debate around AI productivity often centers on displacement or disruption, the Codex app points in a more nuanced direction: what happens when coding tools become partners rather than assistants?

The answer won’t be immediate, and the work still demands human judgement, but for many developers the first glimpse of that future arrived today.

            <h2>Europe’s not-so-dry January: Unicorns and a new tech identity</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-02</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every January, millions take on Dry January, a ritual of restraint and resetting after the holiday season. If that’s the benchmark for kicking off the year with moderation, Europe’s startup ecosystem clearly didn’t get the memo.

In the opening weeks of 2026, the region saw five startups join the unicorn club, crossing the $1 billion valuation mark across sectors as varied as cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence tech, ESG software, and education technology.

January was anything but dry for European companies. This burst of activity signals more than a funding spike; it invites a deeper look at what Europe’s innovation identity looks like today. Across the continent, there’s a stronger sense that Europe can produce and scale world-class tech companies in its own right, rather than just nurture later-stage spin-offs or see them acquired by U.S. firms.

While the United States still leads in overall startup volume and ecosystem strength, Europe’s recent momentum shows its innovation landscape is maturing and gaining confidence on the global stage.

Europe was already home to over 217 unicorns by late 2025, spread across fintech, AI, enterprise software, and other domains. That’s a milestone for a region whose venture culture has historically leaned toward caution.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What’s notable isn’t simply the number of new billion-dollar companies, but their variety. Gone are the days when a single sector, often generative AI, defined European unicorn trajectories. Here we see cybersecurity, cloud optimisation, defence-oriented software, sustainability data, and education marketplaces all earning top valuations and investor backing.

The broader context matters. In 2025, deep-tech and university spinouts, including companies in aerospace, robotics, materials, sensors, and health sciences, saw near record levels of funding, and many achieved significant valuation or revenue milestones.

This goes hand in hand with a narrative that’s become increasingly clear: European capital is being more deliberate than exuberant. Rather than inflate every trend label, investors are writing checks where traction, revenue models, and regulatory demand converge. That’s why platforms helping companies with compliance and ESG reporting, or infrastructure for cloud efficiency, are winning attention alongside defence-tech innovators.

Europe’s tech ecosystem has matured, even if it still faces hurdles. Venture funding peaked in recent years and then dipped; for example, total European VC investment in 2024 was reported to be around $45 billion, down from earlier highs. Yet the valuation achievements and funding depth remain meaningful.

This apparent paradox highlights a structural shift: rather than broad flows of unfettered capital, funding is now more selective and outcome-oriented. Investors, LPs, and strategic partners are looking for proof of product-market fit, regulatory differentiation, and defensible business models.

Fragmentation across markets and languages, long considered a European challenge, can also be a strength when paired with clusters of domain expertise, cybersecurity hubs in Belgium, deep tech in the Nordics, cloud infrastructure in the Baltics, and education technology with strong ties to diverse EU labour markets. Observers have noted that these clusters are attracting venture dollars, even if not every founder heads straight for the Bay Area.

Policy tools and institutional support are increasingly part of the backdrop for European innovation. The European Union’s research and innovation framework programmes, most notably Horizon Europe, are directing substantial resources toward areas such as digital transformation, strategic autonomy, and industrial competitiveness.

For 2021–2027, Horizon Europe is the EU’s flagship funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of around €93.5 billion allocated to boost competitiveness, address climate and social challenges, and support key technologies from AI to advanced manufacturing.

This support matters because initiatives that might once have felt niche, advanced sensors, ESG compliance tools, or technologies with both civil and defence applications, now align clearly with broader strategic goals set out in the EU’s innovation plans.

Calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 – Digital, Industry and Space, and related programmes bring together public and private partners to tackle digital and green transitions, pooling resources and creating coherent pathways from research to commercial deployment.

That’s why this month’s unicorn news feels less like a fluke and more like a phase transition.

So what does it all mean? Are these five new unicorns signs of a sustainable upswing or just a temporary blip in enterprise valuations?

They’re arguably both: an indicator that Europe’s startup engine still runs on thoughtful investment, real use cases, and foundational problems, and a challenge to continue scaling that momentum into later-stage growth and exits.

Europe doesn’t need to be Silicon Valley. It never really did. What it needs is confidence in its own values, disciplined capital, diverse innovation, and regulation as an enabler, not a constraint.

If this is Europe’s tech moment, it’s not marked by headline-grabbing valuations alone. It’s defined by the breadth of problems being solved and the depth of conviction behind those solutions.

            <div id="article-text">G2 has completed a major acquisition by purchasing three of the world’s most influential software discovery platforms from Gartner. The move significantly reshapes the global B2B software reviews market and strengthens G2’s position in how companies evaluate and buy software.

Slush, one of Europe’s most influential tech and startup events, has named Noora Saksa as its new CEO. The leadership change signals a strategic shift toward expanding Slush beyond its annual event and building a year-round global founder platform.

The French government has decided to phase out US-based collaboration tools such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams across public administration. The decision is part of a broader push for European digital sovereignty and reduced reliance on American Big Tech.

This week signals consolidation and sovereignty: G2 reshapes software discovery, Slush enters a new leadership phase, and Europe doubles down on digital independence.

            <div id="article-text">We are all familiar with the subscription economy, and it certainly works as a reminder of the COVID-19 pandemic, when we were all hooked on our TVs watching Netflix or listening to our favorite music artist on Spotify.

Despite how modern it seems to be, the truth is that the subscription economy has been around for some time, surprisingly dating back to around 1800, with the first magazine subscriptions, or the subscriptions for fresh British milk, around 1860.

Over the years, the of subscription-based companies has turned the subscription model into an ideal business strategy since it provides unique benefits. In the same way, the adoption of this model across multiple industries has led to negative repercussions for the general public.

This article explores its growth across industries, benefits and disadvantages, and why this is important for you, as a service provider and/or as a customer.

The subscription economy is a recurring-revenue model in which products or services are delivered daily under a temporary or perpetual subscription in exchange for a fixed price, growing considerably in the last 20 years.

According to the last report in the Subscription Economy Market 2025 by Juniper, the global market had a total revenue of $722B in 2025, with a forecasted total revenue of $1.2T by 2030, with an average annual growth rate of more than 15%. Software as a service (SaaS) remains the biggest part of the subscription market with a revenue of more than $250B by 2022. The car rethinking industry, e-mobility application area, and the digitization of the health sector are expected to be enormously scaled by 2030.

The European market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.50% in the forecast period of 2026-2035. The main industry leaders within the region are beauty, food, and digital subscriptions. Whereas the countries where the subscription market stands out are the UK (beauty and personal care), Germany (software and consumer goods), France (food and beverage), and Italy and Spain (digital subscription and other categories).

A study made by Advances in Consumer Research (ACR) journal highlights how this model is great for businesses because it provides steady income, low upfront costs, and consistent lifetime value (the total value a customer provides to a company over their relationship), while promoting brand loyalty. It also offers unique advantages for consumers, such as a customer-centric approach focused on personalizing services, products and experiences, and experiences; convenient, time-saving solutions; cost-effectiveness; access to a diverse range of products rather than ownership of a few; and even social recognition and identity.

The gaming industry had a steady increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, introducing subscription-based services, which have become regular within the industry. The business model is simple: gamers pay a subscription fee to access gaming services, and there are three different options for customers:

The global market for subscription-based gaming was estimated at $10.1B in 2023 and is forecasted to reach $21.3B by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 11.3% from 2023 to 2030.

It has been popularized due to its affordability and convenience, since the subscription to platforms enables players the flexibility to pay multiple games with an affordable fee.

The subscription model also offers unique advantages for companies, such as reduction of upfront costs since the games are directly streamed from servers, promoted by the technological development of high-speed internet infrastructure and 5G, cloud gaming service, cross-platform accounts, family plans, and leveraged AI to offer personalized game recommendations based on user behavior.

Another industry that is adapting to market and customer expectations is healthcare. As a response to technological and societal advancements, subscription medical care is increasing in popularity within the US, expected to reach $15.1bn by 2032.

Health tech represents a great opportunity for individuals and businesses since it introduces cost predictability, personalized attention, and wellness data. Healthcare providers and health tech companies are leveraging the use of AI, since it facilitates the data analysis process, helping health professionals to make more accurate and efficient diagnoses.

Within the health care and health tech industry, there are several subscription-based models, such as:

The subscription economy has expanded to other services, such as education. Since the customer expectations and behavior is demanding accessible, personalized content at an affordable price, the global e-learning market is growing and expected to reach $1T by 2032 with subscription models leading.

The key drivers for growth are the increasing use of VR and AR in e-learning, digital transformation, and the partnership of universities and diversity in offerings. Some of the most used platforms worldwide are Duolingo, Coursera, and FutureLearn, among others.

Another industry that has greatly benefitted with the subscription model is the creator economy. Content creators are increasingly looking to subscription platforms such as Patreon, OnlyFans, and Substack, adopting them as a solution in a volatile economy and competitive markets, where creators heavily depended on paid partnerships and platform payouts, this way ensuring a stable monthly recurring revenue.

The key drivers for the growth of this market are, whatsoever, slightly different than the previously mentioned: audiences want to pay for a deeper relationship with the creator than passive scrolling, whether of its niche expertise or personal connection.

Despite all the unique benefits that the subscription model offers for customers and companies, the quick expansion and adoption of this model has led to negative effects in the audiences, which become challenges for the companies. You may be familiar with the concept of subscription fatigue, which reflects the customers’ reluctance to engage with multiple subscriptions.

This phenomenon was born due to the saturation in the expanding market and is driven by “lack of perceived value, hidden or unpredictable fees and loss of control,” fomenting churn (percentage of customers who cancel their subscription) for customers to save money or just because the service seems not useful for them.

Another challenge for companies is the constant pressure for ongoing investment in product development and customer engagement, especially in industries with minimal product differentiation, such as the streaming platforms industry. High production costs and limited audience engagement increase this model’s financial struggles, adding pressure on companies to deliver valuable services while generating profit.

Subscription models are no longer limited to entertainment platforms. They have become a core part of modern digital business strategies, offering predictable revenue streams for companies and enhancing customer experience.

The next phase will likely combine hybrid subscription models with usage-based pricing and data-driven personalization. To remain competitive, companies will need to adapt to consumer expectations by offering flexible prices and plans, pause options, bundling strategies, and partnerships across platforms.

Ultimately, the main challenge right now is how to design models that deliver long-term value without overwhelming users, balancing profitability with meaningful user experience.
