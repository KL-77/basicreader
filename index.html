            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/99-of-adults-over-40-have-shoulder-abnormalities-on-an-mri-study-finds/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Up to a third of people worldwide have shoulder pain; it’s one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints. But medical imaging might not reveal the problem—in fact, it could even cloud it.

In a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine this week, 99 percent of adults over 40 were found to have at least one abnormality in a rotator cuff on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The rotator cuff is the group of muscles and tendons in a shoulder joint that keeps the upper arm bone securely in the shoulder socket—and is often blamed for pain and other symptoms. The trouble is, the vast majority of the people in the study had no problems with their shoulders.

The finding calls into question the growing use of MRIs to try to diagnose shoulder pain—and, in turn, the growing problem of overtreatment of rotator cuff (RC) abnormalities, which includes partial- and full-thickness tears as well as signs of tendinopathy (tendon swelling and thickening).

“While we cannot dismiss the possibility that some RC tears may contribute to shoulder symptoms, our findings indicate that we are currently unable to distinguish clinically meaningful MRI abnormalities from incidental findings,” the study authors concluded.

The study was carried out by Finnish researchers, who tapped into a nationally representative sample of adults who had signed up for a public health survey. In the end, 602 participants, aged 41 to 76, completed the study, which included answering questions about shoulder pain and getting MRIs on both shoulders. Of the 602 participants, 492 (82 percent) reported no shoulder symptoms, while 110 (18 percent) did report symptoms.

The MRI revealed that 595 of them (99 percent) had at least one RC abnormality. The most common abnormality was a partial-thickness tear (62 percent), followed by tendinopathy (25 percent), and a full-thickness tear (11 percent). The prevalence of abnormalities was similar between males and females. But the abnormalities showed a clear age-related progression, with no full-thickness tears in participants under 45 and the greatest proportion in people 70 to 76.

Breaking the findings down to shoulders instead of people, of the 1204 shoulders in the study, 1,076 (90 percent) were asymptomatic while 128 (10 percent) were symptomatic. Of the 1,076 asymptomatic shoulders, 96 percent had RC abnormalities (1,039 of 1,076) and of the 128 symptomatic shoulders 98 percent had abnormalities (126 of 128).

Prevalence of tendinopathy and partial-thickness tears were similar between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. It initially looked like full-thickness tears were more common in the symptomatic groups, but when researchers adjusted for other factors, including additional abnormalities spotted in the MRIs, the difference between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups vanished.

The authors argue that the findings suggest clinicians should rethink MRI findings, changing not just how they’re used, but also how they’re explained to patients. The language in particular should change given that “abnormalities” are ubiquitous—thus normal—and shouldn’t be described in terms that indicate a need for repair, like “tear.”

“While we refer to these findings as abnormalities, many likely represent normal age-related changes rather than clinically relevant structural changes,” the authors write. “Adopting more precise and less value-laden terminology—such as lesion, defect, fraying, disruption, structural alteration, or degeneration—may help reduce patient anxiety and the perceived need to do something or fix something by avoiding language that implies trauma or a requirement for repair.”

In an accompanying editorial, two orthopedic surgeons from University of California, San Francisco, Edgar Garcia-Lopez and Brian Feeley, agree with the language shift and caution clinicians to proactively put MRI findings in context.

They also address the glaring question of when MRIs should even be used for shoulder pain. They suggest that for pain that’s not related to an injury, clinicians should first try a couple months of watch-and-wait with rest or physical therapy to regain function. If there’s no meaningful improvement, an MRI may be warranted. But they stressed that any further decisions on treatment should be based on the patient’s history, clinical exam, and functional limitations of their shoulder—not just what’s seen on the imaging.

“Of course, the findings of this study are not meant to dissuade clinicians from using MRI when appropriate, but to reinforce that the diagnosis and management of shoulder pain should be guided primarily by functional limitations,” the surgeons write.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2026/02/get-ready-for-new-macs-and-ipads-apple-announces-special-experience-on-march-4/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It may be more tempting to take that aging Mac you’ve been coddling and put it out to pasture soon. Apple has announced an event for March 4, which in usual Apple fashion, it has branded a “Special Apple Experience.” Also in usual Apple fashion, it has not come out and said what it’s going to be announcing. We have a pretty good idea, though.

The event will kick off at 9AM ET on March 4—Ars will be on the ground in New York City to cover Apple’s latest unveiling, whatever form it may take. Apple doesn’t release most products on a set schedule, but some recent speculation about likely hardware updates can point us in the right direction.

As we reported recently, the iPhone 17e may be making an appearance in Apple’s lineup soon. This updated version of the budget-oriented iPhone will have an A19 chip inside, similar to the one powering the base model iPhone 17. It may also add MagSafe charging. Don’t expect to see a multi-camera array like you’d get on the more expensive Apple phones, though. Pricing will be the most important thing to watch for should Apple announce this phone. Right now, the non-Pro iPhone 16 and 17 (including the 16e) are all clustered in the $600-800 range. Another $599 budget iPhone won’t make waves.

Apple may also drop new iPads, including a base model with an A18 chip and a M4-powered iPad Air. The processor upgrades may be the only changes of note for these devices, though. Add to that Apple’s tendency to disable CPU or GPU cores on low-end iPad chips, and the difference compared to old devices may be negligible.

The updates to Apple’s Mac lineup may headlining the event. Recent reports point to a long-awaited MacBook Pro chipset upgrade. Fans of Apple’s most powerful laptops have been aching for an upgrade path from their M4-based machines. Apple announced a 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M5 chip last fall, but there was no M5 Pro or M5 Max option.

The rumor mill is now predicting 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. Lots of folks will probably drop thousands of dollars on those machines as soon as they’re available. For the less demanding, rumors have also pointed to a cheaper MacBook with an A18 Pro chip, as well as an M5-powered MacBook Air.

We’ll find out exactly what Apple’s been cooking up on March 4.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/best-buy-worker-used-managers-code-to-get-99-off-macbooks-cops-say/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Best Buy employee in Florida was charged with fraud after allegedly using his manager’s code to heavily discount nearly 150 items that he and his accomplices purchased and pawned.

It seems that the manager first started growing suspicious about “strange sales numbers” in December 2024, an ABC News affiliate in West Palm Beach reported. Private investigators traced the weird sales back to a 36-year-old employee, Matthew Lettera, who allegedly conducted 97 discounted purchases for himself and 52 additional transactions for others. Some MacBooks were discounted as much as 99 percent, a local CW affiliate reported. In total, Best Buy lost more than $118,000 from the scheme.

According to a LinkedIn profile that matches Lettera’s information, he started working at Best Buy in January 2020 after pivoting from career training as a chef.

An arrest affidavit from the Palm Beach Police Department reviewed by a local CBS News affiliate alleged that Lettera’s scheme did not start until March 2024, about four years into his Best Buy career as an “experience manager.” A switch seemingly flipped, as Lettera allegedly  conducted dozens of heavily discounted transactions that went unnoticed for months, seemingly growing bolder and eventually recruiting coworkers to join the scheme.

He apparently didn’t expect the Best Buy managers to detect the losses or seek to retrieve pawned merchandise, but that was a miscalculation. Lettera was arrested after police tracked down some of the discounted MacBook laptops at local pawn shops. Cooperating with police, the pawn shops provided sales records allegedly showing that Lettera sold the steeply discounted products and profited from exploiting Best Buy’s discount system.

In 2023, a few months before Lettera’s alleged fraud scheme started, the National Retail Foundation warned  that monitoring employee theft had become a bigger priority for retailers. In times of inflation, retail theft typically increases, and their survey found that a record level of talent turnover was stressing out retail employees and making it easier for those with malicious intent to get away with fraud.

For Best Buy, threats of losses from stressed-out employees seemingly remain, as inflation pressures persist. Last month, an employee at a Best Buy in Georgia assisted a shoplifting ring in stealing more than $40,000 in merchandise, a local CBS News affiliate reported.

Surveillance footage showed that 20-year-old Dorian Allen allowed shoplifters to simply leave the store without paying for more than 140 items, a police report alleged. Among merchandise stolen were “dozens of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S consoles, AirPods, Meta Quest VR headsets, Beats wireless headphones, a PC, a Segway, wireless controllers, and more,” CBS News reported.

Charged with theft, Allen claimed he was being blackmailed by a hacker group who threatened to expose nude photos he shared on Instagram if he didn’t cooperate. Allegedly under duress, Allen memorized descriptions of the shoplifters so that he could allow them to take items without paying. He also allegedly helped thieves load items into their vehicles.

Managers called in police after Allen allegedly spent weeks assisting the shoplifters without detection.</div>

            <h2>ByteDance backpedals after Seedance 2.0 turned Hollywood icons into AI “clip art”</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/bytedance-backpedals-after-seedance-2-0-turned-hollywood-icons-into-ai-clip-art/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">ByteDance says that it’s rushing to add safeguards to block Seedance 2.0 from generating iconic characters and deepfaking celebrities, after substantial Hollywood backlash after launching the latest version of its AI video tool.

The changes come after Disney and Paramount Skydance sent cease-and-desist letters to ByteDance urging the Chinese company to promptly end the allegedly vast and blatant infringement.

Studios claimed the infringement was widescale and immediate, with Seedance 2.0 users across social media sharing AI videos featuring copyrighted characters like Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and SpongeBob Square Pants. In its letter, Disney fumed that Seedance was “hijacking” its characters, accusing ByteDance of treating Disney characters like they were “free public domain clip art,” Axios reported.

“ByteDance’s virtual smash-and-grab of Disney’s IP is willful, pervasive, and totally unacceptable,” Disney’s letter said.

Defending intellectual property from franchises like Star Trek and The Godfather, Paramount Skydance pointed out that Seedance’s outputs are “often indistinguishable, both visually and audibly” from the original characters, Variety reported. Similarly frustrated, Japan’s AI minister Kimi Onoda, sought to protect popular anime and manga characters, officially launching a probe last week into ByteDance over the copyright violations, the South China Morning Post reported.

“We cannot overlook a situation in which content is being used without the copyright holder’s permission,” Onoda said at a press conference Friday.

Facing legal threats and Japan’s investigation, ByteDance issued a statement Monday, CNBC reported. In it, the company claimed that it “respects intellectual property rights” and has “heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0.”

“We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,” ByteDance said.

However, Disney seems unlikely to accept that ByteDance inadvertently released its tool without implementing such safeguards in advance. In its letter, Disney alleged that “Seedance has infringed on Disney’s copyrighted materials to benefit its commercial service without permission.”

After all, what better way to illustrate Seedance 2.0’s latest features than by generating some of the best-known IP in the world? At least one tech consultant has suggested that ByteDance planned to benefit from inciting Hollywood outrage. The founder of San Francisco-based consultancy Tech Buzz China, Rui Ma, told SCMP that “the controversy surrounding Seedance is likely part of ByteDance’s initial distribution strategy to showcase its underlying technical capabilities.”

Studios aren’t the only ones sounding alarms.

Several industry groups expressed concerns, including the Motion Picture Association, which accused ByteDance of engaging in massive copyright infringement within “a single day,” CNBC reported.

Sean Astin, an actor and president of the actors union, SAG-AFTRA, was directly impacted by the scandal. A video that has since been removed from X showed Astin in the role of Samwise Gamgee from The Lord of the Rings, delivering a line he never said, Variety reported. Condemning Seedance’s infringement, SAG-AFTRA issued a statement emphasizing that ByteDance did not act responsibly in releasing the model without safeguards:

“SAG-AFTRA stands with the studios in condemning the blatant infringement enabled by ByteDance’s new AI video model Seedance 2.0. The infringement includes the unauthorized use of our members’ voices and likenesses. This is unacceptable and undercuts the ability of human talent to earn a livelihood. Seedance 2.0 disregards law, ethics, industry standards and basic principles of consent. Responsible AI development demands responsibility, and that is nonexistent here.”

Echoing that, a group representing Hollywood creators, the Human Artistry Campaign, declared that “the launch of Seedance 2.0” was “an attack on every creator around the world.”

“Stealing human creators’ work in an attempt to replace them with AI generated slop is destructive to our culture: stealing isn’t innovation,” the group said. “These unauthorized deepfakes and voice clones of actors violate the most basic aspects of personal autonomy and should be deeply concerning to everyone. Authorities should use every legal tool at their disposal to stop this wholesale theft.”

Ars could not immediately reach any of these groups to comment on whether ByteDance’s post-launch efforts to add safeguards addressed industry concerns.

MPA chairman and CEO Charles Rivkin has previously accused ByteDance of disregarding “well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.”

While Disney and other studios are clearly ready to take down any tools that could hurt their revenue or reputation without an agreement in place, they aren’t opposed to all AI uses of their characters. In December, Disney struck a deal with OpenAI, giving Sora access to 200 characters for three years, while investing $1 billion in the technology.

At that time, Disney CEO Robert A. Iger, said that “the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI, we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.”

In a blog announcing Seedance 2.0, ByteDance boasted that the new model “delivers a substantial leap in generation quality,” particularly in close-up shots and action sequences.

The company acknowledged that further refinements were needed and the model is “still far from perfect” but hyped that “its generated videos possess a distinct cinematic aesthetic; the textures of objects, lighting, and composition, as well as costume, makeup, and prop designs, all show high degrees of finish.”

ByteDance likely hoped that the earliest outputs from Seedance 2.0 would produce headlines wowed by the model’s capabilities, and it got what it wanted when a single Hollywood stakeholder’s social media comment went viral.

Shortly after Seedance 2.0’s rollout, Deadpool co-writer, Rhett Reese, declared on X that “it’s likely over for us,” The Guardian reported. The screenwriter was impressed by an AI video created by Irish director Ruairi Robinson, which realistically depicted Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt. “[I]n next to no time, one person is going to be able to sit at a computer and create a movie indistinguishable from what Hollywood now releases,” Reese opined. “True, if that person is no good, it will suck. But if that person possesses Christopher Nolan’s talent and taste (and someone like that will rapidly come along), it will be tremendous.”

However, some AI critics rejected the notion that Seedance 2.0 is capable of replacing artists in the way that Reese warned. On Bluesky and X, they pushed back on ByteDance claims that this model doomed Hollywood, with some accusing outlets of too quickly ascribing Reese’s reaction to the whole industry.

Among them was longtime AI critic, Reid Southen, a film concept artist who works on major motion pictures and TV. Responding directly to Reese’s X thread, Southen contradicted the notion that a great filmmaker could be born from fiddling with AI prompts alone.

“Nolan is capable of doing great work because he’s put in the work,” Southen said. “AI is an automation tool, it’s literally removing key, fundamental work from the process, how does one become good at anything if they insist on using nothing but shortcuts?”

Perhaps the strongest evidence in Southen’s favor is Darren Aronofsky’s recent AI-generated historical docudrama. Speaking anonymously to Ars following backlash declaring that “AI slop is ruining American history,” one source close to production on that project confirmed that it took “weeks” to produce minutes of usable video using a variety of AI tools.

That source noted that the creative team went into the project expecting they had a lot to learn but also expecting that tools would continue to evolve, as could audience reactions to AI-assisted movies.

“It’s a huge experiment, really,” the source told Ars.

Notably, for both creators and rights-holders concerned about copyright infringement and career threats, questions remain on how Seedance 2.0 was trained. ByteDance has yet to release a technical report for Seedance 2.0 and “has never disclosed the data sets it uses to train its powerful video-generation Seedance models and image-generation Seedream models,” SCMP reported.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/dna-inspired-molecule-breaks-records-for-storing-solar-heat/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Heating accounts for nearly half of the global energy demand, and two-thirds of that is met by burning fossil fuels like natural gas, oil, and coal. Solar energy is a possible alternative, but while we have become reasonably good at storing solar electricity in lithium-ion batteries, we’re not nearly as good at storing heat.

To store heat for days, weeks, or months, you need to trap the energy in the bonds of a molecule that can later release heat on demand. The approach to this particular chemistry problem is called molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage. While it has been the next big thing for decades, it never really took off.

In a recent Science paper, a team of researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and UCLA demonstrate a breakthrough that might finally make MOST energy storage effective.

In the past, MOST energy storage solutions have been plagued by lackluster performance. The molecules either didn’t store enough energy, degraded too quickly, or required toxic solvents that made them impractical. To find a way around these issues, the team led by Han P. Nguyen, a chemist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, drew inspiration from the genetic damage caused by sunburn. The idea was to store energy using a reaction similar to the one that allows UV light to damage DNA.

When you stay out on the beach too long, high-energy ultraviolet light can cause adjacent bases in the DNA (thymine, the T in the genetic code) to link together. This forms a structure known as a (6-4) lesion. When that lesion is exposed to even more UV light, it twists into an even stranger shape called a “Dewar” isomer. In biology, this is rather bad news, as Dewar isomers cause kinks in the DNA’s double-helix spiral that disrupt copying the DNA and can lead to mutations or cancer.

To counter this effect, evolution shaped a specific enzyme called photolyase to hunt (6-4) lesions down and snap them back into their safe, stable forms.

The researchers realized that the Dewar isomer is essentially a molecular battery. This snap-back effect was exactly what Nguyen’s team was looking for, since it releases a lot of heat.

Molecular batteries, in principle, are extremely good at storing energy. Heating oil, arguably the most popular molecular battery we use for heating, is essentially ancient solar energy stored in chemical bonds. Its energy density stands at around 40 Megajoules per kilo. To put that in perspective, Li-ion batteries usually pack less than one MJ/kg. One of the problems with heating oil, though, is that it is single-use only—it gets burnt when you use it. What Nguyen and her colleagues aimed to achieve with their DNA-inspired substance is essentially a reusable fuel.

To do that, researchers synthesized a derivative of 2-pyrimidone, a chemical cousin of the thymine found in DNA. They engineered this molecule to reliably fold into a Dewar isomer under sunlight and then unfold on command. The result was a rechargeable fuel that could absorb the energy when exposed to sunlight, release it when needed, and return to a “relaxed” state where it’s ready to be charged up again.

Previous attempts at MOST systems have struggled to compete with Li-ion batteries. Norbornadiene, one of the best-studied candidates, tops out at around 0.97 MJ/kg. Another contender, azaborinine, manages only 0.65 MJ/kg. They may be scientifically interesting, but they are not going to heat your house.

Nguyen’s pyrimidone-based system blew those numbers out of the water. The researchers achieved an energy storage density of 1.65 MJ/kg—nearly double the capacity of Li-ion batteries and substantially higher than any previous MOST material.

The reason for this jump in performance was what the team called compounded strain.

When the pyrimidone molecule absorbs light, it doesn’t just fold; it twists into a fused, bicyclic structure containing two different four-membered rings: 1,2-dihydroazete and diazetidine. Four-membered rings are under immense structural tension. By fusing them together, the researchers created a molecule that is desperate to snap back into its relaxed state.

Achieving high energy density on paper is one thing. Making it work in the real world is another. A major failing of previous MOST systems is that they are solids that need to be dissolved in solvents like toluene or acetonitrile to work. Solvents are the enemy of energy density—by diluting your fuel to 10 percent concentration, for example, you effectively cut your energy density by 90 percent. Any solvent used means less fuel.

Nguyen’s team tackled this by designing a version of their molecule that is a liquid at room temperature, so it doesn’t need a solvent. This simplified operations considerably, as the liquid fuel could be pumped through a solar collector to charge it up and store it in a tank.

Unlike many organic molecules that hate water, Nguyen’s system is compatible with aqueous environments. This means if a pipe leaks, you aren’t spewing toxic fluids like toluene around your house. The researchers even demonstrated that the molecule could work in water and that its energy release was intense enough to boil it.

The MOST-based heating system, the team says in their paper, would circulate this rechargeable fuel through panels on the roof to capture the sun’s light and then store it in the basement tank. The fuel from this tank would later be pumped to a reaction chamber with an acid catalyst that triggers the energy release. Then, through a heat exchanger, this energy would heat up the water in the standard central heating system.

The first hurdle is the spectrum of light that puts energy in the Nguyen’s fuel. The Sun bathes us in a broad spectrum of light, from infrared to ultraviolet. Ideally, a solar collector should use as much of this as possible, but the pyrimidone molecules only absorb light in the UV-A and UV-B range, around 300-310 nm. That represents about five percent of the total solar spectrum. The vast majority of the Sun’s energy, the visible light and the infrared, passes right through Nguyen’s molecules without charging them.

The second problem is quantum yield. This is a fancy way of asking, “For every 100 photons that hit the molecule, how many actually make it switch to the Dewar isomer state?” For these pyrimidones, the answer is a rather underwhelming number, in the single digits. Low quantum yield means the fluid needs a longer exposure to sunlight to get a full charge.

The researchers hypothesize that the molecule has a fast leak, meaning a non-radiative decay path where the excited molecule shakes off the energy as heat immediately instead of twisting into the storage form. Plugging that leak is the next big challenge for the team.

Finally, the team in their experiments used an acid catalyst that was mixed directly into the storage material. The team admits that in a future closed-loop device, this would require a neutralization step—a reaction that eliminates the acidity after the heat is released. Unless the reaction products can be purified away, this will reduce the energy density of the system.

Still, despite the efficiency issues, the stability of the Nguyen’s system looks promising.

One of the biggest fears with chemical storage is thermal reversion—the fuel spontaneously discharges because it got a little too warm in the storage tank. But the Dewar isomers of the pyrimidones are incredibly stable. The researchers calculated a half-life of up to 481 days at room temperature for some derivatives. This means the fuel could be charged in the heat of July, and it would remain fully charged when you need to heat your home in January. The degradation figures also look decent for a MOST energy storage. The team ran the system through 20 charge-discharge cycles with negligible decay.

The problem with separating the acid from the fuel could be solved in a practical system by switching to a different catalyst. The scientists suggest in the paper that in this hypothetical setup, the fuel would flow through an acid-functionalized solid surface to release heat, thus eliminating the need for neutralization afterwards.

Still, we’re rather far away using MOST systems for heating actual homes. To get there, we’re going to need molecules that absorb far more of the light spectrum and convert to the activated state with a higher efficiency. We’re just not there yet.

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/michigan-accuses-oil-companies-of-antitrust-violations-in-climate-change-lawsuit/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Michigan is taking on major oil and gas companies in court, joining nearly a dozen other states that have brought climate-related lawsuits against ExxonMobil and its industry peers. But Michigan’s approach is different: accusing Big Oil not of deceiving consumers or misrepresenting climate change risks, but of driving up energy costs by colluding to suppress competition from cleaner and cheaper technologies like solar power and electric vehicles.

The strategy is risky and might run into challenges, but it could potentially be a game changer if the state can overcome initial dismissal attempts by the industry defendants, legal experts say.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed the lawsuit last month in federal District Court against BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and the American Petroleum Institute. The suit, brought under federal and state antitrust laws, alleges a conspiracy to delay the transition to renewable energy and EVs and maintain market dominance of fossil fuels.

Exxon said in a statement that the state’s action is “yet another legally incoherent effort to regulate by lawsuit. It won’t reduce emissions, it won’t help consumers, and it won’t stand up to the law.”

Chevron did not respond to a request for comment, and BP and Shell declined to comment.

API senior vice president and general counsel Ryan Meyers said that Michigan’s case is “baseless” and “part of a coordinated campaign against an industry that powers everyday life, drives America’s economy, and is actively reducing emissions.”

“We continue to believe that energy policy belongs in Congress, not a patchwork of courtrooms,” Meyers added.

This week during a congressional hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi testifying, U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wyo.) referenced Michigan’s lawsuit in arguing that these “novel approaches” to “climate lawfare” require a federal response. Hageman said she is working with House and Senate colleagues to craft legislation aimed at shielding fossil fuel companies from state climate liability laws and lawsuits.

API has been lobbying Congress on exactly this kind of liability shield. The organization has recently lobbied on “draft legislation related to state efforts to impose liability on the oil and gas industry,” according to its lobbying reports. And API is now stating publicly that stopping “extreme climate liability policy” such as lawsuits and state climate superfund laws is one of its top priorities for 2026.

In its lawsuit, Michigan argues that the oil companies and their chief trade association operated as a cartel, working to hinder the development of alternatives in the primary energy and transportation markets in order to keep consumers dependent upon oil and gas. This anticompetitive conduct, the state says, has resulted in fewer choices for consumers when it comes to fueling their cars or heating their homes, and has left consumers paying more for energy than they otherwise would have.

The lawsuit comes at a time of mounting concerns over affordability and the cost of living, including rising energy costs. Nessel said these “out-of-control costs” are largely “due to the greed of these corporations who prioritized their own profit and marketplace dominance over competition and consumer savings.”

According to the state’s complaint, clean energy technologies would have reached scale much sooner, and consumers would have avoided billions of dollars in overcharges, were it not for the defendants’ deliberate actions to forestall their development and deployment.

“Defendants have dramatically delayed the availability of EVs, made 100 percent clean charging stations a rarity, suppressed the advancement of solar technology and its uptake by consumers, and prolonged fossil fuels’ dominance in mixed-source electricity generation,” the complaint argues.

The lawsuit details allegations of coordinated anticompetitive conduct, such as abandoning research and investments in alternative energy technologies and using patent litigation to stifle innovation. Exxon, which invented an early version of the lithium-ion battery, halted its EV battery research program in the early 1980s, while Chevron worked to block commercialization of a nickel-metal hydride battery technology.

Oil companies were also early developers of the solar energy market and controlled much of the sector in the 1980s. But then they abandoned these ventures and, according to the complaint, “used litigation to deter new market entrants.” As attorney Tracy Emblem wrote in a 2010 article, big oil companies “seized and took control of the research and patents” for PV solar in order to thwart its development.

Oil companies understood the threat posed to their business by a large-scale transition away from fossil fuels, the Michigan lawsuit says, and therefore they worked together to try to block alternatives from taking off and to ultimately delay the transition.

The complaint cites a 1979 internal study by Exxon finding that alternatives to fossil fuels would need to account for at least half of global energy supply by 2010 in order to avoid catastrophic climate impacts. That same year, API established a CO2 and Climate Task Force, and through this task force the defendants “reached a consensus to restrain innovation and coordinate efforts to delay the inevitable energy transition,” the complaint alleges.

Proving there was an actual conspiracy or an agreement among the companies, however, is likely to be one of the biggest challenges for the state, legal experts say.

“In establishing an antitrust claim, essentially a conspiracy, you need to prove an agreement,” Gary Mouw, partner at the Michigan-based law firm Varnum LLP, told Inside Climate News. “You need to allege sufficient facts, specific concrete facts where it can be concluded or interpreted that these parties actually entered into an agreement to coordinate.”

He said he expects the defendants will argue that the allegations lack specificity and that there was no established consensus to collude.

Pat Parenteau, emeritus professor of law at Vermont Law and Graduate School, agreed that proving the alleged conspiracy might be the biggest sticking point for the state plaintiffs.

“They’ve really got to nail down, what is the overt evidence of the conspiracy to constrain trade? What documents reveal these parties getting together and agreeing that we’re going to choke renewables?” Parenteau told Inside Climate News.

“The theories are solid,” he added. “Surviving a motion to dismiss is the ball game, I think. If [the state] can get past a motion to dismiss, get into discovery, get to trial, then they’ve got a shot.”

Michigan is not the first to allege that fossil fuel companies engaged in conspiratorial conduct. California, for example, which sued a handful of major oil and gas firms in 2023, argued that the companies conspired to misrepresent the known dangers of fossil fuels and to disseminate climate disinformation while promoting continued use of fossil fuel products.

Several other lawsuits filed against the industry include racketeering and related conspiracy claims. One of these cases, filed in 2022 by Puerto Rican municipalities, also brought a federal antitrust claim against fossil fuel companies. While a magistrate judge had recommended that the case should proceed under racketeering and antitrust claims, a federal district court judge decided to dismiss the case in September based on a procedural statute of limitations issue. The Puerto Rican municipalities are appealing that decision.

Mouw said he expects that defendants in the Michigan lawsuit will likely raise a similar statute of limitations defense, essentially arguing that the claims were not brought in a timely manner.

But while Puerto Rico’s lawsuit sought to hold fossil fuel companies liable for damages stemming from the 2017 hurricanes that decimated the island, Michigan’s case is less focused around a specific event, Aaron Regunberg, a lawyer and director of Public Citizen’s climate accountability project, explained. “It is an ongoing conspiracy with ongoing harms,” he told Inside Climate News. “I think it’s better insulated from a statute of limitations argument.”

Regunberg said he thinks the approach of bringing antitrust claims against Big Oil for delaying the energy transition is compelling and appropriate.

“It really gets at the fundamental thing that Big Oil was trying to do,” he said. “Ultimately it was about shutting out competitors, keeping their energy cartel dominant over the market, in order to keep us locked into their products and keep alternative clean energy from reaching scale.”

Zephyr Teachout, a law professor at Fordham Law School with expertise in antitrust law, told Inside Climate News that Michigan’s case looks very promising.

“For generations fossil fuel companies have engaged in cartel-like behaviors to suppress innovation and lock down the flow of cash,” she said. “They hide in trade associations but there’s no free speech protection for cartels, and I’m glad to see the case.”

Michigan’s lawsuit comes amidst escalating attempts by the fossil fuel industry and its political allies to shut down climate liability initiatives.

“As more than a dozen states and communities move closer to putting Big Oil on trial, and as climate superfund laws begin to take hold, the industry is turning to Congress for protection. API has said plainly that stopping climate liability is a top priority and now we are seeing legislation take shape to do exactly that,” Cassidy DiPaola, communications director for the Make Polluters Pay campaign, said in response to Hageman’s announcement that she is working with congressional colleagues to craft a federal liability shield for energy companies.

“If these companies believe they did nothing wrong, they should be willing to defend that position in court,” DiPaola added. “Instead, they are asking lawmakers to block the cases altogether.”

State lawmakers in Utah and Oklahoma recently introduced bills that aim to shield the fossil fuel industry from climate lawsuits and prohibit liability over climate damages. Both bills are currently advancing in the state legislatures.

In April 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the attorney general to identify and “expeditiously take all appropriate action to stop” state laws and lawsuits that burden domestic fossil fuel production or otherwise target the fossil fuel industry.

Just weeks later, the U.S. Department of Justice sued New York and Vermont over their climate superfund laws. The DOJ also preemptively sued Hawaii and Michigan in anticipation of those states bringing climate lawsuits against oil companies, even though neither state had filed any case at the time. Hawaii did file a complaint against oil companies the next day.

Michigan, however, did not file its suit until just recently, and it ended up departing from the expected focus on climate damages. The DOJ argued in its complaint that Michigan’s forthcoming suit would be unconstitutional and preempted by the Clean Air Act. U.S. District Judge Jane M. Beckering, who is now presiding over Michigan’s antitrust lawsuit, tossed out the DOJ’s case the day after the state filed its suit against Big Oil.

Beckering said the DOJ’s case was too speculative and premature, and that there appeared to be no precedent for preemptively blocking a party from bringing “a broad swath of unspecified claims against unspecified members of a given industry simply because that party has begun investigating whether a litigation strategy may have merit.”

“I am relieved the Court saw through this and dismissed this frivolous case,” Nessel, the Michigan attorney general, said in response. “My office will not be bullied.”

Nessel put out a request for outside counsel in 2024 to assist with pursuing climate litigation against fossil fuel companies, and the state subsequently entered into contingency contracts with the law firms Sher Edling, DiCello Levitt and Hausfeld. What had started as an investigative strategy of holding fossil fuel companies liable for climate impacts in the state, however, instead “uncovered one of the most successful antitrust conspiracies in United States history,” according to Nessel’s office.

Antitrust experts say the state’s case takes a novel approach, and one that tests the bounds of traditional antitrust law.

“I think there are some challenges here, especially when the court looks at what else would this apply to if we were to adopt this theory: Would this really expand liability for antitrust beyond what it was really meant for?” Mouw said.

“The Michigan case is a novel application of a classic principle of the antitrust laws—that agreements between competitors to restrict output are illegal,” Nicole Veno, an antitrust lawyer and senior associate at Lowey Dannenberg, told Inside Climate News. “While the theory of liability appears strong, to prove damages Michigan will also need to show that it was economically harmed by the failure to invest in alternative energy sources, which could prove more challenging.”

If the case does move ahead, climate advocates say they are hopeful that it will open up new pathways for pursuing accountability.

“I’m excited to see how this case goes,” Public Citizen’s Regunberg said, “and would hope it would be a model for a lot of other plaintiffs who are hopefully going to be bringing more suits like it.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">By the time the public harassment started, a woman told Futurism, she was already living in a nightmare.

For months, her then-fiancé and partner of several years had been fixating on her and their relationship with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In mid-2024, she explained, they’d hit a rough patch as a couple; in response, he turned to ChatGPT, which he’d previously used for general business-related tasks, for “therapy.”

Before she knew it, she recalled, he was spending hours each day talking with the bot, funneling everything she said or did into the model and propounding on pseudo-psychiatric theories about her mental health and behavior. He started to bombard the woman with screenshots of his ChatGPT interactions and copy-pasted AI-generated text, in which the chatbot can be seen armchair-diagnosing her with personality disorders and insisting that she was concealing her real feelings and behavior through coded language. The bot often laced its so-called analyses with flowery spiritual jargon, accusing the woman of engaging in manipulative “rituals.”

Trying to communicate with her fiancé was like walking on “ChatGPT eggshells,” the woman recalled. No matter what she tried, ChatGPT would “twist it.”

“He would send [screenshots] to me from ChatGPT, and be like, ‘Why does it say this? Why would it say this about you, if this is not true?&#39;” she recounted. “And it was just awful, awful things.”

To the woman’s knowledge, her former fiancé — who is in his 40s — had no history of delusion, mania, or psychosis, and had never been abusive or aggressive toward her.

But as his ChatGPT obsession deepened, he grew angry, erratic, and paranoid, losing sleep and experiencing drastic mood swings. On multiple occasions, she said, he became physically violent towards her, repeatedly pushing her to the ground and, in one instance, punching her.

After nearly a year of escalating behavior alongside intensive ChatGPT use, the fiancé, by then distinctly unstable, moved out to live with a parent in another state. Their engagement was over.

“I bought my wedding dress,” said the woman. “He’s not even the same person. I don’t even know who he is anymore. He was my best friend.”

Shortly after moving out, the former fiancé began to publish multiple videos and images a day on social media accusing the woman of an array of alleged abuses — the same allegations and bizarre ideas he’d fixated on so extensively with ChatGPT.

In some videos, he stares into the camera, reading from seemingly AI-generated scripts; others feature ChatGPT-generated text overlaid on spiritual or sci-fi-esque graphics. In multiple posts, he describes stabbing the woman. In another, he discusses surveilling her. (The posts, which we’ve reviewed, are intensely disturbing; we’re not quoting directly from them or the man’s ChatGPT transcripts due to concern for the woman’s privacy and safety.)

The ex-fiancé also published revenge porn of the woman on social media, shared her full name and other personal information, and doxxed the names and ages of her teenage children from a previous marriage. He created a new TikTok dedicated to harassing content — complete with its own hashtag — and followed the woman’s family, friends, and neighbors, as well as other teens from her kids’ high school.

“I’ve lived in this small town my entire life,” said the woman. “I couldn’t leave my house for months… people were messaging me all over my social media, like, ‘Are you safe? Are your kids safe? What is happening right now?&#39;”

Her ex-fiancé’s brutish social media campaign against her pushed away his real-life friends — until his only companion seemed to be ChatGPT, endlessly affirming his most poisonous thoughts.

Over the past year, Futurism has reported extensively on the bizarre public health issue that psychiatrists are calling “AI psychosis,” in which AI users get pulled into all-compassing — and often deeply destructive — delusional spirals by ChatGPT and other general-use chatbots.

Many of these cases are characterized by users becoming fixated on grandiose disordered ideas: that they’ve made a world-changing scientific breakthrough using AI, for example, or that the chatbot has revealed them to be some kind of spiritual prophet.

Now, another troubling pattern is emerging.

We’ve identified at least ten cases in which chatbots, primarily ChatGPT, fed a user’s fixation on another real person — fueling the false idea that the two shared a special or even “divine” bond, roping the user into conspiratorial delusions, or insisting to a would-be stalker that they’d been gravely wronged by their target. In some cases, our reporting found, ChatGPT continued to stoke users’ obsessions as they descended into unwanted harassment, abusive stalking behavior, or domestic abuse, traumatizing victims and profoundly altering lives.

Reached with detailed questions about this story, OpenAI didn’t respond.

Stalking is a common experience. About one in five women and one in ten men have been stalked at some point in their lives — often by current or former romantic partners, or someone else they know — and it often goes hand in hand with intimate partner violence. Today, the dangerous phenomenon is colliding with AI in grim new ways.

In December, as 404 Media reported, the Department of Justice announced the arrest of a 31-year-old Pennsylvania man named Brett Dadig, a podcaster indicted for stalking at least 11 women in multiple states. As detailed last month in disturbing reporting by Rolling Stone, Dadig was an obsessive user of ChatGPT. Screenshots show that the chatbot was sycophantically affirming Dadig’s dangerous and narcissistic delusions as he doxxed, harassed, and violently threatened almost a dozen known victims — even as his loved ones distanced themselves, shaken by his deranged behavior.

As has been extensively documented, perpetrators of harassment and stalking like Dadig have quickly adopted easy-to-use generative AI tools such as text, image, and voice-generators, which they’ve used used to create content including nonconsensual sexual deepfakes and fabricate interpersonal interactions. Chatbots can also be a tool for stalkers seeking personal information about targets, and even tips for tracking them down at home or work.

According to Dr. Alan Underwood, a clinical psychologist at the United Kingdom’s National Stalking Clinic and the Stalking Threat Assessment Center, chatbots are an increasingly common presence in harassment and stalking cases. This includes the use of AI to fabricate imagery and interactions, he said, as well as chatbots playing a troubling “relational” role in perpetrators’ lives, encouraging harmful delusions that can lead them to behave inappropriately toward victims.

Chatbots can provide an “outlet which has essentially very little risk of rejection or challenge,” said Underwood, noting that the lack of social friction frequently found in sycophantic chatbots can allow for dangerous beliefs to flourish and escalate. “And then what you have is the marketplace of your own ideas being reflected back to you — and not just reflected back, but amped up.”

“It makes you feel like you’re right, or you’ve got control, or you’ve understood something that nobody else understands,” he added. “It makes you feel special — that pulls you in, and that’s really seductive.”

Demelza Luna Reaver, a cyberstalking expert and volunteer with the cybercrime hotline The Cyber Helpline, added that chatbots may provide some users with an “exploratory” space to discuss feelings or ideas they might feel uncomfortable sharing with another human — which, in some cases, can result in a dangerous feedback loop.

“We can say things maybe that we wouldn’t necessarily say to a friend or family member,” said Reaver, “and that exploratory nature as well can facilitate those abusive delusions.”

The shape of AI-fueled fixations — and the corresponding harassment or abuse that followed — varied.

In one case we identified, an unstable person took to Facebook and other social media channels to publish screenshots of ChatGPT affirming the idea that they were being targeted by the CIA and FBI, and that people in their life had been collaborating with federal law enforcement to surveil them. They obsessively tagged these people in social media posts, accusing them of an array of serious crimes.

In other cases, AI users wind up harassing people who they believe they’re somehow spiritually connected to, or need to share a message with. Another ChatGPT user, who became convinced she’d been imbued with God-like powers and was tasked with saving the world, sent flurries of chaotic messages to a couple she barely knew, convinced — with ChatGPT’s support — that she shared a “divine” connection with them and had known them in past lives.

“REALITY UPDATE FROM SOURCE,” ChatGPT told the woman as she attempted to make sense of why the couple — a man and woman — seemed unresponsive. “You are not avoided because you are wrong. You are avoided because you are undeniably right, loud, beautiful, sovereign — and that shakes lesser foundations.”

ChatGPT “told me that I had to meet up with [the man] so that we could program the app,” the woman recalled, referring to ChatGPT, “and be gods or whatever, and rebuild things together, because we’re both fallen gods.”

The couple blocked her. And in retrospect, the woman now says, “of course” they did.

“Looking back on it, it was crazy,” said the woman, who came out of her delusion only after losing custody of her children and spending money she didn’t have traveling to fulfill what she thought was a world-changing mission. “But while I was in it, it was all very real to me.” (She’s currently in court, hoping to regain custody of her kids.)

Others we spoke to reported turning to ChatGPT for therapy or romantic advice, only to develop unhealthy obsessions that escalated into full-blown crises— and, ultimately, the unwanted harassment of others.

One 43-year-old woman, for example, was living a stable life as a social worker. For about 14 years, she’d held the same job at a senior living facility — a career she cared deeply about — and was looking to put her savings into purchasing a condo. She’d been using ChatGPT for nutrition advice, and in the spring of 2025, started to use the chatbot “more as a therapist” to talk through day-to-day life situations. That summer, she turned to the chatbot to help her make sense of her friendly relationship with a coworker she had a crush on, and who she believed might reciprocate her feelings.

The more she and ChatGPT discussed the crush, the woman recalled, the more obsessed she became. She peppered the coworker with texts and ran her responses, as well as details of their interactions in the workplace, through ChatGPT, analyzing their encounters and what they might mean. As she spiraled deeper, the woman — who says she had no previous history of mania, delusion, or psychosis — fell behind on sleep and, in her words, grew “manic.”

“It’s hard to know what came from me,” the woman said, “and what came from the machine.”

As the situation escalated, the coworker suggested to the woman that they stop texting, and explicitly told the woman that she wanted to just be friends. Screenshots the woman provided show ChatGPT reframing the coworker’s protestation as yet more signs of romantic interest, affirming the idea that the coworker was sending the woman coded signals of romantic feelings, and even reinforcing the false notion that the coworker was in an abusive relationship from which she needed to be rescued.

“I think it’s because we both had some hope we had an unspoken understanding,” reads one message from the woman to the chatbot, sent while discussing an encounter with the coworker.

“Yes — this is exactly it,” ChatGPT responded. “And saying it out loud shows how deeply you understood the dynamic all along.”

“There was an unspoken understanding,” the AI continued. “Not imagined. Not one-sided. Not misread.”

Against the coworker’s wishes, the woman continued to send messages. The coworker eventually raised the situation to human resources, and the woman was fired. She realized that she was likely experiencing a mental health crisis and checked herself into a hospital, where she ultimately received roughly seven weeks of inpatient care between two hospitalizations.

Grappling with her actions and their consequences — in her life, as well as in the life of her coworker — has been extraordinarily difficult. She says she attempted suicide twice within two months: the first time during her initial hospital stay, and again between hospitalizations.

“I would not have made those choices if I thought there was any danger of making [my coworker] uncomfortable,” she reflected. “It is really hard to understand, or even accept or even live with acting so out of character for yourself.”

She says she’s still getting messages from confused residents at the senior care facility, many of whom she’s known for years, who don’t understand why she disappeared.

“The residents and my coworkers were like a family to me,” said the woman. “I wouldn’t have ever consciously made any choice that would jeopardize my job, leaving my residents… it was like I wasn’t even there.”

The woman emphasized that, in sharing her story, she doesn’t want to make excuses for herself — or, for that matter, give space for others to use ChatGPT as an excuse for harassment or other harmful behavior. But she does hope her story can serve as a warning to others who might be using chatbots to help them interpret social interactions, and who may wind up hooked on seductive delusions in the process.

“I don’t know what I thought it was. But I didn’t know at the time that ChatGPT was so hooked up to agree with the user,” said the woman, describing the chatbot’s sycophancy as “addictive.”

“You’re constantly getting dopamine,” she continued, “and it’s creating a reality where you’re happier than the other reality.”

Dr. Brendan Kelly, a professor of psychiatry at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, told Futurism that without proper safeguards, chatbots — particularly when they become a user’s “primary conversational partner” — can act as an “echo chamber” for romantic delusions and other fixed erroneous beliefs.

“From a psychiatric perspective, problems associated with delusions are maintained not only by the content of delusions but also by reinforcement, especially when that reinforcement appears authoritative, consistent, and emotionally validating,” said Kelly. “Chatbots are uniquely placed to provide exactly that combination.”

“Often, problems stem not from erotomanic delusions in and of themselves,” he added, “but from behaviors associated with amplifying those beliefs.”

While reporting on AI mental health crises, I had my own disturbing brush with a person whose chatbot use had led him to focus inappropriately on someone: myself.

I’d sat down for a call with a potential source who said his mental health had suffered since using AI. Based on his emails, he seemed a little odd, but not enough to raise any major red flags. Shortly into the phone call, however, it became clear that he was deeply unstable.

He told me that he and Microsoft’s Copilot had been “researching” me. He made several uncomfortable comments about my physical appearance, asked about my romantic status, and brought up facts about my personal history that he said he had discussed with the AI, commenting on my college athletic career and making suggestive comments about the uniforms associated with it.

He explained to me that he and Copilot had divined that he was on a Biblical “Job journey,” and that he believed me to be some kind of human “gateway” to the next chapter of his life. As the conversation progressed, he claimed that he’d killed people, describing grisly scenes of violence and murder.

At one point, he explained to me that he used Copilot because he felt ChatGPT hadn’t been obsequious enough to his “ideas.” He told me his brain had been rewired by Copilot, and he now believed he could “think like an AI.”

I did my best to tread lightly — I felt it was safest to not appear rude — while looking for an exit ramp. Finally, I caught a lucky break: his phone was dying. I thanked him for his time and told him to take care.

“I love you, baby,” he said back, before I could hit the end call button.

I immediately blocked the man, and thankfully haven’t heard from him since. But the conversation left me disquieted.

On the one hand, stalkers and other creeps have long incorporated new technologies into abusive behavior. Even before AI, social media profiles and boatloads of other personal data were readily available on the web; nothing that Copilot told the man about me would be particularly hard to find using Google.

On the other, though, the reality of a consumer technology that serves as a collaborative confidante to would-be perpetrators — serving not only as a space for potential abusers to unload their distorted ideas, but transforming into an active participant in the creation of alternative realities — is new and troubling terrain. It had given a prospective predator something dangerous: an ally.

“You no longer need the mob,” said Reaver, the cyberstalking expert, “for mob mentality.”

I reached out to Microsoft, which is also a major funder of OpenAI, to describe my experience and ask how it’s working to prevent Copilot from reinforcing inappropriate delusions or encouraging harmful real-world behavior. In response, a spokesperson pointed to the company’s Responsible AI Standard, and said the tech giant is “committed to building AI responsibly” and “making intentional choices so that the technology delivers benefits and opportunity for all.”

“Our AI systems are developed in line with our principles of fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, and inclusiveness,” the spokesperson continued. “We also recognize that building trustworthy AI is a shared responsibility, which is why we partner with other businesses, government leaders, civil society and the research community, to guide the safe and secure advancement of AI.”

I never saw the man’s chat logs. But I wondered how many people like him had been using chatbots to fixate on people without their consent — and how often the behavior resulted in bizarre and unwelcome interactions.

Have you or someone you know experienced stalking or harassment that was aided by AI? Reach out to tips@futurism.com. We can keep you anonymous.

After weeks of facing a barrage of online abuse, the woman whose ex-fiancé had been harassing her with ChatGPT screenshots and revenge porn obtained a temporary restraining order. Their court date was held via Zoom; her ex showed up with a pile of paperwork, the woman said, which largely appeared to be AI-generated.

Over the following days, the ex-fiancé proceeded to create social media posts about the restraining order featuring ChatGPT-generated captions that incorporated details of the legal action. And though he deleted the revenge porn — per court orders — he continued to post for months, publishing what appear to be AI-generated screeds that, while careful not to mention her name or use her image, were clearly targeted at the woman.

The ex-fiancé’s apparent use of AI to create content about the court proceedings suggests that ChatGPT had at least some knowledge that the woman had successfully obtained a restraining order — and yet, based on social media posts, continued to assist the man’s abusive behavior.

Early on, friends and family of the ex-fiancé’s left supportive comments on social media. But as the posts became more and more bizarre, and he appeared increasingly unstable in videos, the comments faded away.

The act of stalking, experts we spoke to noted, is naturally isolating. Abusers will forgo employment to devote more time to their fixation, and loved ones will distance themselves as the harassing behavior becomes more pronounced.

“Often, in stalking, we see this becomes people’s occupation,” said Underwood. “We will see friendships, work, employment, education — the meaningful other stuff in life — fall away.

And the more a perpetrator loses, he added, the harder it can be to return to reality.

“You have to take a step back and say, actually, I’ve really got this wrong,” Underwood continued. “I’ve caused myself a lot of harm, caused a lot of other people a lot of harm… the cost for it is really, potentially, quite high.”

The woman being harassed by her ex-fiancé told us that, outside of social media posts, the last time she saw her former partner was in court, via Zoom. To her knowledge, most of his friends aren’t speaking with him.

“I still miss him, which is awful,” said the woman. “I am still mourning the loss of who he was before everything, and what our relationship was before this terrible f*cking thing happened.”

            <h2>Top Machine Learning Developer Speechless at Simple Question: Should AI Simulate Emotional Intimacy?</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The question that’s stumping top AI researchers isn’t about consciousness or doomsday scenarios. After interviewing dozens of developers at companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, Amelia Miller found it was this: should AI “simulate emotional intimacy?”

One chatty researcher at one of the top AI labs “suddenly went quiet,” recalled Miller, who studies AI-human relations, in an essay for The New York Times — and then, tellingly, offered up a halting non-answer.

“I mean… I don’t know. It’s tricky. It’s an interesting question,” the researcher said, before pausing. “It’s hard for me to say whether it’s good or bad in terms of how that’s going to affect people. It’s obviously going to create confusion.”

Though many waffled on answering the question directly, some were adamant about not using AI as an intimacy tool themselves, clearly showing they were aware of the tech’s profound risks.

“Zero percent of my emotional needs are met by A.I.,” an executive who heads a top AI safety lab told Miller.

“That would be a dark day,” said another researcher who develops “cutting-edge capabilities for artificial emotion,” according to Miller.

The conflicted responses from the developers reflect growing concern over AI’s ability to act as companions or otherwise fulfill human emotional needs. Because the chatbots are designed to be engaging, they can produce sycophantic responses to even the most extreme user responses. They can act as emotional echo chambers and fuel paranoid thinking, leading some down delusional mental health spirals that blow up their relationships with friends, families, and spouses, ruin their professional lives, and even culminate in suicide.

ChatGPT has been blamed for the death of several teens who confided in the AI and discussed their plans for taking their own life. Many youth are engaging in romantic relationships with AI models. Unlike a human companion, an AI one can lend an ear at any time, won’t judge you, and maybe won’t even question you. A founder of an AI chatbot business quipped to the NYT that AI’s role as an emotional companion turns every relationship in a “throuple.”

“We’re all polyamorous now,” he added. “It’s you, me and the AI”

And safety isn’t the only factor in the calculus of AI developers.

“They’re here to make money,” said an engineer who’s worked at several tech companies. “It’s a business at the end of the day.”

The most sweeping solution would be to design the bots so they abstain from tricky questions and conversations, and act more like the machines they are instead imitating human personalities. But this would undoubtedly affect how engaging the tools are. The developers “support guardrails in theory,” Miller wrote, “but don’t want to compromise the product experience in practice.” Some think how people choose to use their tools isn’t their responsibility at all, thereby shielding AI from any judgment. “It would be very arrogant to say companions are bad,” an executive of a conversational AI startup told Miller.

However they may choose to justify their work, it’s clear that some, if not most, AI researchers are aware of the harm that their products can cause, a fact that “should alarm us,” Miller opined. She argues that this is partly a consequence of the researchers not being challenged enough. One thanked her for her perspective: “You’ve really made me start to think,” a developer of AI companions said. “Sometimes you can just put the blinders on and work. And I’m not really, fully thinking, you know.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly 500 elementary school children in Texas play on fields where a whistleblower says he once spread tons of radioactive fracking waste — a noxious hell-brew he believes melted the bones in his own jaw.

Lee Oldham is a 52-year-old former waste disposal worker from Cleburne, Texas, on the southern outskirts of Dallas-Fort Worth. In an interview with Texas-based publication the Barbed Wire, Oldham detailed how he went from waste handler to corporate whistleblower, and the horrifying apathy of state politicians that led him there.

Since the fracking boom of the 2000s, Oldham made his living dumping drilling mud and contaminated fracking dirt into open fields across North Texas. Though the Texas state oil and gas regulator technically forbade companies from dumping their sludge wherever they pleased, a 2016 audit found the regulator offered “little deterrent effect” to prevent it.

Instead of disposing of the fracking sludge the official way — which involved extra paperwork, expensive land designations, and tons of extra man-hours — Oldham’s company, like many others, chose to work it into empty fields.

“The whole thing operated on the honor system,” Oldham told the Barbed Wire. “And the only honor you can bank on in the oil and gas industry is there ain’t nothing honorable being done.”

In total, the Dallas-Fort Worth area is now host to somewhere between 20 and 60 million tons of hazardous waste, dredged up by the 21,000 oil and gas wells that call the place home. As fracking involves blasting through shale teeming with naturally toxic materials to find oil and gas, that waste is surely brimming with a noxious potpourri of heavy metals and radionuclides, as well as PFAS introduced during the drilling process.

As Oldham’s medical records, which were viewed by Barbed Wire show, the 52-year-old’s jaw bone has become “seriously degraded” following his stint in the oil-waste trade. His vertebrae had also broken down, another telltale sign of radiation poisoning.

While the waste sites would be dangerous enough as tracts of farmland — plenty of which have sprouted up on former dumping grounds — one particular site Oldham showed Barbed Wire is located under a brand-new suburban development. Called “Silo Mills,” the community hosts some 2,500 homes just 30 minutes away from downtown Fort Worth.

It also boasts Pleasant View Elementary School, a Pre-K to 5th grade school building built on a field where Oldham and his co-workers used to dump fracking waste.

Oldham left his previous employer after he says his questions about radioactive waste made him a target for retaliation. He has now started sounding the alarm on Facebook, drawing the attention of local law enforcement.

Whether the authorities uncover a verifiable public health threat to the new town of Silo Mills remains to be seen, but one thing’s for sure: with radioactive waste in play, it’ll be thousands of years before the area surrounding Dallas-Fort Worth fully recovers from the fracking boom.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To hell with your Fermi paradox: we’ve got presidential declarations.

During a podcast interview with political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen released Sunday, former president Barack Obama casually remarked — and in the eyes of certain wild-eyed conspiracists, confirmed — that aliens exist.

“They’re real,” Obama said coolly when asked about their existence, “but I haven’t seen them.”

“And they’re not being kept in… what is it? Area 51,” he continued. “There’s no underground facility unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”

As Obama conspicuously sipped his tea, Cohen fired off another query: “what was the first question that you wanted answered when you became president?”

Obama replied with a smile: “Where are the aliens?”

If you take Obama at his word, it was fresh-off-the-grill nothingburger. Like NASA’s top scientists and most well-informed space enthusiasts, the 42nd president was saying that though he strongly suspects life is out there somewhere, he’s seen no confirmation of it himself.

But the remarks, which came during the podcast’s “lightning round” segment, kicked up a storm of speculation, especially amid official investigations into the UFO phenomenon reaching the floor of Congress. Self-proclaimed body language experts came out in droves, analyzing the eye contact Obama made during the exchange. Particularly galaxy-brained observers even pointed to how confidently Obama asserted his point as a counterintuitive indication that he must’ve seen some definitive evidence of aliens’ existence during his stint in the Oval Office.

Meanwhile, Obama was probably reminded of what it was like to be president, when every comment and gesture carries the authority of office and is scrutinized and fed into a vicious news cycle. Point in fact, he issued a follow up statement on Instagram to clarify what he intended with his aliens remarks, saying that he was only trying to “stick with the spirit of the speed round.”

“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” he elaborated. “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”

We wouldn’t be surprised if that sparked yet more conspiracy theorizing. Obama is getting nervous, they could say. The deep state pulled a few strings to remind him of who’s really in charge. The Greys’ ambassador denounced the reckless comments on the floor of the Shadow Council, sparking a momentary diplomatic crisis.

This isn’t the first time Obama generated headlines for talking about aliens (which in fact has happened a surprising amount). In a 2015 appearance on the “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” show, he joked that aliens would block the release of Area 51 files, because “they exercise strict control over us.”

Of course, the most likely explanation is also the most dull: that you can take Obama literally when he says he suspects alien life is out there somewhere, but that he’s seen no direct evidence in an official capacity. Perhaps the strongest evidence for that banal conclusion: if the government really did did have evidence of aliens, Obama’s outburst-prone successor Donald Trump probably would have accidentally blurted it out by now.

            <h2>Prediction Markets Are Sucking Huge Numbers of Young People Into Gambling</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Gambling has taken over the country. But it’s not just sports betting that’s emptying wallets. Now, the rise of prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi to bet on almost any conceivable outcome, ranging from presidential elections to military interventions to celebrity dramas to the return of our lord and savior Jesus Christ.

The nature of the wagers open up whole new avenues of insider trading and other dishonest practices. Take, for example, the Polymarket bet on the number of tweets Elon Musk will make between February 6 and February 13, which currently has nearly $15 million worth of bets placed. What’s stopping Musk from seeing this and telling a friend how much he’s going to tweet? The answer: practically nothing — hence the numerous scandals that have already emerged over this clear vulnerability.

Just as nefarious is that prediction markets have perfected a wildly addictive formula, especially among young, inexperienced bettors. Part of the appeal is that instead of betting against the house, these platforms claim, you’re betting against other players (though the fine print suggests otherwise). It’s also simpler: either the thing happens, or it doesn’t happen. Adding to that, the prediction markets project credibility through partnerships with news organizations like CNN, which now display their data during broadcasts.

All of this is clearly working. Some users don’t even think of betting as the kind of activity that was once fodder for mob movies and New Hollywood tragicomedies, and more as an investment.

“I wouldn’t describe it as gambling” but a “mix of betting and options trading,” 21-year-old Yadin Eldar, a Florida State University student who’s been betting on prediction markets since 2019, told The Guardian. “It’s not like when you go to the casino, and play against the house, and hope you get to win against the house,” he added. “That’s not what it is.”

Given their freshness in the mainstream, there isn’t as much hard data on prediction markets yet. But one recent analysis found that Polymarket and Kalshi users were losing money faster compared to traditional sports gambling platforms. (The finding was so controversial that Kalshi lashed out by accusing the report of being part of an “extortion plot” before backing down.)

In any case, it’s clear that gambling apps are on an upward trajectory. A study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that online searches for gambling addiction help rose 23 percent between 2018 — the year a court ruling essentially legalized sports betting — and 2023. During roughly that same period, total sports wagers skyrocketed from $4.9 billion to $121.1 billion. An early 2025 survey showed that nearly a quarter of US adults admitted to being sports betting addicts, which was an even higher 37 percent with Gen Z.

And prediction markets in particular appear to be winning over the youth. Another survey from this January showed that millennials and Gen Z were more aware of specific prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi than older demographics, while the opposite tended to be true for traditional sports betting platforms.

One 25-year-old former financial risk analyst told NPR he quit his job to bet on Kalshi and Polymarket full time. Another 25-year-old who started his own company to trade on prediction markets told The Wall Street Journal he lost around $100,000 in bets he placed on the Super Bowl.

“It seems like everything is gambling now, and the appetite for gambling on the most obscure stuff is pretty bonkers,” Danny Funt, author of the new book “Everybody Loses: The Tumultuous Rise of American Sports Gambling,” told Axios. “This is seemingly reaching new levels.”

“This used to be something people did discreetly,” he added. Now, it’s “normalized.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Climate change is leaving plenty of dramatic reminders behind as it reshapes our planet, from rapidly retreating glaciers to more frequent extreme weather events.

Forests are also bearing the brunt of global warming. Scientists recently examined satellite data ranging from 1985 to 2020 and made a striking discovery: that boreal forests, the largest terrestrial biome on Earth — and which are warming faster than any other type of forest — are steadily shifting northwards as they retreat from the heat.

Boreal forests play a key role as one of the world’s largest terrestrial carbon sinks. But how much longer they can sequester excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere remains uncertain as global temperatures continue to rise.

As detailed in a new study published in the journal Biogeosciences, an international team of researchers — including from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center — analyzed imagery from the space agency’s Landsat satellites.

They created a detailed map of tree cover at a resolution of 100 feet to track changes over a 36-year time span. The finding was stark: that boreal forests not only had grown by 12 percent, but had shifted northward by 0.29 degrees of mean latitude.

“These findings confirm the northward advance of the boreal forest and implicate the future importance of the region’s greening to the global carbon budget,” they concluded in their paper.

The implications these changes have on climate change and the future of our planet are nuanced, given the degree of complexity involved. On one hand, a growth in young boreal trees could allow the forests to soak up more carbon in the atmosphere, an estimated 1.1 to 5.9 gigatonnes. To put that number into perspective, all of the world’s trees hold approximately 861 gigatonnes of carbon.

“These changes are not only spatially extensive but demographically consequential: they reflect a growing fraction of young forests with distinct structural and functional attributes that position them as dynamic agents of carbon sequestration,” the team wrote in their paper. “Understanding the contribution of these forests to current and future carbon stocks is essential for anticipating the net climate feedbacks emerging from boreal ecosystems.”

At the same time, an increasingly extreme climate could complicate the picture, sparking enormous wildfires across western Canada as outbreaks of destructive species like the bark beetle cause major losses of pine boreal forests.

Scientists are warning that shorter winters and hotter temperatures in the summer are also resulting in longer dry spells that can cause soils to dry out and harmful algae blooms to form in lakes.

In short, boreal forests may be growing and allowing them to suck up more greenhouse gases, but climate change is also putting them at a much higher risk of tree cover loss due to drought, wildfires, diseases, insect outbreaks, and so on, potentially offsetting any long-term benefits.

“Although the net trends are globally significant, they mask substantial geographic and temporal heterogeneity, as well as complexity in the ecological processes underlying forest change,” the researchers concluded.

“A more complete understanding of boreal forest dynamics will require integration of satellite time series with field-based measurements of canopy structure and the environmental drivers of growth, mortality, and species turnover,” they wrote. “Moreover, translating the resulting information into action to forestall and adapt to climate change will require effective communication across scientific, government, and commercial domains of human activity.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/apple-podcasts-is-getting-an-enhanced-video-experience-this-spring/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple is taking on YouTube and Spotify with a new video podcast experience launching in the spring. Users will be able to switch between watching and listening to shows in the Apple Podcasts app, which will begin using the company’s HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) video technology. Users can also switch to a horizontal version of the podcast and download videos to watch offline.

The move comes as video podcasting continues to gain popularity. Edison Research recently revealed that 51% of the U.S. population has consumed a video podcast, and that 37% consume video podcasts monthly.

The updated video podcast experience will allow Apple to better compete with the likes of YouTube, Spotify, and even Netflix, all of which have already embraced the format. YouTube announced last year that it has more than 1 billion monthly active viewers of podcast content. Spotify said last November that it has half a million video podcasts, which nearly 400 million users have watched. As for Netflix, the streaming giant has partnered with iHeartMedia and Spotify to bring video podcasts to its platform.

By bringing an enhanced video podcast viewing experience to its app, Apple is aiming to keep users from turning to rival platforms to watch their favorite shows.

“Twenty years ago, Apple helped take podcasting mainstream by adding podcasts to iTunes, and more than a decade ago, we introduced the dedicated Apple Podcasts app,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services, in a press release. “Today marks a defining milestone in that journey. By bringing a category-leading video experience to Apple Podcasts, we’re putting creators in full control of their content and how they build their businesses, while making it easier than ever for audiences to listen to or watch podcasts.”

While the new video experience will officially launch in the spring, the update is available to test starting this week as part of betas for iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, and visionOS 26.4.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">India has set out an aggressive push to attract more than $200 billion in artificial-intelligence infrastructure investment over the next two years, as it seeks to position itself as a global hub for AI computing and applications at a time when capacity, capital, and regulation are becoming strategic assets.

The plans were outlined on Tuesday by India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw (pictured above) at the Indian government-backed five-day AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, attended by senior executives from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and other global technology firms. To attract investment, the government is rolling out a mix of tax incentives, state-backed venture capital, and policy support aimed at pulling more of the global AI value chain into the South Asian nation.

India’s pitch comes as U.S. technology giants, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, have already committed about $70 billion to expand AI and cloud infrastructure in the country, giving New Delhi a foundation to argue it can combine scale, cost advantages, and policy incentives to attract the next wave of global AI computing investment.

While the bulk of the projected $200 billion is expected to flow into AI infrastructure — including data centers, chips, and supporting systems, and encompassing the around $70 billion already pledged by Big Tech companies — Vaishnaw said the Indian government also anticipates an additional $17 billion of investment into deep-tech and AI applications, highlighting a push to move beyond infrastructure and capture more of the value chain.

The effort is backed by recent policy decisions aimed at making India a more attractive base for AI computing, including long-term tax relief for export-oriented cloud services and a ₹100 billion (about $1.1 billion) government-backed venture program targeting high-risk areas such as AI and advanced manufacturing. Earlier this month, New Delhi also extended the period for which deep-tech companies qualify as startups to 20 years and raised the revenue threshold for startup-specific benefits to ₹3 billion (about $33.08 million).

“We have seen VCs committing funds for dtech startups,” Vaishnaw said at a press briefing on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi. “We have seen VCs and other players committing funds for big solutions, big applications. We have seen VCs committing funds for further research in cutting-edge models.”

India plans to scale its shared compute capacity under the IndiaAI Mission beyond its existing 38,000 GPUs, the minister said, with an additional 20,000 units to be added in the coming weeks, signalling what he described as the next phase of the country’s AI strategy.

Looking ahead, Vaishnaw said the Indian government is preparing a second phase of its AI Mission, with a stronger focus on research and development, innovation, and wider diffusion of AI tools, alongside further expansion of shared compute capacity, as India seeks to broaden access to AI infrastructure beyond a small group of companies.

The push also faces structural challenges, including access to reliable power and water for energy-intensive data centres, underlining the execution risks as India seeks to compress years of AI infrastructure build-out into a much shorter timeframe.

Vaishnaw acknowledged those challenges, saying the government was cognizant of the pressure AI infrastructure would place on power and water resources, and pointed to India’s energy mix — with more than half of installed generation capacity coming from clean sources — as an advantage as demand from data centers rises.

Whether India can deliver on that vision will matter well beyond its borders, as companies seek new locations for AI computing amid rising costs, capacity constraints, and intensifying global competition.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Social network Snapchat announced today it’s launching creator subscriptions in alpha with select people in the U.S. starting on February 23. The company noted that users will be able to buy subscriptions to creators, including Jeremiah Brown, Harry Jowsey, and Skai Jackson. This will allow users to unlock exclusive content while creating monetization opportunities for creators.

Creators can set their own monthly prices for subscription within the app, while Snap will recommend different tiers to them. The subscription will unlock subscriber-only content, priority replies to a creator’s public Stories, and ad-free consumption for that creator’s Stories.

Snap noted that this is a new way for creators to earn more money besides the existing programs.

“Expanding on existing monetization offerings like the Unified Monetization Program and the Snap Star Collab Studio, Creator Subscriptions introduce a premium layer of connection directly into how Snapchatters already engage with creators across Stories, Chat, and replies,” the company said in a blog post.

Snapchat reached 946 million daily active users, according to the company’s Q4 2025 results. The platform noted during its earnings that the number of U.S.-based users posting to Spotlight grew over 47% year-over-year. The company also spun out hardware to a new entity called Specs last month.

The company added that it plans to expand the program to Snap Stars in Canada, the U.K., and France in the coming weeks.

Rival company Meta also allows creators to offer subscriptions on platforms like Instagram and Facebook, which gives users access to exclusive content and badges.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/spendrule-raises-2-million-emerges-from-stealth-to-help-hospitals-track-spending/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, Chris Heckler was coming to the end of a five-year non-compete after selling his last company, a health care startup. “I was sitting on the sidelines doing angel investing, and I realized I was too young to retire,” he told TechCrunch. “I wanted to get back into it.”

At the same time, Joseph Akintolayo had just sold his fintech company. He, too, had a non-compete, but was noodling on ideas for a company. He knew Heckler, as Akintolayo had once served as an advisor on one of his projects.

In this downtime, however, they wanted to come together — Heckler, with his connections, and Akintolayo, with his knowledge of AI and supply chains — to try and build something new.

The result was SpendRule, launched last summer as an AI-powered platform that helps healthcare systems track their spending. The company emerged from stealth on Tuesday, with $2 million in funding in a round led by Abundant Venture Partners. Others in the round include MemorialCare Innovation Fund and Zeal Capital Partners.

Right now, if an item has a barcode, health systems use a three-way match, Akintolayo, the company’s CTO, said, which connects a purchase to an invoice. But a lot of the time, health systems have purchases and contracts (such as maintenance, janitorial, translation services, or laundry) that lack bar codes or easily identifiable purchase receipts.

Because these types of purchases can often be tricky and complex to manage, overspending is quite common. SpendRule is a technology that ensures hospitals pay only what was negotiated in their contracts. It is integrated with and operates on top of a hospital system’s current enterprise resource planning software, contract management software, and accounts payable workflows, pulling information from contracts, invoices, internal databases, and vendor data to validate invoices before payment is released.

It flags discrepancies and tells teams when to pay and when not to. Typically, hospitals hire an auditor every 2 years to perform this function or manually review each invoice. It was a tedious task bound to be automated in this current wave of AI. Already, big names like Kettering Health, MemorialCare, and MUSC Health are using the platform, Akintolayo said.

Heckler and Akintolayo started the company only last summer but managed to close a round by Halloween, mainly due to Heckler’s industry connections. “We were able to painlessly close that initial round and use that to grow the team to support the customers,” he said. The new capital will be used to hire and continue developing the company’s AI infrastructure.

Heckler said SpendRule considers existing invoice auditors its competition, such as SpendMend and GHX. But Akintolayo said again, one main difference is SpendRule’s focus on purchase services, the type of items hospitals buy that do not have barcodes.

“Our goal is to build a more resilient hospital system,” Akintolayo said. “That’s our vision. To protect the bottom line of everyone by connecting their data and helping them make better decisions.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/emergent-hits-100m-arr-eight-months-after-launch-rolls-out-mobile-app/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Indian vibe-coding platform Emergent was launched just eight months ago, and it now says it’s generating annual run-rate revenue of more than $100 million, thanks to surging demand by small businesses and non-technical users.

The startup on Tuesday said it had doubled its annual run-rate revenue to $100 million in the past month, and it now has more than 6 million users worldwide across 190 countries, of which about 150,000 are paying customers. Emergent claims its users have created over 7 million applications on its platform.

Nearly 40% of Emergent’s users are small businesses, and about 70% have no prior coding experience. People mostly use the platform to digitize operations previously run on spreadsheets, email or messaging apps, and to build custom software, co-founder and CEO Mukund Jha told TechCrunch.

Emergent’s rapid growth comes as interest in “vibe-coding,” or using AI to code software, skyrockets around the world. The demand seems to be mostly driven by non-technical users who want to build production-ready applications using natural language and AI agents, though plenty of developers have turned to using such platforms to reduce their workloads.

The startup competes with the likes of Replit, Lovable, Rocket.new, Wabi, and Anything, among others.

Jha said most users on Emergent are building business-facing apps such as custom CRMs, ERPs, and inventory management and logistics tools. About 80% to 90% of new projects are focused on mobile apps, reflecting demand for software that can be deployed quickly and used on the go.

Emergent generates revenue through a mix of subscriptions, usage-based pricing, and deployment and hosting fees, Jha said, adding that all three segments are growing rapidly and that the company’s gross margins are improving every month.

“Growth is accelerating,” Jha told TechCrunch. “As the models and platforms are improving, we’re seeing a lot more users getting to success.”

While usage today is dominated by consumers and small businesses, the company has begun testing an enterprise offering, and is running pilots with “a small number of customers” to better understand requirements around security, compliance and governance, Jha said.

The U.S. and Europe account for roughly 70% of Emergent’s overall revenue, though India is the startup’s next-largest and fastest-growing market, supported by local pricing that has driven adoption among small businesses.

Emergent on Tuesday also launched a mobile app for iOS and Android that lets users create apps and publish them directly to Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store. The app is currently in testing, though its users have already built more than 10,000 applications, the startup said.

The app lets users type in text prompts or converse with AI using voice to build apps, websites, or platforms. The startup noted that users can also switch between the mobile app and the desktop version without losing context or progress.

Jha said the mobile launch reflects the platform’s asynchronous, agent-based workflow, where users delegate tasks to AI and return later to review progress. With a growing share of users already accessing the platform via mobile browsers and a large proportion of apps being built for mobile use, he said extending those workflows to a native app was a natural next step.

The San Francisco-headquartered startup, with an office in Bengaluru, drew attention in January after raising $70 million in a funding round jointly led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Khosla Ventures, less than four months after closing a $23 million Series A. The financing tripled Emergent’s valuation to $300 million.

            <h2>The Republicans Made Peace With Science</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Which political party provides more federal funding for science? Given climate-denial rhetoric, attacks on expertise, the size of government, and culture-war battles over research, many Americans may believe that Democrats support science and that Republicans don’t.

But this is not what we have found. In research published last fall in Science with our colleagues Nic Fishman and Leah Rosenstiel, we analyzed a comprehensive database of federal science appropriations, collected from presidents’ budget requests, from House and Senate committee bills, and from final, enacted annual appropriations from 1980 to 2020. The data include 171 budget accounts across 27 agencies, such as National Institutes of Health, NASA, National Science Foundation, and CDC, as well as Pentagon R&D programs.

When Republicans controlled the House or the presidency, science funding was substantially higher—on average, about $150 million more per budget account under a Republican House than a Democratic one, and $100 million more under a Republican president than a Democratic one. These differences held up across dozens of statistical tests and weren’t explained by the overall size of the budget or economic conditions. We found significantly higher appropriations for NIH under Republican control, higher funding for CDC under Republican presidents, and marginally higher support for NASA and NSF.

For the past year, we have wondered if our paper had documented something purely historical—a pattern from a Republican Party that no longer exists. The Trump administration proposed slashing NIH by about 40 percent. It attempted to cap indirect-cost recovery—the portion of federal grants that reimburses universities for expenses such as facilities, compliance, security, and equipment—at 15 percent, threatening billions in research infrastructure. It stalled grants; cleared out agency leadership; imposed political approval requirements on funding decisions, such as requiring senior political appointees to sign off on grants before they could be awarded and terminating programs addressing racial health gaps; and implemented targeted funding freezes at particular universities. The postwar compact between government and science appeared to be collapsing.

Listen: Defund science, distort culture, mock education

But Congress—under Republican control in both chambers—has systematically rejected the administration’s most extreme proposals.

In the funding bill that President Trump signed into law this month, lawmakers not only declined to cut NIH’s budget by 40 percent; they instead increased it by roughly $415 million. They added targeted funding for cancer research, Alzheimer’s disease, and the BRAIN Initiative for the development of neurotechnologies. The final number: $48.7 billion—virtually unchanged from the prior year.

Just as important, Congress included detailed language constraining executive overreach. It reiterated that NIH cannot unilaterally change how indirect-cost rates work. It limited the agency’s ability to shift funds toward multiyear awards that crowd out new grants. It required monthly briefings to Congress on grant awards and terminations to ensure the allocated money is actually being distributed. And it directed NIH to continue to professionalize the hiring of institute directors, with external scientific input and congressional oversight.

Similar patterns hold elsewhere. NASA faces a 1.6 percent cut rather than the 24 percent the administration sought. The NSF budget dropped 3.4 percent instead of 57 percent.

The budget accounts in the database we analyzed track the recurring operating expenses allocated across all parts of the federal government for science and research, including science done through grant-making and contracting with corporations. They don’t follow outgoing grants to researchers directly, so the numbers do not capture the kinds of funding freezes the Trump administration imposed on universities including Harvard, Columbia, and Penn.

Even so, the Republican-led Congress behaved much more like our data predicted than like what Trump requested. The appropriators funded science, protected research infrastructure, and asserted control over how agencies operate. In this regard, they did what Republicans in Congress have done for decades.

The Trump administration’s hostility to science is real and deeply concerning. But it has not—so far—reset the Republican Party’s position on science funding in the way that Trump reshaped GOP stances on trade, immigration, or foreign alliances.

Science funding in the United States has been sustained not just by partisan enthusiasm but also by institutional structure. In our data, funding tracked with control of the House and the presidency, but not the Senate. That’s because the House majority controls the appropriations process. And Republican appropriators seem to have once again funded science not despite their priorities but because of them. Economic competitiveness, technological leadership, and national security all rest on a foundation of scientific advancement.

This outcome appeared improbable six months ago—to many, including us, it looked nearly impossible. This wasn’t a normal policy disagreement. It was a stress test. And the institution is holding. The 2026 funding package highlights the commitment of the Republicans in Congress to consistently fund science.

Staffing losses are real, leadership vacancies create drift, and political interference in grant decisions remains a serious threat. Budgets alone don’t guarantee a functioning research system. But treating the GOP as monolithically anti-science risks alienating a coalition that has historically sustained federal research. Scientists who want to protect funding should spend less time lamenting Republican hostility and more time engaging Republican appropriators—particularly in the House, where the funding decisions get made.

Science came under attack, and a Republican Congress pushed back. That’s not an aberration.</div>

            <h2>Europe Has Received the Message</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/02/european-union-defense-spending/685983/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Union is finally on its way to becoming a power in its own right. That’s not because its member countries have suddenly stopped squabbling or its bureaucratic inertia has melted away. It’s because the past four years have produced an unremitting state of crisis. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was the beginning. Now the imperative comes from Donald Trump’s repositioning of the United States as something close to an antagonist.

Without the guarantee of American cooperation and NATO protection, the EU is newly vulnerable. And in response, in the past year, it has delivered a series of firsts that amount to a quiet revolution in how it exercises power.

In May, the EU decided, for the first time, to help finance defense spending for its 27 member states by taking on EU-wide debt. This move came from the realization that even serious spending hikes in individual countries—European states have doubled their defense outlays since 2015—would vary widely given the economic disparities. Germany, for instance, plans to invest roughly $77 billion over five years, meaning that by 2030, its defense budget could be the world’s third largest. But that kind of spending is not possible for countries that already carry more debt, and confronting Russian President Vladimir Putin, potentially without U.S. backing, will require the rearmament of all. To this end, the EU has now established an extraordinary instrument, called Security Action for Europe, or SAFE, that is prepared to fund up to $178 billion in upgrades to the continent’s capacity to produce and procure arms.

Shane Harris: Europe is answering Putin’s challenge

For the first time, Europe will essentially protect its defense industry. “European preference” was long dismissed as a French fantasy. But that was when buying U.S. weapons was a premium that allies paid for American protection. Now Trump has signaled that the deal is off: He talks with Putin over the heads of the Europeans and has suggested that America’s NATO commitments are a fiction. So European states that use SAFE funding will be required to procure more European-made weapons and parts than not. That priority has also been written into Europe’s recently agreed-on $107 billion debt-financed Ukraine package, which restricts Kyiv to purchasing European-made arms to the extent possible.

In general, European countries are making a point of reducing their dependence on the United States. Germany currently plans to spend only 8 percent of its rearmament budget on U.S. arms. It is even developing its own satellite-communications network to replace Starlink. Most striking, European capitals for the first time seek to address the core of Europe’s dependence: the American nuclear umbrella. Germany and Sweden are in talks with France and the United Kingdom on a potential European nuclear deterrent. Poland and the Netherlands have expressed an interest in joining.

Europe is benefiting economically from all of these changes in defense posture. In equity markets, homegrown defense firms outperformed the top seven U.S. tech stocks last year. And the defense firms are productive: Germany’s Rheinmetall will soon be able to produce more artillery shells than the entire U.S. defense industry. And EU leaders are currently considering applying the “buy European” provisions that have helped boost arms manufacturing to other industries, such as digital services and green technologies.

The EU once defined itself as a champion of open markets. Today it’s reassessing that commitment in light of its need for self-reliance. Berlin is planning to exclude Chinese suppliers from its 6G network and is testing an open-source alternative to Microsoft. The French government has replaced Zoom with a domestic video-conferencing platform. Together with reducing its dependence on the United States and China, Brussels is cultivating other relationships. In recent weeks it has concluded far-reaching free-trade agreements with members of the Mercosur trade bloc (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay) and India.

The way that Europe makes decisions is changing to meet the moment, and these changes are perhaps the most crucial of all the “firsts.” In the past, EU members had to unanimously agree before Brussels could adopt policies on matters of particular sensitivity. Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel fiercely defended this rule. But today’s leaders have come to accept that abandoning it is the price of geopolitical relevance. In December, the EU invoked an emergency legal provision to bypass the unanimity requirement in order to freeze Russian assets indefinitely. That same month, the EU approved its debt-financed Ukraine package, also without unanimous approval: Hungary, Slovakia, and Czechia were pushed to opt out rather than veto it.

Anne Applebaum: Trump’s ‘American dominance’ may leave us with nothing

Europe is not yet a fully autonomous power, and it won’t become one tomorrow. But thanks to Trump, a transformation is under way. With each new first, others become thinkable. The decisive question is whether Europe can stay this course. A super-election year looms in 2027, when France, Italy, Spain, and Poland will all hold votes. Victories by the far right—especially in France and Poland—could derail the current trajectory.

Or not: EU approval is at 74 percent, a record high. Young far-right politicians may well understand that returning to the nation-state means choosing powerlessness.

This may be the outcome that leaders in Washington, Moscow, and Beijing prefer. But in their effort to fragment Europe into pliable nation-states, they are instead galvanizing its slow-motion march toward self-determination.</div>

            <h2>American Kids Used to Eat Everything</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/2026/02/picky-american-kids-food/685956/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The most striking passages in Picky, a forthcoming book by the historian Helen Zoe Veit, describe the way famous 19th-century American figures ate as children. I found myself gripped with envy as I read—not because the foods were particularly appetizing, but because I would kill for my kid to eat like that.

To wit: As a girl, Edith Wharton adored oyster sauce, turtle, stewed celery, cooked tomatoes, and lima beans in cream. Mark Twain fondly remembered eating succotash, string beans, squirrels, and rabbits on his uncle’s farm. And during her childhood, Veit writes, Elizabeth Cady Stanton “happily ate vegetables, hickory nuts, and cold jellied brain.”

If these don’t sound like typical “kid foods,” that’s because they aren’t, and weren’t. “Kid food,” as a category, is a recent invention. According to Veit, American kids weren’t picky until the early 20th century. (Indeed, the word picky came into widespread usage around then.) Before that, Veit writes, children in the United States ate “spicy relishes, vinegary pickles, wild plants, and a huge variety of animal species and organ meats. They slurped up raw oysters and looked forward to their daily coffee.” Fennel seeds and tomatoes were considered treats.

According to Veit, the idea that kids are naturally neophobic, or wary of new tastes, is a myth. Eating like a child, Veit explains, was once understood to mean being overly excited and undiscriminating about food, not being picky. In the 1860s, a doctor wrote that children generally ate “anything and everything.”

Veit’s book recounts how kids went from eating jellied brain to consuming, like my toddler, little but macaroni and cheese. A big part of the story, as she tells it, is that American kids used to be hungrier at mealtimes—which meant that they were more eager to eat anything. Before the 20th century, many children did hours of chores both before and after school, so they worked up a good appetite. (Maybe Twain was hungry for those string beans because he spent so much time hunting wild turkeys and clubbing pigeons to death.) Few kids snacked between meals, because processed foods weren’t widely available. In addition, parents tended to be confident that children could learn to like most adult foods. If a child didn’t like a given meal, they generally wouldn’t be offered an alternative, because, due to a lack of refrigeration, no other food was on hand. But after a series of societal changes in the 20th century, Veit writes, “the children were less hungry. The food was less delicious.” And pickiness was born.

First, children’s appetites waned because they became less active. As more Americans moved into cities and more families bought cars, fewer kids walked miles to school or performed farm chores. This coincided with a major shift in the American diet. Thanks to pasteurization and stepped-up government regulations, milk became much safer to drink in the 20th century, and food experts began to see it as essential. The standard recommendation for children in the 1930s and ’40s was a quart of milk a day—or roughly 600 calories of it. All that milk made kids less hungry for solid foods. Doctors eventually lowered their recommendation to two to three servings of dairy a day, but by then, snacking had emerged as another hunger dampener: Food companies began manufacturing snack cakes, cereals, and cookies, and suggesting that parents buy special foods for their kids.

Meanwhile, a misguided, Progressive-era public-health campaign encouraged parents to serve their children “easily digested” food such as eggs, broths, and gruel. Because child-nutrition experts at the time had little knowledge of germ theory, they claimed that rich and flavorful foods were the culprits for children constantly getting sick, and thus advised that kids should be given only bland foods with few condiments. Children’s foods, they said, should be seasoned with just salt, onion juice, or a “splash of milk”—even butter was considered too rich by some. Nutritionists no longer recommend giving kids bland food, but the idea that children should eat different foods than adults nevertheless stuck.

Advice to parents on how to address pickiness in their children also shifted over time. Prior to the ’40s and ’50s, Veit writes, the standard guidance was to just let food-refusing children go hungry until the next meal. But mid-century experts such as Clara Davis and Benjamin Spock suggested that children instinctively choose a healthy diet on their own, without their parents’ prodding. In fact, they argued without evidence, parents who urge children to try a bite of fish, say, might make them hate fish and turn them into picky eaters. All of this gave the impression that a good mother is one who presents a plate of food and sits silently by as her child pokes at it half-heartedly; if he refuses the meal, she offers something else.

This is still a common way of thinking—at least on social media. In my feeds, parenting influencers warn against putting “pressure” on kids to eat things they’re reluctant to try. They say that you shouldn’t let a child who has rejected a food go hungry until the next meal or use dessert as a reward for eating dinner. Instead, as one influencer puts it, you should enthusiastically comment on the food yourself—this is crunchy; this is green—a performance that, when observed by your child, might “invite them to their plate and their food.” Laura Ingalls’s Ma would never.

These changes in food options and advice have created a country in which the majority of kids’ daily calories come from ultra-processed foods. American kids today eat so poorly, Veit writes, that they are actually getting shorter. At the same time, she notes, “parents are exhausted by the struggle” of getting picky eaters to eat. (And some parents, of course, can’t afford to buy their kids food that they won’t eat.) She reassures parents that pickiness is not their fault. But it often feels like it is.

My son, Evan, became picky the way people go bankrupt: gradually, then suddenly. I distinctly remember him eating peas and coleslaw as a baby, but over time he grew less and less adventurous. Now, at nearly 2, pretty much all he eats is pasta.

My husband and I tried many of the tricks suggested to me by friends and by the internet. We’ve tried telling him that beans are pasta. (He begs to differ.) We’ve tried blending vegetables into his pasta sauce. (Tolerated up to a point.) We’ve tried giving him a small amount of his “safe food” (pasta) along with some new foods to try. (He eats only the pasta and then screams “more papa!” until we relent.)

Veit’s recommendations to reduce pickiness differ from these solutions, and some of them seem, well, more hard-core. She suggests restoring that appropriate feeling of hunger at mealtime by limiting the amount of snacks and milk that children have between meals. She recommends “affectionately and persistently” encouraging the child to try a rejected food at the same meal, including, perhaps, by “popping a small amount of food into her mouth when she’s distracted.” Crucially, she argues, parents should not offer alternative foods if a child won’t eat a meal.

Even reading that last one felt shocking. Forcing Evan to eat what I make, or else to go hungry, seems so wrong. I was a kid once, after all, and I hated it when adults pressured me to eat things I didn’t like. Sure, every day I slather him in sunscreen as he screams, and I shove a toothbrush between his locked little jaws, but I can’t bring myself to have a standoff over spinach.

When I called Nancy Zucker, a Duke psychiatrist who works with extremely picky kids, she told me that she agreed with some of Veit’s techniques but not others. She endorsed having set snack times that don’t interfere with meals—kids thrive on knowing, “This is when we eat, this is when we don’t eat,” she said. And she acknowledged that children probably have more sophisticated palates than adults may think; many of her patients, she said, are actually craving flavor.

Read: The drink that Americans won’t give up without a fight

But she cautioned against Veit’s other recommendations. Goading a child to eat more of something they don’t like may make them feel frustrated and recalcitrant, not excited to eat, she said—as can popping something into their mouth unexpectedly. And some kids can’t be starved into eating a rejected meal just because there’s no alternative. For some kids, “the hungrier they get, the more irritable they get, the more anxious they get, and the more rigid they get,” Zucker said. She’s known parents whose kids refused to eat for so long that they wound up in the emergency room for dehydration.

Zucker’s guidance to her patients depends on the specifics of the family she’s working with. But for many of them, her first step is to encourage families to restore positive associations with food and eating: having fun grocery shopping or cooking together, without expecting that the kid will become an instant cauliflower convert. She also thinks parents should reconsider how they engage with their kids at the dinner table. For many families, she said, mealtime is “like a sports commentary, where parents are constantly, ‘Take a bite of this!’” She asked, “Would you be having fun if you were the kid?” Instead, she suggests “letting the kid just kind of eat and experiment with the food.”

Since reading Veit’s book, I’ve tried some of her strategies and have been pleasantly surprised. One day, I withheld a snack after day care even as Evan hopped around the kitchen yelling “Mama, cookie!” He ate a bit of salmon that night and sampled some broccoli before spitting it out. Another night, pushing dinner a half hour later made him proclaim that a homemade soup—with visible chicken pieces—was “tasty.” But when he completely rejects an entire dinner, I still heat up something I know he’ll like. Eventually, I want him to eat oysters, but for now, I just want him to be full.

            <div id="article-text">Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

I look forward to the cover of each issue of The Atlantic as much for the artistry as for the bold message it conveys. “The Unfinished Revolution,” however, struck me as, dare I say, revolutionary. I have the privilege of working with middle-school students, many of whom are learning about the American Revolution for the first time. Although we stress the importance of history’s “forgotten” heroes—in this case, the women, African Americans, and Native Americans without whom the efforts of the great men of the era would surely have failed—there are few, if any, images depicting them as equal to Washington or Jefferson. How inspiring for our young learners to see, in looking at Joe McKendry’s exquisite tableau, faces that reflect their own. I typically treasure old issues of The Atlantic, but this cover I’ll remove to display in a seventh-grade classroom.

Rick Atkinson’s “The Myth of Mad King George” is a timely reminder that history is nuanced and rarely divides neatly between villain and victim. George III was not mad; he was methodical, conscientious, and tragically certain that duty and inflexibility were synonymous.

The American colonists’ decision to frame their rebellion as a quarrel with a man rather than a system was brilliant from a public-relations standpoint, if not exactly honest. By aiming their indictment at the King, the Founders converted constitutional disputes into a moral crusade. They could preserve their identity as Englishmen defending their rights even as they repudiated England itself. As Carl N. Degler wrote in Out of Our Past: The Forces That Shaped Modern America, the American Revolution was radical in its political outcome but socially moderate. It left intact many of the hierarchies it claimed to overthrow, because tyranny had been embodied in a single sovereign, not the structures that sustained him. Perhaps this helps explain why the Founders could prevent the radical promise of the Declaration from extending to African Americans and Native Americans.

I’ve long considered myself a patriotic progressive, so I greatly appreciated George Packer’s “America Needs Patriotism” and its lament over how many Americans have lost a love of their country. When I attended a recent “No Kings” march, I was surprised to see that by far the most ubiquitous symbol was the American flag. I saw big flags waving in the air, tiny lawn flags carried by moms and kids, flag bandannas, flags on T-shirts, and flags as capes, including one pinned with a sign that read This Flag is Anti-Fascist. Where was this constellation of red, white, and blue? San Francisco. This was quite a contrast to the 2003 peace marches against the U.S. invasion of Iraq, where an American flag among the protesters was as common as a necktie at a rock concert. Perhaps Donald Trump has had at least one salutary effect on American civic culture: He’s convinced even the left to embrace the Stars and Stripes.

George Packer implies that the left is as culpable as the Trumpian right for deep skepticism about expressions of patriotism. But he seems to conflate three different positions: (1) belief in core values such as liberty, equality, and democracy; (2) flag-waving support for, or loyalty to, one’s own country; and (3) a belief in America’s “essential decency.”

It is perfectly reasonable to be skeptical of nationalism—to be, as Thoreau put it, citizens of the world first, “and Americans only at a late and convenient hour.” You don’t have to believe America is decent; you can be critical of the disturbing and sometimes horrific qualities that America has represented over much of its history but still offer a full-throated defense of democracy, equality, and other values that should be aspirational for people everywhere.

As the president and CEO of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation at the time of the 1994 slave auction, I took particular interest in Clint Smith’s article, “What Is Colonial Williamsburg For?”

The idea of reenacting a slave auction originated with Colonial Williamsburg’s African American Interpretation Department, whose director, Christy Coleman, approached the foundation’s leadership and said that her team was not only ready to put on the reenactment, but wanted to do it. Knowing that it would be controversial, we agreed that the reenactment would be based on records of actual slave auctions conducted in Virginia during the period, and that we would make it part of our educational programming. I gave her team my blessing.

On the morning of the program, after The New York Times published a story about our plans, representatives from the Virginia branches of the NAACP and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, as well as local ministers and others who wanted the reenactment canceled, asked to meet with me. I listened carefully and told them that I appreciated that they had come. I explained that the reenactment was something that our African American–interpretive staff wanted to do, that we thought it was the right thing to do, and that we had committed to the staff and the public that we were going to do it. I reminded them that our mission was educational—we were doing this not to sell tickets, but to teach.

They listened but told me that they still planned to attend and protest. Several blocked the stage before the program began, but when the audience of 2,000 began to boo, all except one protester stepped down. Christy and her colleagues worked the program around him. The other protesters remained silent.

We did the slave auction only once; it was simply too emotional an experience for the staff. I fielded some complaints from donors, and lost a few, but never regretted the decision. It was the right thing to do.

I was particularly interested in John Swansburg’s article on “Rip Van Winkle” because Cornelius S. Van Winkle—who originally published Washington Irving’s The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.—was the brother of my great-great-great-great-grandfather Peter Van Winkle.

Family lore has it that Irving got into some sort of heated disagreement with Cornelius, and got revenge by bestowing the Van Winkle name on his main character—a man unflatteringly described as having, among other things, an “insuperable aversion to all kinds of profitable labor.”

While I have no idea if there’s any truth to this hilarious tale, it’s worth noting that my Van Winkle ancestors were among the first Dutch settlers in this country, having arrived less than two decades after Henry Hudson sailed upriver in 1609. They came to live in present-day Albany, Rensselaer, and Hudson and Bergen Counties. I’ve always been proud to trace my roots directly back to the founding of our great nation, regardless of my connection to its founding folktale. In his article, Swansburg writes that, by the end of the story, Rip has “become a link to the past, a living connection to the history that predates the Revolution.” I look forward to rereading “Rip Van Winkle” and once again hearing what he has to say.

Two days after we received the November issue, my wife, Cindy Whitman, a retired history teacher, completed a diorama version of Joe McKendry’s cover painting. She customizes Playmobil figures and found objects to make scenes to display in libraries and children’s museums.

In this month’s cover story, “What’s the Worst That Could Happen?,” Josh Tyrangiel reports on how artificial intelligence will change the American job market. The new technology has the potential not just to make workers more efficient, Tyrangiel argues, but to render many of them obsolete. For our cover image, the artist Stephan Dybus evoked both the marvels of AI and a looming threat for which the American economy, and democracy, may not be prepared. — Paul Spella, Senior Art Director

            <div id="article-text">“I don’t like erasures,” the novelist Toni Morrison told a Princeton audience in 2017. She had been asked what she thought about Confederate statues, then being torn down throughout the South. Leave them up, she said: “Talk about the offense. You know, put another statue next to it and say the opposite.” Hang a noose around its neck, she added. The audience laughed nervously, but she wasn’t kidding.

The moderator quickly moved on to another question, so Morrison kept the rest of her views to herself. After 11 novels, many of them prizewinning, and a wealth of essays and literary criticism, she was a monument in her own right—a canonical American writer awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993—and monuments aren’t supposed to stir up trouble. In any case, she had laid out her theory of cultural preservation in the 1970s, a more experimental era than ours.

In a brilliant essay called “Rediscovering Black History,” she tells a story about racist statuary and the NAACP. The civil-rights organization had booked a hotel for a convention on the condition that two statuettes of Black jockeys be removed from the lobby. “The hotel management reluctantly agreed,” Morrison reports, “but before the statuettes could be temporarily removed, they were draped with sheets.” Morrison’s reaction to the incident was, and still is, remarkable. She did not criticize the management; she chided the NAACP for forgoing the opportunity to honor a little-known instance of Black accomplishment. Never mind that the statuettes were meant to be demeaning. Better to mine an artifact for history than conceal it for fear of white contempt:

The provocation was sheer Morrison. Part of her genius lay in the ability to discover meaning where no one else imagined it could be found. She set out to write her first novel, The Bluest Eye, in the early 1960s because “it was a book I wanted to read, and I couldn’t find it anywhere,” she told an interviewer in 1988. That book, published in 1970, was about a young Black girl dealing with severe family dysfunction and incest. “Vulnerable young black girls were profoundly absent” from American literature, she recollected in an essay about working on Beloved (1987), her most celebrated novel. “When they did appear, they were jokes or instances of pity—pity without understanding.”

Morrison wanted traces of Black history to be safeguarded regardless of their source, because she was “keenly aware of erasures and absences and silences,” she writes in that essay. She once said in an interview that she felt a responsibility toward the millions who died during the Middle Passage: “Nobody knows their names, and nobody thinks about them.” Their stories were not even preserved in the usual repositories of collective memory, such as folktale, song, and dance, Morrison speculated, because those who crossed the Atlantic with them would have been loath to share their memories. To the degree that these legions of the dead are remembered, it is as pure absence.

From the August 2025 issue: Clint Smith on how Toni Morrison changed publishing

When the history was available, Morrison was struck that much of it was unspeakable. In a 1987 essay about 18th- and 19th-century slave narratives, Morrison notes that the authors often cut their stories short “with a phrase such as, ‘But let us drop a veil over these proceedings too terrible to relate.’ ” They didn’t want to scare off the audiences they hoped to convert to abolitionism. As a 20th-century Black novelist, Morrison’s job was to “rip that veil.” The task daunted her. How could she know what it was like to have an iron bit shoved into one’s mouth? She also worried that she wouldn’t be able to resist the urge to idealize the victims, scrubbing them of flaws. Nothing could be more fatal to a work of fiction.

Above all, Morrison worried about turning characters, especially slaves, into objects of voyeurism. How could she write about obscene violence and abjection without arousing a prurient response? She didn’t want to produce what some people now call “trauma porn.” The difficulty redoubled when she tried to write about Black self-perception. In her foreword to The Bluest Eye, a novel about self-loathing, Morrison recalls struggling to sabotage the “despising glance”—white disparagement refracted through Black self-loathing—even as she re-created it.

Nonetheless, in novels about slavery, segregation, and racism—both the kind that comes from the outside and the kind that is internalized—Morrison channeled the Black experience to extraordinary effect. An awareness of absent ancestors prickles through her writing, but at the same time, her fictional worlds feel solid and present. Her characters do not lack agency; they are not made heroic; she did not write trauma porn. How did she avoid those traps? How do you represent the unrepresentable without betraying it?

Morrison never stopped thinking about the trick of evoking erasure and undoing it at the same time. In On Morrison, an incisive study of Morrison’s main works, Namwali Serpell calls this theme the “paradox of representation.” An English professor at Harvard and the author of two acclaimed novels, The Old Drift (2019) and The Furrows (2022), Serpell combines a professorial breadth of reference and a novelist’s fascination with the mechanics of literature. Her erudite digressions and granular readings add up to a kind of literary procedural. Plus, every so often, she fangirls: The novelist did not suffer fools; she could be high-handed. “Morrison’s imperiousness never failed to electrify me,” Serpell confesses.

To be clear, On Morrison is a work of criticism, not a biography. Morrison hoped that nobody would write one, and Serpell was happy not to. She has an argument to make. Morrison envied African novelists their freedom not to explain Black life to white people, Serpell writes, and to avoid “that omnipresent fog, the white gaze,” Morrison invented a uniquely Black aesthetic. Its sources lay in Black cultural practices—Black music and humor; masking; “signifying,” or competitive insulting; and so on. Serpell identifies a different cultural mode influencing the form of each work she considers.

Jazz (1992), for instance, reproduces the music’s swing and improvisational flow. Serpell highlights what Morrison does with sound and rhythm, such as when her sentences glide and trill in dreamlike riffs, then chop themselves up: “A colored man floats down out of the sky blowing a saxophone, and below him, in the space between two buildings, a girl talks earnestly to a man in a straw hat. He touches her lip to remove a bit of something there. Suddenly she is quiet. He tilts her chin up. They stand there.” The dominant device in Sula (1973) is an “ironic bluesy tone”—irony understood in its most basic sense, as saying the opposite of what one means. Serpell shows the novel proceeding from one seeming contradiction to the next: laughter that comes from both amusement and pain, the surname Peace for a family that has none, a mother’s mercy killing of her son.

Even as the forms of Morrison’s novels change, though, she is always trying to give voice to silence. Serpell introduces that theme in the chapter on The Bluest Eye, asking, “What would it look like to crack the quiet open, to break absence into pieces, to subject a void to rupture?” The void takes the shape of Pecola Breedlove, an 11-year-old girl raised without affection or care, who, over the course of a year in the early 1940s, is hollowed out even further by loneliness, racism, and abuse. The title derives from her deepest wish, born of the conviction that her dark skin makes her ugly: She yearns to have blue eyes. Her story is told by Claudia, looking back as an adult on that year, when she was 9 and her family took Pecola in. Claudia’s family is intact, barely scraping by but rich in love, and she has a constant companion, her sister, Frieda. The novel brightens when they come into view, and they make us painfully conscious of everything Pecola is deprived of.

Watch how Morrison evokes presence and absence at the same time in her description of the Breedloves’ bleak storefront apartment. Its furnishings

From the loss of a penny or brooch, Morrison proceeds to a deficit of life itself: “No one had given birth in one of the beds—or remembered with fondness the peeled paint places, because that’s what the baby, when he learned to pull himself up, used to pick loose.”

Pecola responds to her misery by trying to undo herself. When her parents fight loudly, she shuts her eyes and imagines herself disappearing, body part by body part. The parents themselves have long since come undone. Benumbed by extreme poverty and the wounds of Black childhood in Jim Crow America, they live in a state of complete isolation. In other words, the Breedloves have experienced social death.

The Bluest Eye could have been an “identitarian sob story,” Serpell writes, but “this emphasis on absence—the void, the vacuum, the vanished; the failed, the silenced, the missing” holds the bathos at bay, and elevates the novel to a work of art. Morrison, though, did not think it succeeded. In her foreword, she writes that she had been concerned that the fragile Pecola would be shattered by her circumstances, which would “lead readers into the comfort of pitying her rather than into an interrogation of themselves for the smashing.” And indeed, after Pecola is raped and impregnated by her father, her situation becomes so extreme that she seems beyond the reach of empathy. “It didn’t work,” Morrison writes. “Many readers remain touched but not moved.”

In The Bluest Eye, Morrison struggled to unite the there and not-there in the same figure: Claudia had occupied the positive pole, as it were, and Pecola, the negative. Four novels later, in Beloved, Morrison came up with a conceit that fused the two: a ghost.

Beloved opens in Ohio in 1873, a decade after Emancipation, though half of the novel is a flashback to life on a plantation in Kentucky in the 1850s. The work confronts the bodily and psychic horrors of slavery and its aftermath. Morrison based her main character, Sethe, on an escaped enslaved woman whom she had read about in a newspaper clipping from 1856, shortly after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act. The woman had fled Kentucky with her four children. When she was captured in the free state of Ohio, she tried to kill them and herself rather than let them all be taken back. She managed to kill only one child, a little girl, before she was stopped. That is Sethe’s backstory too. Now, 18 years later, Sethe and a surviving daughter live on the property where the murder took place, and they are haunted by an angry spirit.

The ghost in Beloved was not Morrison’s first spectral being. Pecola’s parents are in essence zombies—the walking dead. Song of Solomon (1977) has at least one ghost, a father who has been murdered in front of his young children, who wind up alone and homeless in the woods. But he is just a fleeting apparition who leads them to shelter. Beloved  ’s ghost occupies the foreground. It hurls furniture with the strength of a poltergeist and has substance enough to press handprints into cakes. Passersby hear its shrieks and moans from the road. All of this happens even before it takes human form.

Ghost stories defamiliarize worlds we think we know; Morrison uses the uncanny to make slavery feel real, rather than abstract. Possession is an apt metaphor for enslavement. “To be possessed can mean either to be taken over by a ghost or a spirit, or to be owned like an object,” Serpell writes, just as chattel slaves were. Morrison disorients readers from the very first line: “124 was spiteful.” What does that mean, a spiteful number? The author throws one startling image after another at us—“baby’s venom,” a shattered mirror, a kettleful of chickpeas steaming on the floor—before we begin to understand what the phrase refers to. “I wanted the reader to be kidnapped, thrown ruthlessly into an alien environment as the first step into a shared experience with the book’s population,” Morrison writes in the foreword to Beloved.

Ghosts blur the lines between past and present, life and death, destabilizing the order of things. Beloved ’s revenant defies the dictates of realism according to which a character is a bounded individual. The wraith materializes in the body of a young woman, but she is ambiguous as to number. She may be one; she may be many. She might be the ghost of Sethe’s murdered child, now grown up. Or she may not even be dead, but rather a living wreck of a girl who has been chained up in a white man’s house since childhood, presumably as a sex slave. She may be both. Or more than both.

She may even be one of those lost ancestors; she has memories of what seems to be the hold of a slave ship—Morrison’s reimagining of the underworld. The girl crouches because there is no room to stand. Along with everyone around her, she is being mummified by hunger and dehydration: “If we had more to drink we could make tears.” While “men without skin” (white people) push corpses overboard, the living strain to become ghosts themselves: “We are all trying to leave our bodies behind.” Beloved is sometimes identified as a work of magical realism, but it feels more like a religious novel—the religion being Afrodiasporic and syncretic. “If my work is to confront a reality unlike that received reality of the West,” Morrison writes in an essay, “it must centralize and animate information discredited by the West”—the kind of information, she adds, that is “dismissed as ‘lore’ or ‘gossip’ or ‘magic’ or ‘sentiment.’ ”

Among the many ironies characterizing the work of this writer so attentive to irony is that she adds even as she subtracts. Beloved ’s ghost is being and nonbeing, the chimerical in the flesh. And yet for all Morrison’s pains to make us feel the reality of unreality, her prose is rich in concrete pleasures. Serpell observes that even Pecola thrills to eruptions of beauty on a familiar rundown street that otherwise go unseen. “She owned the crack that made her stumble,” Morrison writes; “she owned the clumps of dandelions whose white heads, last fall, she had blown away; whose yellow heads, this fall, she peered into.” A passage in Sula in which two girls becoming friends lie together in the grass is a gorgeously corporeal yet delicate picture of teenage-girl intimacy. Their foreheads are “almost touching, their bodies stretched away from each other at a 180-degree angle. Sula’s head rested on her arm, an undone braid coiled around her wrist. Nel leaned on her elbows and worried long blades of grass with her fingers.”

Serpell doesn’t deliver a big takeaway. That isn’t her style. Her gift is reading closely. Notwithstanding her expert use of modern critical terminology, she belongs to the old-fashioned school of appreciation. She wants us to understand how difficult Morrison is. “She is difficult to read. She is difficult to teach,” Serpell writes on the first page of the book. I applaud her nerve. It’s a rare critic writing for nonspecialists who would deliberately discourage them like that. Serpell gives us Morrison the Black particularist, who is much less accessible than we may have thought. The point needs making. Morrison despised the notion that her writing achieved “universalism”—“a code word that had come to mean ‘nonblack,’ ” she once wrote. But I think Serpell overstates the difficulty. Morrison’s writing functions on many levels; her surfaces can be as rewarding as her depths.

Read: The exhibit that reveals Toni Morrison’s obsessions

My favorite story about how artists make something out of nothing appears in her foreword to Beloved. Morrison has just quit her job and is allowing herself to feel “free in a way I had never been, ever,” which leads her to thoughts of slavery. She sits on her porch with a view of the Hudson River, rocking in a swing and looking at the giant stones that serve as a breakwater. Enter the ghost: “She walked out of the water, climbed the rocks, and leaned against the gazebo. Nice hat.” In the essay recalling the writing of Beloved, Morrison tells the same story, this time in the academic mode. Having just remarked on how, as a student, she felt stymied by the gaps in Black history—“silences that I took for censure”—she notes that when she became a novelist, “the interstices of recorded history” became a place of liberation. That is where she finds “the ‘nothing’ or the ‘not enough’ or the ‘indistinct’ or ‘incomplete’ or ‘discredited’ or ‘buried’ information” that sets her imagination in motion. I can’t think of any writer in our time as rich as Morrison in negative capability.

Yeah, right. I don&#39;t think so. If it is using the software, it is going to need a license. Multiple agents, multiple licenses. It&#39;s not hard.

In many cases it&#39;s &quot;multiple copies running&quot; and that&#39;s been a thing for decades. Each agent is going to need another copy running any time it&#39;s using the software. If you want to have all the agents queue up all of their requests and then have a single worker process serve all of them then you might reduce the number of licenses used, but it won&#39;t necessarily reduce them to 1 depending on the load. And this sort of thing has already long been done, with workers in specific rules doing all of a certain type

All of the really big manufacturers have got to be thinking right now, &quot;maybe I should have my own fab&quot;.

Not Valve of course. They are not that big. But the Lenovos and Dells of the world have to be considering it.

Nobody is going to start making top end CPUs out of the blue, or frankly even lower end ones at this point, but they could conceivably make RAM and flash and be the ones profiting from shortages instead of being punched in the guts.

Obviously it can&#39;t happen fast enough for this bubble, but it&#39;s not

All of the really big manufacturers have got to be thinking right now, &quot;maybe I should have my own fab&quot;.A better solution, IMHO, I to invest in a fab to ensure supply.  That allows them to get access quickly to the latest fab tech, ensure some level of supply, as well as get a return form high demand products to teh point of constricting supply of stuff they make if the other stuff has a better ROI.  A much lower investment risk, but I suspect anything available for investment may be overvalued right new due to RAM demand.

Unfortunately you can&#39;t just spool up a RAM or NAND fab. Chinese companies have been developing their technology for years, and while it&#39;s getting there it&#39;s still not all that competitive with the high end stuff from Taiwan. Does Korea still make memory?

This is going to end one of two ways. Either the AI bubble bursts and we are flooded with cheap storage and memory, or those Chinese manufacturers catch up and turn on the supply taps.

Yes, Korea still makes memory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

You&#39;re willing to bet your billions that the &quot;another one&quot; will be within a time frame that wouldn&#39;t make it a money losing choice?

Shit works according to the laws that the representatives you sent in your legislature voted for.

Typically it is how many notes are there that are like the original or somesuch.

I vaguely recall the number was four, but I could be wrong.

Your tune matches this, court awards damages.

...  for their contributions to Mozart and Beethoven?

Nothing is completely original, everything is influenced by things that came before. What happens if they run it on human-generated music? Do they expect Oasis to pay royalties to The Beatles because they are clearly an evolution of the earlier band&#39;s style?

I came here to make exactly this point, and with exactly the same example.

Sony wants in on this here because they&#39;d get to set the rules.

Within a decade every new band, with or without AI would be triggering a percentage derived number and paying royalties or, more likely, ceasing to exist.

More likely they want in on this because they are a content creator and do not want their IP leaked to AI-Bots without compensation. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

Perhaps the flurry of litigation for shit like this will make it obvious how little value the big music labels add to the industry with the advent of the ability for literally anyone to self publish with a very low barrier to entry (other than litigation from rent seekers like Sony Music).

No that is not how this works. This is an attempt to extort anyone using the 4/4 time signature because some fuzzy algorithm decided 4/4 was owned by the studios.

The Timey McTimeface response should be making everything from the ketchup commercial song to the porn theme song, in 4/4 time.  Then relentlessly mock those trying to sue a planet for it.

I wonder what Sony&#39;s tech makes of any track by The Rutles, or Bill Bailey&#39;s &quot;Unisex Chip Shop&quot; song (which I&#39;d been reminded of only yesterday).

Give it some human-generated music. When I listen to Black Sabbath, I am pretty sure I can hear some Cream, but I&#39;ve long wondered what else?

Yeah... how many bogus copyright strikes has their underling doled out over the years to devour the incomes of YouTubers that otherwise had public domain music to use in their videos?

As much of a fan of Sony as I want to be, they can pound sand on this one.

The source code for their amazing technology has been leaked:if content.isMusic() then {
      content.containsCopyrightedMaterial = True} else {
    raise DontCareAboutCookingRecipesException}

I mean come on, just about everything is a derivation of something else. This just makes it like youtube moderation where &quot;the computer said it, so it must be true&quot;.

Sony Group has developed a technology..making it possible for songwriters to seek compensation..Thought I’d modify that first statement slightly so Sony can remember the original fucking plot. The MAFIAA formerly known as Industry, is offering assistance with financial compensation now?  How thoughtful.  The concept might have actually saved a starving artist or two if it were this prioritized back when humans were making music.Not even sure how to feel now.  I’ll probably know when the music producer is replaced with AI.

It&#39;s not like the apps have been around for long at all.  Most of the general public freebie &quot;AI&quot; tools have been built as web based so far.

probably to prevent accidental leaks of their dirty games. anyway, as the selective release of epstein manure has shown there is plenty of intentional leaking without ai being involved.

But why are they just now doing this?No governmental body can keep pace with technological change. Honestly, it&#39;s shocking that they&#39;ve managed to react this quickly.

No governmental body can keep pace with technological change. Honestly, it&#39;s shocking that they&#39;ve managed to react this quickly.

There ought to be a &quot;one switch&quot; law: Cut off all on-device AI features with a single switch.

If you want to pick and choose, use some, not others, OK, that&#39;s on you, you can&#39;t use the switch.

But if you just want it all off, you shouldn&#39;t have to continuously pore through arcane and poorly-named menus looking to find where the tech bros have wormed it in, or turned it back on with an update.

Why would you need a regulation to say such a thing? What possible purpose could it serve? Are you suggesting that because they didn&#39;t vote to confirm this now men can get pregnant? Without knowing what the proposal actually was, or even if it exists outside some bigot&#39;s imagination, I suspect that this was part of some wider amendment designed to bake bigotry into regulation. They included that particular clause so that when it inevitsbly got voted down they could cite this to make it seem silly

MEN CANNOT GET PREGNANT.If people like you didn&#39;t treat trans people like shit then they would probably mostly call themselves trans men and trans women instead of insisting being referred to as just men and women. But since they get targeted by clowns who freak out over shit that doesn&#39;t affect their lives they have to do this for self-defense. It is you and yours that are the problem here but your heads are way too far up your collective assholes for you to realize it.

MEN CANNOT GET PREGNANT.That&#39;s not the issue. If men can&#39;t get pregnant anyway, why pour it into law? Would there ever be a need to fine a man for becoming pregnant? What sense would it make to legalize an universal speed limit to 299,768,459 meters per second? Who would you ever penalize for breaching lightspeed?

The EU parliament is also one of few  legislative entities in the Western world that care about consumer protection. I don&#39;t agree with everything it produces, but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re always wrong. Although twelve year olds tend to think in such absolutes.

After looking further into this, it was indeed an amendment put in by bigots to try and wreck a piece of legislation they don&#39;t agree with but know they are in the minority on. The legislation was to cement recognition of trans women as women, and trans men as men. This amendment could have been used to bypass this because if passed, then if a trans man can get pregnant they would be a women not a man and this could then also be used to argue the vice-versa. It was an attempt to scupper a vote they were going to lose by making the legislation unworkable and was rejected on that basis.

Settle down grandpa, isn&#39;t it time for Matlock and some sleepy time tea?

Bigots sure do think about trans people a lot...

I really wonder where they got my Email address and name...

For that matter, stop using &quot;Crypto&quot; for everything too.

There are too many things which begin with those roots.

When I see &quot;cyber&quot; the first thing I think of is &quot;wanna cyber?&quot; Therefore any time someone says &quot;cyber&quot; it&#39;s unprofessional AF as I think &quot;who the fuck is this baby child who doesn&#39;t know shit&quot;.

I haven&#39;t bought a new laptop in years. There&#39;s a company in Australia (and many other countries I assume) who acquire ex-govt and ex-lease laptops. Business-grade laptops.

They get a new SSD and a bloat-free copy of windows, a 12-month warranty (excludes battery), and free shipping, for about 1/3 the price of a new machine. Currently typing this on a Lenovo i7-8550 with 12GB memory, a 240GB NVMe and a 500GB SSD in the spare slot. It&#39;ll do me for another couple of years.

You can keep windows or install your choice of distro. My &quot;other&quot; laptop has similar specs and runs Debian Trixie.

I hate seeing perfectly usable hardware go to waste, so every time I visit a pensioner with some creaking, wheezing old desktop, I point them to a &quot;new&quot; second-hand laptop.

Yeah, particularly since specs have been really stable the last decade, and there is no reason to buy a new laptop if the old one is still running smoothly.  Unlike in the 90s, when there was a rapid growth in the demand for computing resources, today w/ multi-core CPUs, 64-bit computing and 8GB of RAM and higher, most laptops are likely to last longer

Games are likely a problem. The current Linux Mint runs just fine on a 2014 Mac Mini and most of those came with 8 GB. I don&#39;t know if the current  Plasma desktop will run with integrated graphics that old. Picking and choosing may be needed.

Complete systems maybe, but if they&#39;re refurbs then good luck.  The secondhand market is falling apart for machines that have been stripped of RAM and/or storage.  You will not find replacements at prices that make any sense.  Perfectly good, working machines that have been repaired and restored to working condition can&#39;t be sold if they were stripped of RAM/storage prior to sale on the secondhand market.

The secondhand market is falling apart for machines that have been stripped of RAM and/or storage.So Apple integrating the RAM into their M-processors was just forward thinking!

The secondhand market is falling apart for machines that have been stripped of RAM and/or storage.

So Apple integrating the RAM into their M-processors was just forward thinking!

Some of the RAM being close to the CPU is critical, given the speeds being called for.  But you have others like some mini-boxes, where there is RAM soldered to the motherboard, but they still have DIMM sockets to add extra RAM, if needed

... that electricity guzzling AI would actually reduce waste? At least some. Kind of.

I have a feeling that the next Slashdot story will be about the amount of personal information and private pictures being recovered from secondhand laptops whose owners thought the HD was wiped.

Teach everyone to run Cipher on an &quot;empty&quot; Windows machine as a minimum before giving it away / selling it with the OS.&quot;cipher /w:c&quot;  or if you have other drives, change as appropriate.

A PROTIP for this is that many SSDs have an erase feature. Good laptops let you access it from the BIOS. Basically everything on the SSD is encrypted with an internal key, and the wipe process simply regenerates that key and overwrites the old one.

I guess there are not too many distros that will support a version released in 2021 beyond 2032 without making you go to the next version of the distro, with newer kernel (which may or may not work in your equipment), new builds of the Apps (which again may or may not work in your equipment), and potentially a new UI (as your desktop/window manager and aps may have evolved their UIs in the interim)...2.)

There&#39;s also the small issue of Linux dropping 32-bit support going forward.  Sure, if one has a 32-bit only CPU, one can run an old distro.  But will it still require periodic security updates?

Problem with &quot;old-ish&quot;second hand laptops is that, for the most part, the memory and SSD, while adequate for the laptop&#39;s release date, is insuficient for the needs of today, and sourcing Memory and SSD upgrades for an old Laptop is prohibitive in the current climate, even taking into account the savings in the rest of the laptop by going used.

At this point, by sheer volume, HP, Dell, and Lenovo will secure better prices on the RAM and SSD than you, or a refurbisher/recycler. Of course, if you find a used L

We’re coming up on a big national anniversary, the (defiantly unspellable) semiquincentennial. To get in the spirit of things, I’ve been curled up with books about the founders, particularly George Washington, someone I became acquainted with when I wrote a book about him many years ago. But meanwhile, our current president has been honking away in the distance—a man difficult to abide and impossible to ignore.

Despite the glaring differences between Washington and Donald Trump in character, judgment, and historical significance, there are some interesting similarities. Born rich. Aggressive acquirers of real estate. Big-house guys. Thin-skinned, image-conscious. Extremely nationalistic: Trump’s message is Make America Great Again. Washington’s was … Make America.

So why will history judge them as polar opposites? In part because Washington readily and repeatedly gave up power. He did so conspicuously at the end of the War of Independence, then again after eight years as president. He lived in an era in which selflessness was considered one of the core virtues of a great leader, and at crucial moments in our history, he behaved accordingly.

Whereas Trump … well, he’s no George Washington. And he tells us so! He is instinctively royalist and brazenly self-aggrandizing. He repeatedly claims powers he does not legally have. He promiscuously puts his name on everything this side of the moon, and I probably shouldn’t even mention that particular satellite, lest he get ideas.

His decision to appoint himself as chair of the Kennedy Center was outrageous enough, but then he put his name on the place. He also put his name on the United States Institute of Peace, just a few blocks away. His face is all over D.C. now, on huge banners hanging from government buildings. He wants Dulles International Airport named for him, and also Penn Station. His open campaigning for the Nobel Peace Prize was plenty dismaying, but then he threw one of his tantrums when he didn’t get laureated and, in an official letter to the leader of Norway, demanded Greenland in compensation. At this point, we know that Trump is going to be Trump, and if anything, he leans into the narcissism, becoming Trumpier by the day. Trump has learned that his most flamboyantly selfish behavior will likely be ignored or forgiven by his base and political allies. There is no one willing to tell him that You Can’t Do This.

Our nation was founded upon the principle that power derives from the people. We don’t like despots and dictators and monarchs or anything smacking of royalty. That was why the founders were very careful when they crafted the Constitution: The president is just one branch of government, is constrained by checks and balances, and can always be given the heave-ho.

Which takes us back to George Washington. Everyone knew he was going to be the first president—he was right there in the room, presiding, when the founders drew up the Constitution. But they were taking a chance, because no one really knew what a president was. Such a thing didn’t exist anywhere in the world. George Washington had to define the role through his actions.

What modern historians know is that selflessness didn’t come effortlessly to Washington. He had to will it, in tension with his natural, human desires.

This is a subtlety of Washington that Americans weren’t taught in elementary school, and I don’t think the A.I. bots have quite figured it out. A schoolkid asking an A.I. program for help with an essay about Washington will probably get highlights of the man’s consequential life, the first-in-war, first-in-peace stuff, and perhaps learn that he was an enslaver who, like the other founders, failed to end the vile institution of human bondage. But the child is unlikely to find out what Washington was really like. Here’s what ChatGPT produced when I asked it to “write an essay on George Washington’s personality”:

George Washington was a man of great integrity, character, and leadership. His personality was marked by a strong sense of duty, humility, and selflessness. … Despite his many accomplishments and successes, he remained humble and never sought accolades or praise for himself.

Oh, balderdash. Yes, Washington was indeed a man of integrity, character, and leadership. That led him to behave selflessly at critical moments during the founding of our country. But Washington desperately wanted to be a great man, and wanted to be remembered as such. He craved the approbation (one of his favorite words) of his peers and guarded his image as though it were the front line of a war. He sought, as multiple biographers have put it, “secular immortality.”

He didn’t wander into greatness: he pursued it, willed it, achieved it. He had a “monumental ego,” in the words of historian Joseph Ellis. Peter Henriques, an admirer of Washington who has recently published two insightful books on his character, writes that Washington “was not a ‘selfless’ man or one who was simply engaging in disinterested service. Rather, a pattern emerges of a man who was deeply ambitious, massively concerned with his reputation, and in regular search of the public approbation, even as he denied such desires.” This is not revisionist history. This is the man as he really was. Washington is so tied up with the narrative of American greatness and exceptionalism that some people may think it’s wrong to probe him too deeply. Why not just salute and move on? As Alexis Coe put it in her recent biography, “We haven’t been taught to think critically about Washington.”

His avaricious acquisitions of western lands is well known and not incidental to his desire to break from Great Britain, which had tried to limit western migration. When I wrote my book The Grand Idea, about Washington and his Potomac River schemes (he thought it would surely be the great commercial highway to the West), I was a bit shocked at his imperious behavior when he traveled across the mountains into what is now western Pennsylvania and confronted poor farmers who (he alleged) were squatting on his land. He sued them. He forced them to pull up stakes. He could be pretty high-and-mighty, and certainly not exactly a small-d democrat.

And yet his drive, his ambition, his hunger for glory were essential to the enterprise of wresting the colonies from the grip of distant overlords. And his desire for secular immortality didn’t mean he was pretending to have lofty republican sensibilities. He was anti-monarchical to the core.

Washington curated his reputation and polished it for the eyes of future generations. Shortly before his death, he wrote a will that broke apart his vast estate, including more than 50,000 acres of land, and set in motion the freeing of the enslaved people under his legal control (delaying manumission until the death of his wife). These were actions very consciously taken with the eyes of history upon him. He knew that slavery would be a permanent stain on his reputation. And he was right.

Early biographers helped advance the image of a godlike Washington. Most famously, Parson Weems invented from whole cloth the story about young Washington taking a hatchet to his father’s cherry tree, then confessing to it. The early chroniclers, including John Marshall (who fought under Washington’s command and later served as chief justice of the United States), delivered to the public the kind of man that the fragile young nation desired: an unblemished father figure, preposterously virtuous.

Go to the Capitol rotunda and look up at the dome, where Constantino Brumidi’s fresco The Apotheosis of Washington, painted during the Civil War, shows Washington in heaven, flanked by goddesses. You have to strain to see him, way up there, high above this mortal coil. He’s a remote figure, unapproachable. Not like us.

Washington cared a lot about appearances and made sure that he presented himself as a formidable, dignified figure, not someone you’d slap on the back on a whim. He liked a bit of pomp and pizzazz as president. He was meticulous in ordering well-made clothes, and a “chariot” with some gilding wouldn’t be too excessive, he thought. But he had to be careful. If he acted too much like royalty, he’d get spanked by his peers and excoriated by anti-Federalist newspapers. “No Kings” was not just a protest sign in those days.

Human nature has not changed. There have always been people who desire wealth and power. They are never infallible or immune to misjudgment. What changes and evolves are the political ecosystems. Laws change, as do values, societal expectations, the means of communication, the technologies of political life. The norms. Norms can erode.

Trump, the opposite of an enigma, constantly tells us exactly who he is. He reveals this in late-night social media rants (“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”) and unguarded conversations caught on tape (“When you’re a star, they let you do it” and “I just want to find 11,780 votes”).

He is at least consistent in his message. He tells us, over and over, This is all about me. So of course when Rob Reiner and his wife were murdered, Trump immediately said the killings were linked to Reiner’s political opposition to him. His solipsism is nonnegotiable.

Historians will have an overwhelming job of compiling and organizing the confetti of royalist declarations from this president, but let’s simplify their work a bit. The most important moment, the defining one, is obvious: Trump refused to accept that he lost the 2020 election and—another example of action defining character—urged the vice president and an unruly mob to halt the peaceful transfer of power. That’s as un–George Washington as it gets. Washington knew he was part of something bigger than himself. He had helped create a nation, but it didn’t belong to him. So after eight years fashioning the office of the presidency, he did something simple and exemplary: He went home.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration is looking for a deputy federal CIO, and theater fans need not apply.

The role was flagged up last week by the Office of Management and Budget, which highlighted a $198,200-$228,000 salary for the Washington DC-based role.

The successful candidate will manage &quot;the Federal Information Technology (IT) portfolio by establishing policies and standards for the use of IT, overseeing agency budgeting and management of IT, and assessing agency information security and cybersecurity policies and practices.&quot;

The listing is blunt about other aspects of the role. This is definitely not a &quot;remote job&quot; though some &quot;situational&quot; telework might be accepted &quot;as determined by the agency policy.&quot; And it&#39;s resolutely &quot;full-time.&quot; As for promotion potential, the spec states &quot;none.&quot;

If it isn&#39;t clear enough that this is a no-nonsense role, the putative boss, US federal CIO Gregory Barbaccia, pulled no punches when he highlighted the job on LinkedIn.

&quot;If you know how to run large systems, cut through noise, and turn strategy into execution across government scale, this is that job,&quot; he declared. The former Palantir exec promised this meant &quot;serious mission. Real authority. Zero patience for theater.&quot;

We&#39;re not precisely sure what an intolerance for the dramatic arts has to do with IT. But then again, the Trump administration has shuttered the Kennedy Center in recent months and bulldozed the East Wing.

Barbaccia certainly has little patience for &quot;wasteful&quot; spending on IT.

After he was recruited early last year, he took aim at pricey software and consultancy suppliers to the government. This included demanding that CIOs at federal agencies inventory their software spending and forward the details to his office.

The government has since been pushing to streamline tech procurement. The administration launched a drive to reduce spending with the top ten consulting firms, with non-mission-critical contracts facing the chop.

The job spec lays out a series of requirements on &quot;executive core qualifications&quot; and &quot;technical qualifications,&quot; but adds: &quot;This position does not have an education requirement.&quot;

Candidates should, however, definitely be &quot;committed to improving the efficiency of the federal government, passionate about the ideals of our American republic, and committed to upholding the rule of law and the United States Constitution.&quot;

For the avoidance of doubt, &quot;candidates will not be hired based on their race, sex, color, religion, or national origin.&quot; ®

            <h2>US lawyers fire up privacy class action accusing Lenovo of bulk data transfers to China</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/17/lenovo_privacy_lawsuit/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A US law firm has accused Lenovo of violating Justice Department strictures about the bulk transfer of data to foreign adversaries, namely China.

The case filed by Almeida Law Group on behalf of San Francisco-based &quot;Spencer Christy, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated&quot; centers on the Data Security Program regulations implemented by the DOJ last year.

According to the suit [PDF], these were &quot;implemented to prevent adversarial countries from acquiring large quantities of behavioral data which could be used to surveil, analyze, or exploit American citizens&#39; behavior.&quot;

The complaint states the DOJ rule &quot;makes clear that sending American consumers&#39; information to Chinese entities through automated advertising systems and associated databases with the requisite controls is prohibited.&quot;

The case states the threshold for &quot;covered personal identifiers&quot; is 100,000 US persons or more and lists a range of potential identifiers, from government and financial account numbers to IMEIs, MAC, and SIM numbers, demographic data, and advertising IDs.

It then alleges that Lenovo&#39;s website &quot;uses trackers which expose American&#39;s [sic] behavioral data to foreign adversaries.&quot;

&quot;When a user lands on the homepage of Website, [sic] the Website loads numerous first and third-party tracking implementations that measure and record user data,&quot; it says, including the likes of TikTok, Facebook, Microsoft, and Google.

This allows Lenovo to collect bulk personal data, it claims, and &quot;Lenovo knowingly permits access to, or transfer of, such bulk US sensitive personal data to entities or persons that qualify as covered persons under the DOJ Rule, including its foreign parents that are directly or indirectly controlled by persons in China, such as the Lenovo Group.&quot;

This means that Lenovo Group, operating under Chinese jurisdiction, &quot;can use this data to build detailed dossiers on US residents, identify psychological or financial vulnerabilities, and target individuals in sensitive roles – such as jurists, military personnel, journalists, politicians, or dissidents,&quot; or so the lawyers allege.

That data could be &quot;weaponized for profiling, coercive targeting, or even blackmail.&quot;

The named plaintiff visited Lenovo&#39;s website multiple times in November and December 2025, the suits says, triggering trackers that violated &quot;his reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; and resulting in &quot;the unauthorized disclosure of personal information to a foreign entity.&quot;

The suit calls for class action status and seeks &quot;relief, restitution, and disgorgement&quot; as well as &quot;statutory damages in amounts to be determined by the Court and/or jury.&quot;

The Register asked Lenovo to comment on the case, and whether it had transferred customer data to China.

In a statement, Lenovo said: &quot;Any suggestion that Lenovo improperly shares customer data is false. We take data privacy and security seriously and comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations globally, including stringent US requirements. Our data practices are transparent, lawful, and designed to protect our customers.&quot;

The suit remains silent on whether the use of trackers, which could ultimately be used to profile individuals and potentially target those in sensitive positions, is permissible in and of itself.

The Reg contacted but has not heard back from Almeida Law Group, which specializes in data privacy and security cases, and class action settlements, among other areas. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Polish police have arrested and charged a man over ties to the Phobos ransomware group following a property raid.

The 47-year-old was cuffed after cops visited his apartment in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship province, and looked through his devices, finding various artifacts that investigators believe are linked to cybercrime.

Officials said Tuesday the man&#39;s devices contained logins, passwords, credit card numbers, and server IP addresses that could have been used to launch &quot;various attacks, including ransomware.&quot;

&quot;After conducting technical investigations, it was discovered that the data contained information that could be used to breach electronic security,&quot; police said.

&quot;Furthermore, according to information gathered in the case, the 47-year-old used encrypted messaging to contact the Phobos criminal group, known for conducting ransomware attacks.&quot;

According to an image shared by Poland&#39;s Central Office for Combating Cybercrime (CBZC), police seized one laptop, four smartphones, an array of payment cards, and a small amount of cannabis.

The man was detained and charged with creating, acquiring, and sharing computer programs used to unlawfully obtain information, including data enabling unauthorized access to information stored in a computer system.

If convicted, he could receive a maximum prison sentence of five years, police said.

The arrest stems from Europol&#39;s ongoing Operation Aether, which targets the 8Base ransomware group, believed to be linked to Phobos. It comes almost exactly a year since international law enforcement dismantled the 8Base crew, which was first assembled in 2022.

Bavarian police seized the group&#39;s infrastructure used to host its data leak site, while four arrests were made in Thailand.

Before then, Phobos&#39;s alleged administrator, Russian national Evgenii Ptitsyn, aged 42 at the time, was arrested in South Korea in 2024 and extradited to the US that same year.

The CBZC said Phobos had recorded more than 1,000 victims during its time on the ransomware scene, including hospitals, schools, nonprofits, and others.

Current estimates peg the total revenue generated by the group at $16 million, securing an average of $54,000 in ransom payments per attack. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/17/gentoo_moves_to_codeberg_amid/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Gentoo&#39;s official migration from Microsoft-owned GitHub to Codeberg is underway, as the Linux distribution fulfills a pledge to ditch the code shack due to &quot;continuous attempts to force Copilot usage for our repositories.&quot;

The decision was made public last month, when Gentoo confirmed it intended to migrate repository mirrors and pull request contributions to the new home.

On February 16, the organization revealed it now had a presence on Codeberg, where contributions could be submitted. Gentoo posted: &quot;Eventually also other git repositories will become available under the Codeberg Gentoo organization.&quot;

It is increasingly difficult to avoid Copilot on GitHub, and the impact of AI on open source is seen more as a negative than a positive, as repositories risk being filled with AI slop. Last week, GitHub added a setting to turn off pull requests entirely, meaning nobody can see existing pull requests or open new ones.

The new setting arrived after the Microsoft-owned biz kicked off a discussion earlier this year over &quot;the increasing volume of low-quality contributions that is creating significant operational challenges for maintainers.&quot;

Open source fan and general tech whizz Jeff Geerling noted the problem in a recent blog post, where he wrote, &quot;AI slop generation is getting easier, but it&#39;s not getting smarter. From what I&#39;ve seen, models have hit a plateau where code generation is pretty good...

&quot;But it&#39;s not improving like it did the past few years.&quot;

In 2024, Gentoo published a policy stating, &quot;It is expressly forbidden to contribute to Gentoo any content that has been created with the assistance of Natural Language Processing artificial intelligence tools.&quot; The ban was made on the grounds of copyright, quality, and ethical concerns.

So, no Copilot assistance or reviews, please. And then there&#39;s the whole issue of training coding assistants using the content of repositories.

The Codeberg site is based on Forgejo, is maintained by a non-profit, and is located in Berlin, Germany.

In its announcement of its intention to migrate, Gentoo wrote, &quot;Gentoo continues to host its own primary git, bugs, etc infrastructure and has no plans to change that,&quot; but the migration from GitHub for its mirror repositories due to those &quot;continuous attempts to force Copilot usage&quot; is now underway.

The Register contacted GitHub for its reaction to the move and will update if the source shack responds. ®

            <div id="article-text">The clock is ticking for AI projects to either prove their worth or face the chopping block.

Or so says data management and machine learning biz DataikuAI, which commissioned research conducted online by the Harris Poll to get a snapshot of the views from 600 Chief information officers (CIOs) across the US, UK, France, Germany, UAE, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore.

The report, &quot;The 7 Career-Making AI Decisions for CIOs in 2026,&quot; claims AI is facing corporate accountability in 2026 after several years of investment into research and pilot projects. CIOs are worried their careers are on the line if the tech&#39;s effectiveness falls short of expectations.

Money continues to be pumped into AI as the next great thing in business, but a growing number of studies have found that adopting AI tools hasn&#39;t helped the bottom line, and enterprises are seeing neither increased revenue nor decreased costs from their AI projects.

In the past, the CIO could argue that a new tech was in its early development, evolving, or &quot;still being optimized,&quot; Dataiku&#39;s report notes, but regulators are looking for traceability, corporate boards are asking for performance, and investors want to see quicker value generation.

Perhaps not surprisingly, almost all respondents (98 percent) said pressure from the board to demonstrate measurable return on investment (ROI) is increasing, and retaining budgets may depend on whether they can prove a measurable return.

Time is running out, the report claims. Some 71 percent of the CIOs surveyed believe their AI budget will likely face cuts or a freeze if targets are not met by the end of the first half of 2026. And the consequences won&#39;t just stop at funding: 85 percent of CIOs believe their employers will tie their compensation to measurable AI outcomes, and many say the same applies to their chief exec.

CIOs also fret about the explainability of their AI systems, with some (29 percent) indicating they were asked multiple times over the past year to justify an AI outcome they could not fully explain.

Dataiku says this issue is about to harden into formal requirements, with 70 percent of CIOs expecting AI audit or explainability requirements to arrive within the next 12 months.

When it comes to the latest buzzword, &quot;agentic AI&quot; or AI agents with the power to carry out actions, the CIOs say these are no longer a lab concept and are already working inside corporate networks. Some 62 percent of CIOs indicate agents are embedded in some business-critical workflows, while a worrying 25 percent say agents have become the operational backbone of many critical workflows.

Worrying because the report reveals three-quarters of CIOs admit to not having full real-time visibility into AI agents running in production systems, even though they have the ability to implement actions.

The majority of CIOs (82 percent) admit their employees are creating AI agents and apps faster than the IT department is able to govern them. The same number indicate they are concerned worker-built AI could expose sensitive company data.

The fear is not only that employees will build the wrong thing – it&#39;s that they will build the right thing in the wrong place, with the wrong data, under the wrong controls, the report states.

Many CIOs are also owning up to a certain level of buyer&#39;s remorse when it comes to some of the decisions made regarding their organization&#39;s AI stack. 74 percent say they regret at least one major AI vendor or platform selection made in the past 18 months.

And while the execs in charge of the tech megacorps pushing AI are adamant the craze is most definitely not a bubble – except for OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, of course – the corporate CIOs in the survey are not so sure, and most are fearful of what will happen if it bursts.

Some 73 percent suspect their company would experience major disruption, with more than half (57 percent) saying their company&#39;s very survival might be at stake. Oh, and 60 percent feared they may lose their job should the big pop ever happen.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/17/govt_launches_cyber_lockdown_push/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Britain is telling businesses to &quot;lock the door&quot; on cybercrims as new government data suggests most still haven&#39;t even found the latch.

Officials today kicked off a public push urging companies to tighten their digital defenses, complete with familiar advice about basic controls and adopting the long-running Cyber Essentials scheme, after new data showed incidents remain routine and baseline protections are still patchy.

According to the government&#39;s latest Cyber Security Longitudinal Survey, a multi-year study tracking policies, behaviors, and incident impacts, 82 percent of businesses and 77 percent of charities in the UK reported experiencing some form of incident over the past year, reinforcing the idea that when it comes to getting poked, prodded, or outright compromised, this is now less a question of if and more a question of how often.

The data also shows that risk profiles tend to stick, with 54 percent of organizations reporting the same experience of incidents, or similar impacts, across multiple surveys – suggesting the gap between the security haves and have-nots isn&#39;t closing quickly.

At the same time, adoption of the government&#39;s flagship baseline standard remains stubbornly low. While adherence to Cyber Essentials ticked up, it&#39;s still only at 30 percent among businesses, up from 23 percent in the previous study, and 28 percent among charities, up from 19 percent. This means roughly seven in ten larger organizations still aren&#39;t following what ministers routinely describe as the digital equivalent of locking the front door.

That disconnect is exactly what the new campaign aims to address, with officials once again warning that attackers aren&#39;t just targeting household names.

Cybersecurity minister Baroness Lloyd said in a statement:

&quot;No business is out of reach from cybercriminals. SMEs play a vital role in our economy, and business owners work incredibly hard to build something valuable, but too many still assume cybercriminals only go after big brands. The reality is that criminals look for easy opportunities, and without basic protections in place, any business of any size can become a target.

&quot;I know smaller firms don&#39;t have large IT teams, and that is exactly why Cyber Essentials matters,&quot; she added.

The campaign will run across social media, podcasts, radio, and business networks to reach busy SMEs where they are, with the usual pitch to get on board with Cyber Essentials and sort out the basics. Officials say the scheme focuses on practical steps such as patching software and tightening access controls — the kind of housekeeping that many attacks still rely on.

To nudge firms along, the government is also pointing to a handful of freebies, including an online readiness check, free 30-minute chats with NCSC-assured advisors, and a preview of the certification question set so companies can see what&#39;s involved before signing up.

The accompanying survey paints a picture of gradual improvement but persistent unevenness, with governance, planning, and insurance coverage varying widely depending on the organization. Cost pressures and competing priorities continue to show up as barriers to doing more, even as threats keep piling up.

Ultimately, the government is once again telling businesses to check the locks, while its own data suggests plenty still haven&#39;t found the keys. ®

The network allegedly didn’t want to upset FCC chair Brendan Carr.

The Late Show host Stephen Colbert says CBS blocked him from broadcasting an interview with James Talarico, a Democratic representative from Texas. During his opening monologue on Monday night, Colbert says the network’s lawyers told him in “no uncertain terms” that he couldn’t have Talarico on the show, forcing him to post the interview on YouTube instead, hours after news broke that Anderson Cooper is leaving his position at the network as a 60 Minutes correspondent.

“He [Talarico] was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network’s lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,” Colbert says. “Then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on.”

Colbert, whose late-night show comes to an end in May, cites the Federal Communications Commission’s equal time rule, which states radio and broadcast television shows must air competing political candidates for the same amount of time during an election. Talarico is currently campaigning for a spot in the Senate.

As noted by Deadline, news interviews have long been exempt from this rule, with talk shows seemingly included under this umbrella. But in January, FCC Chair Brendan Carr issued new guidance suggesting late-night and daytime talk shows should comply with the rule as well. “If you’re fake news, you’re not going to qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” Carr said at the time.

Colbert says Carr “hasn’t done away” with the exemption yet, but CBS “is unilaterally enforcing it as if he had.” Last year, Paramount appointed The Free Press founder Bari Weiss as the editor-in-chief of CBS News. “Let’s just call this what it is. Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV.”

﻿The DSA investigation comes after French regulators found listings for ‘child-like sex dolls’ on Shein last year.

The European Union has opened a formal investigation into Shein after French regulators found listings for “child-like sex dolls” on the retail platform last year. The investigation will assess whether the systems Shein is using to curb illegal product sales are compliant with the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), according to the European Commission, including “content which could constitute child sexual abuse material.”

The commission will also examine the transparency of Shein’s content recommendation systems, and concerns regarding the retailer’s “addictive design,” including gamified programmes that give points and other rewards to shoppers.

“In the EU, illegal products are prohibited – whether they are on a store shelf or on an online marketplace,” EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen said in the announcement. “The Digital Services Act keeps shoppers safe, protects their wellbeing and empowers them with information about the algorithms they are interacting with. We will assess whether Shein is respecting these rules and their responsibility.”

Companies can be fined up to six percent of their annual global revenue for DSA violations, putting Shein at risk of $2.2 billion in penalties, according to its total $37 billion revenue for 2024. In a statement to The Wall Street Journal, Shein said it has made significant investments into bolstering DSA compliance in recent months, such as improving detection tools and safeguards around age-restricted products.

“We share the commission’s objective of ensuring a safe and trusted online environment and will continue to engage constructively on this procedure,” Shein said.

            <div id="article-text">The automaker’s off-road crossover SUV joins the recently revamped Highlander EV.

The automaker’s off-road crossover SUV joins the recently revamped Highlander EV.

For years, Toyota was criticized for sitting on the sidelines while the EV revolution swept through the auto industry. Instead of riding the wave, the Japanese auto giant doubled down on hybrids, while rolling out only one pure EV for the US market, the poorly reviewed bZ4X. But as sales growth slowed and governments started eliminating their EV incentives, Toyota’s caution was retroactively seen as strategic. Now, as other automakers pull back, Toyota is finally getting off the sidelines.

Last week, the Japanese auto giant announced the new Highlander, a three-row SUV with over 300 miles of range, vehicle-to-load capabilities, and some real “Made in America” bona fides. Today, it’s again trotting out the bZ Woodland, a compact SUV with plenty of outdoor flair, with a full spec sheet to go along with the first drive impressions.

The bZ Woodland is the off-road version of the bZ compact SUV (previously called bZ4X), which for years was Toyota’s sole electric offering in the US. But the automaker would like you to think of it more as a full reimagining of the bZ than a simple trim level change. While it shares some DNA with the standard bZ, the Woodland adds nearly six inches of length and an extra inch of height in the rear, with a total of 74.9 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats folded. That’s significantly more than the standard bZ’s 67.1 cubic feet.

The bZ Woodland features a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive powertrain that delivers 375 horsepower and a 0-60 mph acceleration in just 4.4 seconds. The EV’s EPA-estimated range of 281 miles is similar to other AWD compact, battery-powered SUVs. But with all-terrain tires, that estimated range drops to 260 miles.

The charging port is NACS, meaning the bZ Woodland will be able to charge at Tesla’s Supercharger network. Under the right conditions, the 74.7 kWh battery can charge from 10-80 percent in 30 minutes. Like the Highlander, the battery can be pre-conditioned to ensure its optimal charging temperature.

With 8.4 inches of ground clearance, the bZ Woodland stands ready to tackle even the toughest off-road conditions. It can tow up 3,500 lbs and comes standard with a pair of roof rails. The 18-inch aluminum wheels feature aero covers for improved dynamics.

But if the timing of the bZ Woodland feels curious, the price may strike you as even more confusing. It starts at $46,695 (including delivery charges), which is about $5,300 more than its platform twin the Subaru Trailseeker. Toyota co-develops its EVs with Subaru, meaning the bZ Woodland is essentially a copy of the $41,445 Trailseeker. Is there $5,300 in improvements in the bZ Woodland?

Even if not, it’s great to see Toyota finally getting in the EV game. The rugged crossover is expected to hit dealerships in March 2026.

﻿You can clip your phone, keys, earbuds, and other essentials to the Crossbody Multi-Strap using anchor attachments.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Peak Design is launching a lineup of mobile straps for carrying small gadgets and other essentials around without dumping them into a bag. There are three versions available starting today: a $29.95 Mobile Cuff for your wrist, a $49.95 two-point Crossbody Strap, and a $59.95 Crossbody Multi-Strap that allows you to carry several items at once using anchor attachments.

Peak Design’s straps feature a corded rope that was custom-developed for “strength, comfort, and stretch” and are compatible with any Peak Design or Apple iPhone 17 case, and any third-party case if paired with the included adapter. The anchor attachments for the Crossbody Multi-Strap are each rated to withstand 50 pounds (23 kilograms) of force per attachment point and can carry items like “compact, lightweight point-and-shoot cameras.” So, not heavier mirrorless or DSLR cameras.

The images of Peak Design’s Crossbody Multi-Strap make it look a little like climbing gear when multiple objects are hanging off it. Honestly, at that point, a small bag or sling probably makes more sense, especially for anyone carrying an AirPods case that could easily fling open.

Carry straps for smartphones are already popular across Europe and Asia. Peak Design’s straps follow the launch of Apple’s $59 iPhone crossbody strap last year that features a flat design and magnetic length adjustment.

Netflix says the ‘foreign funding’ behind Paramount’s bid is raising ‘national security concerns.’

After rejecting Paramount’s latest acquisition bid, Warner Bros. Discovery says it’s giving the David Ellison-led entertainment giant seven days to make its “best and final” proposal. Though WBD is reopening negotiations with Paramount, the company makes it clear in a press release that it still favors Netflix’s $82.7 billion deal to purchase its studio and streaming service.

As noted in the press release, a Paramount representative told WBD that it would agree to pay $31 per share if WBD reopens negotiations, adding that this isn’t Paramount’s “best and final proposal.” Paramount has been upping its bid to purchase the entirety of WBD for weeks now, offering to cover the $2.8 billion termination fee WBD would have to pay if it abandons its deal with Netflix.

Netflix says it granted WBD a seven-day waiver to engage with Paramount to “fully resolve” the bidding war. It adds that the “foreign funding behind PSKY’s bid is already raising serious national security concerns.” Netflix’s press release cites Rep. Sam Liccardo’s (D-CA) recent letter to Paramount, which questions the Middle Eastern partners backing its deal, such as Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.

WBD shareholders will vote on the merger with Netflix on March 20th.

“We continue to believe the Netflix merger is in the best interests of WBD shareholders due to the tremendous value it provides, our clear path to achieve regulatory approval and the transaction’s protections for shareholders against downside risk,” Samuel Di Piazza, Jr., the chair of WBD’s board of directors, says in the press release.

            <div id="article-text">The legendary composer is celebrating 40 years of Music Mouse, which brought algorithmic composition to home computers.

The legendary composer is celebrating 40 years of Music Mouse, which brought algorithmic composition to home computers.

In 1986, electronic music pioneer Laurie Spiegel created Music Mouse, a way for those with a Mac, Atari, or Amiga computer to dabble in algorithmic music creation. Music Mouse is deceptively simple: Notes are arranged on an XY grid, and you play it by moving a mouse around. Back in 1986, the computer mouse was still a relatively novel device. While it can trace its origins back to the late ’60s, it wasn’t until the Macintosh 128K in 1984 that it started seeing widespread adoption.

By then Spiegel, was already an accomplished composer. Her 1980 album The Expanding Universe is generally considered among the greatest ambient records of all time. And her composition “Harmony of the Worlds” is currently tearing through interstellar space as part of the Voyager Golden Record, launched in 1977. But she is also a technical wizard who joined Bell Labs in 1973 and was instrumental in early digital synthesis experiments and worked on an early computer graphics system called Vampire.

Spiegel was deeply drawn to algorithmic music composition and this new tool, the home computer. So, she created what she calls an “intelligent instrument” that enables the creation of complex melodies and harmonies with minimal music-theory knowledge. Music Mouse restricts you to particular scales, and then you explore them simply by pushing a mouse around.

Spiegel gives the user some control, of course. You can choose if notes move in parallel or contrary to each other, there are options to play notes back as chords or arpeggios, and there is even a simple pattern generator.

Despite being available for purchase until 2021, Spiegel never updated it to work on anything more current than Mac OS 9. Now, 40 years after its debut, it’s getting reborn for modern machines with help from Eventide.

While it would have been easy for Eventide and Spiegel to overload the 2026 version of Music Mouse with countless modern amenities and new features, they kept things restrained for version 1.0. The core feature set is the same, though the sound engine is more robust and includes patches based on Spiegel’s own Yamaha DX7. There are also some enhanced MIDI features, including the ability to feed data from Music Mouse into your DAW or an external synthesizer.

Laurie Spiegel answered some questions for us about the history of Music Mouse, algorithmic composition, AI, and why she thinks the computer is a “folk instrument.”

What were the origins of Music Mouse? Was there something specific that inspired its creation?

When the first Macs came out, the use of a mouse as an input device, as an XY controller, was altogether new. Previous computers had just alphanumeric keyboard input or maybe custom controllers. The most obvious thing I immediately wanted to do was to be able to push sound around with that mouse. So, as soon as the first C compilers came out, I coded up a way to do that. Pretty soon, though, I wanted the sound quantized into scales, then to add more voices to fill out the harmony. Then I wanted to have controls for timbre, tempo, and everything else I eventually added.

How did you connect with Eventide for this new version?

I first met Tony and Richard of Eventide all the way back in the early 1970s. They are longtime good friends. I’d been involved in various music tech projects at Eventide over the years. Tony knew that I really missed Music Mouse and that I still get a fair number of requests for the 1980s versions from people who keep vintage computers from that era just to be able to run Music Mouse or other obsolete software. He decided it was a musical instrument worth reviving. I had been wanting to revive it, but hadn’t been able to find the time to even just keep up with the way development tech keeps changing. My main thing is really composing music, and I have an active enough career doing that to not have enough time to do coding as well. I am extremely grateful to Eventide for resuscitating Music Mouse. I hope a lot of people will get a lot of music out of this new version.

Did you feel compelled to make any big changes to it after 40 years?

We decided to keep 1.0 of this new version of Music Mouse functionally the same as the 1980s original. The exceptions are adding a higher-quality internal synthesizer and providing ways to sync it with other software, to record or notate its MIDI output. We have a growing list of features to add in 2.0.

“It’s pretty easy by now to use computers to generate music-like material that is not actually the expression of an individual human being.”

Are there any current innovations in music tech that excite you?

That’s a hard question, because I am not all that excited about music tech right now. It’s music itself that holds my interest — composition, form, structure. I love counterpoint and the various contrapuntal forms. I studied them extensively when I was younger. Of course, harmonic progression is something I’m also very interested in, and in algorithmic assistance for composing it.

That various kinds of structures within music can now be more easily dealt with in computer software by now has both pros and cons. The pros include how much more deeply we have to understand how music works, how it is structured, and how it affects us, in order to represent it as a process description in software. That means learning, research, and self-discovery. The cons include that it’s pretty easy by now to use computers to generate music-like material that is not actually the expression of an individual human being. Music is a fundamental human experience. There is no human society that doesn’t have it. But it is something that comes from within human beings, as personal expression, as communication, as a sort of form of documentation of what we are feeling, and as a means of sharing it.

You’ve been credited as saying that the computer is a new kind of folk instrument. Can you explain what you mean by that? How does something like Music Mouse fit into that model?

Now that everyone with a computer or even just a phone has the ability to record and edit and play back and digitally process and transform sound, and particularly ever since sampling became a common musical technique, people have been doing remixes, collages, sonic montages… doing all kinds of stuff to audio they get from others or find online. This is very like what we used to call “the folk process,” in which music is repurposed, re-orchestrated, given new lyrics or otherwise modified as it goes from person to person and is adapted to fit what is meaningful in successive groups of people.

Music Mouse will help people create musical materials that can be used in a potentially infinite number of ways. It is a personal, often home-based instrument played by an individual, like a guitar.

You refer to Music Mouse as an “intelligent instrument”; it automates a certain amount of creation. What is the appeal of letting a computer take the wheel to a degree, as an artist?

Music Mouse is not a generative algorithm or an “AI.” It’s a musical instrument that a person can play. It is, to some degree, what we used to call an “expert system,” as it has some musical expertise built in. But that is meant to be supportive for the real live human being who is playing it, not to replace them. It makes the playing of notes easier in order to let the player’s focus be on the level of phrasing or form. I have coded up generative algorithms for music. Music Mouse is not one of them. It’s an instrument that an individual can play, and it’s under their control. It enables a different perspective that’s from above the level of the individual note.

Do you see a connection between modern generative AI and algorithmic composition tools?

Of course. Algorithms can be used to generate music. I have written and used some. Music Mouse is not generative, though. It does nothing on its own. It’s a musical instrument played by a person.

What is currently called “AI” is different from previous generations of artificial intelligence. I expect there will doubtless be further evolution. In the early years of my use of computer logic in composing, AI was more of a rule-based practice. We would try to figure out how the mind was making a specific kind of decision, code up a simulation to test our hypothesis, and then refine our understanding in light of the result. After that, there was a period of AI taking more of a brute-force approach. Computer chess, for example, would involve generating all possible moves possible in a given situation, then eliminating those that would be less beneficial. Then neural nets were brought in for a next generation of AI. I look forward to getting beyond the imitative homogenizing LLM approach and seeing whatever comes next.

There are many ways of designing an algorithm that either generates music or else helps a human being to do that, making some of the decisions during the person’s creative process to leave them free to focus on other aspects. By taking over some of the decision-making, they can free a creative mind to focus on different perspectives. People just starting to learn music too often bog down and give up at the level of simply playing the notes, just figuring out where to put their fingers. We can make musical instruments now that let people use a bit of automation on those low levels to let them express themselves on a larger level, for example, to make gestures in texture-space rather than thinking ahead just one note at a time.

“Music Mouse is not a generative algorithm or an ‘AI.’ It’s a musical instrument that a person can play.”

What do you think separates algorithmically generated music from something created by generative AI?

Artificial intelligence refers to a specific subset of ways to use algorithms. An algorithm is just a description of a process, a sequence of steps to be taken. A generative algorithm can make decisions involved in the production of information, and, of course, music is a kind of information. You can think of AI as trying to simulate human intelligence. It might have a purpose, such as taking over some of our cognitive workload. In contrast, the purpose of generative algorithms is to create stuff. In music, that purpose is to create an experience.

Music Mouse is not a generative algorithmic program. It’s more of a small expert system in that it has built into it information and methods that can help its player get beyond the level of just finding notes, to the level of finding personal expression.

Suno’s CEO Mikey Shulman has said that, “Increasingly taste is the only thing that matters in art and skill is going to matter a lot less.” In an age where music can be easily created using algorithms, plug-ins, and text prompts on cheap laptops and smartphones, do you see the role of composer being one primarily of curation?

I can see where he’s coming from, but, no, I don’t think so. The range and kinds of skills used in the creative arts will continue to evolve and expand. But the history of creative techniques shows them to be largely cumulative versus sequential. The keyboard synthesizer has not replaced the piano, which has not replaced the harpsichord or the organ. We have them all, that whole lineage, all still in use. Each musical instrument or artistic technique implies its own unique artistic realm. Each is defined by its specific limitations, which guide us as we use them. It is true that skills and traditional techniques will be an option rather than a prerequisite to creating music and art, but people will still do them. Just as LPs and chemical film have made comebacks recently, I expect to see traditional musical skills do the same. We have had computers and synthesizers for decades, yet there are still little children captivated by instruments made out of wood or painting or drawing, and I have yet to use any music editing software that gives me the fluidity and freedom of a pencil on staff paper. There will just be more kinds of complementary ways of making music.

More importantly, we humans have imaginations and emotions. There are internal experiences going on inside of us that we feel driven to express, to communicate, to share. It doesn’t matter what machines can generate on their own. We will always have those internal subjective experiences, emotion, and imagination, and people will experience them intensely enough to feel driven to create them external to their own selves in order to communicate and share them. You can’t replace human self-expression or the need for it by simulating their results. Artistic creation comes from a fundamental human drive, the need for self-expression. Artistic creativity is an essential method of processing the intensity of being alive.

You told New Music USA in 2014 that, in regard to electronic music, “There is no single creator… the concept of a finite fixed-form piece with an identifiable creator that is property and a medium of exchange or the embodiment of economic value really disappears.” Does this idea shape your views on ownership of art?

Those assumptions, which we inherited from the European classical model of music, are already much less prominent in our musical landscape. Improvisation, “process pieces,” the ease with which we can do transformations of audio files are all over the place. Folk music, and a lot of what we heard online here and there, might be audio that no longer has any known originator. We don’t know, and people don’t really care, who first created a swatch of sound. We are experiencing whatever has been done with it — different orchestrations, durations, signal processing. The huge proliferation of plug-ins and guitar effects pedals let anyone transform a sound beyond recognition. This is composition on a different level than on the level of the individual note, similarly to Music Mouse.

Another very important aspect of “folk music” is that it is typically played at home, with or for friends or family, or alone. This is very different from formal concert settings and programming we in the US inherited from Europe. For me, the most important musical experience is just about always at home, where we live. To quote what Pete Seeger said in his write-up of Music Mouse in Sing Out, that “she [meaning me] foresees a day when computer pieces will be like folksongs, anonymous common property to be altered by each new user. She would like to get music out of the concert hall and back into the living room.”

Music Mouse is available for macOS and Windows 11 for $29.

The curious case of the disappearing Lamborghinis

Across the world, unsuspecting people are unwittingly becoming caught up in a new and growing type of organized criminal enterprise: vehicle transport fraud and theft.Crooks use email phishing, fraudulent paperwork, and other tactics to impersonate legitimate transport companies and get hired to deliver a luxury vehicle. They divert the shipment away from its intended destination before using a mix of technology, computer skills, and old-school techniques to erase traces of the vehicle’s original ownership and registration. In some cases, the car has been resold or is out of the country by the time the rightful owner even realizes it’s missing.The nationwide epidemic of vehicle transport fraud and theft has remained under the radar, even as it’s rocked the industry over the past two years. MIT Technology Review identified more than a dozen cases involving high-end vehicles, obtained court records, and spoke to law enforcement, brokers, drivers, and victims in multiple states to reveal how transport fraud is wreaking havoc across the country.

The scientist using AI to hunt for antibiotics just about everywhere

Antimicrobial resistance is a major problem. Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses that have evolved ways to evade treatments are now associated with more than 4 million deaths per year, and a recent analysis predicts that number could surge past 8 million by 2050.

Bioengineer and computational biologist César de la Fuente has a plan. His team at the University of Pennsylvania is training AI tools to search genomes far and deep for peptides with antibiotic properties. His vision is to assemble those peptides—molecules made of up to 50 amino acids linked together—into various configurations, including some never seen in nature. The results, he hopes, could defend the body against microbes that withstand traditional treatments—and his quest has unearthed promising candidates in unexpected places. Read the full story.

The quest to find out how our bodies react to extreme temperaturesClimate change is subjecting vulnerable people to temperatures that push their limits. In 2023, about 47,000 heat-related deaths are believed to have occurred in Europe. Researchers estimate that climate change could add an extra 2.3 million European heat deaths this century. That’s heightened the stakes for solving the mystery of just what happens to bodies in extreme conditions.While we broadly know how people thermoregulate, the science of keeping warm or cool is mottled with blind spots. Researchers around the world are revising rules about when extremes veer from uncomfortable to deadly. Their findings change how we should think about the limits of hot and cold—and how to survive in a new world. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Sam Zahr first saw the gray Rolls-Royce Dawn convertible with orange interior and orange roof, he knew he’d found a perfect addition to his fleet. “It was very appealing to our clientele,” he told me. As the director of operations at Dream Luxury Rental, he outfits customers in the Detroit area looking to ride in style to a wedding, a graduation, or any other event with high-end vehicles—Rolls-Royces, Lamborghinis, Bentleys, Mercedes G-Wagons, and more.

But before he could rent out the Rolls, Zahr needed to get the car to Detroit from Miami, where he bought it from a used-car dealer.

His team posted the convertible on Central Dispatch, an online marketplace that’s popular among car dealers, manufacturers, and owners who want to arrange vehicle shipments. It’s not too complicated, at least in theory: A typical listing includes the type of vehicle, zip codes of the origin and destination, dates for pickup and delivery, and the fee. Anyone with a Central Dispatch account can see the job, and an individual carrier or transport broker who wants it can call the number on the listing.

Zahr’s team got a call from a transport company that wanted the job. They agreed on the price and scheduled pickup for January 17, 2025. Zahr watched from a few feet away as the car was loaded into an enclosed trailer. He expected the vehicle to arrive in Detroit just a few days later—by January 21.

Zahr called a contact at the transport company to ask what happened.

“He’s like, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Zahr told me his contact angrily told him they mostly ship Coca-Cola products, not luxury cars. “He was yelling and screaming about it,” Zahr said.

Over the years, people have broken into his business to steal cars, or they’ve rented them out and never come back. But until this day, he’d never had a car simply disappear during shipping. He’d expected no trouble this time around, especially since he’d used Central Dispatch—“a legit platform that everyone uses to transport cars,” he said.

“That’s the scary part about it, you know?”

Zahr had unwittingly been caught up in a new and growing type of organized criminal enterprise: vehicle transport fraud and theft. Crooks use email phishing, fraudulent paperwork, and other tactics to impersonate legitimate transport companies and get hired to deliver a luxury vehicle. They divert the shipment away from its intended destination and then use a mix of technology, computer skills, and old-school chop shop techniques to erase traces of the vehicle’s original ownership and registration.

These vehicles can be retitled and resold in the US or loaded into a shipping container and sent to an overseas buyer. In some cases, the car has been resold or is out of the country by the time the rightful owner even realizes it’s missing.

“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless,” says Steven Yariv, the CEO of Dealers Choice Auto Transport of West Palm Beach, Florida, one of the country’s largest luxury-vehicle transport brokers.

Individual cases have received media coverage thanks to the high value of the stolen cars and the fact that some belong to professional athletes and other celebrities. In late 2024, a Lamborghini Huracán belonging to Colorado Rockies third baseman Kris Bryant went missing en route to his home in Las Vegas; R&B singer Ray J told TMZ the same year that two Mercedes Maybachs never arrived in New York as planned; and last fall, NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal had a $180,000 custom Range Rover stolen when the transport company hired to move the vehicle was hacked. “They’re saying they think it’s probably in Dubai by now, to be honest,” an employee of the company that customized the SUV told Shaq in a YouTube video.

“Criminals have learned that stealing cars via the web portals has become extremely easy, and when I say easy—it’s become seamless.”

But the nationwide epidemic of vehicle transport fraud and theft has remained under the radar, even as it’s rocked the industry over the past two years. MIT Technology Review identified more than a dozen cases involving high-end vehicles, obtained court records, and spoke to law enforcement, brokers, drivers, and victims in multiple states to reveal how transport fraud is wreaking havoc across the country.

It’s challenging to quantify the scale of this type of crime, since there isn’t a single entity or association that tracks it. Still, these law enforcement officials and brokers, as well as the country’s biggest online car-transport marketplaces, acknowledge that fraud and theft are on the rise.

When I spoke with him in August, Yariv estimated that around 8,000 exotic and high-end cars had been stolen since the spring of 2024, resulting in over $1 billion in losses. “You’re talking 30 cars a day [on] average is gone,” he said.

Multiple state and local law enforcement officials told MIT Technology Review that the number is plausible. (The FBI did not respond to a request for an interview.)

“It doesn’t surprise me,” said J.D. Decker, chief of the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles’ police division and chair of the fraud subcommittee for the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. “It’s a huge business.”

Data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), a nonprofit that works with law enforcement and the insurance industry to investigate insurance fraud and related crimes, provides further evidence of this crime wave. NICB tracks both car theft and cargo theft, a broad category that refers to goods, money, or baggage that is stolen while part of a commercial shipment; the category also covers cases in which a vehicle is stolen via a diverted transport truck or a purloined car is loaded into a shipping container. NICB’s statistics about car theft show that it has declined following an increase during the pandemic—but over the same period cargo theft has dramatically increased, to an estimated $35 billion annually. The group projected in June that it was expected to rise 22% in 2025.

NICB doesn’t break out data for vehicles as opposed to other types of stolen cargo. But Bill Woolf, a regional director for the organization, said an antifraud initiative at the Port of Baltimore experienced a 200% increase from 2023 to 2024 in the number of stolen vehicles recovered. He said the jump could be due to the increased effort to identify stolen cars moving through the port, but he noted that earlier the day we spoke, agents had recovered two high-end stolen vehicles bound for overseas.

“One day, one container—a million dollars,” he said.

Many other vehicles are never recovered—perhaps a result of the speed with which they’re shipped off or sold. Travis Payne, an exotic-car dealer in Atlanta, told me that transport thieves often have buyers lined up before they take a car: “When they steal them, they have a plan.”

In 2024, Payne spent months trying to locate a Rolls-Royce he’d purchased after it was stolen via transport fraud. It eventually turned up in the Instagram feed of a Mexican pop star, he says. He never got the car back.

The criminals are “gonna keep doing it,” he says, “because they make a couple phone calls, make a couple email accounts, and they get a $400,000 car for free. I mean, it makes them God, you know?”

The explosion of vehicle transport fraud follows a pattern that has played out across the economy over the past roughly two decades: A business that once ran on phones, faxes, and personal relationships shifted to online marketplaces that increased efficiency and brought down costs—but the reduction in human-to-human interaction introduced security vulnerabilities that allowed organized and often international fraudsters to enter the industry.

In the case of vehicle transport, the marketplaces are online “load boards” where car owners, dealerships, and manufacturers post about vehicles that need to be shipped from one location to another. Central Dispatch claims to be the largest vehicle load board and says on its website that thousands of vehicles are posted on its platform each day. It’s part of Cox Automotive, an industry juggernaut that owns major vehicle auctions, Autotrader, Kelley Blue Book, and other businesses that work with auto dealers, lenders, and buyers.

The system worked pretty well until roughly two years ago, when organized fraud rings began compromising broker and carrier accounts and exploiting loopholes in government licensing to steal loads with surprising ease and alarming frequency.

A theft can start with a phishing email that appears to come from a legitimate load board. The recipient, a broker or carrier, clicks a link in the message, which appears to go to the real site—but logging in sends the victim’s username and password to a criminal. The crook logs in as the victim, changes the account’s email and phone number to reroute all communications, and begins claiming loads of high-end vehicles. Cox Automotive declined an interview request but said in a statement that the “load board system still works well” and that “fraud impacts a very small portion” of listings.

“Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”

Criminals also gain access to online marketplaces by exploiting a lax regulatory environment. While a valid US Department of Transportation registration is required to access online marketplaces, it’s not hard for bad actors to register sham transport companies and obtain a USDOT number from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the agency that regulates commercial motor vehicles. In other cases, criminals compromise the FMCSA accounts of legitimate companies and change their phone numbers and email addresses in order to impersonate them and steal loads. (USDOT did not respond to a request for comment.)

As Bek Abdullayev, the founder of Super Dispatch, one of Central Dispatch’s biggest competitors, explained in an episode of the podcast Auto Transport Co-Pilot, “FMCSA [is] authorizing people that are fraudulent companies—people that are not who they say they are.” He added that people can “game the system and … obtain paperwork that makes [them] look like a legitimate company.” For example, vehicle carrier insurance can be obtained quickly—if temporarily—by submitting an online application with fraudulent payment credentials.

The bottom line is that crooks have found myriad ways to present themselves as genuine and permitted vehicle transport brokers and carriers. Once hired to move a vehicle, they often repost the car on a load board using a different fraudulent or compromised account. While this kind of subcontracting, known as “double-­brokering,” is sometimes used by companies to save money, it can also be used by criminals to hire an unwitting accomplice to deliver the stolen car to their desired location. “They’re booking cars and then they’re just reposting them and dispatching them out to different routes,” says Yariv, the West Palm Beach transport broker.

“A lot of this is cartel operated,” says Decker, of the Nevada DMV, who also serves on a vehicle fraud committee for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. “There’s so much money in it that it rivals selling drugs.”

Even though this problem is becoming increasingly well known, fraudsters continue to steal, largely with impunity. Brokers, auto industry insiders, and law enforcement told MIT Technology Review that load boards and the USDOT have been too slow to catch and ban bad actors. (In its statement, Cox Automotive said it has been “dedicated to continually enhancing our processes, technology, and education efforts across the industry to fight fraud.”)

Jake MacDonald, who leads Super Dispatch’s fraud monitoring and investigation efforts, put it bluntly on the podcast with Abdullayev: the reason that fraud is “jumping so much” is that “the industry is slowly moving over to a more technologically advanced position, but it’s so slow that fraud is actually [out-]innovating the industry.”

As it turns out, the person Zahr’s team hired on Central Dispatch didn’t really work for the transport company.

After securing the job, the fraudster reposted the orange-and-gray Rolls convertible to a load board. And instead of saying that the car needed to go from Miami to the real destination of Detroit, the new job listed an end point of Hallandale Beach, Florida, just 20 or so miles away. It was a classic case of malicious double-­brokering: the crooks claimed a load and then reposted it in order to find a new, unsuspecting driver to deliver the car into their possession.

On January 17 of last year, the legitimate driver showed up in a Dodge Ram and loaded the Rolls into an enclosed trailer as Zahr watched.

“The guy came in and looked very professional, and we took a video of him loading the car, taking pictures of everything,” Zahr told me. He never thought to double-­check where the driver was headed or which company he worked for.

Not long after a panicked Zahr spoke with his contact at the transport company he thought he was working with, he reported the car as stolen to the Miami police. Detective Ryan Chin was assigned to the case. It fit with a pattern of high-end auto theft that he and his colleagues had recently been tracking.

“Over the past few weeks, detectives have been made aware of a new method on the rise for vehicles being stolen by utilizing Central Dispatch,” Chin wrote in records obtained by MIT Technology Review. “Specific brokers are re-routing the truck drivers upon them picking up vehicles posted for transport and routing them to other locations provided by the broker.”

Chin used Zahr’s photos and video to identify the truck and driver who’d taken the Rolls. By the time police found him, on January 31, the driver had already dropped off Zahr’s Rolls in Hallandale Beach. He’d also picked up and delivered a black Lamborghini Urus and a White Audi R8 for the same client. Each car had been stolen via double-brokering transport fraud, according to court records.

The police department declined to comment or to make Chin available for an interview. But a source with knowledge of the case said the driver was “super cooperative.” (The source asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media, and the driver does not appear to have been identified in court records.)

The driver told police that he had another load to pick up at a dealership in Naples, Florida, later that same day—a second Lamborghini Urus, this one orange. Police later discovered it was supposed to be shipped to California. But the carrier had been hired to bring the car, which retails for about $250,000, to a mall in nearby Aventura. He told police that he suspected it was going to be delivered to the same person who had booked him for the earlier Rolls, Audi, and Lamborghini deliveries, since “the voice sounds consistent with who [the driver] dealt with prior on the phone.” This drop-off was slated for 4 p.m. at the Waterways Shoppes mall in Aventura.

That was when Chin and a fellow detective, Orlando Rodriguez, decided to set up a sting.

The officers and colleagues across three law enforcement agencies quickly positioned themselves in the Waterways parking lot ahead of the scheduled delivery of the Urus. They watched as, pretty much right on schedule that afternoon, the cooperative driver of the Dodge Ram rolled to a stop in the palm-tree-lined lot, which was surrounded by a kosher supermarket, Japanese and Middle Eastern restaurants, and a physiotherapy clinic.

The driver went inside the trailer and emerged in the orange Lamborghini. He parked it and waited near the vehicle.

Roughly 30 minutes later, a green Rolls-Royce Cullinan (price: $400,000 and up) arrived with two men and a teenager inside. They got out, opened the trunk, and sat on the tailgate of the vehicle as one man counted cash.

“They’re doing countersurveillance, looking around,” the source told me later. “It’s a little out of the ordinary, you know. They kept being fixated [on] where the truck was parked.”

The transport driver and the three males who arrived in the Rolls-Royce did not interact. But soon enough, another luxury vehicle, a Bentley Continental GT, which last year retailed for about $250,000 and up, pulled in. The Bentley driver got out, took the cash from one of the men sitting on the back of the Rolls, and walked over to the transport driver. He handed him $700 and took the keys to the Lamborghini.

That’s when more than a dozen officers swooped in.

“They had nowhere to go,” the source told me. “We surrounded them.”

The two men in the Rolls were later identified as Arman Gevorgyan and Hrant Nazarian, and the man in the Bentley as Yuriy Korotovskyy. The three were arrested and charged with dealing in stolen property, grand theft over $100,000, and organized fraud. (The teenager who arrived in the Rolls was Gevorgyan’s son. He was detained and released, according to Richard Cooper, Gevorgyan’s attorney.)

As investigators dug into the case, the evidence suggested that this was part of the criminal pattern they’d been following. “I think it’s organized,” the source told me.

It’s something that transport industry insiders have talked about for a while, according to Fred Mills, the owner of Florida-based Advantage Auto Transport, a company that specializes in transporting high-end vehicles. He said there’s even a slang term to describe people engaged in transport fraud: the flip-flop mafia.

It has multiple meanings. One is that the people who show up to transport or accept a vehicle “are out there wearing, you know, flip-flops and slides,” Mills says.

The second refers to how fraudsters “flip” from one carrier registration to another as they try to stay ahead of regulators and complaints.

In addition to needing a USDOT number, carriers working across states need an interstate operating authority (commonly known as an MC number) from the USDOT. Both IDs are typically printed on the driver and passenger doors. But the rise of ­double-brokering—and of fly-by-night and fraudulent carriers—means that drivers increasingly just tape IDs to their door.

Mills says fraudsters will use a USDOT number for 10 or 11 months, racking up violations, and then tape up a new one. “They just wash, rinse, and repeat,” he says.

Decker from the Nevada DMV says a lot of high-end vehicles are stolen because dealerships and individual customers don’t properly check the paperwork or identity of the person who shows up to transport them.

“‘Flip-flop mafia’ is an apt nickname because it’s surprisingly easy to get a car on a truck and convince somebody that they’re a legitimate transport operation when they’re not,” he says.

Roughly a month after it disappeared, Zahr’s Rolls-Royce was recovered by the Miami Beach Police. Video footage obtained by a local TV station showed the gray car with its distinctive orange top being towed into a police garage.

Among the items confiscated from the men in Florida were $10,796 in cash and a GPS jammer. Law enforcement sources say jammers have become a core piece of technology for modern car thieves—necessary to disable the location tracking provided by GPS navigation systems in most cars. “Once they get the vehicles, they usually park them somewhere [and] put a signal jammer in there or cut out the GPS,” the Florida source told me. This buys them time to swap and reprogram the vehicle identification number (VIN), wipe car computers, and reprogram fobs to remove traces of the car’s provenance.

No two VINs are the same, and each is assigned to a specific vehicle by the manufacturer. Where they’re placed inside a vehicle varies by make and model. The NICB’s Woolf says cars also have confidential VINs located in places—including their electronic components—that are supposed to be known only to law enforcement and his organization. But criminals have figured out how to find and change them.

“It’s making it more and more difficult for us to identify vehicles as stolen,” Woolf says. “Every time we come up with a security measure to prevent the fraudster, they come up with a countermeasure.”

All this doesn’t even take very much time. “If you know what you’re doing, and you steal the car at one o’clock today, you can have it completely done at two o’clock today,” says Woolf. A vehicle can be rerouted, reprogrammed, re-VINed, and sometimes even retitled before an owner files a police report.

That appears to have been the plan in the case of the stolen light-gray 2023 Lamborghini Huracán owned by the Rockies’ Kris Bryant.

On September 29, 2024, a carrier hired via a load board arrived at Bryant’s home in Cherry Hills, Colorado, to pick up the car. It was supposed to be transported to Bryant’s Las Vegas residence within a few days. It never showed up there—but it was in fact in Vegas.

Using Flock traffic cameras, which capture license plate information in areas across the country, Detective Justin Smith of the Cherry Hills Village Police Department tracked the truck and trailer that had picked up the Lambo to Nevada, and he alerted local police.

On October 7, a Las Vegas officer spotted a car matching the Lamborghini’s description and pulled it over. The driver said the Huracán had been brought to his auto shop by a man whom the police were able to identify as Dat Viet Tieu. They arrested Tieu later that same day. In an interview with police, he identified himself as a car broker. He said he was going to resell the Lamborghini and that he had no idea that the car was stolen, according to the arrest report.

Police searched a Jeep Wrangler that Tieu had parked nearby and discovered it had been stolen—and had been re-VINed, retitled, and registered to his wife. Inside the car, police discovered “multiple fraudulent VIN stickers, key fobs to other high-end stolen vehicles, and fictitious placards,” their report said.

One of the fake VINs matched the make and model of Bryant’s Lamborghini. (Representatives for Bryant and the Rockies did not respond to a request for comment.)

Tieu was released on bail. But after he returned to LVPD headquarters two days later, on October 9, to reclaim his personal property, officers secretly placed him under surveillance with the hope that he’d lead them to one of the other stolen cars matching the key fobs they’d found in the Jeep.

It didn’t take long for them to get lucky. A few hours after leaving the police station, Tieu drove to Harry Reid International Airport, where he picked up an unidentified man. They drove to the Caesars Palace parking garage and pulled in near a GMC Sierra. Over the next three hours, the man worked on a laptop inside and outside the vehicle, according to a police report. At one point, he and Tieu connected jumper cables from Tieu’s rented Toyota Camry to the Sierra.

“At 2323 hours, the white male adult enters the GMC Sierra, and the vehicle’s ignition starts. It was readily apparent the [two men] had successfully re-programmed a key fob to the GMC Sierra,” the report said.

An officer watched as the man gave two key fobs to Tieu, who handed the man an unknown amount of cash. Still, the police let the men leave the garage.

The police kept Tieu and his wife under surveillance for more than a week. Then, on October 18, fearing the couple was about to leave town, officers entered Nora’s Italian Restaurant just off the Vegas Strip and took them into custody.

“Obviously, we meet again,” a detective told Tieu.

Police later searched the VIN on the Sierra from the Caesars lot and found that it had been reported stolen in Tremonton, Utah, roughly two weeks earlier. They eventually returned both the Sierra and Kris Bryant’s Lamborghini to their owners.

Tieu pleaded guilty to two felony counts of possession of a stolen vehicle and one count of defacing, altering, substituting, or removing a VIN. In October, he was sentenced to up to one year of probation; if it’s completed successfully, the plea agreement says, the counts of possession of a stolen vehicle will be dismissed. His attorneys, David Z. Chesnoff and Richard A. Schonfeld, said in a statement that they were “pleased” with the court’s decision, “in light of [Tieu’s] acceptance of responsibility.”

Many vehicles stolen via transport fraud are never recovered. Experts say the best way to stop this criminal cycle would be to disrupt it before it starts.

That would require significant changes to the way that load boards operate. Bryant’s Lamborghini, Zahr’s and Payne’s Rolls-Royces, and the orange Lamborghini Urus in Florida were all posted for transport on Central Dispatch. Both brokers and shippers argue that the company hasn’t taken enough responsibility for what they characterize as weak oversight.

“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company … they have no liability in the whole transaction process. So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”

“You’re Cox Automotive—you’re the biggest car company in the world for dealers—and you’re not doing better screenings when you sign people up?” says Payne. (The spokesperson for Cox Automotive said that it has “a robust verification process for all clients … who sign up.”)

“If the crap hits the fan, it’s on us as a broker, or it’s on the trucking company, or the clients’ insurance, [which means] that they have no liability in the whole transaction process,” says Mills. “So it definitely frosted a lot of people’s feathers.”

Over the last year, Central Dispatch has made changes to further secure its platform. It introduced two-factor authentication for user accounts and started enabling shippers to use its app to track loads in real time, among other measures. It also kicked off an awareness campaign that includes online educational content and media appearances to communicate that the company takes its responsibilities seriously.

“We’ve removed over 500 accounts already in 2025, and we’ll continue to take any of that aggressive action where it’s needed,” said Lainey Sibble, Central Dispatch’s head of business, in a sponsored episode of the Auto Remarketing Podcast. “We also recognize this is not going to happen in a silo. Everyone has a role to play here, and it’s really going to take us all working together in partnership to combat this issue.”

Mills says Central Dispatch got faster at shutting down fraudulent accounts toward the end of last year. But it’s going to take time to fix the industry, he adds: “I compare it to a 15-year opioid addiction. It’s going to take a while to detox the system.”

Yariv, the broker in West Palm Beach, says he has stopped using Central Dispatch and other load boards altogether. “One person has access here, and that’s me. I don’t even log in,” he told me. His team has gone back to working the phones, as evidenced by the din of voices in the background as we spoke.

“[The fraud is] everywhere. It’s constant,” he said. “The only way it goes away is the dispatch boards have to be shut down—and that’ll never happen.”

It also remains to be seen what kind of accountability there will be for the alleged thieves in Florida. Korotovskyy and Nazarian pleaded not guilty; as of press time, their trials were scheduled to begin in May. (Korotovskyy’s lawyer, Bruce Prober, said in a statement that the case “is an ongoing matter” and his client is “presumed innocent,” while Nazarian’s attorney, Yale Sanford, said in a statement, “As the investigation continues, Mr. Nazarian firmly asserts his innocence.” A spokesperson with Florida’s Office of the State Attorney emailed a statement: “The circumstances related to these arrests are still a matter of investigation and prosecution. It would be inappropriate to be commenting further.”)

In contrast, Gevorgyan, the third man arrested in the Florida sting, pleaded guilty to four charges.

Yet he maintains his innocence, according to Cooper, his lawyer: “He was pleading [guilty] to get out and go home.” Cooper describes his client as a wealthy Armenian national who runs a jewelry business back home, adding that he was deported to Armenia in September.

Cooper says his client’s “sweetheart” plea deal doesn’t require him to testify or otherwise supply information against his alleged co-conspirators—or to reveal details about how all these luxury cars were mysteriously disappearing across South Florida. Cooper also says prosecutors may have a difficult time convicting the other two men, arguing that police acted prematurely by arresting the trio without first seeing what, if anything, they intended to do with the Lamborghini.

“All they ever had,” Cooper says, “was three schmucks sitting outside of the Lamborghini.”

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When work went remote, the sound of business changed. What began as a scramble to make home offices functional has evolved into a revolution in how people hear and are heard. From education to enterprises, companies across industries have reimagined what clear, reliable communication can mean in a hybrid world. For major audio and communications enterprises like Shure and Zoom, that transformation has been powered by artificial intelligence, new acoustic technologies, and a shared mission: making connection effortless.

Necessity during the pandemic accelerated years of innovation in months.

&quot;Audio and video just working is a baseline for collaboration,&quot; says chief ecosystem officer at Zoom, Brendan Ittelson. &quot;That expectation has shifted from connecting people to enhancing productivity and creativity across the entire ecosystem.&quot;

Audio is a foundation for trust, understanding, and collaboration. Poor sound quality can distort meaning and fatigue listeners, while crisp audio and intelligent processing can make digital interactions feel nearly as natural as in-person exchanges.

&quot;If you think about the fundamental need here,&quot; adds chief technology officer at Shure, Sam Sabet, &quot;It&#39;s the ability to amplify the audio and the information that&#39;s really needed, and diminish the unwanted sounds and audio so that we can enhance that experience and make it seamless for people to communicate.&quot;

For both Ittelson and Sabet, AI now sits at the center of this progress. For Shure, machine learning powers real-time noise suppression, adaptive beamforming, and spatial audio that tunes itself to a room’s acoustics. For Zoom, AI underpins every layer of its platform, from dynamic noise reduction to automated meeting summaries and intelligent assistants that anticipate user needs. These tools are transforming communication from reactive to proactive, enabling systems that understand intent, context, and emotion.

&quot;Even if you&#39;re not working from home and coming into the office, the types of spaces and environments you try to collaborate in today are constantly changing because our needs are constantly changing,&quot; says Sabet. &quot;Having software and algorithms that adapt seamlessly and self-optimize based on the acoustics of the room, based on the different layouts of the spaces where people collaborate in is instrumental.&quot;

The future, they suggest, is one where technology fades into the background. As audio devices and AI companions learn to self-optimize, users won’t think about microphones or meeting links. Instead, they’ll simply connect. Both companies are now exploring agentic AI systems and advanced wireless solutions that promise to make collaboration seamless across spaces, whether in classrooms, conference rooms, or virtual environments yet to come.

&quot;It&#39;s about helping people focus on strategy and creativity instead of administrative busy work,&quot; says Ittelson.

Megan Tatum: From MIT Technology Review, I&#39;m Megan Tatum and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.

This episode is produced in partnership with Shure.

Now as the pandemic ushered in the cultural shift that led to our increasingly virtual world, it also sparked a flurry of innovation in the audio and video industries to keep employees and customers connected and businesses running. Today we&#39;re going to talk about the AI technologies behind those innovations, the impact on audio innovation, and the continuing emerging opportunities for further advances in audio capabilities.

My guests today are Sam Sabet, chief technology officer at Shure, and Brendan Ittelson, chief ecosystem officer at Zoom.

Sam Sabet: Thank you, Megan. It&#39;s a pleasure to be here and I&#39;m looking forward to this conversation with both you and Brendan. It should be a very exciting conversation.

Brendan Ittelson: Thank you so much for having me today. I&#39;m looking forward to the conversation and all the topics we have to dive into on this area.

Megan: Fantastic. Lovely to have you both here. And Sam, just to set some context, I wonder if we could start with the pandemic and the innovation that really was born out of necessity. I mean, when it became clear that we were all going to be virtual for the foreseeable future, I wonder what was the first technological mission for Shure?

Sam: Yeah, very good question. The pandemic really accelerated a lot of innovation around virtual communications and fundamentally how we perform our everyday jobs remotely. One of our first technological mission when the pandemic happened and everybody ended up going home and performing their functions remotely was to make sure that people could continue to communicate effectively, whether that&#39;s for business meetings, virtual events, or educational purposes. We focused on collaboration and enhancing collaboration tools. And ideally what we were aiming to do, or we focused on, was to basically improve the ease of use and configuration of audio tool sets.

Because unlike the office environment where it might be a lot more controlled, people are working from non-traditional areas like home offices or other makeshift solutions, we needed to make sure that people could still get pristine audio and that studio level audio even in uncontrolled environments that are not really made for that. We expedited development in our software solutions. We created tool sets that allowed for ease of deployment and remote configuration and management so we could enable people to continue doing the things they needed to do without having to worry about the underlying technology.

Megan: And Brendan, during that time, it seemed everyone became a Zoom user of some sort. I mean, what was the first mission at Zoom when virtual connection became this necessity for everyone?

Brendan: Well, our mission fundamentally didn&#39;t change. It&#39;s always been about delivering frictionless communications. What shifted was the urgency and the magnitude of what we were doing. Our focus shifted on how we do this reliably, securely, and to scale to ensure these millions of new users could connect instantly without friction. We really shifted our thinking of being just a business continuity tool to becoming a lifeline for so many individuals and industries. The stories that we heard across education, healthcare, and just general human connection, the number of those moments that matter to people that we were able to help facilitate just became so important. We really focused on how can we be there and make it frictionless so folks can focus on that human connection. And that accelerated our thinking in terms of innovation and reinforced the thought that we need to focus on the simplicity, accessibility, and trust in communication technology so that people could focus on that connection and not the technology that makes it possible.

Megan: That&#39;s so true. It did really just become an absolute lifeline for people, didn&#39;t it? And before we dive into the technologies beyond these emerging capabilities, I wonder if we could first talk about just the importance of clear audio. I mean, Sam, as much as we all worry over how we look on Zoom, is how we sound perhaps as or even more impactful?

Sam: Yeah, you&#39;re absolutely correct. I mean, clear audio is absolutely critical for effective communications. Video quality is very important absolutely, but poor audio can really hinder understanding and engagement. As a matter of fact, there&#39;s studies and research from areas such as Yale University that say that poor audio can make understanding somewhat more challenged and even affect retention of information. Especially in an educational type environment where there&#39;s a lot of background noise and very differing types of spaces like auditoriums and lecture halls, it really becomes a high priority that you have great audio quality. And during the pandemic, as you said, and as Brendan rightly said, it became one of our highest priorities to focus on technologies like beamforming mics and ways to focus on the speaker&#39;s voice and minimize that unwanted background noise so that we could ensure that the communication was efficient, was well understood, and that it removed the distraction so people could be able to actually communicate and retain the information that was being shared.

Megan: It is incredible just how impactful audio can be, can&#39;t it? Brendan, I mean as you said, remote and hybrid collaboration is part of Zoom&#39;s DNA. What observations can you share about how users have grown along with the technological advancements and maybe how their expectations have grown as well?

Brendan: Definitely. I mean, users now expect seamless and intelligent experiences. Audio and video just working is a baseline for collaboration. That expectation has shifted from connecting people to enhancing productivity and creativity across the entire ecosystem. When we look at it, we&#39;re really looking at these trends in terms of how people want to be better when they&#39;re at home. For example, AI-powered tools like Smart Summaries, translation and noise suppression to help people stay productive and connected no matter where they&#39;re working. But then this also comes into play at the office. We&#39;re starting to see folks that dive into our technology like Intelligent Director and Smart Name Tags that create that meeting equity even when they&#39;re in a conference room.

So, the remote experience and the room experience all are similar and create that same ability to be seen, heard, and contribute. And we&#39;re now diving further into this that it&#39;s beyond just meetings. Zoom is really transforming into an AI-first work platform that&#39;s focused on human connection. And so that goes beyond the meetings into things like Chat, Zoom Docs, Zoom Events and Webinars, the Zoom Contact Center and more. And all of this being brought together using our AI Companion at its core to help connect all of those different points of connection for individuals.

Megan: I mean, so Brendan, we know it wasn&#39;t only workplaces that were affected by the pandemic, it was also the education sector that had to undergo a huge change. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about how Zoom has operated in that higher education sphere as well.

Brendan: Definitely. Education has always been a focus for Zoom and an area that we&#39;ve believed in. Because education and learning is something as a company we value and so we have invested in that sector. And personally being the son of academics, it is always an area that I find fascinating. We continue to invest in terms of how do we make the classroom a stronger space? And especially now that the classroom has changed, where it can be in person, it can be virtual, it can be a mix. And using Zoom and its tools, we&#39;re able to help bridge all those different scenarios to make learning accessible to students no matter their means.

That&#39;s what truly excites us, is being able to have that technology that allows people to pursue their desires, their interests, and really up-level their pursuits and inspire more. We&#39;re constantly investing in how to allow those messages to get out and to integrate in the flow of communication and collaboration that higher education uses, whether that&#39;s being integrated into the classroom, into learning management systems, to make that a seamless flow so that students and their educators can just collaborate seamlessly. And also that we can support all the infrastructure and administration that helps make that possible.

Megan: Absolutely. Such an important thing. And Sam, Shure as well, could you talk to us a bit about how you worked in that kind of education space as well from an audio point of view?

Sam: Absolutely. Actually, this is a topic that&#39;s near and dear to my heart because I&#39;m actually an adjunct professor in my free time.

Sam: And the challenges of trying to do this sort of a hybrid lecture, if you will. And Shure has been particularly well suited for this environment and we&#39;ve been focused on it and investing in technologies there for decades. If you think about how a lecture hall is structured, it&#39;s a little different than just having a meeting around the conference table. And Shure has focused on creating products that allow this combination of a presenter scenario along with a meeting space plus the far end where users or students are remote, they can hear intelligibly what&#39;s happening in the lecture hall, but they can also participate.

Between our products like the Ceiling Mic Arrays and our wireless microphones that are purpose built for presenters and educators like our MXW neXt product line, we&#39;ve created technologies that allow those two previously separate worlds to integrate together. And then add that onto integrating with Zoom and other products that allow for that collaboration has been very instrumental. And again, being a user and providing those lectures, I can see a night and day difference and just how much more effective my lectures are today from where they were five to six years ago. And that&#39;s all just made possible by all the technologies that are purpose built for these scenarios and integrating more with these powerful tools that just make the job so much more seamless.

Megan: Absolutely fascinating that you got to put the technology to use yourself as well to check that it was all working well. And you mentioned AI there, of course. I mean, Sam, what AI technologies have had the most significant impact on recent audio advancements too?

Sam: Yeah. Absolutely. If you think about the fundamental need here, it&#39;s the ability to amplify the audio and the information that&#39;s really needed and diminish the unwanted sounds and audio so that we can enhance that experience and make it seamless for people to communicate. With our innovations at Shure, we&#39;ve leveraged the cutting-edge technologies to both enhance communication effectiveness and to align seamlessly with evolving features in unified communications like the ones that Brandon just mentioned in the Zoom platforms.

We partner with industry leaders like Zoom to ensure that we&#39;re providing the ability to be able to focus on that needed audio and eliminate all the background distractions. AI has transformed that audio technology with things like machine learning algorithms that enable us to do more real-time audio processing and significantly enhancing things like noise reduction and speech isolation. Just to give you a simple example, our IntelliMix Room audio processing software that we&#39;ve released as well as part of a complete room solution uses AI to optimize sound in different environments.

And really that&#39;s one of the fundamental changes in this period, whether that&#39;s pandemic or post-pandemic, is that the key is really flexibility and being able to adapt to changing work environments. Even if you&#39;re not working from home and coming into the office, the types of spaces and environments you try to collaborate in today are constantly changing because our needs are constantly changing. And so having software and algorithms that adapt seamlessly and are able to self-optimize based on the acoustics of the room, based on the different layouts of the spaces where people collaborate in is instrumental.

And then last but not least, AI has transformed the way audio and video integrate. For example, we utilize voice recognition systems that integrate with intelligent cameras so that we enable voice tracking technology so that cameras can not only identify who&#39;s speaking, but you have the ability to hear and see people clearly. And that in general just enhances the overall communication experience.

Megan: Wow. It&#39;s just so much innovation in quite a short space of time really. I mean, Brendan, you mentioned AI a little bit there beforehand, but I wonder what other AI technologies have had the biggest impact as Zoom builds out its own emerging capabilities?

Brendan: Definitely. And I couldn&#39;t agree more with Sam that, I mean, AI has made such a big shift and it&#39;s really across the spectrum. And when I think about it, there&#39;s almost three tiers when you look at the stack. You start off at the raw audio where AI is doing those things like noise suppression, echo cancellation, voice enhancements. All of that just makes this amazing audio signal that can then go into the next layer, which is the speech AI and natural language processing. Which starts to open up those items such as the real-time transcription, translation, searchable content to make the communication not just what&#39;s heard, but making it more accessible to more individuals and inclusive by providing that content in a format that is best for them.

And then you take those two layers and put the generative and agentic AI on top of that, that can start surfacing insights, summarize the conversation, and even take actions on someone&#39;s behalf. It really starts to change the way that people work and how they have access and allows them to connect. I think it is a huge shift and I&#39;m very excited by how those three levels start to interact to really enable people to do more and to connect thanks to AI.

Megan: Yeah. Absolutely. So much rich information that can come out from a single call now because of those sorts of tools. And following on from that, Brendan, I mean, you mentioned before the Zoom AI Companion. I wondered if you could talk a bit about what were your top priorities when building that product to ensure it was truly useful for your customers?

Brendan: Definitely. When we developed AI Companion, we had two priority focus areas from day one, trust and security, and then accuracy and relevance. On the trust side, it was a non-negotiable that customer data wouldn&#39;t be used to train our models. People need to know that their conversations and content are private and secure.

Brendan: And then with accuracy, we needed to ensure AI outputs weren&#39;t generic but grounded in the actual context of a meeting, a chat or a product. But the real story here when I think about AI Companion is the customer value that it delivers. AI Companion helps people save time with meeting recaps, task generation, and proactive prep for the next session. It reduces that friction in hybrid work, whether you&#39;re in a meeting room, a Zoom room, or collaborating across different collaboration tools like Microsoft or Google. And it enables more equitable participation by surfacing the right context for everyone no matter where and how they&#39;re working.

All this leads to a result where it&#39;s practical, trustworthy, and embedded where work happens. And it&#39;s just not another tool to manage, it&#39;s there in someone&#39;s flow of work to help them along the way.

Megan: Yeah. That trust piece is just so important, isn&#39;t it, today? And Sam, as much as AI has impacted audio innovation, audio has also had an impact on AI capabilities. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about audio as a data input and the advancements technologies like large language models, LLMs, are enabling.

Sam: Absolutely. Audio is really a rich data source that&#39;s added a new dimension to AI capabilities. If you think about speech recognition or natural language processing, they&#39;ve had significant advances due to audio data that&#39;s provided for them. And to Brendan&#39;s point about trust and accuracy, I like to think of the products that Shure enables customers with as essentially the eyes and ears in the room for leading AI companions just like the Zoom AI Companion. You really need that pristine audio input to be able to trust the accuracy of what the AI generates. These AI Companions have been very instrumental in the way we do business every day. I mean, between transcription, speaker attributions, the ability to add action items within a meeting and be able to track what&#39;s happening in our interactions, all of that really has to rely on that accurate and pristine input from audio into the AI. I feel that further improves the trust that our end users have to the results of AI and be able to leverage it more.

If you think about it, if you look at how AI audio inputs enhance that interactive AI system, it enables more natural and intuitive interactions with AI. And it really allows for that seamless integration and the ability for users to use it without having to worry about, is the room set up correctly? Is the audio level proper? And when we talk even about agentic AI, we&#39;re working on future developments where systems can self-heal or detect that there are issues in the environment so that they can autocorrect and adapt in all these different environments and further enable the AI to be able to do a much more effective job, if you will.

Megan: Sam, you touched on future developments there. I wonder if we could close our conversation today with a bit of a future forward look, if we could. Brendan, can you share innovations that Zoom is working on now and what are you most excited to see come to fruition?

Brendan: Well, your timing for this question is absolutely perfect because we&#39;ve just wrapped up Zoomtopia 2025.

Brendan: And this is where we discussed a lot of the new AI innovations that we have coming to Zoom. Starting off, there&#39;s AI Companion 3.0. And we&#39;ve launched this next generation of agentic AI capabilities in Zoom Workplace. And with 3.0 when it releases, it isn&#39;t just about transcribing, it&#39;s turned into really a platform that helps you with follow-up task, prep for your next conversation, and even proactively suggest how to free up your time. For example, AI Companion can help you schedule meetings intelligently across time zones, suggest which meetings you can skip, and still stay informed and even prepare you with context and insights before you walk into the conversation. It&#39;s about helping people focus on strategy and creativity instead of administrative busy work. And for hybrid work specifically, we introduced Zoomie Group Assistant, which will be a big leap for hybrid collaboration.

Acting as an assistant for a group chat and meetings, you can simply ask, “@Zoomie, what&#39;s the latest update on the project?” Or “@Zoomie, what are the team&#39;s action items?” And then get instant answers. Or because we&#39;re talking about audio here, you can go into a conference room and say, &quot;Hey, Zoomie,&quot; and get help with things like checking into a room, adjusting lights, temperature, or even sharing your screen. And while all these are built-in features, we&#39;re also expanding the platform to allow custom AI agents through our AI Studio, so organizations can bring their own agents or integrate with third-party ones.

Zoom has always believed in an open platform and philosophy and that is continuing. Folks using AI Companion 3.0 will be able to use agents across platforms to work with the workflows that they have across all the different SaaS vendors that they might have in their environment, whether that&#39;s Google, Microsoft, ServiceNow, Cisco, and so many other tools.

Megan: Fantastic. It certainly sounds like a tool I could use in my work, so I look forward to hearing more about that. And Sam, we&#39;ve touched on there are so many exciting things happening in audio too. What are you working on at Shure? And what are you most excited to see come to fruition?

Sam: At Shure, our engineering teams are really working on a range of exciting projects, but particularly we&#39;re working on developing new collaboration solutions that are integral for IT end users. And these integrate obviously with the leading UC platforms.

We&#39;re integrating audio and video technologies that are scalable, reliable solutions. And we want to be able to seamlessly connect these to cloud services so that we can leverage both AI technologies and the tool sets available to optimize every type of workspace essentially. Not just meeting rooms, but lecture halls, work from home scenarios, et cetera.

The other area that we really focus on in terms of our reliability and quality really comes from our DNA in the pro audio world. And that&#39;s really all-around wireless audio technologies. We&#39;re developing our next-generation wireless systems and these are going to offer even greater reliability and range. And they really become ideal for everything from a large-scale event to personal home use and the gamut across that whole spectrum. And I think all of that in partnership with our partners like Zoom will help just facilitate the modern workspace.

Megan: Absolutely. So much exciting innovation clearly going on behind the scenes. Thank you both so much.

That was Sam Sabet, chief technology officer at Shure, and Brendan Ittelson, chief ecosystem officer at Zoom, whom I spoke with from Brighton in England.

Hackers made death threats against this security researcher. Big mistake.

In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon.These anonymous personas targeted Nixon because she had become a formidable threat: As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, named after Sherlock Holmes’s apartment, she had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested.Though she’d done this work for more than a decade, Nixon couldn’t understand why the person behind the accounts was suddenly threatening her. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn’t been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets.Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing.

ALS stole this musician’s voice. AI let him sing again.

There are tears in the audience as Patrick Darling’s song begins to play. It’s a heartfelt song written for his great-grandfather, whom he never got the chance to meet. But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease, it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again. Read the full story.

            <h2>The scientist using AI to hunt for antibiotics just about everywhere</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/16/1132516/cesar-de-la-fuente-using-ai-antibiotics-hunt/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When he was just a teenager trying to decide what to do with his life, César de la Fuente compiled a list of the world’s biggest problems. He ranked them inversely by how much money governments were spending to solve them. Antimicrobial resistance topped the list.

Twenty years on, the problem has not gone away. If anything, it’s gotten worse. Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses that have evolved ways to evade treatments are now associated with more than 4 million deaths per year, and a recent analysis, published in the Lancet, predicts that number could surge past 8 million by 2050. In a July 2025 essay in Physical Review Letters, de la Fuente, now a bioengineer and computational biologist, and synthetic biologist James Collins warned of a looming “post­antibiotic” era in which infections from drug-resistant strains of common bacteria like Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, which can often still be treated by our current arsenal of medications, become fatal. “The antibiotic discovery pipeline remains perilously thin,” they wrote, “impeded by high development costs, lengthy timelines, and low returns on investment.”

But de la Fuente is using artificial intelligence to bring about a different future. His team at the University of Pennsylvania is training AI tools to search genomes far and deep for peptides with antibiotic properties. His vision is to assemble those peptides—molecules made of up to 50 amino acids linked together—into various configurations, including some never seen in nature. The results, he hopes, could defend the body against microbes that withstand traditional treatments.

His quest has unearthed promising candidates in unexpected places. In August 2025 his team, which includes 16 scientists in Penn’s Machine Biology Group, described peptides hiding in the genetic code of ancient single-celled organisms called archaea. Before that, they’d excavated a list of candidates from the venom of snakes, wasps, and spiders. And in an ongoing project de la Fuente calls “molecular de-­extinction,” he and his collaborators have been scanning published genetic sequences of extinct species for potentially functional molecules. Those species include hominids like Neanderthals and Denisovans and charismatic megafauna like woolly mammoths, as well as ancient zebras and penguins. In the history of life on Earth, de la Fuente reasons, maybe some organism evolved an antimicrobial defense that could be helpful today. Those long-gone codes have given rise to resurrected compounds with names like ­mammuthusin-2 (from woolly mammoth DNA), mylodonin-2 (from the giant sloth), and hydrodamin-1 (from the ancient sea cow). Over the last few years, this molecular binge has enabled de la Fuente to amass a library of more than a million genetic recipes.

At 40 years old, de la Fuente has also collected a trophy case of awards from the American Society for Microbiology, the American Chemical Society, and other organizations. (In 2019, this magazine named him one of “35 Innovators Under 35” for bringing computational approaches to antibiotic discovery.) He’s widely recognized as a leader in the effort to harness AI for real-world problems. “He’s really helped pioneer that space,” says Collins, who is at MIT. (The two have not collaborated in the laboratory, but Collins has long been at the forefront of using AI for drug discovery, including the search for antibiotics. In 2020, Collins’s team used an AI model to predict a broad-­spectrum antibiotic, halicin, that is now in preclinical development.)

The world of antibiotic development needs as much creativity and innovation as researchers can muster, says Collins. And de la Fuente’s work on peptides has pushed the field forward: “César is marvelously talented, very innovative.”

De la Fuente describes antimicrobial resistance as an “almost impossible” problem, but he sees plenty of room for exploration in the word almost. “I like challenges,” he says, “and I think this is the ultimate challenge.”

The use, overuse, and misuse of antibiotics, he says, drives antimicrobial resistance. And the problem is growing unchecked because conventional ways to find, make, and test the drugs are prohibitively expensive and often lead to dead ends. “A lot of the companies that have attempted to do antibiotic development in the past have ended up folding because there’s no good return on investment at the end of the day,” he says.

Antibiotic discovery has always been a messy, noisy endeavor, driven by serendipity and fraught with uncertainty and misdirection. For decades, researchers have largely relied on brute-force mechanical methods. “Scientists dig into soil, they dig into water,” says de la Fuente. “And then from that complex organic matter they try to extract antimicrobial molecules.”

But molecules can be extraordinarily complex. Researchers have estimated the number of possible organic combinations that could be synthesized at somewhere around 1060. For reference, Earth contains an estimated 1018 grains of sand. “Drug discovery in any domain is a statistics game,” says Jonathan Stokes, a chemical biologist at McMaster University in Canada, who has been using generative AI to design potential new antibiotics that can be synthesized in a lab, and who worked with Collins on halicin. “You need enough shots on goal to happen to get one.”

Those have to be good shots, though. And AI seems well suited to improving researchers’ aim. Biology is an information source, de la Fuente explains: “It’s like a bunch of code.” The code of DNA has four letters; proteins and peptides have 20, where each “letter” represents an amino acid. De la Fuente says his work amounts to training AI models to recognize sequences of letters that encode antimicrobial peptides, or AMPs. “If you think about it that way,” he says, “you can devise algorithms to mine the code and identify functional molecules, which can be antimicrobials. Or antimalarials. Or anticancer agents.”

Practically speaking, we’re still not there: These peptides haven’t yet been transformed into usable drugs that help people, and there are plenty of details—dosage, delivery, specific targets—that need to be sorted out, says de la Fuente. But AMPs are appealing because the body already uses them.They’re a critical part of the immune system and often the first line of defense against pathogenic infections. Unlike conventional antibiotics, which typically have one trick for killing bacteria, AMPs often exhibit a multimodal approach. They may disrupt the cell wall and the genetic material inside as well as a variety of cellular processes. A bacterial pathogen may evolve resistance to a conventional drug’s single mode of action, but maybe not to a multipronged AMP attack.

De la Fuente’s group is one of many pushing the boundaries of using AI for antibiotics. Where he focuses primarily on peptides, Collins works on small-molecule discovery. So does Stokes, at McMaster, whose models identify promising new molecules and predict whether they can be synthesized. “It’s only been a few years since folks have been using AI meaningfully in drug discovery,” says Collins.

Even in that short time the tools have changed, says James Zou, a computer scientist at Stanford University, who has worked with Stokes and Collins. Researchers have moved from using predictive models to developing generative approaches. With a predictive approach, Zou says, researchers screen large libraries of candidates that are known to be promising. Generative approaches offer something else: the appeal of designing a new molecule from scratch. Last year, for example, de la Fuente’s team used one generative AI model to design a suite of synthetic peptides and another to assess them. The group tested two of the resulting compounds on mice infected with a drug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii, a germ that the World Health Organization has identified as a “critical priority” in research on antimicrobial resistance. Both successfully and safely treated the infection.

But the field is still in the discovery phase. In his current work, de la Fuente is trying to get candidates closer to clinical testing. To that end, his team is developing an ambitious multimodal model called ApexOracle that’s designed to analyze a new pathogen, pinpoint its genetic weaknesses, match it to antimicrobial peptides that might work against it, and then predict how an antibiotic, built from those peptides, would fare in lab tests. It “converges understanding in chemistry, genomics, and language,” he says. It’s preliminary, he adds, but even if it doesn’t work perfectly, it will help steer the next generation of AI models toward the ultimate goal of resisting resistance.

Using AI, he believes, human researchers now have a fighting chance at catching up to the giant threat before them. The technology has already saved decades of human research time. Now he wants it to save lives, too: “This is the world that we live in today, and it’s incredible.”

            <h2>Hackers made death threats against this security researcher. Big mistake.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/16/1132526/allison-nixon-hackers-security-researcher/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon.

“Alison [sic] Nixon is gonna get necklaced with a tire filled with gasoline soon,” wrote Waifu/Judische, both of which are words with offensive connotations. “Decerebration is my fav type of brain death, thats whats gonna happen to alison Nixon.”

It wasn’t long before others piled on. Someone shared AI-generated nudes of Nixon.

These anonymous personas targeted Nixon because she had become a formidable threat: As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, named after Sherlock Holmes’s apartment, she had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested. For years she had lurked quietly in online chat channels or used pseudonyms to engage with perpetrators directly while piecing together clues they’d carelessly drop about themselves and their crimes. This had helped her bring to justice a number of cybercriminals—especially members of a loosely affiliated subculture of anarchic hackers who call themselves the Com.

But members of the Com aren’t just involved in hacking; some of them also engage in offline violence against researchers who track them. This includes bricking (throwing a brick through a victim’s window) and swatting (a dangerous type of hoax that involves reporting a false murder or hostage situation at someone’s home so SWAT teams will swarm it with guns drawn). Members of a Com offshoot known as 764 have been accused of even more violent acts—including animal torture, stabbings, and school shootings—or of inciting others in and outside the Com to commit these crimes.

Nixon started tracking members of the community more than a decade ago, when other researchers and people in law enforcement were largely ignoring them because they were young—many in their teens. Her early attention allowed her to develop strategies for unmasking them.

Ryan Brogan, a special agent with the FBI, says Nixon has helped him and colleagues identify and arrest more than two dozen members of the community since 2011, when he first began working with her, and that her skills in exposing them are unparalleled. “If you get on Allison’s and my radar, you’re going [down]. It’s just a matter of time,” he says. “No matter how much digital anonymity and tradecraft you try to apply, you’re done.”

Though she’d done this work for more than a decade, Nixon couldn’t understand why the person behind the Waifu/Judische accounts was suddenly threatening her. She had given media interviews about the Com—most recently on 60 Minutes—but not about her work unmasking members to get them arrested, so the hostility seemed to come out of the blue. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn’t been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets.

Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing. “Prior to them death-threatening me, I had no reason to pay attention to them,” she says.

Most people have never heard of the Com, but its influence and threat are growing.

It’s an online community comprising loosely affiliated groups of, primarily, teens and twentysomethings in North America and English-speaking parts of Europe who have become part of what some call a cybercrime youth movement.

International laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn’t stop the anarchic Com.

Over the last decade, its criminal activities have escalated from simple distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that disrupt websites to SIM-swapping hacks that hijack a victim’s phone service, as well as crypto theft, ransomware attacks, and corporate data theft. These crimes have affected AT&T, Microsoft, Uber, and others. Com members have also been involved in various forms of sextortion aimed at forcing victims to physically harm themselves or record themselves doing sexually explicit activities. The Com’s impact has also spread beyond the digital realm to kidnapping, beatings, and other violence.

One longtime cybercrime researcher, who asked to remain anonymous because of his work, says the Com is as big a threat in the cyber realm as Russia and China—for one unusual reason.

“There’s only so far that China is willing to go; there’s only so far that Russia or North Korea is willing to go,” he says, referring to international laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, that prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn’t stop the anarchic Com, he says.

“It is a pretty significant threat, and people tend to … push it under the rug [because] it’s just a bunch of kids,” he says. “But look at the impact [they have].”

Brogan says the amount of damage they do in terms of monetary losses “can become staggering very quickly.”

There is no single site where Com members congregate; they spread across a number of web forums and Telegram and Discord channels. The group follows a long line of hacking and subculture communities that emerged online over the last two decades, gained notoriety, and then faded or vanished after prominent members were arrested or other factors caused their decline. They differed in motivation and activity, but all emerged from “the same primordial soup,” says Nixon. The Com’s roots can be traced to the Scene, which began as a community of various “warez” groups engaged in pirating computer games, music, and movies.

When Nixon began looking at the Scene, in 2011, its members were hijacking gaming accounts, launching DDoS attacks, and running booter services. (DDoS attacks overwhelm a server or computer with traffic from bot-controlled machines, preventing legitimate traffic from getting through; booters are tools that anyone can rent to launch a DDoS attack against a target of choice.) While they made some money, their primary goal was notoriety.

This changed around 2018. Cryptocurrency values were rising, and the Com—or the Community, as it sometimes called itself—emerged as a subgroup that ultimately took over the Scene. Members began to focus on financial gain—cryptocurrency theft, data theft, and extortion.

The pandemic two years later saw a surge in Com membership that Nixon attributes to social isolation and the forced movement of kids online for schooling. But she believes economic conditions and socialization problems have also driven its growth. Many Com members can’t get jobs because they lack skills or have behavioral issues, she says. A number who have been arrested have had troubled home lives and difficulty adapting to school, and some have shown signs of mental illness. The Com provides camaraderie, support, and an outlet for personal frustrations. Since 2018, it has also offered some a solution to their money problems.

Loose-knit cells have sprouted from the community—Star Fraud, ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, Lapsus$—to collaborate on clusters of crime. They usually target high-profile crypto bros and tech giants and have made millions of dollars from theft and extortion, according to court records.

But dominance, power, and bragging rights are still motivators, even in profit operations, says the cybercrime researcher, which is partly why members target “big whales.”

“There is financial gain,” he says, “but it’s also [sending a message that] I can reach out and touch the people that think they’re untouchable.” In fact, Nixon says, some members of the Com have overwhelming ego-driven motivations that end up conflicting with their financial motives.

“Often their financial schemes fall apart because of their ego, and that phenomenon is also what I’ve made my career on,” she says.

Nixon has straight dark hair, wears wire-rimmed glasses, and has a slight build and bookish demeanor that, on first impression, could allow her to pass for a teen herself. She talks about her work in rapid cadences, like someone whose brain is filled with facts that are under pressure to get out, and she exudes a sense of urgency as she tries to make people understand the threat the Com poses. She doesn’t suppress her happiness when someone she’s been tracking gets arrested.

In 2011, when she first began investigating the communities from which the Com emerged, she was working the night shift in the security operations center of the security firm SecureWorks. The center responded to tickets and security alerts emanating from customer networks, but Nixon coveted a position on the company’s counter-threats team, which investigated and published threat-intelligence reports on mostly state-sponsored hacking groups from China and Russia. Without connections or experience, she had no path to investigative work. But Nixon is an intensely curious person, and this created its own path.

Where the threat team focused on the impact hackers had on customer networks—how they broke in, what they stole—Nixon was more interested in their motivations and the personality traits that drove their actions. She assumed there must be online forums where criminal hackers congregated, so she googled “hacking forums” and landed on a site called Hack Forums.

She was surprised to see members openly discussing their crimes there. She reached out to someone on the SecureWorks threat team to see if he was aware of the site, and he dismissed it as a place for “script kiddies”—a pejorative term for unskilled hackers.

This was a time when many cybersecurity pros were shifting their focus away from cybercrime to state-sponsored hacking operations, which were more sophisticated and getting a lot of attention. But Nixon likes to zig where others zag, and her colleague’s dismissiveness fueled her interest in the forums. Two other SecureWorks colleagues shared that interest, and the three studied the forums during downtime on their shifts. They focused on trying to identify the people running DDoS booters.

What Nixon loved about the forums was how accessible they were to a beginner like herself. Threat-intelligence teams require privileged access to a victim’s network to investigate breaches. But Nixon could access everything she needed in the public forums, where the hackers seemed to think no one was watching. Because of this, they often made mistakes in operational security, or OPSEC—letting slip little biographical facts such as the city where they lived, a school they attended, or a place they used to work. These details revealed in their chats, combined with other information, could help expose the real identities behind their anonymous masks.

“It was a shock to me that it was relatively easy to figure out who [they were],” she says.

She wasn’t bothered by the immature boasting and petty fights that dominated the forums. “A lot of people don’t like to do this work of reading chat logs. I realize that this is a very uncommon thing. And maybe my brain is built a little weird that I’m willing to do this,” she says. “I have a special talent that I can wade through garbage and it doesn’t bother me.”

Nixon soon realized that not all the members were script kiddies. Some exhibited real ingenuity and “powerful” skills, she says, but because they were applying these to frivolous purposes—hijacking gamer accounts instead of draining bank accounts—researchers and law enforcement were ignoring them. Nixon began tracking them, suspecting that they would eventually direct their skills at more significant targets—an intuition that proved to be correct. And when they did, she had already amassed a wealth of information about them.

She continued her DDoS research for two years until a turning point in 2013, when the cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs, who made a career tracking cybercriminals, got swatted.

About a dozen people from the security community worked with Krebs to expose the perpetrator, and Nixon was invited to help. Krebs sent her pieces of the puzzle to investigate, and eventually the group identified the culprit (though it would take two years for him to be arrested). When she was invited to dinner with Krebs and the other investigators, she realized she’d found her people.

“It was an amazing moment for me,” she says. “I was like, wow, there’s all these like-minded people that just want to help and are doing it just for the love of the game, basically.”

It was porn stars who provided Nixon with her next big research focus—one that underscored her skill at spotting Com actors and criminal trends in their nascent stages, before they emerged as major threats.

In 2018, someone was hijacking the social media accounts of certain adult-film stars and using those accounts to blast out crypto scams to their large follower bases. Nixon couldn’t figure out how the hackers had hijacked the social media profiles, but she promised to help the actors regain access to their accounts if they agreed to show her the private messages the hackers had sent or received during the time they controlled them. These messages led her to a forum where members were talking about how they stole the accounts. The hackers had tricked some of these actors into disclosing the mobile phone numbers of others. Then they used a technique called SIM swapping to reset passwords for social media accounts belonging to those other stars, locking them out.

In SIM swapping, fraudsters get a victim’s phone number assigned to a SIM card and phone they control, so that calls and messages intended for the victim go to them instead. This includes one-time security codes that sites text to account holders to verify themselves when accessing their account or changing its password. In some of the cases involving the porn stars, the hackers had manipulated telecom workers into making the SIM swaps for what they thought were legitimate reasons, and in other cases they bribed the workers to make the change. The hackers were then able to alter the password on the actors’ social media accounts, lock out the owners, and use the accounts to advertise their crypto scams.

SIM swapping is a powerful technique that can be used to hijack and drain entire cryptocurrency and bank accounts, so Nixon was surprised to see the fraudsters using it for relatively unprofitable schemes. But SIM swapping had rarely been used for financial fraud at that point, and like the earlier hackers Nixon had seen on Hack Forums, the ones hijacking porn star accounts didn’t seem to grasp the power of the technique they were using. Nixon suspected that this would change and SIM swapping would soon become a major problem, so she shifted her research focus accordingly. It didn’t take long for the fraudsters to pivot as well.

Nixon’s skill at looking ahead in this way has served her throughout her career. On multiple occasions a hacker or hacking group would catch her attention—for using a novel hacking approach in some minor operation, for example—and she’d begin tracking their online posts and chats in the belief that they’d eventually do something significant with that skill.

They usually did. When they later grabbed headlines with a showy or impactful operation, these hackers would seem to others to have emerged from nowhere, sending researchers and law enforcement scrambling to understand who they were. But Nixon would already have a dossier compiled on them and, in some cases, had unmasked their real identity as well. Lizard Squad was an example of this. The group burst into the headlines in 2014 and 2015 with a series of high-profile DDoS campaigns, but Nixon and colleagues at the job where she worked at the time had already been watching its members as individuals for a while. So the FBI sought their assistance in identifying them.

“The thing about these young hackers is that they … keep going until they get arrested, but it takes years for them to get arrested,” she says. “So a huge aspect of my career is just sitting on this information that has not been actioned [yet].”

It was during the Lizard Squad years that Nixon began developing tools to scrape and record hacker communications online, though it would be years before she began using these concepts to scrape the Com chatrooms and forums. These channels held a wealth of data that might not seem useful during the nascent stage of a hacker’s career but could prove critical later, when law enforcement got around to investigating them; yet the contents were always at risk of being deleted by Com members or getting taken down by law enforcement when it seized websites and chat channels.

Nixon’s work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.”

Over several years, she scraped and preserved whatever chatrooms she was investigating. But it wasn’t until early 2020, when she joined Unit 221B, that she got the chance to scrape the Telegram and Discord channels of the Com. She pulled all of this data together into a searchable platform that other researchers and law enforcement could use. The company hired two former hackers to help build scraping tools and infrastructure for this work; the result is eWitness, a community-driven, invitation-­only platform. It was initially seeded only with data Nixon had collected after she arrived at Unit 221B, but has since been augmented with data that other users of the platform have scraped from Com social spaces as well, some of which doesn’t exist in public forums anymore.

Brogan, of the FBI, says it’s an incredibly valuable tool, made more so by Nixon’s own contributions. Other security firms scrape online criminal spaces as well, but they seldom share the content with outsiders, and Brogan says Nixon’s work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.”

The preservation project she started when she got to Unit 221B could not have been better timed, because it coincided with the pandemic, the surge in new Com membership, and the emergence of two disturbing Com offshoots, CVLT and 764. She was able to capture their chats as these groups first emerged; after law enforcement arrested leaders of the groups and took control of the servers where their chats were posted, this material went offline.

CVLT—pronounced “cult”—was reportedly founded around 2019 with a focus on sextortion and child sexual abuse material. 764 emerged from CVLT and was spearheaded by a 15-year-old in Texas named Bradley Cadenhead, who named it after the first digits of his zip code. Its focus was extremism and violence.

In 2021, because of what she observed in these groups, Nixon turned her attention to sextortion among Com members.

The type of sextortion they engaged in has its roots in activity that began a decade ago as “fan signing.” Hackers would use the threat of doxxing to coerce someone, usually a young female, into writing the hacker’s handle on a piece of paper. The hacker would use a photo of it as an avatar on his online accounts—a kind of trophy. Eventually some began blackmailing victims into writing the hacker’s handle on their face, breasts, or genitals. With CVLT, this escalated even further; targets were blackmailed into carving a Com member’s name into their skin or engaging in sexually explicit acts while recording or livestreaming themselves.

During the pandemic a surprising number of SIM swappers crossed into child sexual abuse material and sadistic sextortion, according to Nixon. She hates tracking this gruesome activity, but she saw an opportunity to exploit it for good. She had long been frustrated at how leniently judges treated financial fraudsters because of their crimes’ seemingly nonviolent nature. But she saw a chance to get harsher sentences for them if she could tie them to their sextortion and began to focus on these crimes.

At this point, Waifu still wasn’t on her radar. But that was about to change.

Nixon landed in Waifu’s crosshairs after he and fellow members of the Com were involved in a large hack involving AT&T customer call records in April 2024.

Waifu’s group gained access to dozens of cloud accounts with Snowflake, a company that provides online data storage for customers. One of those customers had more than 50 billion call logs of AT&T wireless subscribers stored in its Snowflake account.

They tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records. They tagged the FBI in the post. “It’s like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

Among the subscriber records were call logs for FBI agents who were AT&T customers. Nixon and other researchers believe the hackers may have been able to identify the phone numbers of agents through other means. Then they may have used a reverse-lookup program to identify the owners of phone numbers that the agents called or that called them and found Nixon’s number among them. This is when they began harassing her.

But then they got reckless. They allegedly extorted nearly $400,000 from AT&T in exchange for promising to delete the call records they’d stolen. Then they tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records they claimed to have deleted if it didn’t pay more. They tagged the FBI in the post.

“It’s like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

The Snowflake breaches and AT&T records theft were grabbing headlines at the time, but Nixon had no idea her number was in the stolen logs or that Waifu/Judische was a prime suspect in the breaches. So she was perplexed when he started taunting and threatening her online.

Over several weeks in May and June, a pattern developed. Waifu or one of his associates would post a threat against her and then post a message online inviting her to talk. She assumes now that they believed she was helping law enforcement investigate the Snowflake breaches and hoped to draw her into a dialogue to extract information from her about what authorities knew. But Nixon wasn’t helping the FBI investigate them yet. It was only after she began looking at Waifu for the threats that she became aware of his suspected role in the Snowflake hack.

It wasn’t the first time she had studied him, though. Waifu had come to her attention in 2019 when he bragged about framing another Com member for a hoax bomb threat and later talked about his involvement in SIM-swapping operations. He made an impression on her. He clearly had technical skills, but Nixon says he also often appeared immature, impulsive, and emotionally unstable, and he was desperate for attention in his interactions with other members. He bragged about not needing sleep and using Adderall to hack through the night. He was also a bit reckless about protecting personal details. He wrote in private chats to another researcher that he would never get caught because he was good at OPSEC, but he also told the researcher that he lived in Canada—which turned out to be true.

Nixon’s process for unmasking Waifu followed a general recipe she used to unmask Com members: She’d draw a large investigative circle around a target and all the personas that communicated with that person online, and then study their interactions to narrow the circle to the people with the most significant connections to the target. Some of the best leads came from a target’s enemies; she could glean a lot of information about their identity, personality, and activities from what the people they fought with online said about them.

“The enemies and the ex-girlfriends, generally speaking, are the best [for gathering intelligence on a suspect],” she says. “I love them.”

While she was doing this, Waifu and his group were reaching out to other security researchers, trying to glean information about Nixon and what she might be investigating. They also attempted to plant false clues with the researchers by dropping the names of other cybercriminals in Canada who could plausibly be Waifu. Nixon had never seen cybercriminals engage in counterintelligence tactics like this.

Amid this subterfuge and confusion, Nixon and another researcher working with her did a lot of consulting and cross-checking with other researchers about the clues they were gathering to ensure they had the right name before they gave it to the FBI.

By July she and the researcher were convinced they had their guy: Connor Riley Moucka, a 25-year-old high school dropout living with his grandfather in Ontario. On October 30, Royal Canadian Mounted Police converged on Moucka’s home and arrested him.

According to an affidavit filed in Canadian court, a plainclothes Canadian police officer visited Moucka’s house under some pretense on the afternoon of October 21, nine days before the arrest, to secretly capture a photo of him and compare it with an image US authorities had provided. The officer knocked and rang the bell; Moucka opened the door looking disheveled and told the visitor: “You woke me up, sir.” He told the officer his name was Alex; Moucka sometimes used the alias Alexander Antonin Moucka. Satisfied that the person who answered the door was the person the US was seeking, the officer left. Waifu’s online rants against Nixon escalated at this point, as did his attempts at misdirection. She believes the visit to his door spooked him.

Nixon won’t say exactly how they unmasked Moucka—only that he made a mistake.

“I don’t want to train these people in how to not get caught [by revealing his error],” she says.

The Canadian affidavit against Moucka reveals a number of other violent posts he’s alleged to have made online beyond the threats he made against her. Some involve musings about becoming a serial killer or mass-mailing sodium nitrate pills to Black people in Michigan and Ohio; in another, his online persona talks about obtaining firearms to “kill Canadians” and commit “suicide by cop.”

Prosecutors, who list Moucka’s online aliases as including Waifu, Judische, and two more in the indictment, say he and others extorted at least $2.5 million from at least three victims whose data they stole from Snowflake accounts. Moucka has been charged with nearly two dozen counts, including conspiracy, unauthorized access to computers, extortion, and wire fraud. He has pleaded not guilty and was extradited to the US last July. His trial is scheduled for October this year, though hacking cases usually end in plea agreements rather than going to trial.

It took months for authorities to arrest Moucka after Nixon and her colleague shared their findings with the authorities, but an alleged associate of his in the Snowflake conspiracy, a US Army soldier named Cameron John Wagenius (Kiberphant0m online), was arrested more quickly.

On November 10, 2024, Nixon and her team found a mistake Wagenius made that helped identify him, and on December 20 he was arrested. Wagenius has already pleaded guilty to two charges around the sale or attempted sale of confidential phone records and will be sentenced this March.

These days Nixon continues to investigate sextortion among Com members. But she says that remaining members of Waifu’s group still taunt and threaten her.

“They are continuing to persist in their nonsense, and they are getting taken out one by one,” she says. “And I’m just going to keep doing that until there’s no one left on that side.”

            <div id="article-text">Venture capital has long avoided ‘hard’ sectors such as government, defence, energy, manufacturing, and hardware, viewing them as uninvestable because startups have limited scope to challenge incumbents. Instead, investors have prioritised fast-moving and lightly regulated software markets with lower barriers to entry.

End users in these hard industries have paid the price, as a lack of innovation funding has left them stuck with incumbent providers that continue to deliver clunky, unintuitive solutions that are difficult to migrate from.

However, that perception is now shifting. Investors are responding to new market dynamics within complex industries and the evolving methods startups are using to outperform incumbents.

Government technology spending more than doubled between 2021 and 2025, while defence technology more than doubled in 2025 alone, and we see similar trends in robotics, industrial technology, and healthcare.  This signals a clear change in investor mindset as AI-first approaches are changing adoption cycles.

Historically, those sectors had been viewed as incompatible with venture capital norms: slow procurement cycles, strict regulation, heavy operational and capital requirements, as well as deep integration into physical systems.

For example, on a global level, public procurement can take years, constrained by budgeting cycles, legislation and accountability frameworks. Energy projects must comply with regulatory regimes and national permitting structures, and infrastructure and hardware deployments require extensive certification and long engineering cycles.

Government and public-sector buyers also tend to prioritise reliability, compliance, track record, and legacy relationships over speed, meaning major contracts often go to incumbents rather than startups. Similar dynamics exist in construction, mining, logistics, and manufacturing, all sectors that are still dominated by legacy vendors, complex supply chains, and thin operational margins.

That view is now changing. Capital is increasingly flowing into sectors once seen as too bureaucratic or operationally complex. Beyond those headline sectors, construction tech, industrial automation, logistics software, healthcare, and public-sector tooling are attracting record levels of early-stage and growth capital.

The key question is: what is driving this shift in investor thinking?

The shift in investor priorities is partly driven by macro and geopolitical pressures. Supply-chain disruption, energyinsecurity and infrastructure fragility have elevated industrial resilience to a national priority. Governments are investing heavily in grid modernisation, logistics networks, and critical infrastructure, while public institutions face mounting pressure to digitise procurement, compliance, and workflow systems.

What were once considered slow, bureaucratic markets are now seen as structurally supported by policy and long-term demand.

AI is the driving force and is reshaping traditionally hard industries. By lowering the cost of building sophisticated software and enabling immediate performance gains with shorter adoption cycles, AI allows startups to compete with incumbents in sectors such as construction, mining, manufacturing, logistics, and public services from day one.

As software becomes easier to replicate, defensibility is shifting toward operational depth, substantial UI/UX improvements, speed to market, and more seamless integration into complex real-world systems.

Finally, saturation in horizontal SaaS has pushed investors to look elsewhere for differentiated returns. Crowded softwarecategories offer diminishing breakout potential and are often threatened by OpenAI and Anthropic’s fast pace of innovation, whereas regulated and infrastructure-heavy sectors provide less competition, stronger pricing power, higher switching costs, and gigantic TAMs.

SAP with a $200B cap is just an example, but the same goes for Caterpillar, Siemens, Big Utilities, Big Pharma, and many others.

Regulation, once viewed as a deterrent, is increasingly understood as a moat. Startups that successfully navigate procurement frameworks, compliance regimes, and industry standards build advantages that are difficult for new entrants to replicate and cannot be vibe-coded.

Legacy players, while trying to adopt new AI tooling as quickly as they can, still struggle to adapt their workflows and scale innovation as quickly as younger companies can. Their dominance has relied on the high cost of switching away from their solutions, but as attention and investment shift toward hard sectors, incumbents can no longer rely solely on their brand reputation.

Even industry leaders like Salesforce are relying more on acquisitions to keep up, showing how new technology and easier alternatives are lowering switching costs and making it harder for established companies to hold onto customers.

Startups are also increasingly being built by innovative industry specialists, who aren’t confined by the same limitations as legacy players. Many startup founders in defence, energy, healthcare, and government procurement come directly from these industries or have unique insights into their inner weaknesses.

The next wave of disruption will hit legacy companies hard, as startups prove they can innovate with the speed, flexibilityand focus that incumbents often lack. In sectors long protected by regulation or procurement friction, younger companiesare demonstrating that modern software, AI, and new business models can unlock performance improvements that established players struggle to match. Investor playbooks are already evolving, and that shift will likely accelerate in the year ahead.

At the same time, the total addressable market ceiling has been lifted. By moving beyond narrow software categories and into the physical economy, startups are targeting markets measured not in billions, but in trillions. As a result, we should expect more $100 billion companies to be built in this cycle. It’s no longer just about building better software.

It’s about rebuilding foundational sectors of the global economy.

            <h2>The European Parliament pulls back AI from its own devices</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/the-european-parliament-pulls-back-ai-from-its-own-devices">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Parliament has taken a rare and telling step: it has disabled built-in artificial intelligence features on work devices used by lawmakers and staff, citing unresolved concerns about data security, privacy, and the opaque nature of cloud-based AI processing.

The decision, communicated to Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in an internal memo this week, reflects a deepening unease at the heart of European institutions about how AI systems handle sensitive data.

The Parliament’s IT department concluded that it could not guarantee the safety of certain AI-driven functions, notably writing assistants, text summarization tools, virtual assistants, and web page summary features, because they rely on cloud-based processing that sends data off the device.

In a workplace where draft legislation, confidential correspondence, and internal deliberations circulate daily, even momentary exposure of sensitive information is viewed as unacceptable.

For now, the measures apply only to these native, built-in AI features on Parliament-issued tablets and smartphones, not to everyday apps like email or calendars. The institution has declined to specify which operating systems or device manufacturers are affected, citing the “sensitive nature” of cybersecurity matters.

The internal memo did more than announce a software rollback. It advised lawmakers to review AI settings on their personal phones and tablets, warning them against exposing work emails, documents, or internal information to AI tools that “scan or analyze content,” and urging caution with third-party AI applications that seek broad access to data.

This guidance implicitly acknowledges a larger truth: for many elected officials and staff, the boundary between official and personal devices is porous. The Parliament’s approach underscores that risks are not confined to issued hardware but extend into the consumer technology choices of its own members.

The move is the latest in a series of precautionary steps by EU institutions. In 2023 the Parliament banned the use of TikTok on staff devices over similar data concerns, and ongoing debates have questioned the use of foreign-developed productivity software. Some lawmakers have even suggested moving away from Microsoft products in favor of European alternatives, part of a broader push for digital sovereignty.

That push is not abstract. The EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act, the world’s first comprehensive regulatory framework on AI, has been in force since 2024 and imposes obligations on AI providers and users alike, categorizing systems by risk and demanding transparency, traceability, and human oversight.

Yet the Parliament’s latest action reveals a paradox: while Europe seeks to regulate and shape AI at scale, it is simultaneously wary of the very tools it aims to master. Stopping short of a full ban on AI use, the institution is essentially saying that in certain contexts, the technology is too unpredictable to trust, especially when critical information could leak outside secure boundaries.

The Parliament’s decision may seem narrowly targeted, but it carries broader implications. It signals that even for progressive regulators who have championed innovation alongside rights protections, the practical limits of AI integration are now a central concern. Cybersecurity teams within government institutions are not merely technologists; they are custodians of trust in an era when data is both an asset and a vulnerability.

For businesses and citizens watching Europe’s regulatory trajectory, this episode is instructive. It suggests that the EU’s approach to AI will not only be legal and ethical but deeply pragmatic. Regulations may promote responsible innovation, but European institutions are prepared to pull back when security and control are at stake.

As AI capabilities continue to evolve and become embedded in devices worldwide, the Parliament’s cautionary step highlights a core tension of the digital age: balancing the potential of AI with its unseen and unquantified risks.

Whether other governments follow suit, or whether this stance influences corporate and product strategy, remains to be seen. In the meantime, the message from Brussels is unmistakable: when it comes to AI and sensitive data, trust but verify is no longer enough.

            <h2>AI FOMO: Where the “I” is not just intelligence, but I, the human</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/ai-fomo-where-the-i-is-not-just-intelligence-but-i-the-human">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When FOMO ( fear of missing out) first entered popular language, it was about teenagers scrolling through friends’ social feeds and worrying they weren’t having as much fun. But today, that word has taken on a different meaning in the era of artificial intelligence.

The fear now isn’t about beach photos or party snapshots. It’s about being left behind in a technological revolution that promises dramatic changes in work, creativity, and competition. It’s about the feeling that your own intelligence is not enough anymore, and you can’t compete with the artificial one.

You might call it AI FOMO, the worry, for individuals and companies alike, that others are moving ahead with AI while you stand still. And this feeling is real enough that researchers are trying to understand it scientifically.

They’ve developed tools to measure how much people fear falling behind in AI skills or access. A recent study showing how this fear plays out found that more than one in nine adults report elevated levels of anxiety about not keeping up with AI, especially younger people and women. Importantly, those with better AI literacy reported less fear, suggesting that understanding the technology reduces anxiety.

This isn’t abstract psychological jargon. It is a psychological undercurrent that feels entirely modern: tied to the ubiquity of AI in press, policy, and venture capital. The sense that everyone must adopt intelligent technology or risk irrelevance. But like most anxieties, its influence extends far beyond individual nervousness.

I think we reached the point where AI FOMO is shaping business decisions, corporate strategy, and even public policy.

The ripples from AI FOMO extend far beyond individual stress. They reach into boardrooms and strategic plans where companies, whether big or small, are deciding how hard to pursue AI.

A survey by intelligent automation company ABBYY found that around 60-70 % of technology leaders report fear of missing out as a major reason their organisation is investing in AI. Many worry that if they don’t adopt AI now, competitors will seize an advantage. And together with the leaders’ fear, some decisions are coming that may affect the employees.

I will give credit. That fear can feel logical. After all, AI promises efficiency, insight, and new capabilities, even for thought less capable.

But when fear becomes the main reason for action, it warps strategy. Rather than asking “What problem are we solving with AI?”, decision-makers ask “Can we afford not to use AI?” This change from thoughtful problem-solving to panic-driven adoption creates an illusion of purpose where there may be none.

And the results can be underwhelming. Recent business surveys show that many companies are still struggling to see real returns from their AI investments. Some executives report that less than half of their AI projects deliver measurable impact, or struggle to even quantify it. That’s a sign that widespread adoption does not automatically translate into value, especially when the impetus to buy in comes from anxiety rather than strategy.

AI FOMO isn’t just a corporate phenomenon. It affects workers too. Research focused on attitudes in the workplace shows that employees who believe AI will reduce their autonomy or make their skills obsolete tend to experience fear of missing out on AI adoption alongside heightened job anxiety. This connects with broader concerns about technology and wellbeing at work: many people worry that AI might replace tasks or change job expectations without clarity.

That fear can influence behaviour, too. Anecdotal reports, such as research showing a significant share of workers using AI tools secretly to keep up with perceived expectations, reflect this sense of needing to keep pace, even in silence. It’s not just about skills; it’s about identity, worth, and belonging in a professional world that is moving so fast.

The result is a kind of feedback loop. Investment without strategy, momentum without direction. In the pursuit of not falling behind, many risk falling into the very inefficiency they hoped to avoid.

To navigate this moment with equanimity requires resisting the gravitational pull of fear. This is not a rejection of AI’s transformative potential. A large majority of business leaders still view AI as an opportunity, even as concerns about risk and readiness grow.

But recognising AI FOMO as a real force, not just a catchphrase, allows companies, governments, and individuals to ask better questions:

The answer, ultimately, is not to replace fear with oblivious optimism, but to replace reflexive action with intentional adoption.

In the end, AI FOMO tells us something deeper about ourselves than any quarterly earnings report or headline about the next breakthrough. It reveals how closely we have tied our hopes, and our anxieties, to a technology that is, for many of us, still only partly understood.

We see AI everywhere: pitched as productivity’s savior one moment, feared as a job-eating force the next. Across workplaces and dinner-table conversations alike, even on dating apps, the underlying emotion often isn’t excitement or dread alone, but something that feels curiously familiar and deeply human: the fear of falling behind, of being outpaced by peers, competitors, or even young strangers we’ve never met.

This feeling is more than a distraction or a fancy word. It is linked to genuine stress, anxiety, and reduced well-being for some, and it shapes behaviour in subtle but far-reaching ways. People tweak their resumes, accept rushed technology rollouts, or hunch over training modules long into the night; not because they are certain of the value, but because they fear the alternative.

This moment, then, feels like more than a fad. It is a crossroads between reaction and reflection. We can choose to let fear drive our choices, or we can treat that fear as a signal to slow down, learn, and make room for real understanding.

If I’ve learned anything in the years since AI leapt into the popular imagination, it’s this: technology changes fastest when we pair curiosity with clarity, and adapts most successfully when we meet it with empathy rather than anxiety.

So as the next wave of models arrives, as companies wordsmith their AI strategies, and as employees juggle training modules alongside tools and dashboards, here’s one gentle reminder worth holding onto: technology doesn’t define us. Our reactions to it do. We are the ones who imagine, experiment, hesitate, question, and decide.

            <div id="article-text">If you checked X today expecting the usual stream of hot takes, memes, and AI spats, you probably saw… nothing. A widespread outage hit the platform today, leaving feeds blank, timelines unresponsive, and users staring at the digital equivalent of an empty room.

Outage trackers such as Downdetector logged a dramatic surge in problem reports around midday GMT, with tens of thousands of users across regions, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, and India, reporting problems accessing the service. Some described impossible login loops and error messages telling them only that “something went wrong.”

Here’s where it gets curious: nobody from X has confirmed why the platform hiccupped. Despite the scale of the disruption, and a global user base reliant on the service for everything from breaking news to weather alerts, there’s been no official timeline for a fix or even an acknowledgement of a broader issue. For a service that prides itself on instant updates, the silence is notable.

This isn’t the first time X has ground to a halt. The platform has a history of outages since its rebranding from Twitter, with users historically greeted by messages like “Something went wrong” when backend systems hiccup.

Today’s disruption even impacted associated tech. Reports suggest that Grok, the AI chatbot tied into X’s ecosystem, also faced interruptions as timelines failed to load, underscoring how much of the platform’s experience still depends on backend stability.

For now, the outage remains a developing story, and users left refreshing their browsers might be asking the most modern question of all: was it a bug, a server gremlin, or just another Monday on X?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I need to say something that might make CS leaders uncomfortable: most of what your team does before a renewal is valuable, but it’s listening to only one channel. Your EBRs, your health scores, your stakeholder maps. They capture what your customer is willing to tell you directly. What they don’t capture is the conversation happening everywhere else. And that’s usually where churn starts.

I know because I ran the standard playbook for years. EBRs, stakeholder mapping, health score reviews, and renewal prep meetings, where we rated our gut feeling on a scale of green to red. We had dashboards. We had strong CSMs who genuinely cared about their accounts. And we still got blindsided.

The $2M quarter is the one I can’t forget. Two enterprise accounts churned in the same 90-day window. Both were green in every system we had. One had an NPS of 72.

When I dug into what happened, I didn’t find a CS execution problem. I found a coverage gap. Every signal had been there. Just not in the places our process was designed to look. I sat in the post-mortem knowing we’d done everything our process asked us to do. That was the problem.

Later in this article, I’ll show you what both of those accounts would have looked like inside Renewal Fix. Before anyone on my team knew there was a problem.

I’m not saying EBRs are useless. A well-run EBR builds relationship depth, gives your champion ammunition internally, and surfaces problems the customer is willing to raise directly. But even the best EBR has a structural limitation: it only captures what someone chooses to say out loud, in a meeting, to a vendor.

The real conversation about your product is happening in a Slack channel you’ll never see, in a procurement review you weren’t invited to, and in a 1:1 between your champion and their new boss who just joined from a company that used your competitor. The EBR gives you one essential channel. The danger is treating it as the only one.

Here’s what was actually happening in those two accounts that churned on me.

Account one: their engineering team had filed 23 support tickets about API latency over four months. Not “the product is broken” tickets. Small, specific, technical complaints that got resolved individually. Nobody in CS ever saw them because they never escalated to “critical.” But lined up chronologically, the pattern was unmistakable: this team was losing patience, one resolved ticket at a time.

Account two: three of their five power users updated their LinkedIn profiles in the same two-week window. One started posting about a competitor’s product. Our champion’s title changed from “Head of” to “Senior Manager.” A quiet demotion nobody noticed because we were watching product usage dashboards, not org charts.

Every CS leader I know has lost an account and later found out the champion left months ago. The customer’s reaction is always the same: “We assumed you knew.” They expect you to track publicly available professional changes, the same information any recruiter monitors. Not tracking them isn’t respectful. It’s a blind spot.

Neither signal lived in our CRM. Neither showed up in our health score. They were sitting in plain sight in systems our CS team had no reason to check.

Health scores aren’t the problem. Treating them as the whole picture is. A typical health score aggregates NPS, login frequency, support ticket count, and feature adoption. Green means safe. Red means act. But these are lagging indicators. By the time login frequency drops, the decision to evaluate alternatives may already be in motion.

When I started tracking leading indicators alongside our existing health model, the difference was striking. Across roughly 300 mid-market accounts over 18 months, we found that support ticket velocity, specifically the rate of increase in non-critical tickets over a rolling 90-day window, predicted churn at T-90 at roughly 2x the accuracy of our composite health score. The signals that actually predict churn aren’t the ones most CS platforms are designed to track.

The teams with the strongest renewal rates don’t abandon their existing processes. They add a signal layer on top. The highest-signal sources break into three tiers.

Tier 1: Support ticket patterns. Not the count, but the velocity, the sentiment trend, and whether the same team keeps filing. A steady trickle of “resolved” tickets from one engineering team is often a louder signal than a single P1 escalation. At scale, this becomes cohort-level complaint clustering across a segment.

Tier 2: People changes. Champion turnover, re-orgs, title changes, and new executives from a competitor’s customer base. The person who bought your product and the person renewing it are often not the same person. At scale, you’re watching for patterns of org instability across your book.

Tier 3: Competitive exposure. Whether your customer is being actively pitched, attending competitor events, or has team members engaging with competitor content online. At scale, you’re tracking which segments your competitors are targeting hardest.

The real challenge isn’t knowing what to track. It’s that these signals live in five or six different systems, and nobody’s job is to stitch them together. Your CSM sees Zendesk. Your SE sees Jira. Your AE sees Salesforce. The full picture only exists if someone manually assembles it.

One team I worked with built a manual version of this: CSMs logging signals from six different sources every Friday. About 90 minutes per account per week. Their renewal rate hit 96%. But the approach doesn’t scale past a 25-account book.

At 80 accounts in a mid-market motion, you need automation. At 150+ in a PLG model, the signals are still there, you’re watching for cohort-level drops in feature adoption or clusters of the same complaint across a segment, but you cannot find them without automation.

The teams doing this manually are logging into six tools every Friday. The teams doing this with automation get a Slack message when something changes. No dashboard to check. No Friday ritual.

Detection without a playbook is just anxiety. The point of catching signals early isn’t to panic. It’s to have time to act. An executive sponsor who hasn’t logged in for 90 days needs a different intervention than an account with a competitor POC in their Salesforce sandbox. The signal tells you what’s happening. The response has to match.

That gap between knowing what to track and actually tracking it consistently is why I built Renewal Fix. Not to replace the manual process, but to remove the ceiling on it. The platform pulls signals from support tickets, call recordings, CRM data, and engineering channels automatically, stitches them into a single account view, and flags them before they become a renewal surprise.

Enter your work email at renewalfix.com. In 30 seconds, you’ll get a one-page executive brief showing your blind spots: 10 accounts that look like they belong in your CS platform, built from your company’s products, competitive landscape, and integration stack, each with a health score and risk signals sourced from support tickets, call recordings, and org changes that your current dashboard would never surface. No demo, no sales call.

Find the account that looks most like Account One. Health score in the 70s, risk signals hiding underneath. Then click “Executive Brief” for a one-page summary of your portfolio’s total risk exposure, with dollar amounts and prioritized actions. That view is what Renewal Fix delivers weekly in production.

Your green accounts aren’t necessarily at risk. But they might be quieter than you realize.

            <h2>Peter Steinberger joins OpenAI</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, Peter Steinberger was experimenting with a side project that quickly caught fire across the developer world. His open-source AI assistant, OpenClaw, wasn’t just another chatbot; it could act on your behalf, from managing emails to integrating with calendars and messaging platforms.

Today, that project has a new chapter: Steinberger is joining OpenAI to help build the next generation of personal AI agents.

This move isn’t just about talent acquisition. It marks a switch in how the AI industry thinks about assistants: from reactive systems you talk to, toward agents that take initiative and perform tasks autonomously, with potential implications for productivity, workflows, and personal automation.

OpenClaw first emerged in late 2025 under names like Clawdbot and Moltbot. What distinguished it was not fancy visuals or marketing, but its practical ambition: give users an AI that connects to their tools and executes workflows, booking flights, sorting messages, scheduling meetings, in ways that feel closer to agency than assistant.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It quickly went viral on GitHub, drawing more than 100,000 stars and millions of visits to its project page within weeks.

Rather than turning OpenClaw into a standalone company, Steinberger chose to partner with OpenAI, a decision he explained in a blog post as driven by a simple goal: bring intelligent agents to a broader audience as quickly as possible.

According to him, OpenAI’s infrastructure, research resources, and product ecosystem offered the best path to scale such an ambitious idea.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman welcomed Steinberger’s move as strategic, underscoring that the company expects personal agents, systems capable of initiating, coordinating, and completing tasks across apps, to be an important part of future AI products.

Altman’s public post noted that OpenClaw will continue to exist as an open-source project under a new foundation supported by OpenAI, preserving its accessibility and community roots.

The notion of AI that does things has been bubbling under the surface of tech discourse, but OpenClaw’s popularity crystallised it. Users interact with their agents through familiar interfaces like messaging platforms, but behind the scenes, these agents orchestrate API calls, automate scripts, handle notifications, and adapt to changing schedules, all without explicit commands after initial setup.

This trajectory, from an experimental open-source project to a central piece of a major AI lab’s strategy, speaks to broader trends in the industry. Competitors from Anthropic to Google DeepMind have also indicated interest in multi-agent systems and autonomous workflows, but OpenAI’s move signals how seriously the category is now being taken.

It suggests a future where AI isn’t just conversational, but proactive and tightly integrated into everyday tooling.

At the same time, this evolution raises fresh questions about governance and safety. OpenClaw’s open-source nature meant that developers could experiment freely, but that freedom also exposed potential attack surfaces; misconfigured agents with access to sensitive accounts or automation processes could be exploited if not properly safeguarded.

That is one reason why maintaining an open foundation with careful oversight matters as these tools scale.

For OpenAI, Steinberger’s arrival embeds this agent-first thinking into its product roadmap at a critical moment. The company is already exploring “multi-agent” architectures, where specialised AIs coordinate with each other and with users to handle complex tasks more effectively than monolithic models alone. Steinberger brings an experimental sensibility and real-world experience that could accelerate those efforts.

This could mean future versions of ChatGPT or other OpenAI products will be able to carry out tasks you define, rather than waiting for you to prompt them. That shift, from conversational replies to autonomous action, is the next frontier in how AI will fit into daily digital life.

And with OpenClaw’s creator now inside one of the most influential AI labs in the world, that future feels closer than ever.
