            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/how-europes-new-carbon-tax-on-imported-goods-will-change-global-trade/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For people living in the European Union, the price of their next car, home renovation, and even local produce may soon reflect a climate policy that many have never even heard of. This new regulation, which comes fully into force on New Year’s Day, does not just target heavy industry—it affects everyday goods which now face an added carbon cost when they enter Europe.

The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) puts a carbon price on many imported goods—meaning that EU-based importers will pay for the greenhouse gases emitted during the production of certain carbon-intensive materials.

If goods come from countries with weaker climate rules, then the charge will be higher. To sell to the EU, producers will effectively need to show their goods aren’t too carbon-intensive.

The goal is to prevent companies from relocating their production to places with looser regulations, ensuring fair competition between EU and non-EU companies, while incentivising global decarbonisation.

After a trial phase, full payment obligations begin on January 1 2026, when importers will need to buy CBAM certificates to cover the embedded emissions in goods such as iron and steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers, hydrogen and (eventually) electricity.

Although it is an EU climate policy, CBAM looks set to be a game-changer for global trade. Countries that rely on EU exports may need to make costly investments in cleaner technologies and better emissions tracking, or risk losing market share. The UK government plans to introduce its own version of CBAM in 2027—although how this links to the EU’s is yet to be decided.

A positive shift is already underway: more and more companies are now measuring and reporting their emissions accurately, responding to the growing demand for reliable carbon data. At the same time, an increasing number of countries are introducing their own carbon pricing systems to stay aligned with the EU and protect the competitiveness of their exports.

Morocco is a prominent example: its 2025 finance law gradually introduces a carbon tax from January 2026. As Moroccan firms will already pay a carbon price domestically, their exports are likely to avoid additional CBAM charges at the EU border, helping them remain competitive.

In many countries, CBAM is also accelerating interest in renewable energy and greener industrial processes. Some see it not as a threat, but an opportunity to attract investment and position themselves as low-carbon manufacturing hubs.

However, this mechanism is still controversial. For businesses, CBAM is complex and administratively heavy. Firms need robust systems to measure embedded emissions, collect data from suppliers, and produce environmental product declarations. Many will also need new renewable energy contracts to cut their carbon footprint.

Around the world, CBAM has faced strong criticism. India and China describe it as “green protectionism,” arguing that it puts unfair pressure on developing economies. At the same time, the EU has not yet created dedicated funding to help exporters in lower-income countries adapt. Without this support, the mechanism may not achieve the desired results.

Although CBAM is mainly aimed at industry, its ripple effects will reach consumers in the EU. Importers are unlikely to absorb the full additional cost, meaning prices are likely to rise—particularly for goods that rely heavily on steel, aluminium, or cement. This could mean Europe sees higher costs for cars, home appliances, electronics, building materials, and, indirectly, food production (through fertilizers).

At the same time, CBAM may bring more transparency. Because importers must report the emissions embedded in their goods, consumers may eventually have clearer information about the climate impact of what they buy.

The mechanism will also generate EU revenues from certificate sales. These are expected to support vulnerable households in many European countries, as well as funding clean technologies and improving energy efficiency. How the funds are used will be crucial to public acceptance of Europe’s new carbon tax.

Even before full implementation, CBAM is already reshaping supply chains and influencing government policies far beyond Europe’s borders. It may trigger trade disputes, push exporters to adopt carbon pricing, and highlight the need for more climate finance to support developing countries undergoing green industrial transitions.

For many European consumers, it’s likely to mean gradual price increases—and potentially, more climate-conscious purchasing decisions. Behind the scenes, it marks a significant shift in how global trade accounts for carbon—and how climate policy reaches into people’s everyday lives.

            <h2>Google lobs lawsuit at search result scraping firm SerpApi</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/12/google-lobs-lawsuit-at-search-result-scraping-firm-serpapi/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has filed a lawsuit to protect its search results, targeting a firm called SerpApi that has turned Google’s 10 blue links into a business. According to Google, SerpApi ignores established law and Google’s terms to scrape and resell its search engine results pages (SERPs). This is not the first action against SerpApi, but Google’s decision to go after a scraper could signal a new, more aggressive stance on protecting its search data.

SerpApi and similar firms do fulfill a need, but they sit in a legal gray area. Google does not provide an API for its search results, which are based on the world’s largest and most comprehensive web index. That makes Google’s SERPs especially valuable in the age of AI. A chatbot can’t summarize web links if it can’t find them, which has led companies like Perplexity to pay for SerpApi’s second-hand Google data. That prompted Reddit to file a lawsuit against SerpApi and Perplexity for grabbing its data from Google results.

Google is echoing many of the things Reddit said when it publicized its lawsuit earlier this year. The search giant claims it’s not just doing this to protect itself—it’s also about protecting the websites it indexes. In Google’s blog post on the legal action, it says SerpApi “violates the choices of websites and rightsholders about who should have access to their content.”

It’s worth noting that Google has a partnership with Reddit that pipes data directly into Gemini. As a result, you’ll often see Reddit pages cited in the chatbot’s outputs. As Google points out, it abides by “industry-standard crawling protocols” to collect the data that appears on its SERPs, but those sites didn’t agree to let SerpApi scrape their data from Google. So while you could reasonably argue that Google’s lawsuit helps protect the rights of web publishers, it also explicitly protects Google’s business interests.

The kind of data scraping that SerpApi uses is not new—Google has simply put up with it until now. However, the company claims that SerpApi’s deceptive behavior, like spoofing user agents and hammering sites with armies of bots, has increased significantly over the past year. That may have something to do with the ever-growing hunger for search data in the AI era.

Google is coming out of its antitrust cases relatively unscathed so far, which affects the availability of its data. It has avoided the harshest remedies, like the government’s demand that Google offer search data to competitors. That might have turned businesses like SerpApi legit, but with that no longer an option, Google may feel emboldened to unleash the lawyers.

While Google paints this as a benevolent action, it stands to benefit by stopping SERP scrapers. However, this may make some of Google’s competitors happy, too. Since the search giant doesn’t offer an official API for search (and the courts declined to force the issue), SERP scraping provides a way for companies to get Google’s search data on the down-low. This reduces demand for the handful of other web indexes that do have APIs, including Brave and Bing. Without illicit search APIs, chatbots may have to lean on official data sources.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The trade-off between quality and quantity is a fundamental economic dilemma. Now, a team of British, American, and Japanese researchers describes how it applies to biology, as well. They have discovered that this dilemma most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of ants, one of Earth’s most successful groups of organisms.

Their study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper.

In the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.

“There’s this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex?” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at the University of Maryland and co-author of the study. “For example, the individuals may themselves become simpler because tasks that a solitary organism would need to complete can be handled by a collective.”

Economo’s team hypothesized that the metabolic balance behind investing in cuticles in social insects like ants could favor the collective over the individual. The idea was that a colony of 10,000 workers could lose a few individuals to a predator without much consequence, so investing heavily in each worker’s defenses would seem like a waste of precious nutrients. To test this hypothesis, they examined whether ant lineages that maintain massive, specialized workforces reduce the investment in their individual workers’ exoskeletons.

To test this idea, the researchers needed to pull off a comparative study on the anatomy of ants at an unprecedented scale. “We worked with scans of ant specimens and species from all over the world to capture the global diversity of ants,” Economo says. The team used a massive database called Antscan, which contains three-dimensional X-ray microtomography imaging of ants from around the globe.

Microtomography works similarly to medical CT scans, but at a vastly higher resolution. Still, on its own, the technique could only generate lots of precise data—it still had to be interpreted. Parsing through 3D imagery of over 880 specimens, including workers, queens, and males belonging to over 500 different species, was another challenge. “The 3D scanning itself is a very advanced technology,” says Arthur Matte, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. “But once you have the ants in three dimensions, it’s still very hard to segment manually every tissue you’re interested in.”

To solve this, Matte developed a computer vision algorithm for “unsupervised segmentation.” Because the cuticle is always the outermost tissue of an arthropod, the algorithm could automatically identify and measure the volume of the exoskeleton across all ants in the dataset.

The first thing scientists noticed when the results poured in was that cuticle investment varied wildly, ranging from 6 percent to 35 percent of an ant’s total body volume. So, the next thing they focused on was figuring out the reasons behind these variations.

The team started checking how factors like diet, temperature, humidity, and foraging style correlated with the size of the cuticle. To get a handle on this, segmented 3D scans were fed into evolutionary models. “One of the most insightful things we did was to individually remove such variables from the models to estimate their contributions to the final cuticle investment,” Matte explains. This way, scientists learned that temperature was responsible for just 12 percent of variation in cuticle size and diet—especially its nitrogen content—explained another 37 percent. But the factor that had the strongest impact on the model was the colony size.

Ants that invested less in their cuticle tended to have significantly larger colony sizes. More surprisingly, this reduction in cuticle investment and the resulting increase in colony size appeared to be associated with higher diversification rates. In biological terms, squishier ants could evolve to occupy new niches much faster than their heavily armored cousins. “Requiring less nitrogen could make these ants more versatile and able to conquer new environments,” Matte suggests. This efficiency may have allowed ants to transition from a diet of high-protein prey to more abundant but less nutritious liquid sugar sources, like honeydew or floral nectar.

“Ants reduce per-worker investment in one of the most nutritionally expensive tissues for the good of the collective,” Matte explains. “They’re shifting from self-investment toward a distributed workforce.”

The researchers think the pattern they observed in ants reflects a more universal trend in the evolution of societal complexity. The transition from solitary life to complex societies echoes the transition from single-celled organisms to multicellular ones.

In a single-celled organism, a cell must be a “jack-of-all-trades,” performing every function necessary for survival. In a multicellular animal, however, individual cells often become simpler and more specialized, relying on the collective for protection and resources.

“It’s a pattern that echoes the evolution of multicellularity, where cooperative units can be individually simpler than a solitary cell, yet collectively capable of far greater complexity,” says Matte. Still, the question of whether underinvesting in individuals to boost the collective makes sense for creatures other than ants remains open, and it most likely isn’t as much about nutritional economics as it is about sex.

The study focused on ants that already have a reproductive division of labor, one where workers do not reproduce. This social structure is likely the key prerequisite for the cheap worker strategy. For the team, this is the reason we haven’t, at least so far, found similar evolutionary patterns in more complex social organisms like wolves, which live in packs—or humans with their amazingly complex societies. Wolves and people are both social, but maintain a high degree of individual self-interest regarding reproduction. Ant workers could be made expendable because they don’t pass their own genes—they are essentially extensions of the queen’s reproductive strategy.

Before looking for signs of ant-like approaches to quality versus quantity dilemmas in other species, the team wants to take an even closer look at ants. Economo, Matte, and their colleagues seek to expand their analysis to other ant tissues, such as the nervous system and muscles, to see if the cheapening of individuals extends beyond the exoskeleton. They are also looking at ant genomes to see what genetic innovations allowed for the shift from quality to quantity.  “We still need a lot of work to understand ants’ evolution,” Matte says.

            <h2>Doctors Catch Cancer-Diagnosing AI Extracting Patients’ Race Data and Being Racist With It</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-20</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Just when you thought you heard it all, AI systems designed to spot cancer have startled researchers with a baked-in penchant for racism.

The alarming findings were published in the journal Cell Reports Medicine, showing that four leading AI-enhanced pathology diagnostic systems differ in accuracy depending on patients‘ age, gender, and race — demographic data, disturbingly, that the AI is extracting directly from pathology slides, a feat that’s impossible for human doctors.

To conduct the study, researchers at Harvard University combed through nearly 29,000 cancer pathology images from some 14,400 cancer patients. Their analysis found that the deep learning models exhibited alarming biases 29.3 percent of the time — on nearly a third of all the diagnostic tasks they were assigned, in other words.

“We found that because AI is so powerful, it can differentiate many obscure biological signals that cannot be detected by standard human evaluation,” Harvard researcher Kun-Hsing Yu, a senior author of the study, said in a press release. “Reading demographics from a pathology slide is thought of as a ‘mission impossible’ for a human pathologist, so the bias in pathology AI was a surprise to us.”

Yu said that these bias-based errors are the result of AI models relying on patterns linked to various demographics when analyzing cancer tissue. In other words, once the four AI tools locked onto a person’s age, race, or gender, those factors would form the backbone of the tissue analysis. In effect, AI would go on to replicate bias resulting from gaps in AI training data.

The AI tools were able to identify samples taken specifically from Black people, to give a concrete example. These cancer slides, the authors wrote, contained higher counts of abnormal, neoplastic cells, and lower counts of supportive elements than those from white patients, allowing AI to snuff them out, even though the samples were anonymous.

Then came the trouble. Once an AI pathology tool had identified a person’s race, they became overly-obsessed with finding previous analyses that fit that particular identifier. But when the model was trained mostly on data from white people, the tools would struggle with those who aren’t as represented. The AI models had trouble distinguishing subclasses of lung cancer cells in Black people, for example — not because there was a lack of lung cancer data for them to draw from, but because there was lacking data from Black lung cancer cells to draw from.

That was unexpected, Yu said in the press release, “because we would expect pathology evaluation to be objective. When evaluating images, we don’t necessarily need to know a patient’s demographics to make a diagnosis.”

Back in June, medical researchers discovered a similar racial bias in large language model (LLM) psychiatric diagnostic tools. In that case, results showed AI tools often proposed “inferior treatment” plans for Black patients whenever their race was explicitly known.

In the case of AI cancer-screening tools, the Harvard research team also developed a new AI-training approach called the FAIR-Path. When this training framework was introduced to the AI tools prior to analysis, they found that it thwarted 88.5 percent of the disparities in performance.

That there’s a solution out there is good news, though that remaining 11.5 percent is nothing to sneeze at either. And until training frameworks like this are made mandatory across all AI tools in the pathology field, questions of the system’s inherent biases will remain.

            <h2>Officials Deploying AI Surveillance Devices in School Bathrooms</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-surveillance-school-bathroom">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Public spaces aren’t the only place you need to be worried about being monitored. In 2025, officials are even placing AI surveillance gadgets in school bathrooms.

New reporting by Forbes revealed the troubling rise of AI surveillance at the Beverly Hills High School that may be a sign of things to come for school districts throughout North America.

From video drones capturing footage of the campus to behavioral analysis AI cameras monitoring the hallways, the Los Angeles school district is quickly starting to mirror the dystopian panopticon of “The Minority Report.” As Forbes tells it, no avenue is left un-monitored: Flock license plate readers survey the comings and goings of every visitor, and perhaps most strikingly, AI audio capture devices line the bathroom walls.

To school officials, this is all just part of doing business.

“This community wants… whatever we can do to make our schools safer,” district superintendent Alex Cherniss told Forbes. “If that means you have armed security and drones and AI and license plate readers, bring it on.”

“We are in the hub of an urban setting of Los Angeles, in one of the most recognizable cities on the planet. So we are always a target and that means our kids are a target and our staff are a target,” Cherniss said, adding that the surveillance panopticon spots “multiple threats per day.”

What exactly those threats are, district officials didn’t specify. However, they noted that they’ve spent $4.8 million on security in the fiscal year 2024-2025 alone — a costly solution to a nebulous problem.

Yet as Forbes notes, Beverly Hills isn’t exactly an outlier. From coast to coast, school districts are turning to AI products in an attempt to stem school violence, as America’s school shooting problem continues unabated. While that fear of school shootings is perfectly rational, the rise in unregulated AI surveillance tools comes with its own costs to student’s safety and privacy.

In Baltimore County Public Schools, for example, district officials contract a company called Omnilert to monitor some 7,000 school cameras for deviant activity. In one horrifying case, Omnilert’s system misidentified a student’s bag of Doritos, labeling it a handgun. It wasn’t until an armed police squad detained the 16-year old student at gunpoint that they realized the system’s error.

And in Florida, a middle school recently went into lockdown after a similar AI surveillance system mistook a student’s clarinet as a gun. Luckily, no one was hurt in either case, but the capacity for false positives is deeply concerning. Meanwhile, experts remain skeptical that these systems really do make schools safer.

“It’s very peculiar to make the claim that this will keep your kids safe,” Chad Marlow, a senior policy counsel at the ACLU, told Forbes.

Marlow was the lead author of a 2023 report finding that eight of the biggest ten school shootings since Columbine took place in heavily-surveilled school campuses. Meanwhile, focus group testing by the ACLU found that pervasive school surveillance makes kids much less comfortable telling teachers and administrators about issues like mental health struggles and domestic abuse.

“Because kids don’t trust people they view as spying on them, it ruptures trust and actually makes things less safe,” Marlow said.

Whether it’s worth the tradeoff remains to be seen — Marlow notes that more independent research is needed to tell if these AI systems really do lead to safer outcomes for students. In the meantime, it seems like a risk some school administrators are willing to take.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s the holidays. The soft spice of holly and evergreen cling to the air, and a carefully curated playlist hums at just the right volume. The only thing that could make the atmosphere more inviting is the warm glow of a fire — so you load up the first one you see on the App Store and cast it to the family TV.

Everything is going well, until you turn and notice a popup on your yule log imploring you to upgrade to premium.

That’s the situation facing users of “Winter Fireplace,” a digital yule log on the Apple App Store. Drowning in a sea of similar vibey kitsch, Winter Fireplace starts off a free download, but soon begins begging users to sign up for premium with irritating popups that blot out all the warmth of the fire.

“Experience Winter Fireplace at its best,” the popup — viewed by Futurism at a holiday party — merrily declares. “Upgrade for a clean, distraction-free picture, cozy soundscapes, and the full scene library.”

This kept popping up on the fireplace channel every 15 minutes without fail

Users are then invited to “Upgrade to Premium,” which can cost either $0.99 or $2.99, apparently, according to the app’s listing on the App Store. We chose “not right now,” in order to close the popup and get back to the high-octane holiday action. But 15 minutes later, the popup returned, offering the exact same deal.

A closer look at the store’s in-app purchases shows this isn’t your grandma’s yule log app. It’s jampacked with features like immersive soundscapes and iCloud integration, and boasts over 80 “premium” fire loops “showcasing fireplace, fireside, candle, campfire and bonfire scenes.” And though the base app is free, those extras are gonna cost you.

For example, users can purchase various themed packs for different holidays, like Christmas and Halloween for $5.99 apiece. There’s a “Mega Bundle” for $12.99, which includes numerous firescapes, but not all. For that, users need to shell out a whopping $19.99 to “unlock” the entire app, though we don’t know why anybody would.

(Thriftier holiday enjoyers can find many free — and ad-free — fireplace videos online.)

The developer of Winter Fireplace, Henry Glendening, has found himself in the news before, though not for anything related to his app. Back in 2015, Glendening became the subject of a feel-good lifestyle story, after St Louis Today reported on his betrothal to Kasey Bergh, whom the developer met thanks to a text to a wrong-number.

But the story didn’t really pick up pace until a while later, when Bergh — thirty years Glendening’s senior — needed a new kidney, according to local outlet KSDK. As it turns out, Glendening was a “perfect immunological match” for his wife.

Glendening’s story, then, is a modern parable. As the popup fades and the digital fire resumes its loop, we’re left with a perfect encapsulation of this moment in time, where human connection and the logic of monetization not only coexist, but emerge from the very same device.

We reached out to the developer for comment.

            <h2>Sequoia partner spreads debunked Brown shooting theory, testing new leadership</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/sequoia-partner-spreads-debunked-brown-shooting-theory-testing-new-leadership/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire is once again drawing unwanted attention to the prominent venture firm after falsely accusing a Palestinian student of being behind the December 13 Brown University mass shooting and the subsequent murder of an MIT professor.

In since-deleted posts on X, Maguire speculated that “it seems very likely” the student was the perpetrator, pointing to Brown “actively scrubbing his online presence.” In reality, authorities identified the shooter as Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, a 48-year-old Portuguese national who was later found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility. Brown officials said they removed the student’s digital footprint as a protective measure against dangerous speculation.

Fast Company republished two of Maguire’s deleted posts on Friday (he has previously left inflammatory content online and did not delete comments he made proposing that the MIT professor was targeted for being Jewish). The incident follows months of controversial posts targeting Muslims and pro-Palestine activists, including calling New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani an “Islamist” in July. That post led to a swift online backlash, with nearly 1,200 founders and tech industry professionals signing an open letter urging Sequoia to take action. An open letter was later published supporting Maguire.

The newest episode raises questions about whether Sequoia’s new leadership — managing partners Alfred Lin and Pat Grady, who took over last month — can or will rein in Maguire’s social media activity. Chief Operating Officer Sumaiya Balbale left the firm in August over Sequoia’s inaction on Maguire’s anti-Muslim comments, according to earlier reporting by the Financial Times. Former managing partner Roelof Botha, who stepped down in November, defended Maguire’s behavior during an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt in October, calling Sequoia a believer in its partners’ right to “free speech.”

“Internally, we celebrate diversity of opinions, and we need ‘spiky’ people inside Sequoia,” Botha said, referring to Maguire. He offered that Maguire had a “specific profile” that appeals to certain founders. Maguire has led investments in numerous defense tech and AI startups, and reportedly has deep connections with Elon Musk’s companies, managing Sequoia’s investments in Neuralink, SpaceX, The Boring Company, X, and xAI.

However, Botha acknowledged trade-offs to Maguire’s outspokenness. “Does it come with trade-offs? Yes, it does,” he said.

Lin and Grady have not publicly addressed Maguire’s conduct since taking over leadership.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations has called for Maguire’s firing, telling Fast Company that his accusations are “deeply irresponsible and incredibly dangerous.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/ex-splunk-execs-startup-resolve-ai-hits-1-billion-valuation-with-series-a/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Resolve AI, a startup developing an autonomous site reliability engineer (SRE), a tool that automatically maintains software systems, has raised a Series A led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to three people familiar with the deal.

The headline valuation for the fresh round is $1 billion, sources said. However, the company’s actual blended valuation was lower because of a multi-tranched structure. In this setup, investors purchased some equity at a $1 billion valuation but acquired the remainder — likely a larger percentage of the round — at a lower price. This novel investment approach has recently become popular for the most sought-after AI startups, investors say.

The startup’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approximately $4 million, two of the people said. The size of the funding round couldn’t be learned.

Resolve AI and Lightspeed didn’t respond to our request for comment.

Founded less than two years ago, the startup is led by former Splunk executive Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal, Splunk’s former chief architect for observability. The duo’s partnership dates back 20 years to their graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This isn’t their first collaboration; they previously co-founded Omnition, a startup that was acquired by Splunk in 2019.

While human SREs are traditionally responsible for manually troubleshooting and resolving system failures, Resolve AI automates this process by autonomously identifying, diagnosing, and resolving production issues in real time.

The automation addresses a growing challenge for companies. As software systems become more complex and distributed across cloud infrastructure, outfits often struggle to find and retain enough skilled SREs to keep systems running smoothly. Automating these tasks can reduce downtime, lower operational costs, and free up engineering teams to focus on building new features rather than trying to constantly stomp out production issues.

Last October, Resolve AI raised a $35 million seed round led by Greylock with participation from World Labs founder Fei-Fei Li and Google DeepMind scientist Jeff Dean.

Resolve AI competes with Traversal, an AI SRE startup that raised a $48 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from Sequoia.

            <div id="article-text">Rocket Lab has won an $816 million contract — its largest to date — with the U.S. Space Development Agency as the company continues to diversify beyond its “rocket company” label.

The company said Friday that its subsidiary, Rocket Lab USA, was awarded a prime contract by the Space Development Agency (SDA) to design and manufacture 18 satellites. The satellites will be equipped with advanced missile warning, tracking, and defense sensors for the agency’s Tracking Layer Tranche 3 program.

This contract is separate from an existing $515 million award to deliver satellites for the SDA’s Transport Layer-Beta Tranche 2 program. That program aims to provide a satellite communications network in low Earth orbit that sends encrypted, low-latency data to the military.

Together, Rocket Lab has SDA contracts valued at more than $1.3 billion.

Rocket Lab has expanded into defense and has more recently said it would bid for multibillion-dollar Department of Defense initiatives like Golden Dome.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Brendan Foody is 22 years old and runs a company worth billions. This August, I met the young CEO in a glass conference room overlooking the San Francisco Bay. While his peers are searching for their first jobs, Foody is pursuing a “master plan,” as he calls it, to upend the global labor market. His start-up, Mercor, offers an AI-powered hiring platform: Bots weed through résumés, and even conduct interviews. In the next five years, Foody told me, AI could automate 50 percent of the tasks that people do today. “That will be extremely exciting to see play out,” he said. Humanity will become much more productive, he thinks, allowing us to cure cancer and land on Mars.

Although Foody does not have much by way of conventional work experience, he is already a seasoned entrepreneur. By his account, in middle school, he ran a business reselling Safeway donuts to his classmates at a 400 percent markup. His success at donut arbitrage made his mom nervous he might try to sell sketchier vices (drugs), so she sent him to Catholic school. There, he met his Mercor co-founders. In high school, he started a consulting business for online sneaker resellers that he said raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars by the time he graduated. ChatGPT came out during his sophomore year at Georgetown, and he soon ditched school to build Mercor. When we met this summer, Mercor was worth $2 billion.

The AI boom has become synonymous with a few giant companies: OpenAI, Nvidia, and Anthropic. All are led by middle-aged men who’ve had long careers in Silicon Valley. But many of the most successful new AI start-ups have been founded by people barely old enough to drink. Unlike OpenAI or Anthropic, Mercor is already profitable. Meanwhile, Cursor, a massively popular AI-coding tool run by 25-year-old Michael Truell, was recently valued at nearly $30 billion—roughly the same as United Airlines.

In many ways, Foody, Truell, and others like them epitomize the long-standing Silicon Valley young-founder archetype: They are intensely nerdy and ravenously ambitious. (Foody’s bio on X reads “labor markets fascinate me,” and his pronouns are listed as “can/do.”) But this group is coming of age at a time when the tech industry’s aims—and sense of self-importance—have reached existential heights. They dream of creating superintelligent bots that can dramatically extend our lifespan and perhaps even automate scientific discovery itself.

If they are successful, they could end up with even more power than the tech titans who preceded them. If they fail, based on what I saw during a week in San Francisco, they seem determined to enjoy the party while it lasts.

The promise of remaking the world (and getting rich while doing so) has drawn a fresh wave of dropouts and new grads to San Francisco. Following ChatGPT’s release, Rayan Krishnan abandoned plans to pursue a Ph.D. and instead launched an AI start-up. “It seemed like there was opportunity everywhere,” he told me. One afternoon on my trip to San Francisco, I met Krishnan, the 24-year-old CEO of Vals AI, at his office, a refurbished brewery in the SoMa neighborhood. Vals, which helps evaluate AI models’ performance on real-world tasks, has raised $5 million. Venture capitalists “are now indexing much more on companies that are started by younger founders,” he said.

Many tech investors, I heard during my trip, believe that young people who have never spent time in an office are best-positioned to construct our AI future. Whereas 30-year-olds are already supposedly lost to the byzantine ways of workplace bureaucracies, those a decade their junior are blank slates. Foody recounted to me the story of dining with Adam D’Angelo when the Quora CEO (and OpenAI board member) was considering investing in Mercor. D’Angelo asked Foody about his work experience, and the young founder admitted that he didn’t have any. Good, D’Angelo said, before later cutting him a check. Mercor’s investors also include the Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.

In an attempt to track down these aspiring Zuckerbergs, Bay Area venture-capital firms host elaborate dinners for young tech workers and hire undergraduate scouts at elite colleges to keep tabs on promising talent. The same week I met Foody and Krishnan, I attended a mixer at an all-female hacker house—a shared residence and workspace—in the south of San Francisco. The women, all college-aged, had spent the summer hosting a series of VC-subsidized events. For one of the gatherings, a prominent firm had paid for a hibachi chef to cook dinner in their backyard. The night I visited the house, the women were hosting three investors for a talk. Among the panelists was Liz Wessel, a partner at the investment fund First Round Capital. Wessel said that two-thirds of her portfolio was composed of “young” founders, a label she applied to those 25 and under. By that calculus, even 26 counts as old.

Young people in the industry are coming up with new ways to profit. Later in the trip, I spoke with Vatsalya Verma, 23, and Jasper Vyda, 21, at a Victorian mansion in Lower Pacific Heights that they’d rented through Airbnb. The front entrance was littered with flattened cans. The night prior, Verma and Vyda had thrown a 200-person party to celebrate the launch of a “private network” called V11, which they described to me as an exclusive community of “the smartest friends across the entire nation.” Verma and Vyda believe that these friends are going to start Silicon Valley’s next unicorns. They partner with early-stage venture funds, who then “capitalize on our friendships to basically find deals,” Verma told me.

The Airbnb had been the site of the after-party, but the main event was held at a venue run by Silicon Valley Bank, where they had organized a poker room in a decommissioned bank vault. If Silicon Valley Bank sounds familiar, that’s because it collapsed dramatically in 2023, causing the largest single-day bank run in American history.

Watching Silicon Valley mint billionaires who were born around the time Facebook launched is a spectacle. But it’s been particularly absorbing for me because of my proximity to these young founders. Like Foody, I was a college sophomore when ChatGPT came out. I went to Stanford, where the chatbot set off a frenzy. My econ professor hosted students at his house for catered dinners with C-suite executives from Google and OpenAI. Waiters stood by and served champagne.

When I graduated last year and moved East, seemingly all my peers stayed in the Bay Area to work in AI. Over time, I’ve watched as some of them have been radicalized by the hype of artificial general intelligence, or AGI. (“I think I’ll live more than 1,000 years,” one recently told me.) Many have started their own companies. Early in my trip, I ran into a friend on the street waiting for a self-driving Waymo to take him to a vegan sushi restaurant. He had just raised millions for his AI start-up, and had hired a beloved Stanford adjunct professor to join his team, he told me.

People I know from my hometown near Seattle have also moved to San Francisco to join the AI scene. One helped start the all-female hacker house. Another launched Friend, which sells a $129 AI-powered necklace. Friend went viral earlier this year for plastering the New York City subway with more than 10,000 posters promoting the virtues of human-AI friendship. (I’ll never leave dirty dishes in the sink, one ad read.) Avi Schiffmann, the company’s 23-year-old CEO, has been cast as a misanthropic tech founder emblematic of Silicon Valley’s ills. I know Schiffmann as the nerdy kid from high school who ran one of the world’s most popular COVID-19 tracking websites. We used to hang out in our local public library brainstorming start-up ideas (for example, OnlyFans for stock-market watch lists). Over time, we grew apart. I finished my degree. He dropped out of Harvard and rode his motorcycle along the California coast.

In August, Schiffmann hosted me for a few nights at his home in the Lower Haight neighborhood. For someone building an AI-companionship start-up, Schiffmann lives a strikingly offline life. Much to my inconvenience, he didn’t have Wi-Fi. Instead, he spent a lot of time painting. “This is post-AGI living,” he told me. “It’s a religion I call life-maxxing.” One day, Schiffmann and I walked to a nearby park and marveled at the glorious San Francisco afternoon. “God sculpted the Bay,” he pronounced. Now the Bay is sculpting God. Or at least, a bunch of other 20-somethings in San Francisco think they are.

On my final evening, I ended up at a sci-fi-Barbie-themed party at San Francisco’s Tesla showroom. The party was sponsored by a smattering of investment firms and start-ups with names such as CodeRabbit and Bubble Computing. “The vibe is unapologetically feminine and fun,” read the invitation, which warned that anyone wearing a Patagonia vest would be turned away at the door. Even though this wasn’t an official Tesla event, the company was showing off its latest car tech. I arrived—sans Patagonia—and joined a small group for a spin in a Cybertruck.

On the showroom floor, a long line snaked toward the bar, where people were ordering the James Damore, a cocktail named after the Google employee who was famously fired in 2017 after writing a memo arguing that women at the company were less likely to end up in tech and leadership roles partially due to innate biological differences. (The hosts of this party were enforcing a 50/50 balance between male and female guests, which had left hundreds of guys on the waitlist.)

In many ways, the scene was absurd. But Cybertruck rides aside, it didn’t feel all that different from parties I have hosted in my own cramped apartment. Music blared while people awkwardly exchanged small talk and sipped their drinks. At the edges, some flirted while others danced. For a moment, I forgot that I was surrounded by young people at the center of an industry whose continued growth is now propping up the American economy. Then I spotted a Tesla humanoid robot standing on a pedestal, flanked by columns of hot-pink balloons.

It’s hard to overstate just how much money is coursing through the city. This summer, Meta offered one 24-year-old a $250 million pay package. While in San Francisco, I heard rumors of people in their early 20s holed up in a bar discussing strategies for tax evasion.

The floods of money have made for a culture of constant comparison. People do napkin math at the dinner table using the latest funding announcements to calculate their friends’ net worths and fret about declining job offers to join Anthropic or OpenAI. The most successful become the target of schadenfreude: Behind closed doors, people debate whether Mercor will stay afloat or come crashing down. When the AI bubble bursts, and many say it will, they could get wiped out entirely. For now, there’s a Gatsby-ness to it all.

No matter what happens, the country could be in for a shock. If AI progress stalls and the money dries up, there will be economic chaos. If AI progress advances and leads to massive waves of automation, there will also be economic chaos. Throughout my trip, people kept asking me whether I was familiar with the “escape the permanent underclass” meme. It implies that a huge amount of economic output will soon come to be produced by a select few AI companies. Everyone else will get automated into oblivion. The only way to escape is to get in on the AI boom. In other words: Pack your bags and move to San Francisco. The meme is sort of a joke, but also, it’s not: While a select few 20-somethings in the Bay Area are being paid astronomical sums, new grads across the country are struggling to find jobs, perhaps due to AI. Still, during my trip, people seemed singularly concerned with securing their own future. The only mandate is to keep building and get rich.

In October, Mercor completed another funding round, which valued the company at $10 billion—five times as much as what it was worth when I visited this summer. Now Foody and his 22-year-old co-founders are the world’s youngest self-made billionaires. I messaged Foody to ask him what it’s like to be a billionaire. “Haha I don’t think about it much,” he insisted. To celebrate, the start-up rented out a nightclub. Foody told me more than 1,000 people showed up. They partied until 3 a.m.</div>

            <h2>Trump’s Power Grab Over the Budget Is Breaking the Constitutional Design</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/trump-government-spending-congress/685337/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Recent presidents have not been shy about claiming broad powers, but President Donald Trump has taken this trend into a crucial new area: federal spending.

In just the past 11 months, his administration has canceled billions of dollars in foreign aid, frozen billions of dollars in research grants, imposed new conditions on other grants and contracts, slashed agency staffs, and even sought to claw back certain prior grant payments. At the same time, it has employed military resources to assist immigration enforcement, offered civil-service buyouts without statutory authority, and reportedly used a private donation to help pay military salaries during this fall’s government shutdown.

These precedents might well establish a new normal. Presidents tend not to cede powers claimed by their predecessors, so reversing presidential control over spending will require pushback from Congress. And whereas Congress did put up a fight when earlier presidents such as Richard Nixon attempted similar maneuvers, Congress today is a more divided and less effective body. So far, its response to Trump has been weak.

If this pattern holds, the result will be less responsive governance, more wild swings in policy across administrations, and a less restrained and accountable executive branch. America is dangerously close to a world in which all federal policy hinges on the outcomes of presidential elections, no matter how narrow the margin of victory.

Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress holds the “power of the purse,” meaning the authority to direct federal spending. Because the Constitution forbids any withdrawal of Treasury funds “but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law,” Congress needs to enact special statutes (“appropriations”) allowing any expenditure. That means no benefits can go out, no weapons can get bought, and no government salaries can get paid unless Congress specifically provides the necessary funds.

Although it sometimes authorizes spending on a permanent basis, Congress often does so instead in limited amounts and for limited periods of time, typically one year. That is why the government “shuts down” without new appropriations: If the fiscal year ends before Congress provides new money, agencies are left without the funds to operate.

The British Parliament invented this practice of time-limited appropriations to keep their kings and queens in check, and today it serves much the same purpose. Because presidents need new legislation from Congress each year just to keep the lights on, let alone advance their priorities, Congress has an ongoing say in what the government is doing. If it doesn’t like a new program or regulation, it can deny funds to implement it—or threaten to do so unless the president makes changes.

This congressional check on executive policy is particularly important today. Over time, Congress has conferred broad authorities on federal agencies, and presidents have claimed broad powers in areas including foreign affairs and the use of military force.

As a result, presidents can and often do launch major initiatives on their own, and they have real incentives to do so. These days, America’s two main parties have very different policy ideas, but neither commands majority support in the electorate. So presidents come into office with grand ambitions but no strong mandate to accomplish them. And without significant majorities in Congress, getting major legislation through the House and Senate is nearly impossible. That means presidents end up looking for ways to advance their agenda on their own—but often they still need Congress to provide the necessary funding.

In his second term, Trump has sought to upend this structure.

Starting on his first day back in office, Trump undertook a concerted campaign to wrest control over spending from Congress.

This campaign extended to all stages of the spending process and many areas of policy. The administration has sought to pause or terminate billions of dollars in foreign aid, government contracts, and research grants. It has aimed to shut down agencies, fire staff, and withhold funds from disfavored programs. In one well-known example, it fed USAID—the agency responsible for dispensing foreign aid—“into the wood chipper.” In another, it set about drastically shrinking the Department of Education, putting in doubt the department’s capacity to perform its statutory functions.

Based on purported concerns about anti-Semitism and other civil-rights violations (but without following required procedures for proving them), it suspended billions of dollars in research funding for top universities. Through this tactic, it succeeded in extracting a $221 million payment and other concessions from Columbia University.

The administration even applied a 1974 law limiting unilateral executive spending cuts in a manner that allowed it to accomplish just such cuts: By proposing late in the fiscal year that Congress cancel some $4 billion in foreign aid, it ran out the clock on the underlying appropriation without ever spending the money.

In addition to its cuts, the administration has sought spending flexibility. In its effort to reduce staff, the administration offered de facto buyouts to civil servants even though no appropriation or other statute clearly authorized them. It has shifted resources toward favored goals, employing the military to aid border enforcement and reportedly tasking FBI agents with aiding immigration enforcement. Amid the shutdown, it took this flexibility even further. It attempted to move money creatively among accounts and accepted a private donation for military salaries, while at the same time threatening further staff cuts, suspending payments for certain infrastructure projects, and seeking to halt nutrition assistance, all in an apparent effort to pressure Democrats in Congress.

Aggrieved parties have gone to court to challenge many of these actions, and sometimes they have succeeded in halting the administration’s plans, at least temporarily. But judicial remedies can do only so much in this area. Courts are good at blocking discrete unlawful actions such as illegal regulations and the detention of particular people. They are less adept at getting recalcitrant officials to do things they should be doing anyway, such as prudently dispensing billions of dollars for research or foreign aid in accordance with statutory policies.

Historically Congress, rather than the courts, has been the main check on this sort of spending abuse. Fifty years ago, President Nixon also tried “impounding,” or refusing to spend, large sums for housing assistance, environmental improvements, and other social programs. His administration claimed that the president’s “executive power” under the Constitution included the authority to withhold spending.

But Congress stood up for itself, enacting changes to the budget process including restrictions on impoundments. The 1974 Impoundment Control Act limited presidential authority even for spending “deferrals” (that is, delays). It also made clear that to “rescind” or cancel spending requires new legislation from Congress.

A few years later, President Ronald Reagan came to Washington promising to limit federal spending. But Congress protected much of the funding that his administration sought to cut. As one Texas Representative told Reagan’s budget director, David Stockman, members of Congress were unwilling “to tear up [their] voting cards and become White House robots.”

In one incident, Stockman delayed certain spending in anticipation of proposed cuts, but Howard Baker, the Republican Senate majority leader, told him “this dog ain’t gonna hunt.” Baker then exploded in rage when Stockman pushed back. Recalling the discipline he received as a child, Stockman wrote that Baker’s outburst “stung as much as my father’s leather strap.” The administration backed down.

Today, the Trump administration is singing from Nixon’s hymnal—and succeeding in ways Nixon and Reagan could not. Echoing Nixon’s claims, Trump pledged during last year’s campaign that, if reelected, he would revive a presidential impoundment power as a way “to cut waste, stop inflation, and crush the Deep State.” In 2022, Russell Vought, who has since taken on Stockman’s role as Trump’s budget director, criticized the influence of “congressional appropriations committees” over federal agencies and advocated a “Radical Constitutionalism” including stronger presidential power over the executive branch.

Trump and Vought have acted on these views in office, and Congress so far has given them little effective resistance. As is so often the case in this time of all-out partisanship, Republican majorities in Congress have seemed more interested in protecting their party’s president than in defending their branch of government. Meanwhile, Democrats have done the reverse and resisted the president however they can, voting nearly in lockstep against administration proposals.

The Democrats even triggered the government shutdown by failing to vote for new spending. Yet in doing so, they focused their objections on a policy disagreement over health-care subsidies rather than on Congress’s institutional interest in preserving its power of the purse. Each side has focused on the interests of its political party rather than its branch of government.

J. Michael Luttig: The end of rule of law

The practical effect has been to give the executive branch more latitude to do what it wants. Trump does not have stronger political support than Nixon or Reagan. Quite the opposite: Whereas both of those presidents won reelection in historic landslides, Trump lost the popular vote in 2016 and squeaked by with a plurality in 2024. But Congress today is more partisan and divided and therefore less able to defend its constitutional authorities. Vought is not likely to feel “stung” by anything Congress does.

What does all of this mean for the future? In principle, presidents will still need Congress to provide new funding each year. But if they can impound funds, cancel past grants, move money between accounts, and impose new conditions as Trump has, then Congress will have much less leverage over how those funds are spent.

And while Republicans are riding high right now, it is not hard to imagine a Democratic president acting just as unilaterally. Much as Trump has canceled foreign aid, gutted the Education Department, and required universities to abandon diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, a Democratic president might impound local police funding, limit immigration enforcement, and require universities to resume DEI.

Presidential defiance of Congress seems likely to become self-reinforcing. If legislators can get what they want out of the president, why take tough votes or make compromises with the other side? And if legislators opposed to the president know he can cancel items they like, why help him out with votes for an overall package? Unilateral presidential control over spending may compound Congress’s partisan gridlock, giving presidents still more freedom to defy Congress in the future.

Elections, of course, have consequences, and presidents should advance the preferences of their voters. But the United States is a big, complicated place. In designing the Constitution, the Framers made a bet that negotiation between competing interests in Congress, and between Congress and the executive branch, would generally produce better and more durable policy than hinging everything on nationwide elections every four years. Given recent presidents’ flip-flopping between polarized, unpopular policies, the Framers’ bet looks better than ever—if only the system they designed can deliver on it.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump likes to use a big number to anchor his point, especially when he wanders off on a tangent. Often it seems that a specific figure is on the tip of his tongue.

At this year’s ceremonial turkey pardon, Trump praised a farmer from Wayne County, North Carolina, for raising two “record-setting” birds, but then pivoted to his own electoral margin of victory: “I won that county by 92 percent.” (In fact, he won it by 16 percentage points.) At a McDonald’s corporate event last month, Trump claimed that the United States controls 92 percent of the shoreline of the Gulf of Mexico (the Gulf of America, as he calls it). It’s really about 46 percent. Trump won the veterans’ vote, he said on Veterans Day, with “about 92 percent or something,” and in July, he said he won farmers—well, “by 92 percent.” (More accurate estimates of the portion of the electorate he won would be 65 percent of veterans and 78 percent of voters in farming counties, according to exit polls and election data.)

His fixation on the number between 91 and 93 has been a feature for a while. In April, Trump claimed that egg prices had fallen by 92 percent. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics said 12.7 percent.) And at a rally shortly before last November’s election, while railing against journalists and the media, he allowed that “not all of them” are “sick people.” Just “about 92 percent.” That one, admittedly, is difficult to fact-check.

I came upon this curious pattern in the course of tracking down the basis for a far more serious claim the president has made repeatedly as part of his justification for the U.S. military buildup near Venezuela. More than two dozen strikes on small boats allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific have killed more than 100 people since September. The strikes have formed the core of the administration’s ongoing campaign to treat President Nicolás Maduro as a “narco-terrorist,” which many view as a veneer for wanting to see the Venezuelan strongman ousted from power and work with a new government to secure access to the country’s oil and rare earth minerals.

“The drugs coming in through the sea are down to—they’re down by 92 percent,” Trump told Politico on December 8. At a roundtable later the same day, he went with “92 or 94 percent.” Three days later: “Drug traffic by sea is down 92 percent,” Trump said in the Oval Office. A day after that brought a new estimate: “We knocked out 96 percent of the drugs coming in by water,” he told reporters.

More often than not, the president links the 92 (or more) percent claim to another: “Every one of those boats you see get shot down, you just saved 25,000 American lives.” In December alone, he has cited that figure—25,000 American lives saved per boat strike—on at least six different occasions.

I asked the Coast Guard—the lead federal agency for maritime drug interdiction—for any underlying data or information to support both of those figures. The Coast Guard referred me to the Pentagon. The Pentagon referred me to the White House. The Department of Homeland Security referred me to the Pentagon and the White House, which repeated Trump’s remarks without elaboration.

“President Trump is right. It is widely known that one small dose of these drugs is deadly, fentanyl is the number one killer of adults between the ages of 18 and 45, and any boat bringing this poison to our shores has the potential to kill 25,000 Americans or more,” Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, told me in a statement. “Rather than try to poke holes in these facts, The Atlantic should join President Trump in elevating the voices of families who have lost loved ones to the scourge of narcoterrorism.”

The president’s claims, however, are so porous that I hardly found anywhere to poke. Although Trump and other officials have repeatedly said that the goal of the strikes is to combat the trafficking of illicit fentanyl—the synthetic opioid chiefly responsible for an epidemic of fatal overdoses over the past decade—the drug does not come from South America. It enters America primarily across the border with Mexico and is produced using precursor chemicals from China. Venezuela, however, is primarily a transit country for cocaine bound for Europe.

In a briefing with lawmakers early last month, top officials acknowledged that they believed it was cocaine, not fentanyl, on the boats. A former senior Coast Guard official told me that in his more than three decades in the service, he has not been aware of a single instance of an intercepted load in the Caribbean or eastern Pacific containing fentanyl. In sum, the boats being struck aren’t carrying the drug that is the leading cause of overdose deaths in the U.S.—and what drugs they may be carrying aren’t coming to America. So it is hard to see how each strike saves 25,000 American lives.

Read: Trump’s boat strikes could make the cartel problem worse

Bill Baumgartner, a retired Coast Guard rear admiral who directed the agency’s operations in the Caribbean, told me that number “is just complete and pure fantasy.” The only way to arrive at that total of saved lives is if you would have rounded up 25,000 people and forced them to consume lethal doses of cocaine—a claim “just as stupid as saying that there’s a box of ammunition; if you confiscate a box of ammunition, you have saved 100 lives because there were 100 bullets there,” Baumgartner said.

It is even unclear how many of the destroyed vessels were actually carrying narcotics. The administration has not specified or released evidence of the types or quantities of drugs on them. When identifying boats ferrying drugs, “the intelligence isn’t foolproof,” and destroying a vessel with a strike—unlike boarding it during an interdiction—leaves no room to correct faulty intelligence, Baumgartner said. In the 13 months leading up to early October, 21 percent of the boats interdicted off the coast of Venezuela turned out not to be carrying any contraband, according to data shared by Coast Guard Acting Commandant Admiral Kevin Lunday in a letter to Senator Rand Paul, a Republican.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in the 12-month period ending in April, there were about 73,690 total drug overdose deaths in the United States (although that number is likely to increase when final data are tallied). If it were the case that each strike since September has saved 25,000 American lives, and given that 28 boats have been destroyed to date, the operation would have saved 700,000 lives—more than nine times the total U.S. drug overdose deaths in a year. “That makes no sense,” Adam Isacson, an expert on drug trafficking in Latin America at WOLA, an NGO based in Washington, D.C., told me.

The majority of overdose fatalities stem from opioids, not stimulants such as cocaine. In 2023, the most recent year for which such data are available, the CDC tracked 29,449 cocaine-linked deaths. (About 1.2 grams of cocaine can constitute a fatal dose. That amount is 600 times greater than the 2 milligrams of fentanyl that can cause a deadly overdose.) But notably, nearly 70 percent of cocaine- and other stimulant-related deaths that year also involved fentanyl.

As for the basis for the president’s claim of a 92 percent decline in maritime drug traffic: “We’ve only seen that in Trump’s remarks. No sourcing, no other data,” according to Isacson. (The White House did not specifically respond to my inquiry about it.) But the numbers the government does release give ample reason to doubt the statistic. Last month, the Coast Guard touted a record-setting year of drug interdiction; the agency seized more than 510,000 pounds of cocaine, primarily in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, compared with the 167,000 pounds it seized on average in prior years. This month, as part of its ongoing maritime-law-enforcement operations separate from the strikes, the Coast Guard seized 20,000 pounds of cocaine in a single interdiction. But global cocaine supply and demand continue to reach new heights, according to a June report from the United Nations. And counternarcotics-enforcement veterans told me that even if drug traffic by sea has seen a sharp drop, that does not signal an overall decline in cocaine traffic, because traffickers adapt and reroute shipments.

Perhaps the president has divined these numbers through a mathematically rigorous process beyond the reaches of my imagination. After all, Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, told Vanity Fair that her boss is a “statistical savant.” More likely, his affinity for 92 percent and extravagantly large round numbers is what in a game of poker might be called a tell. In 2019, Bloomberg noticed 10,000 cropping up whenever Trump made big claims, in topics such as the stock market and ISIS fighters. It was the number Trump cited for known or suspected gang members whom ICE removed in 2018 (though the agency put that number at 5,872). And it’s the number of points he said the Dow Jones would have been up in 2019 had the Federal Reserve not raised interest rates the previous year.

Not every time the president cites a 92 percent is off base. His August boast of a “92 percent” approval rating for the Department of Veterans Affairs, for instance, was actually slightly less than the 92.8 percent of veterans who reported trusting the VA for their health care in the agency’s survey that month. That was up from—wait for it—92 percent under the Biden administration the previous year. But more often than not, the number seems to serve as a clue that the commander in chief might be reaching for a number he can easily remember, caring little whether it is accurate.

At three different rallies in the fall of 2024 leading up to Election Day, Trump bragged about his nearly decade-long campaign to denigrate the press. “The fake news back there—they were at 92 percent approval rating when we started this journey in 2015. And now they’re less than Congress,” he said on November 2. “I’m very proud of that.” In fact, the year the president descended his golden escalator and upended the country’s political life, Americans’ trust in the media was not at 92 percent. It stood at a then-historic low of 40 percent. In the years since, it has dropped to a new historic low of 28 percent. Congress’s approval, for the record, stands at 15 percent.</div>

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Rep. Joe Neguse, a Democrat whose district includesBoulder, have suggested that the proposed NCAR closure amounts to political brinkmanship bythe White House in response to Colorado&#39;s refusal to release Tina Peters. Peters, a formerMesa County clerk, is serving a nine-year prison sentence for illegally accessing votingmachines after the 2020 election. A Republican, Peters was recently pardoned by Trump,largely symbolic action since she has neither been charged nor convicted in federal court.

Yes, the trump party is disgusting and corrupt. But what should the world think of the country that allows it to operate without a hint of opposition?

Even one of the Balkan countries managed to take down a corrupt government two weeks ago with largely uncoordinated public protests. Your &quot;oldest democracy&quot; is facing an existential crisis with its basic institutions being demolished by the president with a stuffed and corrupt Supreme Court and a rubber-stamping congress, and yet it (the democracy) behaves as if nothing&#39;s happening. Your &quot;opposition&quot; just &quot;reached across the isle&quot; a few weeks ago, and the last line of defense, your judges, are now getting sentenced.

I agree.  The lack of meaningful and effective opposition in the USA (&quot;The Land of the Free&quot;) is breathtaking.  And while they&#39;re at it, they should repeal the Second Amendment because all it does is result in 50K+ gun deaths per year and has zero effect on stopping a tyrant from taking over, its supposed rationalization.

The billionaires behind Trump know he&#39;s at best a useful idiot - they saw in his first term how quickly he can veer off course if he doesn&#39;t have a reliable minder nearby.

Guys like Vought see entities like NCAR as an impediment to what they want to do, it&#39;s simple as that. They don&#39;t want the commoners to feel like the government owes them anything or is gonna do anything to improve the commoners&#39; lives. They want the commoners to be happy spending long, tedious days screwing tiny screws into iPhones for a pittance, then quietly stepping aside and dying when they&#39;re no longer able to improve the billionaire&#39;s profit margins.

Considering how many of these followers consider cheeto benito their saint, I would say that they will get what they deserve.

I&#39;m amused by those who imagine that the laws of physics can be defied merely by looking the other way. It makes me ponder how unbelievably moronic humanity is, how pathetic, and how deserving of what it is come.You&#39;ve just described the RCP 8.5 numbers used by scientists for pay.  Thank you.

The US government used to be the most powerful in the world because it was the government of the world’s richest country and would spend the money doing things no-one else was able to do. Now, the USG has not merely given up on both the ambition to be the world’s richest country and to do things no-one else can, it’s doing it’s damndest to run fast the other way. And all the while, absolute imbeciles like you are cheering from the bleachers.

It was announced by someone called &quot;Russell Vought&quot; who apparently works for your government https://x.com/russvought/statu... [x.com]

PBS limits themselves to faithfully repeat the words of your government official. In case you prefer other source, it was also featured on CNN, NBC, CBS, NY Times, LA Times, MSN, USA Today, and others.

&quot;nothing useful from that has resulted in decades.&quot;

There are millions of people along the gulf coast and southeastern U.S. that rely on hurricane prediction models to know whether they&#39;re in danger as tropical storms are evolving across the Atlantic into hurricanes. Hurricane prediction models, constrained by NCAR hurricane flight data and research, are crucial to saving lives and property.

What&#39;s sad is that so many people in the southeastern US who are cheering for this dismantling are also benefiting the most from NCAR hurricane research.

Remember the idiots who died in their dozens of Covid infections *actively insisting they weren’t even as they were dying*? Cults have an incredible ability to make people act in completely irrational ways.

... Is like taking a sledgehammer to the foundations of reality!

You almost got it. It is a deliberate sledgehammer to the foundation of existing order that is actively hostile to MAGA base. Trump was elected to dismantle these institutions, regardless of consequences, and he is delivering on that promise. If anything, what is happening in UK and Australia is empirical evidence of what would have happened here, in US, had Trump lost.

I don’t know what you imagine is happening in the UK, but is undoubtedly not what you think it is. Or I should say “think” it is. London remains a safe and happy city, safer than the shitty towns where Reform MPs are based. The UK continues on an energy transition that’s going pretty well.   Our people continue not to be murdered in their thousands by gun-toting maniacs. Etc. As for Australia, last I checked, a broad coalition of left and right politicians had come together in revuls

so we can unfuck all the things he&#39;s fucked.

But the reality is, Trump is a symptom, not a disease. He was elected by the people. Those who voted Trump once were either Nazi sympathizers or fools. Those who voted Trump the second time around were definitely Nazi sympathizers, or definitely fools.

Impeaching Trump won&#39;t do anything. The next Nazi in line is JD Vance and he&#39;s ten times worse because, unlike Trump, he&#39;s not an idiot with a case of fronto-temporal dementia.

And even if Vance and the rest of the Nazi goons are out, the people will vote another fascist in the next time around because the people has proven twice now that they&#39;re fucking fascists or fucking morons.

In short, America is fucked because Americans are hopeless.

People didn&#39;t vote *FOR* Trump. They voted *AGAINST* Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris. How funny. I didn&#39;t vote for them because I wanted them. I just didn&#39;t want the worst person ever alive to be president, which comes back to what Rosco said above. People who voted for Trump did it specifically because they wanted Trump to do terrible things, which was because they are terrible people. They specifically wanted other people to suffer, because they are suffering, and they think making other people suffer more will make them feel better. This in turn is because they don&#39;t know shit, so they are somehow able to believe that punishing people for doing jobs they don&#39;t want to do will make them better off.I don&#39;t think for the most part that there are fundamentally, physically &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; people, and there may or may not even be fundamentally smart or dumb people, at least not to the extent we think there is — some of those people may just not have learned how to use their brains, and society certainly doesn&#39;t want them to learn lest it loses its source of cheap labor. But voting for Donald Trump because you think hurting other people will help you is both stupid and hateful.

Yes he and they made sime bad choices (Afghanistan withdrawal, tepid Ukraine support) but not strategic damage and coupled with some very good decisions (block China access to GPUs, energy policy)

I understand the sentiment, but urge you not to give in to despair. Lots of people voted for him the second time around who are clearly in the process of abandoning not just him but the political movement he represents, as the horrors have unfolded in front of them in an unmistakable way. Most people are quite malleable, not fixed. Their opinions can change over time. That’s what Trump used to his advantage, and it’s something that better people can also use to their advantage too. Of course, cu

I&#39;m an atmospheric and soil scientist returning right now from the annual American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans, where atmospheric science is one of the largest sections of the 25,000-person conference and >60,000-member Union.

There was an emergency town hall at the meeting after the NCAR announcement on Wednesday. One of the largest ballrooms in the convention center (New Orleans) was packed for the town hall. At one point, a (non-NCAR) scientist asked anyone to stand up if they have collaborated with or used NCAR data in the past few years. At least 90% of the people in the room stood up. It was quite moving in person.

NCAR is a resource that has spent decades performing world-leading research. They are notably non-political, they don&#39;t advocate policy, they perform research, acquire data, and report it. They do a very wide range of research that is important for defense, air travel, aeronautics, meteorology, hurricane and tornado prediction, climatology, and air pollution. Note that I tucked climatology in that list - it&#39;s a fraction of the research they do.

An important point: the proposed &quot;break up&quot; is enormously inefficient and expensive. These NCAR scientists are in the same place because their research all overlaps enough that there is benefit to them being together. If they split into different sections, people will have to be relocated, laboratories will have to be moved (short term costs) and new support staff will be required at every new site (long term costs).  So not only is this a bad idea in terms of science, it&#39;s costly.

If you&#39;re interested in contacting your senators and representatives to advocate for saving NCAR, here&#39;s a link to do so provided by AGU.

Maybe it can&#39;t go through your mind but DEI is what world-class institutions do *in order to achieve scientific excellence*. Maybe you can discuss an excess here or there in the USA, but the concept is now accepted by both left and right in the world.

It really really boils your piss to imagine anything being done by someone besides a straight white guy, doesn’t it? Poor little fragile thing you are.

You must have come home from a long day and found DEI fucking your wife. The current administration is all DEI hires. Not a single one of them is qualified based solely on their merit.

People don&#39;t care unless it slaps them in the face. Trump is running amok all over the constitution and people applaud. SCOTUS wants a king or dictator and the Epstein files are garnering the most attention just for the gossip. The senators and representatives are letting all this happen. They don&#39;t care because it doesn&#39;t affect them... now.

Quite a bit are illegal actually. https://www.justsecurity.org/1... [justsecurity.org]

NCAR provides information such that policymakers can make decisions that can reduce pollution or better plan for bad weather or a changing climate.

The USA are fucked because their electoral system occasionally allows for a losing candidate to be elected, as it happened with W Bush and Trump (who then proceeded earn a reputation for f up a lot of things). We can&#39;t redo history but assuming the 2016 election got the result the popular vote should have given it, you&#39;d be now in a Trump first term, or in a pause in between two terms, and Trump would probably be too mentally impaired to show up for a second term after that.

Actually I intended to reply to Rosco P. Coltrane who wrote &quot;America is fucked because Americans are hopeless&quot; and I disagreed. But now at I am here and we&#39;re discussing on potential improvements, the simplest single change that would make the largest impact would be to move away from the winner-takes-all method for the Electoral College. That would allow more parties to join on a regular basis, therefore promoting more debates, and reducing polarisation. It isn&#39;t a panacea, but a necessary step. Also from

No, but it requires all the states to cooperate. GLWT.

The best thing as far as the presidency would really be just to eliminate the electoral college and move to counting the votes directly. We can do that now. Also we should do it with paper. Fuck computer voting.

For example, all of this Epstein nonsense, why the fuck wasn&#39;t this released when the Democrats were in power?Well Trump did promise to release the Epstein files as part of his campaign https://www.foxla.com/video/15... [foxla.com]

Th e climate doesnt care... it will continue to do whatever it is going to do regardless of our belief. All shutting these programs down really means is that when we are finally forced to act it will be more expensive and disruptive. IMHO with stuff like permafrost melts it is far too late to change the climate by widespread emissions and other changes. But stopping research for whatever reason just maxiizes the ultimate cost and consequences.

The end of the article says that if Google wins their lawsuit then serp data will be harder to obtain.

What is serp data and what would we want it for?

&quot;A juxtaposition of what, on the surface, appears to be the case with what is actually the case&quot;, as the Wikipedia tells us.

google, which built its empire on bypassing security protections to scrape data, which it then showed to the users, is angry that someone shrewder is using the same approach - despite the many cases in court where the same google argued the exactly opposite point.

I&#39;ve wondered how they hadn&#39;t been sued before.

Yuep. The TLDR for existing US case law is basically that anything publicly available on the open web

Yes and Google probably benefits from this precedent more than any other company..  They&#39;re running a frickin search engine.  They hardly ever Ask or Get proper permission for scraping anything.  Companies who publish News in particular could have massive claims against sites like google News for pulling their articles and displaying it on Google&#39;s site.   Not only unauthorized scraping, but appropriation.

What if engineers were freed from working for &quot;be evil&quot; finance guys so they could develop software they wanted to use and share it because they got a generous, inflation-proofed basic income?

I&#39;m sure the highest-paid engineers have no desire to be freed.Generous basic income is an oxymoron. Basic income is supposed to be basic, not generous. Basic income still needs to be funded through taxes, and requires a productive economy that generates tax revenue, and produces goods and services that are worth buying.

Basic does not mean &quot;little&quot; but it means &quot;No strings attached&quot;.

Il really trying ting to understand whatâ(TM) theyâ(TM)re alleging that hasnâ(TM)t been standard practice (even by Google) for literally as long as the web has existed.

Honestly, this sounds like textbook monopoly behavior.

To quote the Princess Bride: You are trying to kidnap what I have rightfully stolen!

First I doubt that the search page contains much that is Google&#39;s copyright and second they are currently not in the position to complain about others scraping content.

And this is probably not about search competition, but about AI. Everyone can (and many do) run a LLM-Service cheaply. What comes one expensive very fast is integrating search, because you cannot just scrape Google without tricks so you need to pay them for an API key to get the same results SerpApi is scraping (and also selling to API consumers).

API prices (Openrouter):Small LLM: $0.03 per Million tokensSearch: $4/1000 requests

When you run your own &quot;ChatGPT@home&quot; using API-Providers, search integration qui

On Thursday, the board of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts voted to rename the center “the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” Weirdly, the board of the center, mostly picked by President Donald Trump, does not seem to understand that a “memorial” center is named for someone who is deceased, and thus the new name implies that Trump is dead. By Friday, Trump’s name was physically added to the building at the behest of his handpicked board. Don’t be fooled by the absurdity of Trump’s vanity and the obsequiousness of these government officials: This is not an at all an innocuous move.

American political culture has long rejected he idea that sitting officer holders, or even living persons, should be honored with buildings or institutions named for them, or have their names and faces on currency, coins, or postage stamps. This sort of behavior is alien to a republic and a democracy. It is common, however, in dictatorships. Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Francisco Franco had heir faces on stamps, currency, and coins during their respective despotic reigns. Josef Stalin appeared on numerous stamps while he was the dictator of the Soviet Union and renamed a major city Stalingrad, after himself. Kim Jong-un sometimes appears on North Korean stamps.

The first United States stamps featured Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, many decades after their deaths. Our coins reflect this tradition as well, with Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John F. Kennedy, Dwight Eisenhower, Susan B. Anthony, and Sacagawea getting their faces on coinage posthumously. The tyrannical Confederate government, on the other hand, put its leaders on stamps and currency, breaking with the long United States tradition of not honoring living people in these ways.

The traditions around the naming of buildings and institutions in our democracy have been similar. And the names are often the result of nonpolitical, bipartisan decisions. Our nation’s capital was called the District of Columbia until 1802—three years after the death of George Washington—when the city of Washington was chartered. By this time Washington was seen as the “father” of our country, but his political party, the Federalist Party, was no longer in power. The Democratic-Republican Party of Thomas Jefferson supported the name change. Dulles airport in Washington was named for the deceased Republican Secretary of State John Foster Dulles during the Democratic administration of Kennedy. When it opened, there was talk about changing the name, but the Kennedy administration kept it. Mayor Fiorello La Guardia was responsible for the creation of New York Municipal Airport, which opened in 1939. Shortly before he died of cancer, and after he was no longer mayor, the city named the airport for him. Similarly, Congress renamed Washington National Airport for Ronald Reagan in 1998, long after Reagan had left politics, and four years after he had announced that he was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease—and with Democrat Bill Clinton in the White House. O’Hare International Airport in Chicago was named for Edward Henry “Butch” O’Hare, the first Navy pilot to win the Medal of Honor, who died in combat in 1943.

Cultural institutions are often named for those who donated to them, were leaders of them, or used their influence to create them. The Smithsonian is named for James Smithson, a British scientist who endowed the museum with a gift in his will. Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History began in 1893 but was renamed in 1905, a year before its main benefactor, Marshall Field, passed away. New York City’s Hayden Planetarium was named for a banker, Charles Hayden, who funded its creation, and passed away two years after it opened.

Which brings us to the Kennedy Center. The idea of a national cultural center had bounced around American politics for three decades before President John F. Kennedy pushed for legislation to create it, using both public and private money. The center opened in 1971, nearly eight years after JFK was assassinated. It was formally named the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Richard Nixon, a Republican, was president when it opened. In fact, Kennedy had beaten Nixon in the 1960 presidential election, but Nixon did not try to change the name. He did attend a performance there in the Eisenhower Theater, which also opened in 1971. Bipartisanship and honoring deceased leaders were etched into the building, literally.

Now Trump has physically etched a different, more sinister tradition into its walls.

The bottom line here is simple. For nearly 250 years the United States has not “honored” sitting political leaders by naming buildings or cultural institutions for them. Presidents have never appointed a board to an institution and then pressured that board to rename the institution for the president. Presidents have not signed bills, or issued executive orders, to name things after themselves. Dictators, emperors, führers, czars, kings, and “dear leaders” do such things, because it makes them feel good, powerful, and strokes their fragile egos. Presidents of a republic do not act in this way.

It is unseemly, it is childish, and it is thoroughly un-American. But it is also a warning of a path we must not continue to travel down.

Judges around the country have begun to show a simmering fury at the conduct of federal agents, including those carrying out the increasingly brutal immigration crackdowns in predominantly blue cities nationwide. At the same time, many of the same judges have begun to balk at being extravagantly and shamelessly deceived by Justice Department lawyers defending that conduct in their courtrooms. On Thursday, another federal district court judge, Gary R. Brown, lit into the Trump administration for effectively torturing immigrants in a manner that “shocks the conscience.” His 24-page ruling also castigated both Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and government lawyers for submitting “evasive and demonstrably false” claims to the court under oath. Brown, a Donald Trump appointee, also raised the serious possibility of imminent contempt proceedings against those who lied to him.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed lower court judges’ escalating efforts to hold government officials accountable for shameless fabrications, contemptuous behavior, and egregious violations of immigrants’ constitutional rights. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This picks up themes from our main show with the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt, who warned us that during Trump 1.0, the lawyering could be sloppy, but it at least conformed to norms and basic rules of truth. Now the obligation of candor is simply gone, and lying to a judge’s face is a-OK. Can you tell us what happened in Judge Brown’s court?

Mark Joseph Stern: Judge Brown explained why he ordered the release of Erron Anthony Clarke, a noncitizen whom ICE detained even though he legally entered the country and has no criminal record whatsoever. ICE accused Clarke of overstaying his visa and arrested him. Brown wrote that agents may have arrested him without securing the necessary charging documents or identifying probable cause, then fudged the paperwork to obscure the fact that they acted before they had lawful authority to do so.

But set that aside. ICE then locked Clarke up at the Central Islip federal courthouse, placing him in a tiny cell designed for one person along with eight other men. They had no access to bunks, bedding, soap, showers, toothbrushes, or clean clothes. The cell was literally freezing cold. The lights stayed on 24 hours a day. The detainees had to sleep on the floor, crowded around an open toilet that reeked of urine.

Clarke challenged his detention, arguing due process violations. When it first appeared that Judge Brown was going to release him, ICE transferred him to a different facility in Newark. Brown still ordered him released immediately. ICE blatantly defied the order, holding Clarke overnight. Brown then demanded more information about Clarke’s confinement. On Thursday, he said that what ICE provided was “preposterous,” “rank hearsay,” “evasive and demonstrably false,” and filled with “material misstatements.” He accused ICE agents of lying repeatedly—quite possibly to make it seem like Clarke spent less time in torturous conditions than he did, or to cover up its effort to evade the court’s orders by transferring him to other locations. Brown also said that ICE refused to provide key details about the holding cell at the Islip courthouse. He warned that ICE has started exploiting these holding cells to cram multiple detainees into tiny spaces for long periods, subjecting them to what is essentially torture.

Brown asked for a photo of the Islip cell, but ICE would not even provide it on the grounds that doing so would “create privacy concerns” for detainees. He was having none of this. As he wrote on Thursday: “After nearly 35 years of experience with federal law enforcement in this judicial district, encompassing service as a prosecutor and a judge, I have never encountered anything like this. ICE’s seeming disregard of procedural requisites, combined with the chillingly brutal conditions of confinement to which Petitioner has been, and presumably would continue to be subjected, cries out for immediate remedy.” And so he found that there were “extraordinary circumstances” here that required him to grant bail and release Clarke.

I want to unpeel the onion for one quick second. It’s not just the horrifying misconduct on the part of ICE. It’s the lying. And in that sense, it feels again like we’re back in Judge James Boasberg’s courtroom with a judge who is confronted with blatant misrepresentations. According to Brown, ICE claimed that it moved Clarke from a facility to another in eight minutes, but it’s a 35-minute drive. So unless there’s an ICE rocket ship we don’t know about, these are just blatant falsifications. It does raise this question, which is the same question Judge Boasberg is exploring in D.C.: Is there some possibility that there could be consequences?

Yes, there are. This was not just a cri de coeur against ICE. There is a real possibility of consequences. Judge Brown ordered counsel for ICE to tell him why he shouldn’t enter an order of contempt as punishment for ICE’s defiance of his orders. That means he is strongly considering contempt—maybe civil, maybe criminal—against ICE agents who lied to him repeatedly and conspired to defy his orders.

Crucially, Judge Brown isn’t just considering contempt because of conduct that occurred outside his courtroom. He’s looking at ICE’s defiance of his own orders by lying to him in declarations submitted to his court, lies evidently abetted by DOJ attorneys. That actually takes this beyond Judge Boasberg’s saga, because this seems to involve cut-and-dry, eminently demonstrable perjury. I know there are a lot of hurdles that Brown would have to overcome to bring a contempt proceeding with teeth, but I do think he has a good reason to try. This case could easily escalate into the next judicial attempt to hold people accountable who absolutely need to be in order for us to protect the rule of law.

In mid-March of 2025, ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt and his colleagues started hearing that the Trump administration might attempt a flagrantly lawless publicity stunt, involving migrant men, secret flights to El Salvador, a notorious gulag, and a total disregard for due process. Despite getting word that something was about to happen, and rushing into a Saturday night hearing, and then securing a TRO from DC judge James Boasberg, Lee and his colleagues were unable to prevent more than 250 men from being renditioned from Texas to the CECOT torture prison in El Salvador. The legal cases spawned by the dramatic events of March 15th 2025 haven’t gone away, indeed they are reaching crucial milestones in the courts, raising foundational questions about the abuse of statutes and what it means to defy court orders. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick is joined by the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt who is litigating these cases, to discuss the very high stakes of a set of cases that may have fallen off your radar in the shuffle.

How these cases play out will dictate much of what happens for the rest of Trump’s term in office by answering democracy-defining questions such as whether the antiquated and radical wartime powers of the Alien Enemies Act can be unleashed on people the government deems enemies domestically, whether court orders are actually directives the Trump DoJ is bound  to follow, whether the district courts can require Pam Bondi’s justice department to assist in the finding of fact, and whether the ancient legal concepts protecting liberty of due process and habeas corpus have the force of law in Trump’s America.

            <div id="article-text">If you were hoping for some relief from stratospheric memory pricing, don&#39;t hold your breath. DRAM prices aren&#39;t expected to peak until at least 2026, TechInsights analyst James Sanders tells El Reg.

DRAM is an incredibly broad category and includes everything from the DDR5 found in desktops and servers to the GDDR7 and HBM used by graphics cards and AI accelerators.

The market is also notoriously volatile and prone to wild swings in pricing, spiking as inventories are drawn down and cratering as new capacity is brought online, Sanders explains.

As chip markets go, DRAM is about as volatile as they get. - Click to enlarge

According to TechInsights, memory pricing was already on the rise in 2024, growing 88 percent from a rather steep valley the year prior. Based on previous DRAM booms, one might expect it to grow at a slower pace in 2025, before contracting in 2026 or 2027.

However, Sanders tells us that&#39;s unlikely to happen this time around. &quot;I think we&#39;re looking at the peak in 2026,&quot; he said, adding that even then he only expects DRAM prices to settle in 2027 before rising again in 2028.

So what&#39;s to blame for the sky-high memory prices? Well, as you might have already guessed, it&#39;s AI. But it&#39;s not the full story. Timing is also a factor.

According to Sanders, the AI boom kicked off at what was very possibly the worst time for memory vendors. &quot;This demand started in the Valley for the DRAM industry. That makes financially trying to build additional capacity really challenging,&quot; he said. &quot;If you&#39;re rushing, the time to bring additional capacity online is about three years. It&#39;s a quirk of bad timing that&#39;s led to the circumstances that we&#39;re in now.&quot;

More realistically, DRAM vendors, like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron, are looking at four or five years to ramp production at a new fab, at which time the market conditions could have changed considerably.

Timing is also why the DRAM shortage is hitting some harder than others. &quot;The consumer market is in the stratosphere, whereas OEMs are about a year out, and they&#39;re not getting heartburn quite yet,&quot; he explained.

In other words, giant hardware vendors like Dell and HP aren&#39;t suffering nearly as much because they tend to lock in their orders early, while smaller vendors are at the mercy of spot pricing. In fact, ahead of the Christmas holiday, G.Skill, a supplier of memory for gamers, issued a statement pinning the blame for jacking the price of its products on AI.

&quot;DRAM prices are experiencing significant industry-wide volatility, due to severe global supply constraints and shortages, driven by unprecedented high demand from the AI industry,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;As a result, G.Skill procurement and sourcing costs have substantially increased. G.Skill pricing reflects industry-wide component cost increases from IC suppliers and is subject to change without notice based on market conditions.&quot;

What&#39;s more, AI is driving demand for a different class of memory that, unlike traditional DRAM, isn&#39;t much use in most consumer applications.

&quot;This is a little bit different from previous boom-bust cycles, in that wafers are being redirected toward HBM and away from consumer-grade memory,&quot; Sanders said.

High-bandwidth memory consists of multiple layers of DRAM, which as the name implies, enables it to achieve much higher bandwidth than a typical DRAM module you might find in a notebook or RDIMM. With HBM3e, it&#39;s not uncommon to see a single 36 GB chip deliver 1 TB/s of bandwidth. By comparison, a single 8 GB LPDDR5x module might be able to achieve 140 GB/s.

HBM is used almost exclusively in high-end datacenter GPUs and AI accelerators, like Nvidia&#39;s B300, AMD&#39;s MI355X, or Amazon&#39;s Trainium3. Because of this, Sanders says, the memory market is rapidly diverging.

&quot;Because there&#39;s no consumer demand for HBM — the consumer market can&#39;t bear that price at all — it is really becoming two markets that are detached from each other,&quot; he said.

Memory vendors are currently in the midst of a memory transition as they prepare to ramp production of HBM4 modules, which will power chips like Nvidia&#39;s Vera Rubin and AMD&#39;s MI400s starting next year. Initially, Sanders says these chips will command a price premium.

And while TechInsights does expect the memory market to settle in 2027, it won&#39;t last. As you may recall, Nvidia plans to cram 576 Rubin-Ultra GPUs each equipped with a terabyte of HBM4e memory into a single rack starting in, that&#39;s right, 2027.

This might explain why Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra recently told investors that due to strong AI datacenter demand, &quot;aggregate industry supply will remain substantially short of the demand for the foreseeable future.&quot;

Not that he&#39;s really complaining. While end customers are grappling with memory prices that have gone up 3x in just a few months, the memory fabs are raking in the cash. In Micron&#39;s Q1 2026 earnings call this month, the company saw revenues rise 56 percent while net income more than doubled from $1.87 billion this time last year to $5.24 billion.

And while memory vendors may now have the capital necessary to finance additional fabs, it&#39;ll be at least three more years before they enter production. And even when they do, the bulk of capacity is likely to be allocated toward HBM and other enterprise products.

One wildcard in all of this is China&#39;s CXMT, Sanders explains.

&quot;CXMT doesn&#39;t necessarily play by the same set of rules that everyone else does,&quot; he explained.

For one, they don&#39;t have any meaningful HBM output at this time. Second, many had expected the company to focus heavily on DDR4, but instead, Sanders says the company now appears to be transitioning to DDR5.

Today, CXMT isn&#39;t a very large player in the DRAM business. It certainly doesn&#39;t help that the company is subject to United States export controls. Despite this, TechInsights expects the company to grow considerably by the end of the decade from five to 10 percent of the market, which should in theory help grow the supply of DDR5 overall. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">hands on Infinite Machine, a New York-based electric vehicle startup, began with a stolen Vespa.

Eddie Cohen, president and co-founder of the company, told The Register that he and his brother Joseph were living together during the COVID outbreak.

&quot;His Vespa had gotten stolen and we just kinda had this crazy idea … if we were to design one for the future that was all-electric, had the best technology, what would it look like? What would it feel like?&quot; Cohen explained.

As I stood beside P1, a $10,000 electric seated scooter, and Olto, a $3,495 bike-lane legal class 2 e-bike, that question had been answered. The brothers&#39; company started shipping the P1 to customers in October and expects to deliver Olto in early 2026.

&quot;We just started dabbling and we came up with P1, you know, just a sketch,&quot; said Cohen, who had a background in product design. &quot;And then, over the subsequent two or three years, we just continued to noodle on it. Nights and weekends, we both had other jobs.&quot;

In January, 2024, he said, Infinite Machines became their full-time job. He and his brother assembled a team and began moving from sketch to actual product.

&quot;So P1 is a plated, M-class vehicle,&quot; said Cohen, meaning drivers should be licensed for motorcycles unless they only use it in Mode 1, where speed is capped at 30 mph.

&quot;It goes 65 miles an hour, 60-mile range. The battery is in the floor. It fits two people. It has a full touchscreen – 8.5&quot; display – that has what we call Phone Connect. So it connects to your iPhone, you get Maps. Music, etc. It has whisper-quiet acceleration. It&#39;s kind of like riding a Tesla for the first time, but it&#39;s even more surreal because it&#39;s silent.&quot;

The P1, said Cohen, was designed from scratch. &quot;All of the componentry is custom-toolled and developed. That&#39;s not a trivial thing.&quot;

He pointed to the fender for example. It&#39;s not off the shelf.

&quot;We designed it,&quot; he said. &quot;We made the tooling. We made the molds, and made it so that the engineering works just because we actually care about the details.&quot;

It&#39;s an opinionated design. The use of anodized aluminum and steel makes comparisons with the Tesla Cybertruck unavoidable. But the DMC DeLorean is an equally apt comparison, perhaps more so given the challenging nature of startup vehicle companies.

&quot;We were inspired by the Cybertruck,&quot; said Cohen, &quot;but we didn&#39;t set out to design the Cybertruck of scooters. We used it as one reference point in a lineage of vehicles, like Marcelo Gandini and the Lancias back in the day. The Diablo, the Countach, the DeLorean, like these are all references that we love.&quot;

Cohen added that the plan is to explore future colors, and variants for specific markets like police and other first responders.

Your correspondent had the opportunity to take the P1 for a spin in San Francisco and it was a thrill – it&#39;s fun, fast, and handles well. I&#39;m not by nature a rider of scooters or motorcycles, though I&#39;ve enjoyed the lazy ease of electric bikes. Were I a younger man, more willing to mix it up among motorists without the protection of an automotive frame, airbags, and a seatbelt, I&#39;d be looking seriously at the P1 or the more modest Olto for urban transportation.

The P1 includes just the right number of physical buttons, with well-conceived software and hardware. It features secure storage, front and rear cameras, phone-based keyless access, and GPS location tracking, among other niceties. It relies on a Linux fork called IMOS, Infinite Machine OS.

Presently, there&#39;s no AI on-board – which this reporter considers a selling point. Cohen recounted how someone had asked the company&#39;s head of systems what AI is being explored. &quot;He kind of was like, &#39;Look, they&#39;re expensive, right? You put a Nvidia chip on here and you put a camera and it&#39;s expensive. It adds to the [bill-of-materials] cost. And it&#39;s not obvious that there is value there.&quot;

He added however that the company has ideas for ways AI might be useful to improve the safety of two-wheeled vehicles.

Software applications for the vehicles will be developed in time. Cohen said that Infinite Machine does gather data to understand how people are using its vehicles, but does so in a way that respects privacy.

&quot;So we don&#39;t know anything about the individual rider and we have anonymized everything,&quot; he said. &quot;We care about rider privacy. We also care about, like, you buy this vehicle, it&#39;s just gonna work. Like you don&#39;t have to pay a subscription ever. It&#39;s just gonna work all the time and it&#39;s your vehicle. But we do anonymize and track usage.&quot;

Cohen said he expects the target market in the US will be those who appreciate technology and design. &quot;They want something that&#39;s new and they want the best,&quot; he said.

&quot;In 2025, the ultimate luxury is really time and freedom to do what you want. And P1 saves you time. It&#39;s the fastest and best way to get around any city like in San Francisco, this thing is liberating. It&#39;s amazing. It handles the hills totally well. You can park it anywhere. You don&#39;t have to spend 30 minutes looking for a spot. You get to live life on your own terms.&quot;

Cohen expects the Olto will have broader appeal.

&quot;For Olto, I think it&#39;s for everyone,&quot; he said &quot;I think it&#39;s the mom in Brooklyn dropping her kids to school. I think it&#39;s the person that is single and wants to commute to work. I think it&#39;s the SoCal kid that&#39;s going to school. This is an accessible vehicle. It&#39;s very easy to ride, very approachable, and affordable.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Venezuelan gang described by US officials as &quot;a ruthless terrorist organization&quot; faces charges over alleged deployment of malware on ATMs across the country, illegally siphoning millions of dollars.

Two indictments were returned in Nebraska, collectively charging 54 alleged members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang in connection with a spate of ATM jackpotting attacks.

The gang allegedly deployed a variant of Ploutus malware on ATMs across the US. Court documents assert that TdA members would travel in groups and compromise ATMs managed by certain banks and credit unions.

The alleged gang members would inspect each ATM for external security features before opening the machine&#39;s door, checking for alarms being triggered or law enforcement rushing to the scene.

Once they confirmed a machine could be safely tampered with, the suspects would either remove the ATM&#39;s hard drive and install the Ploutus variant before reinstalling it, or in some cases simply replace the hard drive with one that already had Ploutus installed. Other instances saw the malware deployed using external thumb drives.

Thought to be first observed in Mexico back in 2013, Ploutus malware targets the cash-dispensing module of ATMs, allowing attackers to issue commands that force the machine to spurt out bills.

According to data shared by the Justice Department, ATM jackpotting attacks have seen more than $40 million stolen via physical device tampering and malware deployment since 2020. It did not share specific figures about how much of that could be attributed to TdA.

&quot;Tren de Aragua is not just a criminal gang; they are a ruthless terrorist organization that preys on communities, spreads fear, and bankrolls violence across borders,&quot; said Mark Zito, special agent in charge at HSI Kansas City.

&quot;HSI and our law enforcement partners will track you down, break up your networks, and ensure you never find safe harbor in the United States. Our mission is to protect American families from predators who think they can operate with impunity. We will not tolerate foreign terrorists stealing from our citizens and threatening our homeland. Our communities are safer today because of the relentless work of this team, and we are just getting started.&quot;

Across the various indictments against alleged TdA members in Nebraska over the past year are additional charges related to assault, money laundering, and sex trafficking of minors.

The announcement comes as the US announces a broader crackdown on the Venezuelan gang, with a slew of indictments across various states charging hundreds of alleged members since January.

The DOJ in Washington also unsealed indictments on Thursday related to other violent crimes committed by more than 70 alleged members, including murder, kidnapping, and drug trafficking.

Two of the group&#39;s suspected leaders were indicted in Colorado on various charges, including RICO offenses, while the alleged mastermind and co-leader of TdA, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, was charged in New York.

Flores remains at large, although there is a $5 million bounty on his head. The co-leader of TdA escaped from Venezuela&#39;s Tocorón prison in 2012, allegedly with the help of Jimena Romina Araya Navarro – another TdA leader – before being sent back in 2013.

Tocorón was notoriously lawless for years, but during the early 2000s, TdA began to assemble, and by the following decade, it assumed total control of the prison, infamously building amenities such as the Tokio nightclub, a zoo, a swimming pool, and more.

In 2023, Venezuelan authorities regained control of the facility in an operation that saw 11,000 officers storm the grounds, but Flores and his associates reportedly escaped days before.

In other states, New Mexico charged 11 alleged members over violent and armed crimes, and in Texas, more suspected high-ranking members and those in leadership roles were charged with cocaine trafficking, murder, and extortion.

The renewed focus on tackling TdA began in February when Attorney General Pamela Bondi expanded the remit of Joint Task Force Vulcan. Created in 2019, it was originally tasked with bringing down MS-13 gang members, but is now also responsible for handling TdA.

&quot;Immediately upon taking office, I directed the Department of Justice to fiercely pursue the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations,&quot; said Bondi.

&quot;This latest multi-state series of charges underscores the Trump Administration&#39;s unwavering commitment to restoring public safety, dismantling violent trafficking networks, and ridding our country of Tren de Aragua terrorists.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">﻿And really, is there more you could want from a game?

﻿And really, is there more you could want from a game?

One day, video game critics and journalists will put together a comprehensive study on the impact Balatro had on the industry — of how so many games that came after tried to capture its essence by adding complex systems to otherwise simple, easily understood games. Until then, I’m gonna play Dogpile.

Dogpile is a deckbuilding match-3 roguelike that builds on the style of merge games like Suika Game by adding a Balatro-like twist. The result is a cute, cozy (in both genre and vibe) game that appeals to both the numbers-go-up and the dog-loving sicko in me. Drop matching dogs on top of each other to create bigger dogs that reward you with points to unlock higher levels. The smallest unit of dog is a Chihuahua, two Chihuahuas merge to form a Pomeranian (at least that’s what I think it is), and so forth. The dogs pile up the playing field kinda like Tetris, and also like Tetris, if the dogs spill over the top of the field, it’s game over.

Merging dogs is the simplest part of the game. It’s where the player has the least control — everything is subject to the whims of gravity, physics, and trajectory — but also where Dogpile is the most thrilling. The dogs themselves are cute, contorted into fun, confounding shapes that sometimes show off a butthole or two. Introducing modifiers like making the dogs bouncy or magnetic adds an interesting physical component to the game — Dogpile is match-3 Tetris, yes, but built with a physics engine. It feels so silly, so “baby distracted by jangling keys” to say that a pug glomming onto another pug to make a dachshund is gameplay action worth highlighting in the year of our gaming lord 2025. But the little guy does so with a satisfying “pop” accompanied by a cute little “arf” that like Benoit Blanc, I’m compelled.

Though the game has nothing to do with poker, you can see the DNA of Balatro running throughout. Like Balatro, each round you’re dealt a hand from a deck of cards that have dogs as the different suits. Also like Balatro, you get money to spend on modifying your deck with more cards and tags that work similar to Balatro’s jokers. For $15 (of in-game money, there are no microtransactions), you can either buy a chow chow card or a tag that makes certain dogs spin in place to agitate the dog pile for more merging opportunities. When you win a round, you also visit the grooming salon where you modify your dog cards directly. You can give a dog positive traits like “friendly,” making them magnetically attracted to their matches. Or you can wash away negative traits like fleas, which negate any positive traits a card might have.

Building your dog deck full of synergies to increase your points is where Dogpile is the most like Balatro and where the bulk of your strategic thinking comes into play. I like to give my dogs the barking trait that makes them disturb the pile with a bark when they’re dropped. That combined with the tag that awards points every time a dog barks makes for a brain-pleasing display of meters filling up and cash register noises going off that really drives home the fact that a lot of these well-intentioned, celebrated Balatro-likes tap into the psychology of gambling addition to make them stick.

Dogpile doesn’t feel very deep. There are no boss challenges. Failing to meet the point threshold doesn’t end a run, but instead makes you pick from a stock of negative events or traits that are either easily ignored or so detrimental that you lose the game immediately. Unlike Balatro, Dogpile doesn’t inspire the same feeling of endless possibility of the kinds of decks you can build.

Dogpile isn’t the first game to complexify the humble match-3 genre, and I don’t know if its similarities to Balatro are intentional or not. But I like seeing how games can push Balatro’s formula beyond poker — especially if a dog is involved.

Even at $1,000, the Xbox Ally X handheld didn’t ship with magnetic drift-resistant joysticks, and neither did the $600 model. But for an extra $20 at Amazon, you can change that today — with officially Asus-approved and sanctioned TMR joysticks from Gulikit, the company that’s made a name for itself by supplying aftermarket drift-resistant sticks.

The company says it worked with Xbox Ally manufacturer Asus to create these sticks, that they’ll be “automatically recognized” when you swap them in, and that you can use the handheld’s built-in Armoury Crate app to calibrate them afterwards.

And while I haven’t tried these ones (I do have a pair in my Switch), I can confirm it’s pretty easy to pop open the Xbox Ally to install. Just loosen the Philips-head screws, poke in a guitar pick pry tool to create a small gap, and pull a little harder than you think you need to pop open the clips. The joystick modules are right underneath. There’s nothing blocking you — just pop a ribbon cable and undo their three screws.

Here’s the company’s walkthrough in case you want to see for yourself — though I do not recommend taking sharp tweezers to ribbon cables when your fingernails can do that job safer and easier. (I may have broken a few ribbon cables in my life.)

When we’re talking about TMR or the older and slightly less power-efficient Hall effect joystick technology, I usually write “drift-resistant” instead of “drift-free” because you may find your center point drifting over time — but the beauty of magnetic is you just have to recalibrate! Unlike the potentiometer joysticks that ship with Nintendo, Sony PlayStation, and Microsoft Xbox controllers, you’re not scraping away material that’ll lead to permanent drift as you use the magnetic versions.

Gulikit’s new Xbox Ally sticks are $20 in the US today, and should also be available in the UK for £20, and in Italy, France, and Spain for €22, this January.

            <div id="article-text">Low-cost indie titles took over co-op gaming this year, and they’re embracing their ‘slop’ label.

Low-cost indie titles took over co-op gaming this year, and they’re embracing their ‘slop’ label.

When a friend invited me to play a new game called REPO earlier this year, I thought I was wasting my money — not because the game looked bad, but because it looked like Lethal Company. The surprise-hit 2024 co-op survival horror game has players wander through unnerving ruined structures collecting trash while evading monsters. Lethal Company was popular with my friends (and just about everyone else), but its eerie liminal spaces spooked me too much. My friends swore REPO was different, though, that it was so funny it was hard to be scared, especially with its goofy robot avatars — and they were right.

REPO has become one of my favorite games, and was one of the biggest co-op titles of 2025, along with similar indie co-op hit Peak. Over the past several months, the two titles have become the faces of a new niche of games with a somewhat controversial name: “friend slop.”

The term usually refers to indie co-op games that are best experienced with friends and have an emphasis on humor. They’re typically PC games, cost less than $20, include proximity voice chat, feature wacky game physics, and often fall into the survival horror genre. Friend slop isn’t always scary, though. Some lighthearted flavors of “slop” popped up this year, like Peak, where you attempt to scale increasingly perilous mountains with your friends.

That’s just the tip — or rather, peak — of the friend slop iceberg. There’s also Guilty as Sock!, where you and your co-op buddies roleplay court showdowns as sock puppets. Lockdown Protocol takes inspiration from Among Us, a precursor to the friend slop trend, where one player attempts to sabotage their friends as they complete chores on a timer in a lonely base. Mage Arena is one of the cheapest friend slop games to arrive this year at just $2.99. It’s also one of the most unique — you compete in magic duels with your friends by verbally shouting spells.

Friend slop games tend to follow a similar formula: You and your friends need to accomplish something together, but the consequences for failure aren’t particularly intense (and it’s often funnier if you don’t succeed). Peak is a perfect example. I have yet to survive to the end of a run, and yet I keep playing. Winning Peak is great, but the most entertaining part is watching your friends miss a jump and fall off a mountain, eat poisonous food, or get chased down by the scoutmaster for running ahead.

In friend slop, the main objective is humor. Winning is secondary. If you’re hoping for a deep, nuanced plot, you’ll probably be disappointed. Friend slop games also tend to lose their charm when you’re playing solo. REPO just isn’t the same when there’s no one there to laugh every time you clumsily shatter a vase.

Therein lies one of the major criticisms of the genre and one of the reasons it’s been labeled “slop” to begin with. While REPO and Peak have been hugely popular this year, some say they’re just designed for viral, clippable moments and lack substance beyond that, partly because they’re not usually fun to play solo.

That could be a fair drawback depending on what you expect from these games. However, it misses the point of “friend slop” and overlooks a potential explanation for their popularity this year.

Elden Ring Nightreign was also one of 2025’s biggest co-op games, and I’ve had a great time with it as well. However, it offers something completely different from REPO or Peak and feels drastically different to play, despite technically being under the same broad co-op umbrella. Nightreign requires concentration, skill, and strategy, whereas REPO mostly just requires you to keep an eye out for monsters while absentmindedly picking up junk. It’s also a much more affordable game than Nightreign and doesn’t hinge on any prior knowledge of other games.

That difference highlights one of friend slop’s greatest strengths. For all their arguable faults, friend slop games are approachable. They ask little of you — both in terms of money and time. You don’t even need a particularly powerful PC. These games are a way for people to hang out with friends for little money and laugh with each other. To some, myself included, that’s worth just as much as a rich story or dramatic boss fights.

This year, we’ve seen the prices of games soar, and gaming PC hardware is becoming unaffordable for many. Almost everything about the hobby has become more expensive. Friend slop games offer an oasis from that with low prices and low hardware requirements, staying accessible to a large swath of gamers, even more so because they’re typically easy to learn how to play. The very things that led some people to call these games “slop” are also part of what has made them so popular in 2025 in particular.

Paige Wilson, community manager at Peak publisher Aggro Crab, echoed that sentiment. “We actually think friend slop is a fire term,” they told The Verge. “Sure, it started with the intention of [having] a negative connotation, but I think we always saw the term as funny and actually pretty accurate. It’s used to describe a low-cost game that you and your friends can pick up whenever, have some fun, hang out, and expect a bit of jank. I think some people might not view it as this, but we do!”

In other words, friend slop isn’t so much about the game as it is about the people you play it with. If that’s “slop,” then I’ll gladly embrace the “friend slop” label, too.

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <h2>China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to deal with their aging batteries.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/18/1130148/china-ev-battery-recycle/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
