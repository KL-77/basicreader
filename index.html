            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Browser extensions with more than 8 million installs are harvesting complete and extended conversations from users’ AI conversations and selling them for marketing purposes, according to data collected from the Google and Microsoft pages hosting them.

Security firm Koi discovered the eight extensions, which as of late Tuesday night remained available in both Google’s and Microsoft’s extension stores. Seven of them carry “Featured” badges, which are endorsements meant to signal that the companies have determined the extensions meet their quality standards. The free extensions provide functions such as VPN routing to safeguard online privacy and ad blocking for ad-free browsing. All provide assurances that user data remains anonymous and isn’t shared for purposes other than their described use.

An examination of the extensions’ underlying code tells a much more complicated story. Each contains eight of what Koi calls “executor” scripts, with each being unique for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and five other leading AI chat platforms. The scripts are injected into webpages anytime the user visits one of these platforms. From there, the scripts override browsers’ built-in functions for making network requests and receiving responses.

As a result, all interaction between the browser and the AI bots is routed not by the legitimate browser APIs—in this case fetch() and HttpRequest—but through the executor script. The extensions eventually compress the data and send it to endpoints belonging to the extension maker.

“By overriding the [browser APIs], the extension inserts itself into that flow and captures a copy of everything before the page even displays it,” Koi CTO Idan Dardikman wrote in an email. “The consequence: The extension sees your complete conversation in raw form—your prompts, the AI’s responses, timestamps, everything—and sends a copy to their servers.”

Besides ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, the extensions harvest all conversations from Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok, and Meta AI. Koi said the full description of the data captured includes:

The executor script runs independently from the VPN networking, ad blocking, or other core functionality. That means that even when a user toggles off VPN networking, AI protection, ad blocking, or other functions, the conversation collection continues. The only way to stop the harvesting is to disable the extension in the browser settings or to uninstall it.

Koi said it first discovered the conversation harvesting in Urban VPN Proxy, a VPN routing extension that lists “AI protection” as one of its benefits. The data collection began in early July with the release of version 5.5.0.

“Anyone who used ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or the other targeted platforms while Urban VPN was installed after July 9, 2025 should assume those conversations are now on Urban VPN’s servers and have been shared with third parties,” the company said. “Medical questions, financial details, proprietary code, personal dilemmas—all of it, sold for ‘marketing analytics purposes.&#39;”

Following that discovery, the security firm uncovered seven additional extensions with identical AI harvesting functionality. Four of the extensions are available in the Chrome Web Store. The other four are on the Edge add-ons page. Collectively, they have been installed more than 8 million times.

The extensions come with conflicting messages about how they handle bot conversations, which often contain deeply personal information about users’ physical and mental health, finances, personal relationships, and other sensitive information that could be a gold mine for marketers and data brokers. The Urban VPN Proxy in the Chrome Web Store, for instance, lists “AI protection” as a benefit. It goes on to say:

Our VPN provides added security features to help shield your browsing experience from phishing attempts, malware, intrusive ads and AI protection which checks prompts for personal data (like an email or phone number), checks AI chat responses for suspicious or unsafe links and displays a warning before click or submit your prompt.

On the privacy policy for the extension, Google says the developer has declared that user data isn’t sold to third parties outside of approved use cases and won’t be “used or transferred for purposes that are unrelated to the item’s core functionality.” The page goes on to list the personal data handled as location, web history, and website content.

Koi said that a consent prompt that the extensions display during setup notifies the user that they process “ChatAI communication,” “pages you visit,” and “security signals.” The notification goes on to say that the data is processed to “provide these protections,” which presumably means the core functions such as VPN routing or ad blocking.

The only explicit mention of AI conversations being harvested is in legalese buried in the privacy policy, such as this 6,000-word one for Urban VPN Proxy, posted on each extension website. There, it says that the extension will “collect the prompts and outputs queried by the End-User or generated by the AI chat provider, as applicable.” It goes on to say that the extension developer will “disclose the AI prompts for marketing analytics purposes.”

All eight extensions and the privacy policies covering them are developed and written by Urban Cyber Security, a company that says its apps and extensions are used by 100 million people. The policies say the extensions share “Web Browsing Data” with “our affiliated company,” which is listed as both BiScience and B.I Science. The affiliated company “uses this raw data and creates insights which are commercially used and shared with Business Partners.” The policy goes on to refer users to the BiScience privacy policy. BiScience, whose privacy practices have been scrutinized before, says its services “transform enormous volumes of digital signals into clear, actionable market intelligence.”

It’s hard to fathom how both Google and Microsoft would allow such extensions onto their platforms at all, let alone go out of their way to endorse seven of them with a featured badge. Neither company returned emails asking how they decide which extensions qualify for such a distinction, if they have plans to stop making them available to Chrome and Edge users, or why the privacy policies are so unclear to normal users.

Messages sent to both individual extension developers and Urban Cyber Security went unanswered. BiScience provides no email. A call to the company’s New York office was answered by someone who said they were in Israel and to call back during normal business hours in that country.

Koi’s discovery is the latest cautionary tale illustrating the growing perils of being online. It’s questionable in the first place whether people should trust their most intimate secrets and sensitive business information to AI chatbots, which come with no HIPAA assurances, attorney-client privilege, or expectations of privacy. Yet increasingly, that’s exactly what AI companies are encouraging, and users, it seems, are more than willing to comply.

Compounding the risk is the rush to install free apps and extensions—particularly those from little-known developers and providing at best minimal benefits—on devices storing and transmitting these chats. Taken together, they’re a recipe for disaster, and that’s exactly what we have here.</div>

            <h2>Electric vehicles cause tension in the automotive aftermarket</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/how-is-ev-technology-being-accepted-by-the-aftermarket/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After federal clean vehicle tax credits ended in September, the electric vehicle industry reached a crossroads. Well, technically, it has been there since Trump took office. This is a weird period in automotive history; A chunk of the industry is full-steam ahead with EV development, another is cutting back, and the consumer is left wondering what the electrification landscape will look like next year, let alone in three, during the next administration.

But what about the automotive aftermarket? Typically, this corner benefits from whatever progress is made on the OEM front—have Trump’s policies expanded or contracted its EV technological development? I recently spent some time chatting with personnel of the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) at its yearly tradeshow in Las Vegas to find out. I also hit the bricks (or, rather, bright carpeting) of the massive show itself, seeking out some new, unique developments in the space that behoove EV tech’s inherent benefits.

Above one of the show’s several sprawling halls, I met with Mike Spagnola, SEMA’s CEO, and Karen Bailey-Chapman, senior vice president, public and government affairs, to learn what the organization’s official stance is. First and foremost: It doesn’t want to be told what to do.

“Thirty-three percent of our industry would’ve been wiped out had EV mandates continued,” Bailey-Chapman said, referring to future federal fuel efficiency regulations that would have required automakers to sell many more EVs to avoid punishing fines. Those efficiency targets were just ripped up by the Trump administration.

“The reality is that we embrace EVs, we embrace all technologies. If it moves on wheels, we’re good… but what we are against is that we have to choose this, and that’s it,” she said.

She claimed that over the past couple of years, SEMA has become more political than ever before, advocating heavily for what it finds to be the best way forward for its members. Part of that includes limiting the power of the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which was given the power to regulate California’s air quality after decades of smog affected the Los Angeles basin.

“We’re not against EVs; we just think that all technology should move forward,” Spagnola added. “We’re environmentally respectful—we do a lot of work with CARB and the EPA—but we think technology should move forward, and you should have a choice of what you drive.” Indeed, SEMA has an emissions lab in Diamond Bar, California, to help its member companies create a wide range of products that meet stringent CARB-level requirements.

On one hand, not giving American consumers the choice is counter to how our economy functions, and it limits technological progress. If there are benefits to be found, they typically are found no matter what, especially in the name of horsepower, chassis development, and so on. But on the other hand, stricter guidelines also breed innovation. Increasing emissions and fuel economy standards have gotten us to a level of internal combustion technology that we could have only dreamed of 30 years ago. Who’s to say the same wouldn’t happen with stricter requirements for electrification?

After speaking with Spagnola and Bailey-Chapman, I ventured over to SEMA’s FutureTech Studio, where a handful of EV-centric companies were highlighted. Two immediately piqued my interest.

The first was Sierra, a company that specializes in customizable single-seater off-road chassis, including its assemble-it-yourself Echo, which uses an EV powertrain. The benefits of an EV powertrain are immediately noticeable in its packaging. The motor and battery sit far inboard from the rear axle, and due to their compact overall combined dimension, give it small dimensions that would be hard to match with any engine, transmission, and fuel tank.

But the real benefits are found elsewhere. “The biggest thing is torque application,” a company representative told me. “When you’re in off-road racing, going through whoops [and other trail features], I can get all the torque out of that motor instantaneously.” He also highlighted that there are just four moving parts instead of around 400 in an internal combustion-powered rig, so durability is less of a concern. To keep temperatures in check, it sports an active cooling system that flows glycol through the motor and high-velocity fans for the electronics. The application is intended for short-course desert racing that’s less than 200 miles (321 km), in addition to just going for a rip in the dirt.

The next company made me reminisce about my freshman-year science class in the early ’00s, when I first learned that EVs could one day have skateboard chassis. Meaning, there would be a basic chassis that you could swap different bodies between. Elkington Motors of Provo, Utah, follows a similar concept: bolt a classic muscle car (particularly any gen-one Ford Mustang) or truck body onto a ready-to-go chassis.

The specs are appealing: 90 kWh battery, 508 hp (379 kW), 2,212 lb-ft (3,000 Nm), all-wheel drive, and around 220 miles (354 km) of range. All chassis, suspension, and accompanying electronics to make it work are part of the build. Even in the sea of shoulder-to-shoulder attendees, it was apparent how well-thought-out and beneficial this sort of EV conversion could be, especially to the intrepid DIYer.

Has aftermarket EV tech and development stalled in the wake of increased fuel efficiency and other clean vehicle regulations being off the table? It may be that all the advancements over the past decade have matured enough for the sector to take the basic concepts and run. The benefits are apparent (packaging, output potential, chassis engineering, fascinating traction control tuning, etc.), and there’s clearly enough work still being done to create some new and exciting developments.

But I also can’t help but think that progress may be slowed, at least here in the US. Less investment on the OEM side means less for the technologically talented among us to say “I can do that better,” a cornerstone of the aftermarket industry. Remember when turbocharging took F1 by storm in the ’70s and ’80s? It not only helped form the basis of what forced induction is today, but it also made for one of the series’ most fascinating eras. It would be a shame if we miss out on that on the EV front.</div>

            <h2>Twitter comeback bid draws lawsuit from Elon Musk’s X Corp</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/twitter-comeback-bid-draws-lawsuit-from-elon-musks-x-corp/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday, X Corporation, formerly known as Twitter, sued “Operation Bluebird,” the new startup that is seeking to reclaim the allegedly abandoned Twitter trademark and relaunch a new social media network under that name.

In its 43-page lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Delaware, X Corporation alleges trademark infringement, adding that despite Bluebird’s “purported plan, it cannot bring Twitter ‘back’—Twitter never left and continues to be exclusively owned by X Corp.”

One of Bluebird’s leaders, Michael Peroff, told Ars in an email that Operation Bluebird was “fully expecting” a lawsuit from X Corporation and that “we planned for it.”

Stephen Coates, also of Operation Bluebird (and who formerly served as Twitter’s general counsel), reiterated to Ars that X “legally abandoned the TWITTER mark.”

“Our cancellation petition is based on well-established trademark law and we believe we will be successful,” he wrote in an emailed statement. “They said goodbye. We say hello.”

Neither X Corporation, nor its attorneys, nor CEO Elon Musk, immediately responded to Ars’ request for comment.

“Twitter is one of the world’s most recognized brands, and it belongs to X Corp,” X Corp’s lawsuit continues. “Simply put, a rebrand is not an abandonment of trademark rights.”

Josh Gerben, a Washington, DC-based trademark attorney who has been closely following this case, told Ars that proving that X Corporation has “abandoned” the trademark is a “huge uphill battle—they’re going to have to climb the equivalent of Mt. Everest.”

Operation Bluebird would also have to overcome the “residual goodwill”—the broad-scale brand recognition that most people still associate the name and brand “Twitter” with the X Corporation.

“It’s not like there’s been a trademark case like this before,” Gerben added, noting the rarity of a situation where a company so strongly dissociated itself from such a strong brand.

As Ars previously reported, Musk bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion. He eventually changed the company name and brand identity from Twitter to X. That decision, Operation Bluebird says, created an opening for the Twitter name to be formally abandoned.

In July 2023, Musk himself tweeted that “we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand, and gradually, all the birds.”

That was when Peroff, a Chicago-area attorney specializing in trademark and IP law, saw an opportunity not only to claim the name Twitter but also to use the iconic illustrated logo that was affectionately referred to internally as “Larry Bird.”

Peroff and others began formally organizing Operation Bluebird, a way to bring back Twitter in name, services, and format, catering in particular to commercial brands.

“There certainly are alternatives,” Peroff said last week. “I don’t know that any of them at this point in time are at the scale that would make a difference in the national conversation, whereas a new Twitter really could.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">Lauded theoretical physicist and director of the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center Nuno Loureiro has been murdered at the age of 47.

The professor was shot “multiple times” at this home in Brookline, Massachusetts, according to officials, and died on Tuesday morning in the hospital.

The Norfolk County District Attorney’s Office has since said that the incident is being treated as an “active and ongoing homicide investigation.”

It’s a baffling incident, with no motive in sight — and no clue as to whether the homicide was in any way related to Loureiro’s illustrious career in the fusion energy field.

For decades, scientists have attempted to harness the energy released by fusing atoms inside highly complex reactors, a green and potentially safer alternative to nuclear fission. Scientists are only beginning to crack the point at which fusion plants generate more energy than they require to operate, and plenty of questions remain about our ability to scale up these operations — despite enormous interest from the private sector and major investments from the likes of Amazon cofounder Jeff Bezos and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

Loureiro was known for his award-winning fusion science research, studying the motion of charged particles in the presence of an external magnetic field.

His research “helped inform the design of fusion devices that could harness the energy of fusing plasmas, bringing the dream of clean, near-limitless fusion power closer to reality,” according to an MIT obituary.

Loureiro was convinced that “we are really progressing towards finally having electricity from fusion,” plasma physicist Bruno Soares Gonçalves told Nature.

MIT head of the department of physics Deepto Chakrabarty described him as a “wonderful and engaging colleague, and an inspiring and caring mentor for graduate students working in plasma science.”

“His recent work on quantum computing algorithms for plasma physics simulations was a particularly exciting new scientific direction,” Chakrabarty added.

As we await more news about ongoing investigations into Loureiro’s death, users on social media immediately spun up the rumor mill. Many proposed it had to do with his unusual career.

“I wonder which 3-letter agency did it?” one user speculated.

“It is so obvious what THEY are doing,” another user argued, conspiratorially. “But there will be zero outrage. Zero coverage. This will get swept under the rug just like THEY do to every other cure.”

As we await word from officials and law enforcement, one thing is clear: Loureiro will be sorely missed. He leaves behind a wife and three young children.

“Nuno was not only an extraordinary scientist and educator, but also a tremendous colleague, mentor, and friend who cared deeply about his students and his community,” head of the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT, Benoit Forget, told MIT Tech News in an email. “His absence will be felt profoundly across [Nuclear Science & Engineering] and far beyond.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Joe Rogan absolutely loves AI-generated music.

For the past few months, the podcaster has been drooling like a pig at its slop trough over AI-generated covers of the rapper 50 Cent, finding literally any excuse to play them for his guests, including such luminaries as Carrot Top and Andrew Schulz. It’s gotten so out of his hand that his some of his fans have started fuming about how he keeps bring the AI covers up.

“You gotta hear this,” Rogan said on one occasion. “It’s f*cking good dude,” he said on another. It’s the kind of enthusiastic endorsement you might hear from a friend who’s showing you a “super underrated” band that “nobody knows about” yet, but Rogan is giving it for AI slop.

Most of the time, the guests nod along or even share some of Rogan’s enthusiasm, but not all of them.

When Rogan tried to broach AI music with actress Katee Sackhoff during an interview in October, he got a little pushback — and his reaction during the exchange, which recently made rounds online, was telling.

First, Rogan half jokingly suggested that AI could make better music than humans, and Sackhoff wasn’t having any of it.

“Stop it. It will never be better if AI makes the music,” the “Battlestar Galactica” and “Longmire” actress said. “You just broke my soul.”

“AI is making some really good music,” Rogan wheedled.

Sackhoff grinned. “It’s also making some great podcasts,” she countered.

Rogan’s rambling stopped dead in its tracks.

“I —” he stuttered. “I don’t know about that,” he said, suddenly sounding very skeptical of AI tech, before abruptly changing the topic.

for those that wanted to see the clip of him being genuinely annoyed at the suggestion ai podcasts are good after he spends time glazing ai music lol https://t.co/dZboaXiK1i pic.twitter.com/3VKNF4gNvj

Such is the hypocrisy of your average AI bro. It’s all fun and games watching the tech plunder the arts and put people out of jobs — until it threatens to replace you, apparently.

Rogan was not to be deterred, however. He later had Sackhoff to listen to one of his favorite songs: an AI’s take on what a “soul cover” of 50 Cent’s track “What Up Gangsta” would sound like. According to Rogan, the AI version turned out “better than the original.”

Sackhoff, although impressed by the tech, wasn’t so sure. “I would so much rather see that in person,” she said, adding that the AI cover “robbed” the rapper of the opportunity to make a track in a similar style.

“I know what you’re saying, but this is my point. My point is that it tricks me and I know the trick,” Rogan replied. “I know it’s a trick, and I don’t care.”

Rogan, in sum, is admitting to being self-aware enough to know that he’s getting served soulless slop, but doesn’t have standards high enough to preclude him from enjoying it anyway.

This wasn’t the only time a guest roasted him for his hard-on for AI parody tunes. He also brought up the “What Up Gangsta” cover with former professor of evolutionary biology turned podcaster Bret Weinstein in an episode last month, but didn’t get very far.

“That’s fucking good,” Rogan said of the AI song.

“It depends what you mean by good,” Weinstein replied, grimacing.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Retatrutide, a new weight loss from Eli Lilly, isn’t even out yet. For tht matter, it hasn’t even finished human clinical trials. But it’s already garnered a cult-like following, Wired reports, with adherents swearing by its miraculous benefits.

Lilly’s drug works similarly to semaglutide, which is sold by Novo Nordisk under the brand names Ozempic and Wegovy. It mimics a gut hormone responsible which binds to the GLP-1 receptor for regulating blood sugar levels and your perception of hunger, in effect suppressing your appetite.

But retatrutide is no mere GLP-1 agonist, as semaglutide and others like it are known. It’s being hailed as a first-of-its-kind “Triple G” drug because it targets the GLP-1 receptor, the GIP receptor, and the GCG receptor.

“With the three together… you can actually make a single molecule, like a master key, that opens multiple doors as effectively as [individual] keys, and achieve superior outcomes,” Richard DiMarchi, a chemist and chair in biomolecular sciences at Indiana University, told Wired.

In a phase II trial, obese participants who were administered retatrutide lost an average of 24.2 percent of their body weight over a 48-week period, Wired noted, which is more than what other drugs have achieved in nearly twice the amount of time.

Though it’s yet to hit the mainstream, it’s been a hit with so-called “grey market pharmacies” that sell unapproved drugs under the guise that they’re only for “research purposes.” Such pharmacies can be a vital pipeline of hormones and other compounds for trans and non-binary people seeking gender-affirming care, providing affordable alternatives to what you’d get through your health insurance, but they’re also an outlet of drugs with questions about their efficacy and safety, like anabolic steroids and human growth hormone.

After trying retatrutide for himself, one man, 48-year-old Jake Terry, has launched an entire business that sources “research chemicals” from Chinese and other overseas manufacturers to peddle them to daring consumers. Terry’s pharmacy, and others like it, send the drug as a powder, leaving customers to follow instructions to mix and put it in a syringe themselves. It may sound a little jerry-rigged and prone to error, but its takers swear by its results.

“I was 53 with the dad-bod gut,” Terry’s business partner who chose to remain anonymous told Wired. “This is the first time in my life I’ve actually seen my abs. And I’ve changed nothing, other than retatrutide. I don’t exercise more. I don’t do anything other than take the shot once a week.”

Another man who goes by Craig took retatrutide through an official Eli Lilly trial and lost up to 80 pounds. “Because I can’t eat as much, I have a better relationship with food,” he told the magazine. “I have more mental space to do other things instead of just thinking about, like, when I’m going to eat again.”

It hasn’t worked out well for everyone. 50-year-old fitness YouTuber Adrian Cook said he took retatrutide because he had a “negative association with eating,” and that the “pitch for reta is it just puts that stuff on autopilot.” As a result, “you don’t have to deal with cravings, or the feeling of desperation you get from always being hungry,” he told the magazine.

Crook lost 25 pounds in seven weeks, but stopped because of extreme nausea, though his circumstances are very specific: he was taking a proton pump inhibitor to manage acid reflux he got after taking anabolic steroids.

Lilly spokesperson Niki Biro cautioned that “retatrutide is an investigational molecule that is legally available only to participants in Lilly’s clinical trials. Anyone purporting to sell retatrutide for human use is breaking the law, and no one should consider taking anything claiming to be retatrutide outside of a Lilly-sponsored clinical trial.”

            <h2>Radiant Nuclear raises $300M for its semi-sized 1 MW reactor</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/radiant-nuclear-raises-300m-for-its-semi-sized-1-mw-reactor/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Another day, another nine-figure round for a nuclear startup.

Radiant Nuclear said today that it has raised more than $300 million, just one day after Last Energy said it had raised $100 million. Three weeks ago, X-energy raised $700 million, and in August, Aalo Atomics raised $100 million. Heck, Radiant itself raised $165 million just six months ago.

Given the string of investments, it seems reasonable to ask whether the nuclear world is in a bubble. Investment in the technology has tracked closely with the data center boom. AI requires tremendous amounts of electricity, and tech companies and data center developers have been rushing to secure supplies from sources ranging from nuclear fission to supersonic jet engines.

As long as tech companies’ power demands continue to grow, interest in nuclear is likely to remain strong. But there might be a winnowing of the field in the next year or two if startups don’t deliver on their promises, many of which revolve around starting their first reactor next year.

Some startups might be able to buy some time after that. First-of-a-kind reactors can be built by hand, but many nuclear startups are predicated on the idea that mass manufacturing will make fission cost-competitive. They might succeed at reaching criticality but stumble when they try to replicate their designs.

None of this is to say that Radiant will fall into that category; it may very well succeed. Rather, the company just happens to be the latest in a long list of nuclear startups that have announced eye-popping fundraises in the last few months. Anytime a market gets that frothy, the B-word is bound to pop up.

The new round was led by Draper Associates and Boost VC with participation from Ark Venture Fund, Chevron Technology Ventures, Friends and Family Capital, Founders Fund, and others. It values Radiant at more than $1.8 billion. Previous investors include Andreessen Horowitz, DCVC, Giant Ventures, and Union Square Ventures.

Radiant is developing a microreactor capable of generating 1 megawatt of electricity that can be delivered via semi. It will be cooled by helium and will have enough TRISO fuel — carbon — and ceramic-coated beads of graphite and uranium that are designed to be more resistant to meltdowns — to last five months between refueling.

The startup is aiming to replace diesel generators at commercial and military sites. Customers will be able to buy the units outright or subscribe to a power purchase agreement. When the reactor’s 20-year lifetime is up, the company will haul it away.

Like many nuclear startups, Radiant is targeting data centers as some of its first customers. The company signed a deal with data center developer Equinix in August to supply 20 of its reactors.

First, Radiant is building a demonstration reactor at the Idaho National Lab, which it hopes to begin testing in the summer of 2026. Many nuclear startups are on a similar timeline, one set by the Trump administration’s goal of three reactors achieving criticality — the moment when a nuclear reaction is self-sustaining — by July 4, 2026.

Radiant is one of 11 companies selected for that program, which doesn’t provide government grants or loans but instead speeds approval timelines.

            <h2>Google launches Gemini 3 Flash, makes it the default model in the Gemini app</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/google-launches-gemini-3-flash-makes-it-the-default-model-in-the-gemini-app/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google today released its fast and cheap Gemini 3 Flash model, based on the Gemini 3 released last month, looking to steal OpenAI’s thunder. The company is also making this the default model in the Gemini app and AI mode in search.

The new Flash model arrives six months after Google announced the Gemini 2.5 Flash model, offering significant improvements. On the benchmark, the Gemini 3 Flash model outperforms its predecessor by a significant margin and matches the performance of other frontier models, like Gemini 3 Pro and GPT 5.2, in some measures.

For instance, it scored 33.7% without tool use on Humanity’s Last Exam benchmark, which is designed to test expertise across different domains. In comparison, Gemini 3 Pro scored 37.5%, Gemini 2.5 Flash scored 11%, and the newly released GPT-5.2 scored 34.5%.

On the multimodality and reasoning benchmark MMMU-Pro, the new model outscored all competitors with an 81.2% score.

Google is making Gemini 3 Flash the default model in the Gemini app globally, replacing Gemini 2.5 Flash. Users can still choose the Pro model from the model picker for math and coding questions.

The company says the new model is good at identifying multimodal content and giving you an answer based on that. For instance, you can upload your pickleball short video and ask for tips; you can try drawing a sketch and have the model guess what you are drawing; or you can upload an audio recording to get analysis or generate a quiz.

The company also said the model better understands the intent of users’ queries and can generate more visual answers with elements like images and tables.

You can also use the new model to create app prototypes in the Gemini app using prompts.

The Gemini 3 Pro is now available to everyone in the U.S for search and more people in the U.S. can access the Nano Banana Pro image model in search, as well.

Google noted that companies like JetBrains, Figma, Cursor, Harvey, and Latitude are already using the Gemini 3 Flash model, which is available through Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise.

For developers, the company is making the model available in a preview model through the API and in Antigravity, Google’s new coding tool released last month.

The company said the Gemini 3 Pro scores 78% on the SWE-bench verified coding benchmark, only outperformed by GPT-5.2. It added that the model is ideal for video analysis, data extraction, and visual Q&A, and because of its speed, it is suited for quick and repeatable workflows.

Model pricing is $0.50 per 1 million input tokens and $3.00 per 1 million output tokens. This is slightly more expensive than $0.30 per 1 million input tokens and $2.50 per 1 million output tokens of Gemini Flash 2.5. But Google claims that the new model outperforms the Gemini 2.5 Pro model while being three times faster. And, for thinking tasks, it uses 30% fewer tokens on average than 2.5 Pro. That means overall, you might save on the number of tokens for certain tasks.

“We really position flash as more of your workhorse model. So if you look at, for example, even the input and output prices at the top of this table, Flash is just a much cheaper offering from an input and output price perspective. And so it actually allows for, for many companies, bulk tasks,” Tulsee Doshi, Senior Director & Head of Product for Gemini Models, told TechCrunch in a briefing

Since it released Gemini 3, Google has processed over 1 trillion tokens per day on its API, amid its fierce release and performance war with OpenAI.

Earlier this month, Sam Altman reportedly sent an internal “Code Red” memo to the OpenAI team after ChatGPT’s traffic dipped as Google’s market share in consumers rose. Post that, OpenAI has released GPT-5.2 and a new image generation model. OpenAI also boasted about its growing enterprise use and said the ChatGPT messages volume has grown 8x since November 2024.

While Google didn’t directly address the competition with OpenAI, it said that the release of new models is challenging all companies to be active.

“Just about what’s happening across the industry is like all of these models are continuing to be awesome, challenge each other, push the frontier. And I think what’s also awesome is as companies are releasing these models,” Doshi said.

“We’re also introducing new benchmarks and new ways of evaluating these models. And so that’s also encouraging us.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">​Coursera and Udemy announced on Wednesday a landmark merger agreement valued at approximately $2.5 billion, bringing together two of the biggest names in online learning.

Coursera will acquire Udemy in an all-stock transaction, marking a pivotal moment in online education. The companies said the merger will be finalized in the second half of next year, pending regulatory review and shareholder approval.

​This agreement comes at a challenging time for both Udemy and Coursera, as each faces market headwinds. Despite both companies posting revenue growth in the third quarter of 2025, their share prices declined, underscoring investors’ lack of confidence in the platforms.

As a combined company, Udemy and Coursera aimed to reassure shareholders, suggesting that the combined strengths of both platforms could deliver both immediate returns as well as long-term growth potential.

“Through this combination with Coursera, we will create meaningful benefits for our learners, enterprise customers, and instructors, while delivering significant value to our shareholders, who will participate in the substantial upside potential of the combined company,” Udemy CEO Hugo Sarrazin said in a statement.

​Additionally, as the online learning market continues to expand—particularly with the adoption of AI—Sarrazin said the merger will accelerate plans to introduce AI-powered products.

​Coursera recently announced an integration with OpenAI’s ChatGPT app ecosystem and a content partnership with Anthropic. Wednesday’s announcement also comes just two days after Udemy rolled out its new “AI-powered microlearning experience,” which aims to give students shorter, personalized lessons that fit their busy schedules.

​The companies also believe the merger will better position them to address how AI is transforming the workplace, as AI literacy becomes a requirement for many employees. Job postings requiring AI skills have surged in the past few years, and according to one survey, one in three hiring managers wouldn’t consider candidates without them.

“We’re at a pivotal moment in which AI is rapidly redefining the skills required for every job across every industry. Organizations and individuals around the world need a platform that is as agile as the new and emerging skills learners must master,” added Coursera CEO Greg Hart.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Donald Trump nominated Jay Bhattacharya to be the director of the National Institutes of Health, a shake-up seemed inevitable. Typically, the agency—a $48 billion grant-making institution and the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research—has been led by a medical researcher with extensive administrative experience. Bhattacharya was a health economist without specialized training in infectious disease, who’d come to prominence for his heterodox views on COVID policies and who has criticized the NIH for stifling dissent.

The NIH has been transformed this year. And most of the layoffs, policy changes, and politically motivated funding cuts—notably, to infectious-disease research—have happened under Bhattacharya’s watch. But inside the agency, officials describe Bhattacharya as a largely ineffectual figurehead, often absent from leadership meetings, unresponsive to colleagues, and fixated more on cultivating his media image than on engaging with the turmoil at his own agency. “We don’t really hear from or about Jay very much,” one official told me. (Most of the current and former NIH officials who spoke with me for this article requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation.) Many officials call Bhattacharya “Podcast Jay” because of the amount of time that he has spent in his office recording himself talking. “Bhattacharya is too busy podcasting to do anything,” one official told me.

Instead, Matthew Memoli, the agency’s principal deputy director, “is the one wielding the axe,”the official said. This time last year, Memoli was a relatively low-ranking flu researcher at the NIH&#39;s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Then, in January, the Trump administration appointed him to be the agency&#39;s acting director. At the time, other NIH officials considered Memoli to be a placeholder, temporarily empowered to carry out the administration’s orders. But “there’s been no change since Jay got put in,” one NIH official told me. To the agency officials I spoke with, Memoli, now second in command, still looks to be very much in charge.

Neither Bhattacharya nor Memoli agreed to an interview, and the NIH did not respond to a request for comment. So to better understand their leadership, I spoke with 18 current and former NIH officials, whose positions at the agency have spanned a breadth of specialties and administrative roles, and reached out to several of Bhattacharya’s former colleagues. The officials’ first impressions of Bhattacharya—who has argued that the NIH could do more “to promote innovative science”—were of an outsider and a radical, whose ideas could have changed the agency for better or worse. In recent months, NIH officials have come to see him as so disengaged that they hardly worry about his impact. Memoli, by contrast, knows just enough about the agency—and, in particular, its approach to infectious disease—to help destroy it.

Memoli’s appointment to acting director in January floored his colleagues—many of whom had never heard his name before. Like Bhattacharya, Memoli had no previous track record of executive leadership or in overseeing the awarding of federal grants. But officials quickly deduced what about Memoli might have appealed to the administration: In 2021, he described COVID-vaccine mandates as “extraordinarily problematic” in an email to Anthony Fauci, then the director of NIAID, whom the Trump administration has repeatedly tried to discredit. Then, last year, when asked to submit a routine statement about diversity, equity, and inclusion, Memoli sent in one that called the term DEI “offensive and demeaning.” By September, the NIH, under Bhattacharya’s leadership, had done away with DEI statements for its scientists, describing them as “loyalty oaths” that Memoli had “courageously stood against.”

In his two months as acting director, Memoli enacted the Trump administration’s agenda with aplomb, pushing through the mass cancellation of grants focused on topics such as DEI, transgender health, and COVID-19; multiple NIH leaders were ousted while he was acting director, including Jeanne Marrazzo, who served as the director of NIAID until early April. “His major function was to do the administration’s bidding,” Michael Lauer, who led the NIH’s grant-making division before he departed the agency in February, told me.

That same month, while Memoli was still acting director, he began to call Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s attention to the flu-vaccine research he’d done with his mentor, Jeffery Taubenberger, another NIAID scientist. By early May—after Memoli had been installed as Bhattacharya’s deputy, and Taubenberger as the acting director of NIAID—HHS had redirected about half a billion dollars, once set aside to develop new COVID-19 vaccines and drugs, to their vaccine work. (Outside researchers criticized the grant as an unjustifiably enormous sum; in an email to me in May, Memoli insisted that the grant would support “more than one project,” but did not answer follow-up questions about how much of that sum would furnish his research specifically.)

Part of a deputy’s job is to take some load off the director. But under normal circumstances, people “wouldn’t really notice who the deputy director is,” one official told me; the director is expected to set policy and lead. Although Bhattacharya has continued to reiterate his own goals for the NIH—including advancing more innovative research—his recent visions for the agency have largely followed administration talking points such as diverting resources toward chronic disease and clamping down on “dangerous” virological research. Yet the director seems out of touch with the reality of that agenda: In his public appearances, internal meetings, and on social media, Bhattacharya has delivered conflicting and sometimes erroneous accounts of the NIH’s grant-making policies. Both publicly and internally, he has fixated more on defending himself against criticism he received for his COVID-policy views from 2020 than on the NIH’s current state of affairs, several officials said.

Bhattacharya, in his own way, still seems to be serving the administration by championing its talking points. But Memoli is the one most visibly throttling the NIH’s capacity to fund research and pushing out some of the agency’s most experienced and internally respected leaders. To officials at the agency, his actions look like those of a leader who has been given broad discretion to shrink down the agency’s infectious-disease work—an area where he may have a few personal grievances. “People are afraid of him,” one official said, pausing. “I’m afraid of him.”

Memoli’s history at the NIH appears to have given him a particular zeal for dismantling it. In his two decades at the agency, Memoli has developed a reputation as a self-aggrandizing co-worker, eager to champion himself and dismissive of people he hasn’t felt he could benefit professionally from, three officials who worked with him prior to 2025 told me. At various points, scientists at the agency lodged complaints about his unprofessional behavior toward colleagues, two NIH officials told me. Memoli, meanwhile, complained that “he wasn’t being given enough,” one of them said. Some of his scientific work was solid, but peers inside and outside the agency criticized some as unremarkable, leaving Memoli with a chip on his shoulder, the two officials said.

Of the NIH’s 27 institutes and centers, NIAID, where Memoli once worked, has been among the hardest hit this year, losing most of its senior leadership and a large number of its infectious-disease-focused grants. Since January, multiple officials who denounced the administration’s stance on infectious diseases and vaccines have had Memoli brush aside their concerns in meetings, then been ousted from their roles, three officials told me.

Given the Trump administration’s desire to pare down infectious-disease research, NIAID and prominent officials such as Marrazzo, who succeeded Fauci as director, were always clear targets for cuts. (Yesterday, Marrazzo filed a lawsuit that named Memoli and Bhattacharya and that alleged that she was illegally fired after she had filed a whistleblower complaint about actions of NIH leadership that endangered public health; the Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment on the lawsuit.) But in some cases, three officials told me, Memoli appears to have pushed lesser-known officials out of their roles after more personal clashes, including Sarah Read, who was NIAID’s principal deputy director and who repeatedly questioned the circumstances of Memoli and Taubenberger’s sizable vaccine grant. (Read has since left the agency.) Memoli also recently detailed Carl Dieffenbach, the director of NIAID’s Division of AIDS, to another branch of NIH after the two clashed over the administration’s approach to HIV research. Days later, he gave Dieffenbach a scoring of one out of five on a performance review—potential grounds for termination—before human-resources personnel forced him to revise that rating, because he lacked evidence for them, two officials told me. (Read and Dieffenbach declined to comment.)

Memoli has also argued that funding for HIV-vaccine research—which Dieffenbach oversaw—is wasteful and should be cut. The NIH is expected to soon divert up to a third of its AIDS budget toward improving the delivery of existing HIV tools, such as the new drug lenacapavir. At least some of that push has come from Bhattacharya, who has publicly advocated (including on his own The Director’s Desk podcast) for reallocating HIV funds on the grounds that established interventions could resolve the AIDS crisis on their own. But whereas Bhattacharya has waffled when asked how such an investment would affect other research, two officials told me, Memoli has insisted in internal meetings that it should come at the expense of research into HIV vaccines, which is widely considered to be essential to ending the HIV pandemic. Despite being a vaccine researcher himself, he’s “gleefully making these cuts,” one official told me. “Because it means he did something.”

Allowing Memoli to be the executor of the Trump administration’s cuts could serve the independent-thinker persona that Bhattacharya has tried to cultivate. But the NIH officials I spoke with, and one scientist who knew Bhattacharya prior to his appointment at the agency, doubted that his distance was so calculated. Trying to discredit the scientific establishment from the sidelines is far easier than trying to enact reform from its center. At the NIH, the embittered insider may leave the more memorable legacy.</div>

            <h2>‘Nobody Knows What to Do About the Future’</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2025/12/iran-frozen-postwar/685278/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At the end of November, two aging clerics gave speeches in Tehran reflecting on the lessons to be drawn from the summer’s Israeli and American strikes on their country. The contrast between the men’s visions shows just what sort of pickle Iran now finds itself in.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared total victory. “Without a doubt, the Iranian nation defeated the Americans and the Zionists in the 12-day war,” he said triumphantly on November 26. “They failed to achieve any of their goals.”

Speaking a day earlier, Hassan Rouhani, a former president and a rival of Khamenei, recommended instead that Iran stop underestimating its adversaries and focus on using diplomacy to deter another war. “Unfortunately, we are still in the state of ‘no war, no peace,’” he said before a group of his former cabinet ministers. “There is no feeling of security in the country.”

Only one of these clerics appears to have the authority to enforce his vision. Khamenei has been the single most powerful person in Iran, and its head of state, since 1989. Rouhani, by contrast, holds no official position and was barred last year even from running for a seat he has held on a supervisory body since 2000.

But appearances can be deceiving. The war dealt a harsh blow to Khamenei. For decades, the leader has congratulated himself on keeping Iran out of direct conflicts. But the past two years have seen the fall of one Iranian ally in the region, the Assad regime in Syria, and Israel’s battering of two others, Hamas and Hezbollah. Then came the June bombardment, which Khamenei spent hiding in a bunker; this cost him the respect of many in the Islamic Republic.

The decline of Khamenei’s powers has emboldened Rouhani and others to challenge his stance and offer alternatives. The Iranian establishment consists of multiple factions that disagree, often vehemently, over the path ahead. Many come closer to Rouhani’s thinking than to Khamenei’s. But so long as Khamenei remains alive and in power, his vision prevails, and the larger mood is one of uncomfortable stasis.

From the October 2025 issue: The neighbor from hell

The months since the 12-day war have been rough going for Iran. In September, the United States and Europe helped bring back United Nations–imposed sanctions that had been lifted in 2015. The country’s economy is in free fall. More than 60 percent of working-age Iranians are not employed. Iran remains one of only three countries—the others are North Korea and Myanmar—on the blacklist of the anti–money laundering outfit Financial Action Task Force. Even ratifying two international conventions (seen, for years, as prerequisites for coming off the list) hasn’t helped. A U.S. dollar now trades for a whopping 1.25 million Iranian rials, a historical high.

The country’s infrastructure is crumbling. Planned and unplanned electricity cuts are now a fact of life. The water crisis is so bad that experts warn of “water bankruptcy.” President Masoud Pezeshkian recently said that if Tehran runs out of water, his government might have to evacuate the city and relocate the capital. The repressive apparatus further weakens morale. Hundreds of people have been executed since the war. Several left-wing scholars have been arrested in recent weeks.

Neither Russia nor China has shown any interest in coming to Iran’s rescue. Mere days after the war ended, Iran’s defense minister attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Qingdao, China; some press reports claimed that China agreed to supply Iran with its long-range surface-to-air missiles, known as HQ-9s, and possibly Chengdu J-1o fighters as well. But the Chinese embassy in Tel Aviv denied the news. The Islamic Republic may have warm ties with China, but it would do well to remember that Beijing also does profitable business with Israel and Iran’s Arab rivals.

Tehran can expect even less from Russia. Iranian officials, including the country’s health minister, have been grumbling for some time about the lack of Russian support in the 12-day war. One official even claimed that the Russians worked with Israel against Iran. Speaking last month, Pezeshkian groused that countries Iran had considered “friends” had abandoned it, leaving Iran to rely on “God and the people” in wartime.

Nonetheless, the regime is doing its best to shore up its relationships and project an image of strength. Ali Larijani, the country’s national security adviser, has traveled to Russia, Belarus, and Pakistan, likely in search of military support. The regime has issued new primary- and high-school textbooks, including one, titled We Will Defend Our Iran, that touts Iran’s military and technological capabilities. Another, written by a well-known hard-line ideologue, promotes “victory based on faith” and “no fear of the enemy.” It shows a Palestinian child who tells her Iranian counterpart: “You are so lucky, Sara, to have security and freedom in your country. I have to always pass Zionist checkpoints.” Its cartoons mock Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu.

As part of this tough talk, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), which remains ideologically close to the supreme leader, has gone on blustering about closing off the Strait of Hormuz—the “world’s vital oil and gas artery,” according to the head of the militia’s navy, who in October seemed to threaten to choke off the strait if a war broke out. The Tehran Times, an English-language regime mouthpiece, affirmed Iran’s “readiness to deliver a crushing response to any military aggression.” Mohammadreza Naqdi, a top IRGC commander, took this rhetoric up a notch, declaring that if he ran a religious-tourism company, he’d start selling tours to Jerusalem, ludicrously implying that Iran and its allies were about to conquer Israel.

But the bravado rings hollow for most Iranians. They have not forgotten that Israel killed many of the IRGC’s top figures in the early days of the war, humiliating the militia. Naqdi was reportedly demoted due to suspicions that his office might have been infiltrated by Israeli intelligence. Iranians joke that at any top security gathering in Iran, a few people secretly speak Hebrew. Rouhani cautioned in his speech that Israel now dominates the region and can freely operate in Iranian skies. “It’s a dangerous thing when we lie and say we are a great power and our adversaries are weak and miserable,” he said.

The summer’s conflict has left the establishment braced for the possibility of a new outbreak of hostilities. Iran’s military commanders claim that the country would be prepared to launch many more than the 500 missiles it has already fired at Israel, and to include in these barrages long-range ballistic missiles called Sejjils, which it used only sparingly last time. Israeli analysts are aware that Iran would put up a tougher fight a second time around. But Israel retains a significant military edge over Iran and could also step up the damage it inflicts, or go further in trying to destabilize Iran politically or kill more of its leaders. Israel recently killed a top Hezbollah commander in Lebanon, reminding Iran of just how weak its position in the region has become. To underscore the point, Lebanese officials now openly tell Iranian officials to get lost.

As costly as renewed warfare would be for both sides, the greater peril by far would be to Iran, whose failing infrastructure and crisis-ridden economy make it prone to instability even in peacetime. That’s one reason the Rouhani faction and others are pushing to revive diplomacy that could avert a conflict and better Iran’s lot.

President Trump claims that his administration is already talking with Iran in pursuit of a deal. Some in Iran are hopeful that Saudi Arabia will act as mediator: The kingdom has mended its ties with Tehran, and its de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman, has said he would like to see an Iranian-American understanding. In recent weeks, the Iranian press has buzzed with rumors that MBS took an Iranian message to Washington to give to Trump.

But Khamenei has angrily denied these rumors as “an absolute lie,” adding that the United States “did not deserve to be contacted by the Islamic Republic.” Earlier in the month, Khamenei said that Iran could “assess” working with the U.S. only if Washington stopped backing Israel and removed its military bases from the Middle East.

These protestations can be taken with some skepticism. The leader struck much the same tone earlier this year, just before Tehran started enthusiastically negotiating with Washington. But the gridlock at the top of the Islamic Republic could make the job of Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, very difficult—if, for example, he isn’t given the power to compromise on key issues, such as Iran’s enrichment of uranium on its own soil.

Mostafa Tajzadeh, a former deputy interior minister and current political prisoner, likens Khamenei to a captain who is running his ship aground but refuses to change course. “Vast and deep changes are inevitable, and everybody waits for a transformation,” Tajzadeh wrote in a recent article, “but nobody knows how and when changes will occur.” Eshaq Jahangiri, vice president under Rouhani, put the point even more plainly in a speech last month: “Nobody knows what to do about the future.”</div>

            <h2>Trump Still Needs Susie Wiles</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/12/trump-susie-wiles-white-house/685287/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Susie Wiles styles herself as a White House chief of staff who avoids being in the headlines. When cameras come into the Oval Office, she tends to sit just out of frame. She rarely gives interviews. Unlike her predecessors, she seldom tries to curb President Donald Trump’s impulses. She has been lauded in Trump world for instilling a sense of discipline in a chaotic realm, and for providing steady leadership during both Trump’s historic political comeback and the steamrolling start to his second term.

Wiles committed the cardinal sin for a White House staffer—particularly a staffer for this White House—by becoming the news herself with the publication today of a two-part Vanity Fair story in which she offered stunningly forthright assessments of the president and much of his senior staff. Her blunt candor (she said that Trump has an “alcoholic’s personality” and that Elon Musk is “an avowed ketamine” user) was especially surprising because Wiles has presided over a (relatively) on-message White House and is usually so careful herself. The timing is also far from ideal for a West Wing already dealing with a series of GOP electoral defeats, the fallout from Trump repeatedly declaring the nation’s affordability crisis a hoax, and then, yesterday, the president blaming the beloved filmmaker Rob Reiner for his own murder.

Steve Bannon got excommunicated from Trump world—at least for a while—during the president’s first term after his own frank on-the-record exchange with a journalist. But this time, there was no firing, no public meltdown. Instead, Trump shrugged it off. Cabinet members mobilized to defend Wiles. Her job seems safe, at least for now. To many in Trump’s orbit, the White House’s response is a telling reflection of how indispensable she is to the president.

“She was a loyal fighter for him from the moment she came on board,” Donald Trump Jr. posted on social media today. “When things were tough and other supposed friends left my dad like a bunch of rats, Susie stood by his side.”

Still, her words were bracing. Often, senior administration officials talk to reporters on background—offering quotes without their names attached—so that they can speak honestly without deviating from the official White House message or alienating the president. But Wiles spoke on the record, and she appeared to hold little back. She revealed that Trump is indeed hoping to use military strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats to force that country’s leader out of power. She said that Vice President J. D. Vance has been “a conspiracy theorist for a decade” and that Russell Vought, the budget director, is “a right-wing absolute zealot.” And she tore into Musk, the tech billionaire who spent months destroying the federal bureaucracy, as “an odd, odd duck.”

Wiles’s cooperation with the author Chris Whipple was no secret. She talked with Whipple 11 times over the past year and sat with him in the chief of staff’s office, which occupies a prized perch in the West Wing just steps from the Oval Office. Several other senior staffers—including Vance, Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt—also spoke with Whipple and posed for glossy photographs. (Vanity Fair ran several extreme-close-up shots, not all of them flattering.) A few Trump allies told us that they suspected that Wiles had let her guard down with Whipple, who’d written a definitive history on modern White House chiefs of staff, and that the Trump aides had joined the long list of Washington staffers over the years who had succumbed to the lure of a glamorous Vanity Fair photo shoot. Despite Trump’s constant bashing of legacy media, he has spent a lifetime longing for their coverage and approval.

Wiles’s comments were so unexpected—and so, um, honest—that the story sparked frenzied speculation across Washington: Did Wiles think she was off the record? Was she trying to record her version of events for the history books? Was she planning to resign? After the story broke, Wiles called around to her West Wing colleagues in an attempt at damage control, insisting that her quotes had been taken out of context, aides told us. She told The New York Times that she took issue with the quotes attributed to her about Musk’s drug use, saying, “That’s ridiculous” and “I wouldn’t have said it and I wouldn’t know.” But the newspaper reported that Whipple had played the recording of Wiles’s comments confirming that, yes, she had indeed said what he’d written. (Wiles also told Whipple that she didn’t have firsthand knowledge of Musk’s drug use; the tech billionaire had previously admitted to using ketamine.)

Trump, in making his support for Wiles clear, went so far as to confirm in an interview with the New York Post her assessment that he has “an alcoholic’s personality.” Wiles had told Vanity Fair that Trump operates with “a view that there’s nothing he can’t do,” like her own father, the NFL legend Pat Summerall, who had a drinking problem. Trump does not drink and looks down on those who do, but he claimed not to have been bothered by that comparison. If he did imbibe, he said, “I’d have a very good chance of being an alcoholic. I have said that many times about myself, I do. It’s a very possessive personality.” (When Trump first met Wiles, then a Florida political operative, he loved that she was Summerall’s daughter; many of the president’s favorite cultural touchstones date from the 1980s, the decade in which Summerall and John Madden teamed up to become the NFL’s signature TV-broadcast team.)

In a social-media statement posted soon after the story’s publication, Wiles called it “a disingenuously framed hit piece.” Leavitt did as well, writing that “President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie.” And then she directed top Trump officials to fan out on social media to defend Wiles; agency heads such as Pete Hegseth, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Doug Burgum were among the nearly two dozen senior officials who posted praise for the chief of staff. The vice president, delivering a speech in Allentown, Pennsylvania, even laughingly acknowledged that he could, in fact, be a conspiracy theorist.

“We have our disagreements,” Vance said of Wiles. “We agree on much more than we disagree, but I’ve never seen her be disloyal to the president of the United States, and that makes you the best White House chief of staff that I think the president could ask for.”

The show of force underscored Wiles’s importance to Trump, who churned through four chiefs of staff during his first term. After Trump left office in disgrace in early 2021, Wiles agreed to coordinate his fundraising efforts and political activity. A year later, she took the helm of his reelection campaign, which, at the time, seemed like a long-shot bid. She, along with the GOP consultant Chris LaCivita, put together a far more professional operation than in any previous Trump campaign, and cut down on the staff infighting and leaking that defined his two earlier runs. She publicly claimed that she never tried to control Trump, but she did, on occasion, get him to back away from outlandish ideas. In a moment famous in Trump’s circles, Wiles stepped into the candidate’s line of sight during a particularly dark and rambling Pennsylvania rally in the campaign’s final week and simply glared at him. The unspoken message: Stop it, and move on. Trump eventually did. The president is deeply fond of her, staffers told us, and once praised her as the “most powerful person in the world” while also, oddly, at times calling her “Susie Trump.”

The circle of power in the West Wing is small—Vance, Miller, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and a few others—and Wiles, in many ways, wields the most influence. She streamlined processes, cracked down on talking to the press, and demanded loyalty from the staff. Wiles largely reduced the chaos, dysfunction, and turnover that permeated Trump’s first term and was able to help secure passage of a sweeping tax bill and a dramatic expansion of executive power.

She revealed to Vanity Fair a number of occasions when Trump ignored her advice. She said that she’d tried to persuade him not to pardon the most violent January 6, 2021, rioters and urged him to hold off on announcing his sweeping tariffs plan. She openly criticized the way Musk slashed international-aid programs. She admitted that some of the prosecutions brought by the Department of Justice directly stemmed from Trump’s desire for revenge. And she said that Trump broke their “loose agreement” to end his “score settling” against political enemies that she’d feared would distract from his agenda after the first 90 days.

Now Wiles herself has become the latest in a string of distractions. The momentum that she helped engineer stalled out this summer when the GOP legislation proved unpopular and Jeffrey Epstein returned to the headlines. Since then, rising prices and a sense that Trump has overreached in expanding his executive power have led to a string of Democratic wins at the ballot box and a fear among Republicans that the president has lost touch with the promises that returned him to the White House. And yesterday, even some in the president’s own party denounced his assertion that Reiner was killed alongside his wife because he was a Trump critic. (Prosecutors have said that the couple’s son, who has spoken openly about his struggles with drug addiction, will be charged with their murder.)

Although Trump announced a speech to the nation tomorrow night that is meant to recap a year of accomplishments, some in the West Wing privately admit that a revised approach to governing—including possible staffing changes—could be on the horizon in the new year. Wiles has said that she told Trump that he needs to start campaigning again. And the vice president volunteered his own idea for a course correction.

“If any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article,” Vance said in Pennsylvania, “I hope that the lesson is that we should be giving fewer interviews to mainstream-media outlets.”

It&#39;s honestly surprising how long it took to reach the movie industry, considering the way we&#39;ve been letting the business world consolidate different industries over the last few decades. Sure, there&#39;s some chatter about it here or there among the political class, but for the most part it&#39;s half a step forward, twenty steps back when it comes to enforcement.

It&#39;s honestly surprising how long it took to reach the movie industry, considering the way we&#39;ve been letting the business world consolidate different industries over the last few decades. Sure, there&#39;s some chatter about it here or there among the political class, but for the most part it&#39;s half a step forward, twenty steps back when it comes to enforcement.

It is a Hungary-style media rollup attempt. Buy up, intimidate out or (eventually) sure competing voices into submission.

So Amazon is going to give money to OpenAI so OpenAI can buy chips from Amazon. And Nvidia is giving OpenAI money to buy chips from Nvidia. And AMD is doing some weird thing giving OpenAI stock warrants so OpenAI can sell the stock and buy chips from AMD. How the hell is Sam Altman convincing people to keep this house of cards standing? Is he really a genius running a company so amazing that this makes sense behind closed doors?

And how is OpenAI making its code work well on all these different platforms? Everybody else seems to be writing their code to run on one architecture. Does OpenAI have three teams of programmers adapting their latest code to work on three chip architectures?

This all powerfully reminds me of the deals the big banks like Lehman Brothers and Bear Sterns struck back in 2006 and 2007.  If you&#39;re too young to remember that particular shitshow, the mortgage industry was fundamentally toxic and a bunch of securities were created by mushing bad mortgages in with good ones so that the combination looked secure enough to invest in.

And then THOSE securities were subdivided up and repackaged into even more securities.  And so on.  And so on.

If the Fed had bailed out Lehman, would contagion ever have started infecting the hedges, which turned out in the end to be valid once the irrational, emotional panic set off by Lehman&#39;s failure stopped, due to outright Fed money printing?

It is not the responsibility of government to protect companies from their own incompetence.  Bush letting Lehman die was the only good thing he did during the meltdown.  He should have continued with the rest of them.

It&#39;s called the free market for a reason. If you continually thwart the free market it&#39;s no longer free, is it?

Why not print an indexed basic income so you can let big banks fail without affecting incomes of little guys who were not responsible yet bear the brunt of the big guys&#39; failures?

Making the little guys suffer is all part of how the system works. If you have workers that are broke and desperate, then the labor market is in surplus and it keeps wages down. Plus you don&#39;t have to be nice to your employees.For the middle class, trimming a bit off the top of their retirement savings is very profitable. They simply have to accept a lower standard of living in retirement, possibly working past retirement age. Again this is very good for business.

Should the public Fed work for us by printing an indexed basic income?

The infection was already there.  Anyone who&#39;d invested in any mortgage derived securities was compromised because the underwriting and scoring process was fundamentally fraudulent.  Securities are rated and, at least in theory, those ratings are supposed to reflect the degree of risk.  But the scoring agencies essentially became captives of the folks minting the securities and just handed out great ratings like halloween candy.

The Fed and the money printing and all that -- concerning as it all was -- reall

Discussions of race are everywhere and nowhere in 2025. On one hand, President Donald Trump is openly insulting Somali immigrants, describing entire nations as “shithole” countries, and insisting that the most persecuted class of humans are white South Africans. On the other, none of this is actually registering as anything other than Trump being Trump, and so when the Supreme Court agrees to revisit a foundational doctrine like birthright citizenship, too many of us shrug it off. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick spoke to civil rights attorney Sherrilyn Ifill about her recent Substack, “Is It Too Late,” in which she argued that it is not too late to save American ideals of democracy and equality, but it is assuredly too late to remain indifferent. Part of that conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity below.

Dahlia Lithwick: There is a very human propensity, especially in times of crisis, to normalize and rationalize and temporize. We comfort the comfortable, and we look for hope in norms and in institutions and in rationality. So many people have this perpetual hope that something’s going to come along and life is going to go back to 2010 or 2012. This hope says that with enough time, and even if it’s uncomfortable right now, someone else is going to come along, or some institution is going to come along, and put us in the DeLorean and we’re all going to go back. Can you talk about the ways in which American exceptionalism and the American normalization bias and the profound—just to talk about the Supreme Court as an example—American trust in institutions can get us to the point where it’s not that we don’t see the fire, we can’t even smell the smoke. You write, “everyone should be on full alert,” but you and I both know that not only are people not on full alert, I’m not even sure what could put them on full alert.

Sherrilyn Ifill: I think things are unraveling pretty fast and people will get on full alert. The only question is, when they get on full alert, will it be too late? That’s why I’m saying: “You might want to do that now.” I’ve been guilty of this as well: not ringing the alarm bell with sufficient urgency. This is something lawyers do all the time, because we’re used to finding the little interstices and figuring out how to move within these small spaces so that we can get where we want to go and so that we can make change. I was trained in that tradition—you find a way, you find a pathway, and all of that presumes the legitimacy of the framework.

I’m not a nihilist. I actually always do have hope. And I think one of the reasons I feel so clear, in this moment, is that I have no desire to return to 2010. I have no desire to return to the ’80s. I’ve been a civil rights lawyer for 35 years. The ’80s were a nightmare.

What are we returning to? I don’t have a dream time calling out to me. People will say, “When Obama was president.” I mean, really? Because most of the videos you’ve seen of police killing unarmed black men, most of that was in the second Obama administration. That was Eric Garner. That was Ferguson. That was Walter Scott running in that park. So if you’ve been doing the work that I’ve been doing, you’re always invested in the future.

I have excitement and hope in this time because as this whole thing begins to unravel, we have the opportunity to create something new. This is where the 14th Amendment is so helpful for me, because it’s one of the biggest moments of creating something absolutely new in this country, so I use it as inspiration, not only its very words and provisions and guarantees, but also to remind me that we have the right and the obligation to refound our country when it goes astray. That’s what those young kids in college during the Civil Rights Movement did. They did a version of refounding. So I don’t want to suggest that I don’t feel hope for the future. I do feel quite hopeful. But I also feel that pretending that all we need to do is just make some incremental changes to get us back to 2010 interferes with our ability to do that reset. What has been laid bare is that 2010 ain’t it.

We have some serious structural problems. As a litigator, I don’t know how anyone can purport to pretend that they know what the rules are at the Supreme Court anymore. We have a Supreme Court that not only has the power to say what the law is, pursuant to Chief Justice John Marshall and Marbury v. Madison, but they’ve now decided that they have the power to say what the facts are. That has never been part of our system of adjudication and litigation. Assigning factual findings to the Supreme Court? No, that is for the trial courts, for district courts. But we are now seeing a majority on the Supreme Court that regularly swats away the findings of the district court. That is the power of the district court. They are closest to the conflict. They can evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. They’re seeing the exhibits, the documents, all of it. It’s playing out in real time. It’s not theoretical for them. And now we have a Supreme Court that months later will swat away a two-week trial and the findings of fact over 160 pages by a district court. That’s real. That is real and structural. And it should not be dependent on the personnel of the court.

Last week was a startling and arresting moment for me in terms of the Trump v. Slaughter arguments about Humphrey’s Executor. Put aside originalism, that’s gone, there’s not even a pretense of text and history. But the idea that, “Well, you know, since agencies don’t look like they did 100 years ago, I guess we don’t have to think about them the same way.” It is so strange to see serious people pretending to be doing serious work in this serious place, when all pretense of intellectual seriousness has fallen away. Instead you have feelingsball and “How does executive power make me feel today?” There is no commitment to the principles that were laid out and in which people like you and I as institutionalists took a lot of solace. Part of what is so challenging about this moment is that by the time most Americans get around to the point that they can say the sentence “Amy Coney Barrett’s not going to save us,” or “Brett Kavanaugh is not going to save us,” it’s all going to be too late. It seems we are so committed to the principle that they are originalists, that they are textualists, that they care about a precedent, and so committed to the proposition that the U.S. Supreme Court is going to save us in the end.

The irony of it is that the U.S. Supreme Court got this reputation and the confidence of the American public after Brown. And that’s why, as much as this court is hollowing out Brown, they’ll never overturn it because that is how they became—how they got the reputation, certainly among Black people, for many decades, of being the people who come to your rescue. The shift started to happen with the Burger court in the 1980s.

So many of those who have the greatest platforms are still speaking and behaving in a way that suggests that this is something easily solved, or this is just how it goes, or we can just do this for a couple of years. But if you are watching the videos of people being chased by masked figures who claim to be federal agents, but we don’t know, and who are kidnapping people and throwing them in vans and doing this to American citizens and holding them? The danger is just there. It  is apparent. The more we treat it as though this is just Trumpism, this is Trump 2.0—all the little things that we say to tamp down the alarm are really profoundly problematic.

Many of those who have the greatest microphones frankly don’t know very much about race or racism or the history of it in this country. They want to be experts, so they play to their expertise. These are also the people who have said, “We talk about race too much. We talk about identity too much. We’re scaring people off with that. Everything’s not race.” We’ve made it seem illegitimate to talk about racism. It’s almost like you’re being soft, you’re being anti-intellectual, you’re not doing the rigorous work of politics if you’re talking about race.

In fact, race is threaded through every institutional structure of this country. And we have someone who is exploiting it every day. It’s not that I’m talking about race, it’s that he just stood up the other day and said, We want the Danes, the Swedes, and the Norwegians. We don’t want people from shithole countries. We’re being told that it’s illegitimate to keep talking about race when we’re confronting a tsunami of a movement that uses racism as its stalking horse. It is the lure that brought so many people into this movement. It’s important to help people understand that that’s the bait they’re using. The bait that says, “Yeah, I’m not sure that those people are qualified,” right? Yeah, all of that stuff that just lives in this country, that’s being used as the bait for this smash-and-grab, for this power grab. And I don’t think we’re doing this country any favors by steering people away from that realization.

In A24’s Civil War, a journalist, played by Wagner Moura, pleads with the militiaman, played by Jesse Plemons, who has detained him and his colleagues at gunpoint. “We’re American.” The militiaman replies, “What kind of American?” In a flood of executive orders and proposed bills, the GOP asks U.S. citizens the same question.

This month, Bernie Moreno, a Senate Republican from Ohio, introduced the Exclusive Citizenship Act of 2025, legislation that would compel any U.S. citizen with a second citizenship to choose between the two. Though Moreno’s bill is likely to face heavy resistance due to 14th Amendment protections, it’s a reminder for people like my family and me: Not all U.S. citizenships are created equal.

I was born and raised in the U.S. I’m a U.S. citizen, but I’m also a Spanish citizen through my parents, who were both Spanish citizens when I was born. I never really thought much about my Spanish citizenship. More than anything, I’m American. I grew up watching The Wonder Years, building model planes with my dad, and playing basketball. Plus, my English is a lot stronger than my Spanish. But the more this administration and its acolytes insist I choose, the more fiercely I cling to my heritage.

This isn’t the first time this year that Republicans have reminded me of my family’s second-tier citizenship. Though foiled by the courts so far, this administration has made a concerted effort to end birthright citizenship—the way I became a U.S. citizen—an effort that has made its way back to the Supreme Court. The administration’s plan for birthright citizenship wouldn’t affect me directly, as it wouldn’t be—at least in its current version—retroactive. But it underscores a fundamental truth of this movement’s worldview: How one becomes a U.S. citizen affects the perceived value of said citizenship, which effectively creates tiers of citizenship. (Incidentally, historians and legal scholars consistently cite tiered citizenship as a hallmark of fascist states.)

The Department of Justice has prioritized denaturalization more broadly, as outlined in a June memo. I worry about the implications for people I love, like my wife, my mom, and my sister, all of whom are naturalized U.S. citizens. On paper, I shouldn’t worry. They’re all law-abiding people, and this directive ostensibly aims to ferret out terrorists and criminals.

That’s what this administration said about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s mission, but the agency’s egregious flouting of due process tells a starkly different story. According to ICE’s own numbers, the majority of migrants in detention have no criminal convictions.

In other words, I don’t trust this administration and its devotees when they say they’re only going after the “bad guys.” It’s clear they think the bad guys are anyone with the temerity to speak another language or identify with another culture. A few days after Moreno introduced this piece of legislation, Donald Trump called Somali immigrants “garbage.”

This White House is hell-bent on upholding an English-speaking monoculture, hence the designation of English as the official language of the United States back in March. There’s no room for another language or another culture. If the bill were to pass, I wonder if special dispensations would be made for Melania Trump and Barron Trump, both of whom are dual citizens.

It all stems from a zero-sum philosophy, to which the author of this proposed legislation subscribes. Born in Colombia and naturalized at 18 years old, Moreno insists: “It’s all or nothing. It’s time to end dual citizenship for good.” Therein lies the crux of our differences: Moreno believes that the only way to be a “true” American is to slough off your heritage and pledge your exclusive loyalty, whereas I, like many others, believe that the U.S. is at its best when it activates all participating cultures—and at its worst when it attempts to homogenize them.

I grew up in a mixed-status household. My parents and my sister lacked legal status when I was growing up. As a child, I was oblivious to their fears and the dangers we faced as a family. Immigration hard-liners would argue that they should’ve followed the law and that I should never have become a U.S. citizen. Well, birthright citizenship is enshrined by the 14th Amendment and the General Amnesty of 1986, passed by the Reagan administration, which both say otherwise. You don’t have to like existing immigration laws. You can work to change or overturn them, but then you have no choice but to admit that this fight isn’t about following existing law.

Immigration hard-liners also like to say that the immigrants should’ve come here the proverbial “right way.” What they don’t realize is that many immigrants do come here the so-called right way. They may live in the United States legally for many years with temporary protections, for so long that they lay down roots, buy homes, and raise children, only to have those protections revoked overnight. Then, suddenly, having never committed a crime, they’re called criminals, subject to government-sanctioned abduction.

That’s the funny thing about rules in this country: They have a nasty habit of suddenly turning on you—especially when, in Republicans’ eyes, you’re not the right kind of American.

            <h2>Blockchain company Nomad to repay users under FTC deal after $186M cyberattack</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/nomad_ftc_settlement/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In proposing a settlement agreement, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says that Illusory Systems must repay users funds lost in a 2022 cyberattack.

Illusory Systems, which trades as Nomad, allegedly misled users about the security of its cryptocurrency bridge, which was compromised in 2022 in an attack that led to $186 million worth of funds being stolen.

The FTC alleged that Nomad pushed an update in June 2022 containing &quot;inadequately tested code&quot; that, in turn, introduced a &quot;significant vulnerability&quot; that was exploited around a month later.

The FTC acknowledged that some of these funds were recovered, but Nomad&#39;s customers ultimately lost out on approximately $100 million.

Soon after the breach, Nomad established a &quot;white hat&quot; bounty program open to anyone who stole funds during the attack.

It said those who return at least 90 percent of what they stole will be considered a &quot;white hat,&quot; and in return, it would not pursue legal action against them. Those who complied would also receive 10 percent of whatever sum they returned as a gesture of goodwill.

The FTC&#39;s proposed settlement agreement, published this week, would require Nomad to repay around $37.5 million to users who remain out of pocket within a year of the agreement being signed, or 30 days after the end of any litigation related to the breach, whichever comes later.

Nomad would also be required to implement a comprehensive security program, assign an employee to maintain that program, and agree to regular, third-party assessments.

The company would also be barred from making any further misrepresentations about the security of its products.

The complaint against Nomad alleges that, despite pitching its blockchain bridge as a &quot;security-first&quot; product at the time, the organization behind it fell short in various aspects of cybersecurity.

The FTC alleges that it failed to adopt secure coding practices, implement a vulnerability management program, and deploy technologies that would have limited the impact of a breach on its users.

It went on to claim that these failures and lack of incident response capabilities contributed to the total loss of funds.

Nomad has agreed to the terms of the proposed settlement, which will be finalized following a public comment period and a second, final FTC vote.

&quot;The FTC Act requires companies to take reasonable security measures,&quot; said Christopher Mufarrige, director at the FTC&#39;s Bureau of Consumer Protection. &quot;It&#39;s important that companies live up to their security promises to consumers.&quot;

The company has a highly limited digital presence at present. Public communications have been nonexistent since 2023, and its website displays no information about how to contact it.

The Register reached out to Nomad&#39;s lawyer for more information, but did not hear back by publication time. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Generating code using AI increases the number of issues that need to be reviewed and the severity of those issues.

CodeRabbit, an AI-based code review platform, made that determination by looking at 470 open source pull requests for its State of AI vs Human Code Generation report.

The report finds that AI-generated code contains significantly more defects of logic, maintainability, security, and performance than code created by people.

On average, AI-generated pull requests (PRs) include about 10.83 issues each, compared with 6.45 issues in human-generated PRs. That&#39;s about 1.7x more when AI is involved, meaning longer code reviews and increased risk of defects.

Problems caused by AI-generated PRs also tend to be more severe than human-made messes. AI-authored PRs contain 1.4x more critical issues and 1.7x more major issues on average than human-written PRs, the report says.

Machine-generated code therefore seems to require reviewers to deal with a large volume of issues that are more severe than those present in human-generated code.

These findings echo a report issued last month by Cortex, maker of an AI developer portal. The company&#39;s Engineering in the Age of AI: 2026 Benchmark Report [PDF] found that PRs per author increased 20 percent year-over-year even as incidents per pull request increased by 23.5 percent, and change failure rates rose around 30 percent.

The CodeRabbit report found that AI-generated code falls short of meatbag-made code across the major issue categories. The bots created more logic and correctness errors (1.75x), more code quality and maintainability errors (1.64x), more security findings (1.57x), and more performance issues (1.42x).

In terms of specific security concerns, AI-generated code was 1.88x more likely to introduce improper password handling, 1.91x more likely to make insecure object references, 2.74x more likely to add XSS vulnerabilities, and 1.82x more likely to implement insecure deserialization than human devs.

One area where AI outshone people was spelling – spelling errors were 1.76x more common in human PRs than machine-generated ones. Also, human-authored code had 1.32x more testability issues than AI stuff.

&quot;These findings reinforce what many engineering teams have sensed throughout 2025,&quot; said David Loker, director of AI at CodeRabbit, in a statement. &quot;AI coding tools dramatically increase output, but they also introduce predictable, measurable weaknesses that organizations must actively mitigate.&quot;

CodeRabbit cautions that its methodology has limitations, such as its inability to be certain that PRs labeled as human-authored actually were exclusively authored by humans.

Other studies based on different data have come to different conclusions.

For example, an August 2025 paper by University of Naples researchers, &quot;Human-Written vs. AI-Generated Code: A Large-Scale Study of Defects, Vulnerabilities, and Complexity,&quot; found that AI-generated Python and Java code &quot;is generally simpler and more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging, while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher concentration of maintainability issues.&quot;

Back in January 2025, researchers from Monash University (Australia) and University of Otago (New Zealand) published a paper titled &quot;Comparing Human and LLM Generated Code: The Jury is Still Out!&quot;

&quot;Our results show that although GPT-4 is capable of producing coding solutions, it frequently produces more complex code that may need more reworking to ensure maintainability,&quot; the southern hemisphere boffins wrote. &quot;On the contrary, however, our outcomes show that a higher number of test cases passed for code generated by GPT-4 across a range of tasks than code that was generated by humans.&quot;

As to the impact of AI tools on developer productivity, researchers from Model Evaluation & Threat Research (METR) reported in July that &quot;AI tooling slowed developers down.&quot;

We note that Microsoft patched 1,139 CVEs in 2025, according to Trend Micro researcher Dustin Childs, who claims that&#39;s the second-largest year for CVEs by volume after 2020.

Microsoft says 30 percent of code in certain repos was written by AI and Copilot Actions comes with a caution about &quot;the security implications of enabling an agent on your computer.&quot;

&quot;As Microsoft&#39;s portfolio continues to increase and as AI bugs become more prevalent, this number is likely to go higher in 2026,&quot; Childs wrote in his post.

But at least we can expect fewer typos in code comments. ®

            <h2>NATO's battle for cloud sovereignty: Speed is existential</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/sovereign_cloud_is_existential_nato/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NATO is in an existential race to develop sovereign cloud-based technologies to underpin its mission, the alliance&#39;s Assistant Secretary General for Cyber and Digital Transformation told an audience at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) last week.

Jean-Charles Ellermann-Kingombe said the Ukraine war has highlighted the impact of technology on the battlefield, from drones to AI for targeting. Likewise, it shows the need for a coherent, secure approach to data and similarly coherent and secure cloud platforms to store and process it.

&quot;Modern conflict no longer rewards the side with the most data,&quot; Ellermann-Kingombe declared. &quot;It rewards the side with the ability to connect it, understand it and act on it first.&quot;

This means that cloud adoption is more than just a technical issue for &quot;specialists in white rooms.&quot; Rather, it is a strategic and operational imperative that underpins &quot;the credibility of our collective defense.&quot;

&quot;But if cloud is essential, then speed is existential,&quot; he declared.

&quot;The threat picture we face is grave,&quot; he said. China and Russia are harnessing AI and machine learning, and &quot;exploring quantum computing and autonomous systems powered by cloud architectures that evolve every day.&quot;

This means the alliance&#39;s own digital transformation needs a clear sense of urgency. &quot;That means building a modernized digital backbone to enhance intelligence sharing, accelerate decision making, and strengthen operational readiness across all 32 allies.&quot;

Strengthening deterrence, enhancing resilience, and investing in innovation and technology are all key pillars of the alliance&#39;s NATO 2030 strategy. The 2030 plan kicked off in 2020, before war erupted in Ukraine. Various NATO statements on the strategy refer to sovereignty, but little reference to digital sovereignty or cloud sovereignty.

However, Ellermann-Kingombe used both phrases repeatedly, saying that when it comes to sovereignty, &quot;our approach is one of confidence through cooperation.&quot;

He outlined three dimensions of sovereignty. First is the need to control access to data as well as its location. Operational sovereignty covers how systems are operated and by who. Technological sovereignty covers the need to maintain operations, &quot;even if a provider withdraws or is sanctioned.&quot;

At the same time, he said: &quot;We must acknowledge the trade offs… full sovereignty often comes with reduced scalability and innovation speed.&quot;

NATO members will have to adopt multiple models, he predicted, from globally connected clouds to isolated or air-gapped environments for highly classified workloads.

&quot;This diversity is not weakness, but the pragmatic expression of sovereignty in a complex world. It is the balance between autonomy and Alliance, between national control and collective capability.&quot;

But he insisted digital sovereignty does not have to mean isolation, and American and European companies are working closely together. &quot;We see new models in Belgium, where US hyperscalers partner with trusted European operators to deliver jurisdictionally isolated clouds that respect local control while maintaining innovation speed.&quot;

He added: &quot;We should also keep in mind that sovereignty and openness can coexist through technical safeguards, open standards and interoperability.&quot;

This means &quot;we can protect what must remain sovereign. Our secrets, our decision making, our command authority. Without losing the innovation and resilience that come from NATO wide cooperation and partnership with industry from Allied nations.&quot;

Looking ahead to AI supported command and control, quantum resilient cryptography, &quot;one thing is certain, no nation and no company can achieve this alone altogether.&quot; The Trump White house would probably disagree.

NATO – and the audience – have to keep three things in mind, Ellermann-Kingombe said. &quot;First, that we act with urgency. The threat evolves daily. Our technologies and defenses must evolve faster. Second, prioritize collaboration. Industry, academia and allies all bring critical ideas and solutions. Harnessing them will make us strong.&quot;

&quot;And three, design for sovereignty, build systems that enhance economy, strengthen allied trust and secure the foundations of our partnership in the digital era.&quot;

In a discussion following his speech, Ellermann-Kingombe said it was critical to engage with industry – including beyond the traditional defense sector. This includes tech companies and startups &quot;that have much more accelerated development cycles.&quot;

But a shift to newer tech – and newer tech suppliers – also needs a much more tech savvy bureaucracy and agile procurement system, he added. This can&#39;t be left entirely in the hands of decision-makers &quot;above 50 who grew up without mobile phones.&quot;

Ellermann-Kingombe spoke just days before the UK announced a &quot;rapid £140 million boost&quot; for drone and counter-drone technology. The cash is aimed towards British &quot;SMEs, micro-SMEs, and universities.&quot;

The cash will be funneled by UK Defense Investment, the &quot;focal point for innovation&quot; within the Ministry of Defence, with a ring-fenced annual budget of at least £500 million.

It has already invested more than £25 million in an uncrewed AI submarine, as well as £5 million seed corn investment into Land Autonomous Collaborative Platforms – such as autonomous drones to support British Army Apache helicopters. ®

Garmin may be best known for its hardcore fitness watches, but it’s got an extensive line of lifestyle offerings, too.

Few brands are as synonymous with outdoor sports as Garmin. You’ll find these fitness trackers and smartwatches on dozens of wrists at any 5K, marathon, or Ironman. You’ll also find Garmin devotees among divers, thru-hikers, golfers, kiteboarders — you name it. But these devices aren’t just for athletes. The company’s made significant strides in its lifestyle offerings, so regardless of your fitness level, there’s a Garmin for everyone.

If you’re coming from a more traditional smartwatch, Garmin’s core strengths lie in fitness, GPS, adventuring, and durability. These are hardy devices that are meant to withstand the elements and last weeks on a single charge. Several models come with offline maps, advanced navigational features, and more training metrics than any other platform. Garmin devices tend to be on the pricier side, and the company announced in March 2025 that it would begin putting its newest features behind a paywall. That’s a bummer given Garmin spent years publicly stating it had no intention of charging its users extra.

There are fitness trackers and smartwatches, and then there are Garmins. Depending on the type of Garmin — there are many — we will tailor our benchmarks and experiential, real-life testing. If it’s a rugged Fenix model, we’ll go on extensive GPS activities, see how well it works as a navigation tool, and dive deep into training metrics. If it’s more lifestyle focused, like the Venu 3 or Venu 4, we’ll put an added focus on how well smart features like voice assistant access, notifications, and style. Because people buy Garmins to last a long time, we also put special consideration on battery life testing. Some other factors we consider are durability, performance, ability to connect to gym equipment, and GPS accuracy.

Garmins are known for extra long battery life. The question is, does it last days, weeks, or even a month?

Garmin has so many training features that even the pros probably don’t use all of them. Do you get coaching programs and stamina graphs? Or are you sticking to the basics like steps, pace, and mileage?

Same goes for navigational features. While Garmin is known for its GPS tech, there are multiple kinds of GPS tracking and satellite systems. We also look at whether these navigational features fit the use case. For example, do running watches have back-to-start? Do offline maps come preloaded for thru-hikers?

Do these watches hold up to intense activity? Are they discreet enough to wear to formal occasions without screaming “I love exercise!!!!”

Garmins are expensive. Does the price make sense for the intended user, feature set, and build quality?

Garmins aren’t too shabby on smarts, either. While more fitness-focused than anything from Apple, Google, or Samsung, there’s enough to get you the basics like notifications and then some. For example, most Garmins have fall detection and safety features, and several Garmins released since 2023 have an FDA-cleared EKG feature. (You’ll need a phone on hand, however, as only one Garmin model has cellular connectivity.) Many Garmin devices also support offline music playback and come with a small third-party app ecosystem.

There are a lot of Garmin watches to choose from. No, seriously, there are six major lineups, and each has a multitude of models. But no worries — I test several Garmins every year and can help point you in the right direction.

More intuitive menu navigationMultiband GPSLong battery life — even with AOD enabledAdds helpful training featuresOh, oh, it’s OLED, you know

It’s $100 more than the 255OLED displays don’t cost $100

Sizes: 42mm w/ 18mm straps; 46mm w/ 22mm straps / Weight: 39g (42mm); 47g (46mm) / Battery life: Up to 15 days (42mm); 13 days (46mm) in smartwatch mode / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 8GB

Garmin has many running watches, and a lot of them are great. But the Forerunner 265 or 265S (if you have petite wrists) strikes an excellent balance between price, feature set, and battery life. Its vibrant OLED display also impressed us. We got about a week on a single charge with always-on display enabled, and up to 15 days with that setting turned off.

The 265 has dual-frequency GPS (also known as multi-band), which gets you get much more accurate maps in challenging environments like cities and dense forests because you can access both the L1 and L5 satellite frequencies. You don’t lose a whole lot of battery life with dual-frequency GPS enabled. I wore it during a half marathon with that and the AOD enabled, and I still had over 80 percent battery by the time I got home. This is also an excellent price, as the majority of multi-band GPS watches cost well over $600.

My main complaint is that $450 (outside of a deal, at least), while not bad for Garmin, is still a lot when you consider that’s the same price as smarter smartwatches with great running features. Some runners won’t care. But if you’re on a budget — or you’re new to running and feel iffy about spending that much — then consider the Forerunner 165 series. It starts at $249.99 (add another $50 for onboard music) and does almost everything the 265 series does. The main things you’re missing are dual-frequency GPS and a few more niche sport profiles. But if you’re mostly sticking to running, gym equipment, cycling, swimming, and hiking, you’re covered.

The Garmin Forerunner 165 Music gets you in-depth training metrics but leaves out some of the more advanced features in exchange for a more palatable price.

Neither has all of Garmin’s training features, but it’s got what you’ll need to run anything from a 5K to a full marathon. That includes a Race Predictor, which gives you an estimate of what your best time would be based on your actual training. You can also use PacePro to figure out your pacing strategy for a race. You also get Garmin’s Training Readiness feature to help gauge load and recovery, Garmin Coach plans, and a host of running form metrics. It also supports offline music and safety features like fall detection. The only thing they lack is advanced mapping. (They still have trackback, point-to-point navigation, and real-time breadcrumb trail support, however.)

On the other hand, if your budget allows, you could also consider the Forerunner 570 and Forerunner 970, which were released in June and cost $549.99 and $749.99, respectively. Both models have a built-in speaker and microphone, OLED screen, skin temperature sensors, flashlight, and built-in EKG reader with atrial fibrillation detection. They also give you a daily evening report with suggestions on how much sleep you should get, plus a digest of your upcoming events, workouts, and the weather. You also get access to Garmin Coach, a free multipart workout program, which allows you to upload your course and receive notifications when you’ve hit certain distance benchmarks.

While both smartwatches have a lot in common, they do have some key differences, the main being that the 970 has maps. The Forerunner 570 comes in 42mm and 47mm sizes, and Garmin says its battery lasts up to 10 or 11 days based on which model you pick (with the always-on display off.) The Forerunner 970 only comes in a 47mm size, and Garmin says it can last up to 15 days per charge. The Forerunner 970 also includes three exclusive metrics: running tolerance, running economy, and speed step loss.

These three tools will give you a weekly maximum mileage recommendation (with the option to adjust it up or down), and assess running efficiency. The running economy and step speed loss features require Garmin’s $169.99 HRM 600 heart rate monitor.

The Forerunner 570 is a definite step up from the Forerunner 265, but not a big enough leap to recommend it to everyone instead of that model, especially because it doesn’t offer offline maps. The Forerunner 970 may be overkill for all but the most avid runners, but it’s good to see Garmin continually adding features to the top of its line.

Sizes: 42mm w/ 20mm straps; 47mm w/ 22mm straps; 51mm w/ 26mm straps / Weight: 42mm: 63g stainless steel, 58g titanium; 47mm: 78g stainless steel, 70g titanium; 51mm: 98g stainless steel, 88g titanium / Battery life: 42mm: up to 10 days (4 with AOD); 47mm: up to 16 days (6 with AOD); 51mm: up to 31 days (11 with AOD) / Display type: OLED / GPS: All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 10ATM / Music storage: Up to 32GB

The Epix Pro will get you most fitness features Garmin had to offer, plus topographical maps, turn-by-turn navigation, and more training metrics than even a seasoned triathlete would know what to do with.

The Pro is more size-inclusive than the standard second-gen Epix, which only comes in 47mm. You can get the Pro in that size, too, but it also comes in 42mm and 51mm. This was a major complaint I had with the second-gen Epix, and you love to see companies actually take this sort of thing seriously. The best part is that the Pro models start at the same price as the regular Epix did. You’ll have to pay $100 extra for materials like titanium and sapphire crystal, but that’s also true of the standard Epix.

Smartens up Garmin’s flagship multisport watchExcellent battery and fitness trackingOffers MIP and OLED display optionsCondenses the Fenix and Epix lines into one

The starting price is $350 more than the Fenix 7!Smart features are less helpful without LTE

That said, it muddies the waters if you’re trying to pick between the Epix Pro, Fenix 7, Fenix 7 Pro, and now, the Fenix 8. The main difference is that the Epix watches all have OLED displays. One reason I prefer OLED screens is that they’re much easier to read indoors — where most of us spend the majority of our time. The Fenix 7 series’ memory-in-pixel displays (plus solar charging if you opt for it) allow for weeks and weeks of charge, but the smallest Epix Pro can get around 10 days with normal usage. The 47mm and 51mm Pro models can go longer between charges due to bigger batteries, but I felt that the 42mm has enough juice to satisfy most use cases. Garmin also has so many battery-saving modes and options that I highly doubt this will ever be an issue.

Not helping matters is the fact that the Fenix 8 lets you choose between an OLED and an MIP display. You also get smart features like an onboard voice assistant, the ability to take calls from the wrist, and the Garmin Messenger app. The main problem is that the starting price is now $350 more (barring any deals) than the standard Fenix 7 and right about on par with the Epix Pro. My personal feeling is that the Fenix 8’s smart features are just okay and that you’re really not missing much by not having them. We also often see discounts on older models, so I would put on my bargain-hunting hat for a discounted Epix Pro or Fenix 7 Pro while inventory is still available.

But really, the winning feature of the Epix Pro is the hands-free flashlight. It’s so useful in my day-to-day life, and all you have to do is double-press a button. It’s as bright as your smartphone, comes with a red light option if you want something easier on the eyes, and can act as a strobe in an emergency situation. The Fenix 7 Pro and 8 watches also have a flashlight, so a lot of this is going to come down to personal preference for the display, price, and whether you care about smart features.

We haven’t had a chance to get our hands on it yet, but Garmin also recently announced the Fenix 8 Pro. The watch, which starts at $1,199.99, is available in 47mm and 51mm sizes with either an OLED or MicroLED display. All models feature LTE and satellite connectivity, which costs $7.99 a month and allows you to send text and voice messages through the Garmin Messenger app when your phone is unavailable. The expanded connectivity also enables LiveTrack location sharing and access to real-time weather forecasts, as well as SOS requests, which get routed to Garmin’s Response Center and emergency services in the event of an emergency.

The improved MIP display is still not the easiest to read in dim lightingToo similar to the standard Fenix 7

If you’re set on getting the most battery life possible, I recommend the Fenix 7 Pro over the standard 7 for a few reasons. Its MIP display is slightly brighter, all sizes have the flashlight, and, like the Epix Pro, it has an updated sensor array. I also recommend it over the MIP versions of the Fenix 8 because it comes in more sizes, and costs around $300 less. Especially since the Fenix 8’s smart features are a bit half-baked.

Aesthetically pleasing and accurate trackingGood for smaller wristsAffordable priceThe hidden OLED is cool

The Garmin app is overly complicatedBattery life is shorter than other hybrids

Sizes: 40mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 19g / Battery life: Up to 5 days / Display type: “Hidden” OLED touchscreen / GPS: Tethered GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/A

What I love most about the Vivomove Sport is that it doesn’t look like what most people expect from a Garmin. It’s a hybrid smartwatch, which means it looks like a regular watch but can track fitness and deliver notifications. Garmin’s hybrids are also unique in that they all use an OLED display that stays hidden until you need it.

This is best suited for a casually active person who wants style and value in a lightweight package. Think wellness, more so than fitness. It gets you continuous heart rate monitoring and blood oxygen level monitoring, and can even provide abnormal heart rate alerts. You also get access to more in-depth metrics like respiration rate, fitness age, stress, and Body Battery, which is Garmin’s tool for visualizing how well-rested you are. For smart features, you get all the basics, like notifications, alarms, and timers.

The Sport isn’t quite as full-featured as some other Garmin watches you’ll find on this list. For instance, you’re giving up built-in GPS in favor of tethered GPS through your phone. There are no contactless payments, nor is there a microphone or speaker for taking calls on the wrist. But this is a budget pick, and you get a lot, considering this is an entry-level gadget that could pass for a Swatch at a glance.

I don’t love that the battery life is short for a hybrid, at around three to four days. Even so, that’s still much better than what you’ll get on a recent Apple Watch or Android watch running Wear OS 5 or 6. If you’re willing to spend about $100 more, the $269.99 Vivomove Trend has more chic materials, gets you more screen real estate, and wireless Qi charging. Otherwise, this is a great lifestyle wearable that can serve as a classier alternative to your typical fitness band.

The Garmin Lily 2 is a simple yet chic hybrid analog smartwatch that delivers basic fitness tracking, notifications, and up to five days of battery life.

If you prefer something newer to the Sport that’s also stylish, the Garmin Lily 2 is another good option, especially if you’ve got particularly small wrists or prefer something extremely lightweight. The swipe and tap gestures are still a little fiddly to use — which was also the case with the first-gen model — but the fresh design is a fun way to lightly monitor your fitness without bogging yourself down with notifications. Garmin also offers the Lily 2 Active, which adds a physical button, GPS, and support for more sports tracking for a starting price of $299.99.

Bright displayLong battery lifeTons of training and health features

Sizes: 40mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 38g / Battery life: Up to 11 days / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 4GB (for Music Edition)

If you were disappointed by the Fitbit Sense 2 and Versa 4, the Venu Sq 2 is the next best thing (and, in some ways, better).

At a glance, the Venu Sq 2 could easily be mistaken for an Apple Watch. On the wrist, you’ll notice it’s made of plastic, but it still looks quite chic and extremely lightweight. The screen is bright, easy to read, and looks better than any Versa or Sense ever did.

The feature set is also great for the price, with built-in GPS, a ton of watch faces, emergency safety features, and contactless payments. If you pay $50 more for the Music Edition, you’ll also get enough storage to hold about 500 songs, but we wouldn’t recommend it. This watch doesn’t have cellular connectivity and, therefore, isn’t truly standalone. You’ll most likely be carrying your phone with you anyway.

As for health features, the Venu Sq 2 basically has everything you’d get on a Versa or Sense smartwatch but with Garmin’s treasure trove of metrics as well. That includes heart rate tracking, blood oxygen tracking, intensity minutes (how much moderate exercise you get in a week), stress tracking, hydration tracking, respiratory rate, period tracking, and Garmin’s recovery feature, Body Battery. As far as fitness goes, you also get access to Garmin Coach, which provides free 5K, 10K, and half marathon training plans. You love to see it.

Another big leg-up Garmin has over Fitbit? None of these features or metrics are locked behind a paywall, even if Garmin’s AI-powered insights and a few other expanded features are only available as part of Garmin Connect Plus ($6.99 a month / $69.99 annually).

Good battery lifeBetter sleep tracking and nap detectionEKG and AFib featuresCan take calls and use your phone’s voice assistantAudio meditation sessions done well

Pricey compared to other lifestyle smartwatchesLimited third-party app ecosystemNo LTE capability

Sizes: 41mm w/ 18mm straps; 45mm w/ 22mm straps / Weight: 40g for the 3S; 47g for the 3 / Battery life: Up to 10 days for 3S; 14 days for 3 / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 8GB

Garmin has shored up the smarts in its watches over the past several years, and the Venu 3 series is one of the smartest (and most affordable) of the bunch.

The Venu 3 series comes in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. Like the Venu 2 Plus, it has a microphone and speaker. You can take calls directly from the wrist and issue commands to your phone’s digital assistant via Bluetooth. It’s not the same as having Siri, Bixby, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant built directly into the watch, but it’s a clever workaround that works well for hands-free control. It also supports safety features like fall detection and live tracking, as well as contactless payments.

Like other OLED Garmins, the display is both vibrant and easy to read. As for health and fitness, you get a nice mix of basic and more advanced features and metrics. It has a heart rate sensor that enables FDA-cleared EKG and AFib detection features. Overall, it leans a bit more on the wellness and health side of things, with intensity minutes, blood oxygen monitoring, sleep tracking, period tracking, abnormal heart rate alerts, and stress tracking. As for training, you still get built-in GPS, VO2 Max, heart rate zones, respiration rate, and downloadable training plans via Garmin Coach.

The Venu 3 and 3S have a sleep coach that factors in metrics like heart rate variability and recent activity to determine your sleep needs. It also adds nap detection, a feature that’s been long overdue for the Garmin platform, and audio-guided meditation sessions. From an accessibility standpoint, this also adds a wheelchair mode.

Technically, the Fenix 8 is slightly smarter in that it has an onboard voice assistant. However, it is also more than double the price and not what I’d consider a good value for the average athlete. It’s more for people who spend hours upon hours training every week.

This is the Garmin for you if you want the platform’s in-depth training without sacrificing the productivity of a smartwatch. The main features it’s lacking are cellular options and a robust third-party app ecosystem. That said, it’s got Spotify, Amazon Music, and Deezer for offline listening. It’s also a good option if you’re fed up with MIP displays and want a smarter Garmin rather than a full-on smartwatch.

However, it is worth noting that Garmin recently launched the Garmin Venu 4. That model is available in two sizes, 41mm and 45mm, both of which are available from Amazon, Best Buy, and Garmin for $549.99. The smartwatch features more advanced wellness features than the Venu 3, including the ability to log your caffeine and alcohol intake, providing insights into how they may be impacting your sleep. Garmin’s Fitness Coach can also create a personalized workout regimen from a pool of 25 exercises, which are based on your prior performance, recovery level, and recent sleep patterns.

A more efficient version of the Gemini 3 Pro model offers faster responses while retaining the flagship model’s reasoning capabilities.

Google is upgrading its Gemini app with Gemini 3 Flash, a more efficient version of its flagship AI model that’s still capable of fielding complex requests. The new model will replace Gemini 2.5 Flash as the default inside the Gemini app, and it’s headed to Google Search, too.

Its arrival comes one month after the launch of Gemini 3 Pro, which showed advancements in reasoning, coding, and its ability to process images, text, and videos simultaneously. Google says Gemini 3 Flash “retains this foundation, combining Gemini 3’s Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level latency, efficiency and cost.”

Tulsee Doshi, Google DeepMind’s senior director and head of product, tells The Verge that the jump to Gemini 3 Flash will be a “huge upgrade” for most users. “With Gemini 3 Flash… it’ll be a faster turnaround from a latency perspective,” Doshi says, adding that you’ll also see “more detailed, nuanced answers” when compared to Gemini 2.5 Flash.

Gemini 3 Flash also outperforms the last-gen flagship, Gemini 2.5 Pro, while operating at a “fraction of the cost,” according to Google. As an example, the company says Gemini 3 Flash can generate a plan based on a series of videos and images in “just a few seconds.” In addition to launching inside the Gemini app globally, Gemini 3 Flash is becoming the default model powering AI Mode in Google Search, which previously ran on 2.5 Flash.

Google is bringing Gemini 3 Flash to developers as well. It’s coming to Google AI Studio, the Gemini API, Google Antigravity, Gemini CLI, Android Studio, and Vertex AI.

            <div id="article-text">A new study estimates the environmental impact of AI in 2025 and calls for more transparency from companies on their pollution and water consumption.

A new study estimates the environmental impact of AI in 2025 and calls for more transparency from companies on their pollution and water consumption.

AI created as much carbon pollution this year as New York City and guzzled up as much H20 as people consume globally in water bottles, according to new estimates.

The study paints what’s likely a pretty conservative picture of AI’s environmental impact since it’s based on the relatively limited amount of data that’s currently available to the public. A lack of transparency from tech companies makes it harder to see the potential environmental toll of AI becoming a part of everyday tasks, argues the author of the study who’s been tracking the electricity consumption of data centers used for AI and crypto mining over the years.

“There’s no way to put an extremely accurate number on this, but it’s going to be really big regardless… In the end, everyone is paying the price for this,” says Alex de Vries-Gao, a PhD candidate at the VU Amsterdam Institute for Environmental Studies who published his paper today in the journal Patterns.

“In the end, everyone is paying the price for this.”

To crunch these numbers, de Vries-Gao built on earlier research that found that power demand for AI globally could reach 23GW this year — surpassing the amount of electricity used for Bitcoin mining in 2024. While many tech companies divulge total numbers for their carbon emissions and direct water use in annual sustainability reports, they don’t typically break those numbers down to show how many resources AI consumes. De Vries-Gao found a work-around by using analyst estimates, companies’ earnings calls, and other publicly available information to gauge hardware production for AI and how much energy that hardware likely uses.

Once he figured out how much electricity these AI systems would likely consume, he could use that to forecast the amount of planet-heating pollution that would likely create. That came out to between 32.6 and 79.7 million tons annually. For comparison, New York City emits around 50 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.

Data centers can also be big water guzzlers, an issue that’s similarly tied to their electricity use. Water is used in cooling systems for data centers to keep servers from overheating. Power plants also demand significant amounts of water needed to cool equipment and turn turbines using steam, which makes up a majority of a data center’s water footprint. The push to build new data centers for generative AI has also fueled plans to build more power plants, which in turn use more water and (and create more greenhouse gas pollution if they burn fossil fuels).

AI could use between 312.5 and 764.6 billion liters of water this year, according to de Vries-Gao. That reaches even higher than a previous study conducted in 2023 that estimates that water use could be as much as 600 billion liters in 2027.

“I think that’s the biggest surprise,” says Shaolei Ren, one of the authors of that 2023 study and an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside. “[de Vries-Gao’s] paper is really timely… especially as we are seeing increasingly polarized views about AI and water,” Ren adds.

Across the US, which has more of these facilities than any other country in the world, there’s been a surge in local opposition to new data center projects that is often driven by concerns about water and power usage.

Even with the higher projection for water use, Ren says de Vries-Gao’s analysis is “really conservative” because it only captures the environmental effects of operating AI equipment — excluding the additional effects that accumulate along the supply chain and at the end of a device’s life.

There’s a pretty wide range of outcomes because companies are failing to disclose more accurate data. De Vries-Gao gathered whatever information he could from sustainability reports, but found that they often exclude key details, like their indirect water consumption from electricity demand and how much is used for AI specifically. Emissions and water consumption can vary depending on where a data center is located and how dirty the local power grid is in there, so being more forthcoming about where they operate or plan to build new data centers would also shine a greater light on AI’s growing environmental impact.

“We can really ask ourselves, is this how we want it to be? Is this fair?” de Vries-Gao says. “We really need to have that transparency, so we can start having that discussion.”

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/17/1129259/omar-yaghi-chemist-nobel-prize-crystals-water-air/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Omar Yaghi was a quiet child, diligent, unlikely to roughhouse with his nine siblings. So when he was old enough, his parents tasked him with one of the family’s most vital chores: fetching water. Like most homes in his Palestinian neighborhood in Amman, Jordan, the Yaghis’ had no electricity or running water. At least once every two weeks, the city switched on local taps for a few hours so residents could fill their tanks. Young Omar helped top up the family supply. Decades later, he says he can’t remember once showing up late. The fear of leaving his parents, seven brothers, and two sisters parched kept him punctual.

Yaghi proved so dependable that his father put him in charge of monitoring how much the cattle destined for the family butcher shop ate and drank. The best-­quality cuts came from well-fed, hydrated animals—a challenge given that they were raised in arid desert.

Specially designed materials called metal-organic frameworks can pull water from the air like a sponge—and then give it back.

But at 10 years old, Yaghi learned of a different occupation. Hoping to avoid a rambunctious crowd at recess, he found the library doors in his school unbolted and sneaked in. Thumbing through a chemistry textbook, he saw an image he didn’t understand: little balls connected by sticks in fascinating shapes. Molecules. The building blocks of everything.

“I didn’t know what they were, but it captivated my attention,” Yaghi says. “I kept trying to figure out what they might be.”

That’s how he discovered chemistry—or maybe how chemistry discovered him. After coming to the United States and, eventually, a postdoctoral program at Harvard University, Yaghi devoted his career to finding ways to make entirely new and fascinating shapes for those little sticks and balls. In October 2025, he was one of three scientists who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for identifying metal-­organic frameworks, or MOFs—metal ions tethered to organic molecules that form repeating structural landscapes. Today that work is the basis for a new project that sounds like science fiction, or a miracle: conjuring water out of thin air.

When he first started working with MOFs, Yaghi thought they might be able to absorb climate-damaging carbon dioxide—or maybe hold hydrogen molecules, solving the thorny problem of storing that climate-friendly but hard-to-contain fuel. But then, in 2014, Yaghi’s team of researchers at UC Berkeley had an epiphany. The tiny pores in MOFs could be designed so the material would pull water molecules from the air around them, like a sponge—and then, with just a little heat, give back that water as if squeezed dry. Just one gram of a water-absorbing MOF has an internal surface area of roughly 7,000 square meters.

Yaghi wasn’t the first to try to pull potable water from the atmosphere. But his method could do it at lower levels of humidity than rivals—potentially shaking up a tiny, nascent industry that could be critical to humanity in the thirsty decades to come. Now the company he founded, called Atoco, is racing to demonstrate a pair of machines that Yaghi believes could produce clean, fresh, drinkable water virtually anywhere on Earth, without even hooking up to an energy supply.

That’s the goal Yaghi has been working toward for more than a decade now, with the rigid determination that he learned while doing chores in his father’s butcher shop.

“It was in that shop where I learned how to perfect things, how to have a work ethic,” he says. “I learned that a job is not done until it is well done. Don’t start a job unless you can finish it.”

Most of Earth is covered in water, but just 3% of it is fresh, with no salt—the kind of water all terrestrial living things need. Today, desalination plants that take the salt out of seawater provide the bulk of potable water in technologically advanced desert nations like Israel and the United Arab Emirates, but at a high cost. Desalination facilities either heat water to distill out the drinkable stuff or filter it with membranes the salt doesn’t pass through; both methods require a lot of energy and leave behind concentrated brine. Typically desal pumps send that brine back into the ocean, with devastating ecological effects.

I was talking to Atoco executives about carbon dioxide capture earlier this year when they mentioned the possibility of harvesting water from the atmosphere. Of course my mind immediately jumped to Star Wars, and Luke Skywalker working on his family’s moisture farm, using “vaporators” to pull water from the atmosphere of the arid planet Tatooine. (Other sci-fi fans’ minds might go to Dune, and the water-gathering technology of the Fremen.) Could this possibly be real?

It turns out people have been doing it for millennia. Archaeological evidence of water harvesting from fog dates back as far as 5000 BCE. The ancient Greeks harvested dew, and 500 years ago so did the Inca, using mesh nets and buckets under trees.

Today, harvesting water from the air is a business already worth billions of dollars, say industry analysts—and it’s on track to be worth billions more in the next five years. In part that’s because typical sources of fresh water are in crisis. Less snowfall in mountains during hotter winters means less meltwater in the spring, which means less water downstream. Droughts regularly break records. Rising seas seep into underground aquifers, already drained by farming and sprawling cities. Aging septic tanks leach bacteria into water, and cancer-causing “forever chemicals” are creating what the US Government Accountability Office last year said “may be the biggest water problem since lead.” That doesn’t even get to the emerging catastrophe from microplastics.

So lots of places are turning to atmospheric water harvesting. Watergen, an Israel-based company working on the tech, initially planned on deploying in the arid, poorer parts of the world. Instead, buyers in Europe and the United States have approached the company as a way to ensure a clean supply of water. And one of Watergen’s biggest markets is the wealthy United Arab Emirates. “When you say ‘water crisis,’ it’s not just the lack of water—it’s access to good-quality water,” says Anna Chernyavsky, Watergen’s vice president of marketing.

In other words, the technology “has evolved from lab prototypes to robust, field-deployable systems,” says Guihua Yu, a mechanical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin. “There is still room to improve productivity and energy efficiency in the whole-system level, but so much progress has been steady and encouraging.”

MOFs are just the latest approach to the idea. The first generation of commercial tech depended on compressors and refrigerant chemicals—large-scale versions of the machine that keeps food cold and fresh in your kitchen. Both use electricity and a clot of pipes and exchangers to make cold by phase-shifting a chemical from gas to liquid and back; refrigerators try to limit condensation, and water generators basically try to enhance it.

That’s how Watergen’s tech works: using a compressor and a heat exchanger to wring water from air at humidity levels as low as 20%—Death Valley in the spring. “We’re talking about deserts,” Chernyavsky says. “Below 20%, you get nosebleeds.”

That still might not be good enough. “Refrigeration works pretty well when you are above a certain relative humidity,” says Sameer Rao, a mechanical engineer at the University of Utah who researches atmospheric water harvesting. “As the environment dries out, you go to lower relative humidities, and it becomes harder and harder. In some cases, it’s impossible for refrigeration-based systems to really work.”

So a second wave of technology has found a market. Companies like Source Global use desiccants—substances that absorb moisture from the air, like the silica packets found in vitamin bottles—to pull in moisture and then release it when heated. In theory, the benefit of desiccant-­based tech is that it could absorb water at lower humidity levels, and it uses less energy on the front end since it isn’t running a condenser system. Source Global claims its off-grid, solar-powered system is deployed in dozens of countries.

But both technologies still require a lot of energy, either to run the heat exchangers or to generate sufficient heat to release water from the desiccants. MOFs, Yaghi hopes, do not. Now Atoco is trying to prove it. Instead of using heat exchangers to bring the air temperature to dew point or desiccants to attract water from the atmosphere, a system can rely on specially designed MOFs to attract water molecules. Atoco’s prototype version uses an MOF that looks like baby powder, stuck to a surface like glass. The pores in the MOF naturally draw in water molecules but remain open, making it theoretically easy to discharge the water with no more heat than what comes from direct sunlight. Atoco’s industrial-scale design uses electricity to speed up the process, but the company is working on a second design that can operate completely off grid, without any energy input.

Yaghi’s Atoco isn’t the only contender seeking to use MOFs for water harvesting. A competitor, AirJoule, has introduced MOF-based atmospheric water generators in Texas and the UAE and is working with researchers at Arizona State University, planning to deploy more units in the coming months. The company started out trying to build more efficient air-­conditioning for electric buses operating on hot, humid city streets. But then founder Matt Jore heard about US government efforts to harvest water from air—and pivoted. The startup’s stock price has been a bit of a roller-­coaster, but Jore says the sheer size of the market should keep him in business. Take Maricopa County, encompassing Phoenix and its environs—it uses 1.2 billion gallons of water from its shrinking aquifer every day, and another 874 million gallons from surface sources like rivers.

“So, a couple of billion gallons a day, right?” Jore tells me. “You know how much influx is in the atmosphere every day? Twenty-five billion gallons.”

“Just the greater Phoenix area gets influx of about 25 billion gallons of water in the air,” he says. “If you can tap into it, that’s your source. And it’s not going away. It’s all around the world. We view the atmosphere as the world’s free pipeline.”

Besides AirJoule’s head start on Atoco, the companies also differ on where they get their MOFs. AirJoule’s system relies on an off-the-shelf version the company buys from the chemical giant BASF; Atoco aims to use Yaghi’s skill with designing the novel material to create bespoke MOFs for different applications and locations.

“Given the fact that we have the inventor of the whole class of materials, and we leverage the stuff that comes out of his lab at Berkeley—everything else equal, we have a good starting point to engineer maybe the best materials in the world,” says Magnus Bach, Atoco’s VP of business development.

Yaghi envisions a two-pronged product line. Industrial-scale water generators that run on electricity would be capable of producing thousands of liters per day on one end, while units that run on passive systems could operate in remote locations without power, just harnessing energy from the sun and ambient temperatures. In theory, these units could someday replace desalination and even entire municipal water supplies. The next round of field tests is scheduled for early 2026, in the Mojave Desert—one of the hottest, driest places on Earth.

“That’s my dream,” Yaghi says. “To give people water independence, so they’re not reliant on another party for their lives.”

Both Yaghi and Watergen’s Chernyavsky say they’re looking at more decentralized versions that could operate outside municipal utility systems. Home appliances, similar to rooftop solar panels and batteries, could allow households to generate their own water off grid.

That could be tricky, though, without economies of scale to bring down prices. “You have to produce, you have to cool, you have to filter—all in one place,” Chernyavsky says. “So to make it small is very, very challenging.”

Difficult as that may be, Yaghi’s childhood gave him a particular appreciation for the freedom to go off grid, to liberate the basic necessity of water from the whims of systems that dictate when and how people can access it.

“That’s really my dream,” he says. “To give people independence, water independence, so that they’re not reliant on another party for their livelihood or lives.”

Toward the end of one of our conversations, I asked Yaghi what he would tell the younger version of himself if he could. “Jordan is one of the worst countries in terms of the impact of water stress,” he said. “I would say, ‘Continue to be diligent and observant. It doesn’t really matter what you’re pursuing, as long as you’re passionate.’”

I pressed him for something more specific: “What do you think he’d say when you described this technology to him?”

Yaghi smiled: “I think young Omar would think you’re putting him on, that this is all fictitious and you’re trying to take something from him.” This reality, in other words, would be beyond young Omar’s wildest dreams.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rolling out enterprise-grade AI means climbing two steep cliffs at once. First, understanding and implementing the tech itself. And second, creating the cultural conditions where employees can maximize its value. While the technical hurdles are signiﬁcant, the human element can be even more consequential; fear and ambiguity can stall momentum of even the most promising initiatives.

Psychological safety—feeling free to express opinions and take calculated risks without worrying about career repercussions1—is essential for successful AI adoption. In psychologically safe workspaces, employees are empowered to challenge assumptions and raise concerns about new tools without fear of reprisal. This is nothing short of a necessity when introducing a nascent and profoundly powerful technology that still lacks established best practices.

“Psychological safety is mandatory in this new era of AI,” says Rafee Tarafdar, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Infosys. “The tech itself is evolving so fast—companies have to experiment, and some things will fail. There needs to be a safety net.”

To gauge how psychological safety influences success with enterprise-level AI, MIT Technology Review Insights conducted a survey of 500 business leaders. The ﬁndings reveal high self-reported levels of psychological safety, but also suggest that fear still has a foothold. Anecdotally, industry experts highlight a reason for the disconnect between rhetoric and reality: while organizations may promote a safe to experiment message publicly, deeper cultural undercurrents can counteract that intent.

Building psychological safety requires a coordinated, systems-level approach, and human resources (HR) alone cannot deliver such transformation. Instead, enterprises must deeply embed psychological safety into their collaboration processes.

AI tools that may have been used were limited to secondary production processes that passed thorough human review.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

Some disillusionment was inevitable. When OpenAI released a free web app called ChatGPT in late 2022, it changed the course of an entire industry—and several world economies. Millions of people started talking to their computers, and their computers started talking back. We were enchanted, and we expected more.Well, 2025 has been a year of reckoning. For a start, the heads of the top AI companies made promises they couldn’t keep. At the same time, updates to the core technology are no longer the step changes they once were.To be clear, the last few years have been filled with genuine “Wow” moments. But this remarkable technology is only a few years old, and in many ways it is still experimental. Its successes come with big caveats.

Quantum navigation could solve the military’s GPS jamming problem

Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thousands of flights have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of using radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.One approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
