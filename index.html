            <h2>ChatGPT Health lets you connect medical records to an AI that makes things up</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/chatgpt-health-lets-you-connect-medical-records-to-an-ai-that-makes-things-up/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, OpenAI announced ChatGPT Health, a dedicated section of the AI chatbot designed for “health and wellness conversations” intended to connect a user’s health and medical records to the chatbot in a secure way.

But mixing generative AI technology like ChatGPT with health advice or analysis of any kind has been a controversial idea since the launch of the service in late 2022. Just days ago, SFGate published an investigation detailing how a 19-year-old California man died of a drug overdose in May 2025 after 18 months of seeking recreational drug advice from ChatGPT. It’s a telling example of what can go wrong when chatbot guardrails fail during long conversations and people follow erroneous AI guidance.

Despite the known accuracy issues with AI chatbots, OpenAI’s new Health feature will allow users to connect medical records and wellness apps like Apple Health and MyFitnessPal so that ChatGPT can provide personalized health responses like summarizing care instructions, preparing for doctor appointments, and understanding test results.

OpenAI says more than 230 million people ask health questions on ChatGPT each week, making it one of the chatbot’s most common use cases. The company worked with more than 260 physicians over two years to develop ChatGPT Health and says conversations in the new section will not be used to train its AI models.

“ChatGPT Health is another step toward turning ChatGPT into a personal super-assistant that can support you with information and tools to achieve your goals across any part of your life,” wrote Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, in a blog post.

But despite OpenAI’s talk of supporting health goals, the company’s terms of service directly state that ChatGPT and other OpenAI services “are not intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health condition.”

It appears that policy is not changing with ChatGPT Health. OpenAI writes in its announcement, “Health is designed to support, not replace, medical care. It is not intended for diagnosis or treatment. Instead, it helps you navigate everyday questions and understand patterns over time—not just moments of illness—so you can feel more informed and prepared for important medical conversations.”

The SFGate report on Sam Nelson’s death illustrates why maintaining that disclaimer legally matters. According to chat logs reviewed by the publication, Nelson first asked ChatGPT about recreational drug dosing in November 2023. The AI assistant initially refused and directed him to health care professionals. But over 18 months of conversations, ChatGPT’s responses reportedly shifted. Eventually, the chatbot told him things like “Hell yes—let’s go full trippy mode” and recommended he double his cough syrup intake. His mother found him dead from an overdose the day after he began addiction treatment.

While Nelson’s case did not involve the analysis of doctor-sanctioned health care instructions like the type ChatGPT Health will link to, his case is not unique, as many people have been misled by chatbots that provide inaccurate information or encourage dangerous behavior, as we have covered in the past.

That’s because AI language models can easily confabulate, generating plausible but false information in a way that makes it difficult for some users to distinguish fact from fiction. The AI models that services like ChatGPT use statistical relationships in training data (like the text from books, YouTube transcripts, and websites) to produce plausible responses rather than necessarily accurate ones. Moreover, ChatGPT’s outputs can vary widely depending on who is using the chatbot and what has previously taken place in the user’s chat history (including notes about previous chats).

Then there’s the issue of unreliable training data, which companies like OpenAI use to create the models. Fundamentally, all major AI language models rely on information pulled from sources of information collected online. Rob Eleveld of the AI regulatory watchdog Transparency Coalition told SFGate: “There is zero chance, zero chance, that the foundational models can ever be safe on this stuff. Because what they sucked in there is everything on the Internet. And everything on the Internet is all sorts of completely false crap.”

So when summarizing a medical report or analyzing a test result, ChatGPT could make a mistake that the user, not being trained in medicine, would not be able to spot.

Even with these hazards, it’s likely that the quality of health-related chats with the AI bot can vary dramatically between users because ChatGPT’s output partially mirrors the style and tone of what users feed into the system. For example, anecdotally, some users claim to find ChatGPT useful for medical issues, though some successes for a few users who know how to navigate the bot’s hazards do not necessarily mean that relying on a chatbot for medical analysis is wise for the general public. That’s doubly true in the absence of government regulation and safety testing.

In a statement to SFGate, OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood called Nelson’s death “a heartbreaking situation” and said the company’s models are designed to respond to sensitive questions “with care.”

ChatGPT Health is rolling out to a waitlist of US users, with broader access planned in the coming weeks.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nintendo’s Switch 2 was an unmitigated market success for Nintendo following its launch last June, selling a record-setting 3.5 million units worldwide in its first four days and reaching over 10 million shipments in just under four months. But a new report from The Game Business suggests that frenzied initial sales pace may have slowed significantly in many markets during the system’s crucial first holiday season.

The report suggests that US Switch 2 sales were down about 35 percent during November and December compared to sales of the original Switch in the same period in 2017. In the UK, Switch 2 sales were down 16 percent compared to the original Switch during the last eight weeks of the year. And in France, comparative Switch 2 sales were down 30 percent relative to the Switch for the same period, reflecting what The Game Business says is “a slowdown in Switch 2 sales momentum over the Christmas sales window” across “all major European markets.”

The Switch 2’s relative performance was a little better in Japan, where sales for the holiday period declined just 5.5 percent compared to the original Switch. For the full launch year, though, Japanese Switch 2 sales were up 11 percent compared to the Switch launch, thanks perhaps in part to a cheaper Japan-only version of the console that isn’t subject to the vagaries of international currency valuations.

To be fair, the original Switch’s first holiday season set a high bar for any new Nintendo console to meet. When the Switch proved unexpectedly popular following its March 2017 launch, Nintendo hastily bumped worldwide production by 4 million units to help ameliorate holiday shortages. That helped the first Switch sell 15 million units in its first full year on store shelves, roughly mirroring the initial sales mania for the Nintendo Wii a decade earlier.

Lingering sales of the original Switch might also be contributing to the relatively weak holiday performance for the Switch 2. In the UK, at least, the older console is still selling well enough to buoy Nintendo’s overall holiday hardware sales in the country to 7 percent higher than what the company achieved in 2017.

That said, the transition from record-setting launch sales to relatively underwhelming holiday sales is a worrying sign for the Switch 2’s market momentum. A lack of system-selling Switch 2 exclusive games could explain that movement. In 2017, the October launch of Super Mario Odyssey built holiday excitement for the Switch on top of earlier hits like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. For the Switch 2, holiday releases like Pokémon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4 don’t seem to have had as much impact as early system sellers like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza.

Thus far, Nintendo’s planned 2026 schedule doesn’t seem primed to offer many big-name exclusive software to turn things around. The year’s first-party lineup is currently anchored by standard sequels for second-tier franchises like Yoshi, Mario Tennis, and Fire Emblem, alongside slightly upgraded “Switch 2 Edition” re-releases of popular Switch games. Aside from Nintendo’s own titles, the planned 2026 release of FromSoft’s Bloodborne-esque Duskbloods as a Switch 2 exclusive could make some fans of the company’s Souls-like games take a second look at the hardware.

Nintendo is likely to announce more Switch 2 exclusives and ports in the coming months, of course. Having a few system-selling blockbusters in that slate could be crucial to propping up the Switch 2’s sales now that pent-up launch-window demand seems largely satiated.</div>

            <h2>Trump withdraws US from world’s most important climate treaty</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/trump-withdraws-us-from-worlds-most-important-climate-treaty/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Donald Trump has decided to withdraw the US from the world’s most important climate treaty, as well as from dozens of other international organizations, as the president intensifies efforts to upend decades of global cooperation tackling rising temperatures.

In a presidential memorandum issued on Wednesday evening, Trump said the US would withdraw from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and 65 additional UN and other multilateral groups, mostly linked to the environment, renewable energy, development, education, and the promotion of democracy and human rights.

They include the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the global body of climate scientists, the International Trade Centre, the UN Population Fund, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN’s climate arm, said the US was “instrumental in creating” both the UNFCCC and the Paris agreement, adding its departure was a “colossal own goal” that would leave the country “less secure and less prosperous.”

The 1992 UNFCCC treaty underpins international cooperation to deal with climate change. The latest announcement comes almost a year after Trump, who last year branded climate change a “con job,” announced that he would pull the US from the 2015 Paris climate agreement for the second time. During his first term, the US became the first and so far only country to withdraw from the accord, but Joe Biden rejoined.

The White House said the decision to pull out from a total of 66 international organizations, including 31 UN entities, was intended to save US taxpayers money and advance Trump’s “America First” agenda.

“American taxpayers have spent billions on these organizations with little return, while they often criticize US policies, advance agendas contrary to our values, or waste taxpayer dollars,” the White House said in a factsheet issued alongside the executive order.

But the move was met with heavy criticism from climate experts and organizations, as well as politicians.

Wopke Hoekstra, the EU’s climate commissioner, said the decision by the world’s largest economy and second-largest emitter to retreat from the UNFCCC was “regrettable and unfortunate,” adding that the treaty “underpins global climate action.”

Former US Vice President Al Gore said the work of the IPCC, UNFCCC, and other global institutions was “essential to safeguarding humanity’s future.”

“By withdrawing from the IPCC, UNFCCC, and the other vital international partnerships, the Trump administration is undoing decades of hard-won diplomacy, attempting to undermine climate science and sowing distrust around the world,” he said.

“Fortunately, 198 [signatories to the treaty] minus one does not equal zero.”

Despite Trump’s decision to pull the US from the Paris agreement last year, no other country has followed his approach.

As one of the world’s biggest emitters, the US has long played a crucial role in global efforts to tackle climate change. Many countries are now increasingly looking to China—the world’s largest emitter but also the dominant player in green technology—to drive progress.

Former US Secretary of State John Kerry, who worked as Joe Biden’s presidential envoy for climate, said the withdrawal from the climate treaty was “par for the course” for the Trump administration.

“But it doesn’t change the fact that it’s a gift to China and a get-out-of-jail-free card to countries and polluters who want to avoid responsibility.”

The past three years have been the hottest on record, with scientists warning climate change is making extreme weather events more intense.

The actual impact of the US withdrawal on many of the UN bodies singled out by Trump would depend on how aggressively his administration followed through on its announcement.

The head of one of the UN bodies named in the executive order said that the full effect of the move would become clear only during the UN’s annual budget allocation process.

“If they want to be difficult they could block the adoption of our budget. So it depends on how far they want to take it,” the person added.

Although the list caused anguish among environmental groups, it did not go as far as originally envisaged on trade and economic matters after the administration quietly dropped the World Trade Organization and the OECD from its list of potential targets last year.

In October, it emerged that Trump had authorized the payment of $25 million in overdue subscriptions to the WTO, despite the administration deriding the organization as “toothless” only a month previously.

The list also did not include the International Maritime Organization despite the Trump administration’s successful—and diplomatically bruising—move last year to block the IMO’s plan to introduce a net zero framework for shipping.

Sue Biniaz, the former US climate negotiator, said she hoped the retreat from the UNFCCC treaty was “a temporary one,” adding there were “multiple future pathways to rejoining the key climate agreements” in future.

Stiell of the UNFCCC agreed: “The doors remain open for the US to re-enter in the future, as it has in the past with the Paris Agreement. Meanwhile the size of the commercial opportunity in clean energy, climate resilience, and advanced electrotech remains too big for American investors and businesses to ignore.”

He added: “While all other nations are stepping forward together, this latest step back from global leadership, climate co-operation, and science can only harm the US economy, jobs, and living standards, as wildfires, floods, megastorms, and droughts get rapidly worse.”

            <h2>Former Google CEO plans to singlehandedly fund a Hubble telescope replacement</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/eric-schmidt-will-massively-invest-in-private-telescopes-including-hubble-replacement/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Prior to World War II the vast majority of telescopes built around the world were funded by wealthy people with an interest in the heavens above.

However, after the war, two significant developments in the mid-20th century caused the burden of funding large astronomical instruments to largely shift to the government and academic institutions. First, as mirrors became larger and larger to see deeper into the universe, their costs grew exponentially. And then, with the advent of spaceflight, the expense of space-based telescopes expanded even further.

On Wednesday evening, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife, Wendy, announced a major investment in not just one telescope project, but four. Each of these new telescopes brings a novel capability online; however, the most intriguing new instrument is a space-based telescope named Lazuli. This spacecraft, if successfully launched and deployed, would offer astronomers a more capable and modern version of the Hubble Space Telescope, which is now three decades old.

A billionaire with a keen interest in science and technology, Schmidt and his wife did not disclose the size of his investment in the four telescopes, which collectively will be known as the Schmidt Observatory System. However, it likely is worth half a billion dollars, at a minimum.

“For 20 years, Eric and I have pursued philanthropy to seek new frontiers, whether in the deep sea or in the profound connections that link people and our planet, committing our resources to novel research that reaches beyond what might be funded by governments or the private sector,” Wendy Schmidt said in a statement to Ars. “With the Schmidt Observatory System, we’re enabling multiple approaches to understanding the vast universe where we find ourselves stewards of a living planet.”

Essentially the Schmidts have taken innovative telescope concepts that scientists have proposed for government funding and will provide the money needed to build them. Their gift has enormous potential to advance the study of astronomy and astrophysics.

Named for the deep sky blue of the rock Lapis lazuli, Lazuli is an optical space telescope with a mirror diameter of 3.1 meters (by comparison, the primary mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope is 2.4 meters). It is intended to launch as early as late 2028 and begin scientific operations in 2029.

There are some notable differences between Hubble and Lazuli, starting with the orbit. Lazuli will be located much farther from Earth, in an elliptical orbit with an apogee of 275,000 km and a perigee of 77,000 km, the latter distance about twice as high as geostationary orbit. This will afford the telescope a much clearer view than Hubble, located about 500 km above Earth and increasingly affected by the passage of Starlink and other communications satellites in its observations. At this higher altitude the Lazuli team believes it can maintain control of the telescope at all times and have a rapid data downlink.

“We sit on decades of technological developments since Hubble,” said Arpita Roy, lead of the Astrophysics & Space Institute at Schmidt Sciences, in an interview. “Lazuli is a very modern take on Hubble, with a larger mirror, swifter response, and different instruments.”

The instruments are a wide-field camera, a spectrograph, and notably, a coronagraph to blot out the light from stars to reveal the atmospheres and other details of exoplanets orbiting them.

Schmidt Sciences will act as the overall integrator and manager of the Lazuli project. The president of the philanthropic organization, Stuart Feldman, said he was not ready to disclose the telescope’s primary contractors yet. But he said a key goal of this telescope, and the other three projects, is to move quickly. Moving from a telescope concept to launching hardware in less than five years would be rapid indeed.

Feldman said in an interview that the major space telescopes planned, built, and launched by NASA have tended toward 25-year gestation periods. It is common today for an astronomer to design instruments on observatories that will only be used by their graduate students upon nearing retirement. Moving expeditiously should also better control costs.

Feldman said he had “moderate-high confidence” that deploying and operating Lazuli would be a success. “We are taking far more risks than NASA would be willing to do,” he acknowledged. “But we are doing things rigorously, and aiming for a very high probability of success.”

No privately funded observatory remotely close to Lazuli’s scope has ever been launched into space. If successful, it would be, in many ways, historic.

The other three telescopes that will be funded by the Schmidts will be based on the ground, in the southern and western United States, but they are no less innovative than Lazuli. All three of the proposed telescopes are modular and take advantage of recent advances in computing power, storage, and AI processing and analyzing data.

The design of each telescope selected for the Schmidt Observatory System feels very modern. Their designs are enabled by recent developments in the miniaturization of electrical components, more powerful computers, artificial intelligence, lower-cost launch, and other trends.

These telescopes could probably not have been built even five years ago. Feldman said the storage for some of the ground telescopes requires petabytes. AI will be crucial to poring over all of this data to uncover new and novel observations. And prior to the current class of commercial heavy-lift rockets, a telescope had to scrimp on mass and power; but now, with cheaper and brawnier launch, it’s easier just to throw more solar cells on an instrument.

The plan is to freely and openly share data from the telescopes. The Schmidts have emphasized that this is not a commercial project in any way. They will not be selling time on the telescopes. Rather, there will be an open competition for the best scientific ideas and observations to make.

“We are basically providing a gift to the global astronomical community,” Feldman said. “We wish the data to be openly available for all of the instruments.”

The Schmidts’ approach also includes tapping into emerging commercial space companies, such as Observable Space, which is building the Argus Array telescopes.

“The Argus Array’s commitment to open data and open science represents a new model for how astronomical discovery should happen,” Dan Roelker, CEO of Observable Space, said. “We’re excited to partner with the University of North Carolina and Schmidt Sciences to build the more than 1,200 telescopes designed not just for today’s questions, but for discoveries we haven’t imagined yet.”

The Schmidts have been reticent to speak about costs, but Feldman acknowledged that building and launching a space telescope will easily cost in the “hundreds of millions of dollars.” And that’s just one of the four telescopes.

“Putting up a whole valley filled with 20-foot antennas is not child’s play either,” he said. “This is a very significant contribution to astronomy.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/chatgpt-falls-to-new-data-pilfering-attack-as-a-vicious-cycle-in-ai-continues/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a well-worn pattern in the development of AI chatbots. Researchers discover a vulnerability and exploit it to do something bad. The platform introduces a guardrail that stops the attack from working. Then, researchers devise a simple tweak that once again imperils chatbot users.

The reason more often than not is that AI is so inherently designed to comply with user requests that the guardrails are reactive and ad hoc, meaning they are built to foreclose a specific attack technique rather than the broader class of vulnerabilities that make it possible. It’s tantamount to putting a new highway guardrail in place in response to a recent crash of a compact car but failing to safeguard larger types of vehicles.

One of the latest examples is a vulnerability recently discovered in ChatGPT. It allowed researchers at Radware to surreptitiously exfiltrate a user’s private information. Their attack also allowed for the data to be sent directly from ChatGPT servers, a capability that gave it additional stealth, since there were no signs of breach on user machines, many of which are inside protected enterprises. Further, the exploit planted entries in the long-term memory that the AI assistant stores for the targeted user, giving it persistence.

This sort of attack has been demonstrated repeatedly against virtually all major large language models. One example was ShadowLeak, a data-exfiltration vulnerability in ChatGPT that Radware disclosed last September. It targeted Deep Research, a Chat-GPT-integrated AI agent that OpenAI had introduced earlier in the year.

In response, OpenAI introduced mitigations that blocked the attack. With modest effort, however, Radware has found a bypass method that effectively revived ShadowLeak. The security firm has named the revised attack ZombieAgent.

“Attackers can easily design prompts that technically comply with these rules while still achieving malicious goals,” Radware researchers wrote in a post on Thursday. “For example, ZombieAgent used a character-by-character exfiltration technique and indirect link manipulation to circumvent the guardrails OpenAI implemented to prevent its predecessor, ShadowLeak, from exfiltrating sensitive information. Because the LLM has no inherent understanding of intent and no reliable boundary between system instructions and external content, these attacker methods remain effective despite incremental vendor improvements.”

ZombieAgent was also able to give the attack persistence by directing ChatGPT to store the bypass logic in the long-term memory assigned to each user.

As is the case with a vast number of other LLM vulnerabilities, the root cause is the inability to distinguish valid instructions in prompts from users and those embedded into emails or other documents that anyone—including attackers—can send to the target. When the user configures the AI agent to summarize an email, the LLM interprets instructions incorporated into a message as a valid prompt.

AI developers have so far been unable to devise a means for LLMs to distinguish between the sources of the directives. As a result, platforms must resort to blocking specific attacks. Developers remain unable to reliably close this class of vulnerability, known as indirect prompt injection, or simply prompt injection.

The prompt injection ShadowLeak used instructed Deep Research to write a Radware-controlled link and append parameters to it. The injection defined the parameters as an employee’s name and address. When Deep Research complied, it opened the link and, in the process, exfiltrated the information to the website’s event log.

To block the attack, OpenAI restricted ChatGPT to solely open URLs exactly as provided and refuse to add parameters to them, even when explicitly instructed to do otherwise. With that, ShadowLeak was blocked, since the LLM was unable to construct new URLs by concatenating words or names, appending query parameters, or inserting user-derived data into a base URL.

Radware’s ZombieAgent tweak was simple. The researchers revised the prompt injection to supply a complete list of pre-constructed URLs. Each one contained the base URL appended by a single number or letter of the alphabet, for example, example.com/a, example.com/b, and every subsequent letter of the alphabet, along with example.com/0 through example.com/9. The prompt also instructed the agent to substitute a special token for spaces.

ZombieAgent worked because OpenAI developers didn’t restrict the appending of a single letter to a URL. That allowed the attack to exfiltrate data letter by letter.

OpenAI has mitigated the ZombieAgent attack by restricting ChatGPT from opening any link originating from an email unless it either appears in a well-known public index or was provided directly by the user in a chat prompt. The tweak is aimed at barring the agent from opening base URLs that lead to an attacker-controlled domain.

In fairness, OpenAI is hardly alone in this unending cycle of mitigating an attack only to see it revived through a simple change. If the past five years are any guide, this pattern is likely to endure indefinitely, in much the way SQL injection and memory corruption vulnerabilities continue to provide hackers with the fuel they need to compromise software and websites.

“Guardrails should not be considered fundamental solutions for the prompt injection problems,” Pascal Geenens, VP of threat intelligence at Radware, wrote in an email. “Instead, they are a quick fix to stop a specific attack. As long as there is no fundamental solution, prompt injection will remain an active threat and a real risk for organizations deploying AI assistants and agents.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Gmail made us all rethink how email could work when it debuted more than 20 years ago. Google thinks we’re in the process of another email transformation courtesy of AI. The company has unveiled a new round of AI features that will make Gemini an even more integral part of Gmail. The new Gemini experiences are coming to paying subscribers starting today, and a collection of previously premium-only AI features are rolling out widely.

AI Overviews first appeared in Gmail last year to summarize email chains, and now it’s expanding to Gmail search. This is closer to the AI Overview experience to which you are accustomed in Google’s web search. You can enter a natural language search, and the robot churns through your messages to generate a response.

In the example above, the user looks up a past plumbing quote. Traditionally, Gmail would show emails that are likely matches for your search. With AI Overview, you instead get a nicely formatted AI answer that includes all the relevant information and cites the email. That sounds all well and good, assuming it works. AI Overviews in search is notoriously inaccurate when summarizing search results, but grounding it in your email could make it less likely to screw up. Maybe.

AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will also begin seeing a new proofreading tool in Gmail. Proofreading suggestions will appear as dotted underlines in your email text, offering suggestions to streamline and clarify your writing. Google says AI Proofreading can make more nuanced changes than standard spellchecking features thanks to the company’s largest and most powerful Gemini 3 models.

Lastly, Google is previewing a new version of its iconic inbox—no, not that Inbox. The AI Inbox will roll out to a group of “trusted testers” before making its way to more users. The AI Inbox looks at your unread mail and creates an interactive list with “Priorities” at the top. If Gemini thinks an email is important, it will become a line item in that section. Below that is “Catch me up,” which summarizes less important messages. Again, this is based on Gemini’s ability to delineate important from unimportant.

The company stresses that AI Inbox will be optional when it arrives. However, we could imagine a future in which it becomes the default view. Google doesn’t have a timeline for when this one will move beyond testing.

We are also beginning to see how Google’s AI changes filter down through the subscription tiers. Email summaries, Help me write, and Suggested replies launched last year and were initially limited to those paying for AI Pro or Ultra. Google notes most Gmail users aren’t paying for either one. Now, all those people will have access to those features as they move to the free tier.

We suspect it will be a similar story for the features announced today. At launch, you’ll need a premium AI plan to access Proofread and Search AI Overviews (and presumably AI Inbox when it’s ready). Down the line, they will likely expand to all Gmail users. So if you were happy to see AI features limited to paid users, that reprieve is looking rather short-lived.

Google is used to being asked if the latest raft of AI inbox features can be disabled. The answer has always been “yes,” and that’s still the case for the new expansion of AI in Gmail. However, Gemini doesn’t have its own toggle. By lumping AI into “Smart Features,” you can only ditch Gemini if you’re also willing to give up features like package tracking cards, calendar integration, and loyalty cards in Wallet. If you don’t mind losing all that, you can keep Gemini out of your inbox.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in April, we came across a flashy and almost entirely CGI video of a bizarre concept for a rideable, four-legged robotic “horse.”

The video showed the mysterious concept, dubbed Corleo, roaming rocky terrain, leaping over icy crevasses, crossing snowy landscapes without losing its footing, and traversing a dark forest at night — all while carrying an adult rider on its back and being powered by a hydrogen power cell.

While the company behind the idea, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, showed off a full-scale model at an exposition at the time, promising a production-ready device by the far-off date of 2050, we had a lot of trouble believing Corleo was little more than pure vaporware.

But the company has now announced that it’s started to work on turning its ambitious vision into a reality, and decades ahead of schedule. As New Atlas reports, Kawasaki is setting up a dedicated “Safe Adventure Business Development Team,” with the aim of showing off a functioning prototype at the Expo 2030 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

The company is hoping to put the unusual motorcycle on legs on sale by 2035, a lofty plan that still keeps the delivery way well in the future to avoid near-term embarrassment — we’re looking at you, Elon Musk!

According to a press release, Kawasaki is also developing a “riding simulator that enables riding experience of the four-legged mobility vehicle.”

Beyond targeting thrill seekers, the company also suggests that Corleo could be used to “eliminate mountain accidents and make mountainous regions safe and enjoyable for everyone.”

Sure, it may sound like a promising start — but there are plenty of reasons to remain skeptical. For one, achieving the kind of agility the company showed off in its original marketing video will likely remain an enormous engineering challenge.

What exactly a production-ready prototype will be able to do at the Expo 2030 — a mere four years from now — remains unclear as well.

On the other hand, we’ve seen the field of robotics make major leaps and bounds, with an onslaught of humanoid robots that can dance, kickbox, and even cook up an elaborate breakfast. Four-legged robots have similarly learned to effortlessly navigate rugged landscapes and even herd sheep.

In short, for now we’ll reserve judgment — but we’re nonetheless excited about the prospect of a robotic horse that we can ride into the sunset, not unlike Aloy, the protagonist of the popular video game series “Horizon.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What makes a conspiracy theorist? Is it poor education, an overactive imagination, a tinfoil hat? According to one recent study, it isn’t any of that stuff, but instead something psychologically revealing: a deep insecurity about the world they inhabit.

The study, published in the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology, examined 14 variables in demographics, ideology, and personality for links to conspiratorial thinking. Some 253 adults were recruited to participate in the study, primarily from the UK, US, Canada, and South Africa, with an average age of 49 years old.

Specifically, the researchers were interested in exploring factors that might influence whether a person has “beliefs about cover-ups.” This is the blanket idea that powerful organizations or collectives are concealing the truth from the entire world, which only the conspiracy-minded can see through.

“I have long been interested in conspiracy theories, having published around 20 papers on the topic over the past decade or so,” the study’s lead author and professor of psychology at the Norwegian Business School, Adrian Furnham, told PsyPost. “Few, if any, researchers have taken into account the ‘cover up’ perspective of conspiracy believers.”

To consistently measure conspiratorial thinking, the researchers created a 10-point scale, corresponding to responses to statements such as “politicians usually do not tell us the true motives for their decisions” and “government agencies closely monitor all citizens.” Participants also took a personality assessment called the High Potential Trait Indicator (HTPI), which measures six traits including competitiveness and tolerance of ambiguity.

When all was said and done, one of the main factors researchers found a strong correlation between endorsement of conspiracy theories and an intriguing characteristic: a low tolerance of ambiguity.

In other words, people who feel insecure or uncomfortable when they don’t know all the answers, or who can’t grasp that some situations are complex, multidimensional, and puzzling even to experts. Presented with a complicated set of issues or events, these folks were more likely to sign on to a hare-brained conspiracy theory that offered an easy answer, even if it was wrong, or an oversimplification.

There was also a significant correlation between those who believe that the world is fundamentally unfair — from a “human nature” point of view — and those who subscribe to far-fetched theories. Those who believe in an “unjust world,” the researchers found, were also more inclined to believe in shadowy groups pulling the strings.

Contrary to what many may think, the researchers found no correlation between a person’s level of education and their capacity to believe in absurd conspiracies. Basically, this suggests that intelligence isn’t a factor determining whether a person falls into a conspiracy rabbithole, which paints a far different picture of conspiracy theorists than the one we typically see.

Going forward, more research with a much larger sample size is needed to expand the findings. Still, it’s a fascinating glimpse at the factors that could shape conspiratorial thinking — concrete evidence that when faced with uncertainty, some of us really do prefer simple lies to complicated truths.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A simple medical issue as mundane as an infection is far more dangerous when orbiting the Earth hundreds of miles above the surface in a confined spacecraft.

Apollo 7 astronaut Wally Schirra famously came down with a nasty head cold a mere 15 hours into the mission in 1967, with ground control warning him he could shatter his eardrums while returning to Earth with bad congestion. Given the lack of gravity, even a runny nose can turn into an extremely unpleasant experience, forcing astronauts to resort to unusual measures just to drain mucus from their nasal passages.

In short, there are compelling reasons to be extremely cautious about any possibility of illness when it comes to space travel, particularly given the lack of comprehensive medical equipment or specialized health professionals in orbit.

That’s why it’s striking that on Thursday, NASA announced that it was forced to postpone a January 8 spacewalk, citing a “medical concern.”

According to the carefully-worded update, the “matter involved a single crew member who is stable.”

The situation is still developing, and we have far more questions than answers. We don’t know if the astronaut has fallen ill or has suffered an injury. However, given NASA’s description, it sounds like it could be a fairly serious situation.

“Safely conducting our missions is our highest priority, and we are actively evaluating all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew-11’s mission,” the statement reads, referring to a mission that saw a crew of four travel to the ISS in August on board a SpaceX Crew Dragon.

“These are the situations NASA and our partners train for and prepare to execute safely,” NASA wrote.

The Crew-11 crew, which includes NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, arrived at the station on August 2 and is, at the time of writing, scheduled to return to Earth next month, following the mid-February launch of the Crew-12 launch.

As CNN points out, NASA doesn’t usually speak openly about medical conditions affecting its astronauts. However, there has been plenty of research into the effects of microgravity on the human body.

Prolonged space travel has been shown to affect astronauts’ vision, bone density, and blood circulation. A 2020 study, for instance, points out that blood can clot in an astronaut’s jugular vein, but how much of a danger this poses to astronauts remains unclear.

An astronaut and Crew-8 mission crew member, who returned to Earth in October 2024, had to be hospitalized upon their return. The crew member stayed overnight for observation due to a “minor medical issue.”

“To protect the crew member’s medical privacy, specific details on the individual’s condition or identity will not be shared,” NASA wrote in an update at the time.

To this day, we still don’t know why the astronaut was hospitalized — suggesting we may get little clarity on the currently unfolding situation, either.

However, NASA has promised “further updates within the next 24 hours.”

            <div id="article-text">Forget Mars. For 28 member of China’s astronaut corps, the brave new world is a dark, damp hole in the ground — cut off from light, wind, and even the internet.

As reported by Space News, the China Astronaut Research and Training Center (CARTC) just wrapped up a month-long training regimen meant to prepare future and veteran astronauts for lunar landing missions. The astronauts were split into four groups, each of which spent nearly a week in underground isolation.

While they were down there, each team completed work in cave mapping, environmental monitoring, long-distance communication, as well as psychological and behavioral training, according to the China National Space Administration.

While it isn’t known which cave the astronauts braved, the CNSA notes the system was located somewhere in the Wulong District of Chongqing. This area is home to massive karst formations like the Wulong Three Bridges, the largest natural stone arches in Asia, as well as the Xiaozhai Heavenly Pit, the world’s largest sinkhole. It also contains the famous Furong Cave, a UNESCO world heritage site and one of the largest limestone caverns in the world.

CARTC researchers had been scouting caves across China for the training program since 2016. At least 10 alternative caves were also considered, in regions like Guangxi, Hunan, and Guizhou. After rating each cavern based on metrics like training challenge, geological stability, and safety, program administrators settled on the one in Chongqing, where conditions most accurately resembled the “extreme environment of space,” the CNSA said.

The training mirrored a similar program run by the European Space Agency, called the Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising human behavior and performance Skills (CAVES). One of the directors of the Chinese cave training, veteran astronaut Ye Guangfu, also participated in a 2016 CAVES training in a European cavern.

“Compared with the cave training in Europe, our support team inside the cave intervened as little as possible,” Ye told the state news agency Xinhua. “This approach pushed astronauts to rely on their own judgment, unlocking both individual initiative and their full problem-solving potential.”

“It was so dark that I couldn’t see my own hands in front of my face,” Tang Hongbo told the agency. A veteran of the Shenzhou-12 and Shenzhou-17 spaceflight missions, Tang served as commander of the second team to face the underground trials. “In that kind of darkness, the mental pressure is overwhelming.”

These special glasses have “dynamic lenses” made of liquid crystals, which can transform to accommodate whatever focal length the user’s eyesight requires, IXI CEO Niko Eiden told CNN.

That makes them a far cry from old fashioned bifocals, which are eyeglasses with two different prescriptions in the same lens that are clearly separated by a seam, or progressive glasses (also called varifocal lenses), which are similar to bifocals but use a progression of lenses instead of a hard divider.

Eyeglasses that can autofocus automatically would be a huge leap for the tech, which hasn’t changed much since progressive lens were first developed in 1950s Germany.

“The eyewear industry hasn’t really been innovating for vision correction,” Eiden told CNN. “Maybe 10, 15 years from now people will be wondering, how did we wear those fixed focus glasses in the old days?”

Tiny LEDs inside the IXI frame bounce invisible infrared light into your eyes while photodiodes, also within the slim eyeglass frame, pick up the reflection on your eyeballs while measuring and tracking what you’re looking at. Then it converts that reflection and data into electrical signals that control the liquid crystals; like bifocals or progressives, the IXI has a reading area within the lens for near sighted vision, but that disappears entirely if it detects your eyes looking to the far distance.

The venture has attracted more than $36.5 billion from Amazon and other investors. It’s not clear when the eyeglasses will be available for the public to buy, though Eiden told CNN that they’ll launch sometime next year. Meanwhile, there’s a waiting list live on the company’s site.

IXI isn’t the only company pursuing dynamic autofocus lens with liquid crystals; CNN reports that a Japanese company called Elcyo is developing its own version, while another Japanese outfit called ViXion is currently selling autofocus glasses, though they look pretty clunky with two tiny apertures in the lens that a user must look through in order for the glasses to work. The IXI glasses look like ordinary glasses, by comparison.

But there’s a catch with the IXI glasses — they need to be charged along with your other gadgets taking up precious real estate on your nightstand, and will brick to their “base” prescription if they run out of batteries. And these specs, which will no doubt be more expensive than ordinary lo-fi eyeglasses, will be harder to fix or replace — a major negative for people who don’t want another gadget to maintain.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Venezuelans begin to pick up the rubble following massive air strikes by the United States over the weekend, the full scope of the destruction is slowly coming into focus.

As Agence France-Presse reports, Venezuelan officials say the US air strikes that killed at least 56 soldiers also destroyed numerous non-military targets, including the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research (IVIC).

On Wednesday, the country’s science and technology minister Gabriela Jimenez shared footage which shows an obliterated building which she says housed the mathematics department at the IVIC. On top of this, Jimenez said that four other IVIC buildings were targeted for destruction: the physics, chemistry, ecology, and nuclear research centers.

“Two missiles struck the area directly,” Jimenez wrote on Telegram referencing the mathematics center, per AFP which translated the comment. “The attack was total: these areas housed servers and equipment essential to our computer networks that were completely devastated.”

The minister characterized the attacks as an “unprecedented act of imperial aggression.”

Why the institute was targeted is unclear. The IVIC is located on the southwestern outskirts of Caracas, nearly 11 miles away from the Fuerte Tiuna, the military installation from which Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores were kidnapped by US special forces on Saturday.

In addition to the academic buildings, the governor of La Guaira, Jose Alejandro Teran, said the US air strikes destroyed a medicine warehouse located on the coastal city near Caracas.

“Tons of medicine burned to ash, tons of food,” Teran said in a video posted on social media. “Here are the results of what the bombs and missiles of the United States government have done… to destroy our warehouses full of medicine and food.”

Though Trump has emphasized the deaths of Venezuelan and Cuban soldiers, numerous civilians also lost their lives in the barrage. Those fatalities include 45-year old single mother Yohana Rodríguez Sierra, who was killed by a US missile. At least one of Sierra’s daughters was injured in the missile strike.

At least 150 US war planes and drones took part in the devastation, which the Trump administration and American media have characterized as a “precision operation.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">​XBREW Lab debuted its countertop nitro beverage machine, EverNitro, at CES this week, offering nitro coffee enthusiasts a more accessible way to enjoy the drink—without the waste and expense of traditional cartridge-based machines.

If you’re unfamiliar with nitro coffee, it’s cold brew coffee infused with nitrogen gas. This process creates tiny bubbles, resulting in a silky-smooth, naturally sweeter taste—similar to drinking a Guinness. Many people also note that nitro coffee has less bitterness.

EverNitro is positioning itself against competitors such as NitroBrew as a long-term more affordable all-in-one solution. “We offer the quality of a commercial tap with the footprint of a coffee maker. While others sell you gas, we give you technology to harvest it for free,” founder and CEO Terry Tan said.

​The company claims EverNitro delivers 95% nitrogen purity and highlights its ability to generate nitrogen directly from the surrounding air. By eliminating the need for single-use cartridges, the device provides a less expensive, environmentally friendly solution for home use.

After testing it ourselves, we were pleasantly surprised. The machine is simple to use, and it fits easily on a counter or stores comfortably on a shelf—making it a nice addition to any kitchen or bar setup. The canister accommodates coffee, cocktails for that bar-quality touch, or other beverages. Users can select their preferred pressure, which ranges from 0 to 8 BAR (a metric unit of pressure).

The entire process, from loading your beverage to enjoying the finished drink, takes only minutes. There’s also a companion app that delivers updates.

The device launched on Kickstarter in October and raised over $570,000—a testament to strong interest in this product despite its premium price point. The Lite option costs $470 and includes just the machine and canister, while backers can purchase it for $290. The Pro version is $583 (or $337 for backers) and comes with the machine, two canisters, a coffee bean preservation jar, and whipped cream kits.​ Yet, for comparison’s sake, a countertop unit of NitroBrew costs about $1,000.

Looking ahead, Tan told TechCrunch that the team is “exploring how gases can fundamentally elevate the texture of all beverages, not just coffee. Imagine a machine that doesn’t just dispense; it intelligently mixes a cocktail or brews a coffee and then automatically selects the perfect gas profile to enhance its body and mouthfeel.”

            <h2>I watched LG’s new home robot CLOid do laundry but I have questions</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/i-watched-lgs-new-home-robot-cloid-do-laundry-but-i-have-questions/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">CES is always chock-full of robots, and this year electronics giant LG announced a new bot, dubbed CLOid, that it claims will revolutionize household chores (as in, you won’t have to do them anymore).

CLOid is described as an AI-powered home robot, designed to assist its user with a wide variety of domestic tasks — from folding laundry to making breakfast to patrolling a home for signs of trouble. The company says that, eventually, it envisions the device “evolving into an ambient-care agent that supports everyday life.”

The bot was announced during LG’s keynote earlier this week, but it was also available for inspection via rolling presentations on the convention room floor. I went to check one out, where I saw the bot, alongside a human presenter, performing a variety of tasks for an enthusiastic audience.

CLOid has autonomous movement, so it can get around by itself, and comes equipped with a variety of cameras and sensors that, when paired with LG’s smart home ThinQ app, can leverage situational and environmental data to make proactive suggestions for how to make its user’s life better, LG says.

The bot also has speakers so it can communicate with its user. LG says that CLOid runs off a vision language model that converts “images and video into structured, language-based understanding” and a vision language action program that can convert verbal commands into action (you know, like Siri).

The last few years have seen the introduction of a number of domestic robots, including Amazon’s Astro and Enabot’s EBO X. CLOid follows in their footsteps but seems designed for a broader array of domestic tasks than its predecessors. Unlike Astro and EBO (which are little more than squat, rolling automatons), CLOid has a large upper body and two arms — a physicality clearly designed to lift stuff and interact with its environment.

You’d think that would lead to some impressive results, right? Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOid didn’t do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in a number of hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.

CLOid was cute, and seemed affable enough, but the biggest thing you notice is how slow it is. During Tuesday’s presentation, when his human counterpart asked CLOid to make him some breakfast, the robot trundled over to the refrigerator, waited for the automatic door to open, and then stared into the fridge’s depths for an uncomfortably long period of time before ultimately selecting milk.

Yes, even the most lethargic human would likely win in a race against CLOid. However, speed isn’t really the issue here. The idea is to make sure that the bot’s human companion doesn’t have to do any work at all. It’s part of what LG refers to as its “Zero Labor Home” model, where automation takes care of all of those boring but essential domestic chores. You can be off brushing your teeth or answering a call from your boss while the bot is in the next room, prepping pancakes. That’s the idea, at least.

From the available presentation, it’s a little unclear when that idea will become a reality. I was unable to find out if and when the bot would actually be available to the public. A disclaimer at the bottom of the presentation’s videos read: “Products and solutions shown in this video are under development and not been released for commercial use, thus specifications may vary.”

An on-site LG communications staffer told me that CLOid would be available in the future, but she didn’t know when. I reached out to LG’s Home Solutions team for more information.

Thus, like a lot of other robots on display at CES, CLOid felt a little more like an ad for its company’s potential than an accurate representation of what it is currently offering. The bot also seemed well positioned to help market LG’s new AI home ecosystem, which represents a broader array of impressive smart home products, the bulk of which seem like easier lifts for consumers than a new robot in their home.

I got a brief tour of some of the latest editions of those products. In addition to the return of the LG Wallpaper (having spent a few minutes staring into its insanely thin but beautifully hypnotic surface, I can safely say I want one), the company had a variety of appliances on display this week, including an AI-powered oven that can identify particular ingredients and recommend recipes for you, and an AI refrigerator that you can talk to. All of these devices are supposed to synch with CLOid and are controllable via the company’s ThinQ app.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Internet connectivity collapsed across Iran on Thursday amid nationwide protests, according to web monitoring firms.

“I think we’re at a near-total disconnection from the outside world now,” Amir Rashidi, an Iranian cybersecurity researcher who works for the nonprofit Miaan Group, told TechCrunch.

Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik, a company that monitors internet traffic worldwide, concurred, telling TechCrunch that Iran’s internet has been in “near-total blackout” since around 11:30 a.m. on the U.S. east coast on Thursday, or 8 p.m. local time in Tehran.

Internet traffic monitor NetBlocks, internet infrastructure company Cloudflare, and internet connectivity tracking site IODA, all registered sudden drops in connectivity across Iran at the same time.

“We continue to see a small amount of traffic, but the country is effectively completely offline,” David Belson, the head of data insight at Cloudflare, told TechCrunch.

At the end of December, protests erupted in several cities in Iran, following a sharp drop in the value of the country’s currency, prompting shortages of goods and dramatic spikes in prices. Some shops in Tehran’s traditional bazaar have been closed for eleven days, according to The New York Times.

Iran’s government has responded by violently cracking down on the protesters.

The Iranian government, which maintains a tight control over the country’s internet access, is behind the internet blackout, according to Rashidi.

Representatives for the Iranian government in the United States did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. The Iranian Foreign Ministry’s website was down at the time of publication.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI is kicking off the new year with yet another acqui-hire. The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting.

An OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo’s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its “AI cloud efforts.” The three co-founders – Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett – will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal.

The startup began as a “weekend hackathon” sparked by a question by Cooper’s mother, who is an executive coach: could an AI tool automate the drudgery of report writing so she could spend more time on the human coaching work she loves? Over the past two years, Convogo has helped “thousands” of coaches and partnered with the “world’s top leadership development firms,” per an email bearing news of the acquisition sent by Convogo.

In the email, the team wrote that the real problem they uncovered in their work is how to bridge the gap between what is possible with each new model release and how to translate that into real world outcomes.

“We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we’ve built for coaches at Convogo,” the founders wrote. “That’s why we’re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry.”

The Convogo acqui-hire marks OpenAI’s ninth acquisition in the span of a year, per PitchBook data. In nearly all of those acquisitions, the product was either folded into OpenAI’s ecosystem – as in the case of Sky, the AI interface for Mac, or Statsig, a product testing firm – or completely shut down as the team joined OpenAI – as in the cases of Roi, Context.ai, and Crossing Minds.

The Convogo deal also signals that OpenAI, like its competitors, is using M&A as a talent and capability accelerator. The main exception to that rule is OpenAI’s acquisition of Jonny Ive’s io Products, which is continuing its product roadmap as the two companies work together to create a piece of AI hardware.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/andurils-palmer-luckey-thinks-the-future-of-tech-is-in-the-past/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">You might think it’s pretty weird to hear the founders of a VR company and a social media platform publicly complaining about how things used to be better back in the dial-up days. Nevertheless, that is what happened at CES on Wednesday, when Oculus creator Palmer Luckey and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian gave a joint talk about the joys of “tech nostalgia.”

Luckey, who initially made his fortune in VR and now runs the defense contractor Anduril, and Ohanian both seemed to agree: Stuff was better in the old days.

The catch, however, is that Luckey and Ohanian weren’t really criticizing technology itself (Luckey said, during his remarks, that he supported AI and felt it was changing workflows for the better); instead, they were criticizing the aesthetics of technology. Vintage consumer tech products, they argued, are superior to today’s — and it’s the styles and form factor of the past that will determine tech’s future, they claimed.

“It’s not just about nostalgia for the old; it’s about the fact that it’s just objectively better,” Ohanian said of some older products.

After going on a short tirade about how great the 1999 first-person shooter Quake: Arena is, Luckey similarly sang the praises of old-school media. “There is something that used to exist in the intentionality of building a music library — whether that was building whole albums or building mix tapes,” Luckey said, adding that, in the era of endless downloads, you clearly “lose something.”

Luckey also pointed to younger people who are nostalgic for time periods that they don’t even remember or have any personal connection to. “Why do they think it’s good? It’s not because they’re remembering their childhoods. It’s not because they’re harkening back to some earlier time. It’s because they’re recognizing that it is literally better, some of this old stuff.”

Certain consumer trends would seem to suggest that Luckey and Ohanian are on to something. Nostalgia is obviously big across the board these days (look at all those 1980s period pieces coming out of Hollywood), but nostalgic tech design is a particularly thriving niche. Young people are overwhelmed and oversaturated by the internet. As a result, many have developed new interests in physical media — like collecting cassettes and vinyl. Meanwhile, new, low-tech devices with retro designs are also seeing an uptick in interest (just check out the Clicks Communicator phone that debuted at CES this year).

Given that consumer interests are trending this direction, Luckey and Ohanian’s enthusiasm for vintage tech could also just end up being a savvy business strategy. That is, if Americans are feeling nostalgic, you might as well monetize it.

Indeed, Luckey has already been doing this. The defense contractor, who sports an ’80s mullet, launched a project in 2024 called ModRetro Chromatic — a Game Boy-like device that retails for $199, allows gameplay of old cartridge classics from the 1990s, and has been called one of “the best ever made” of its kind.

On Wednesday, Ohanian brought one of the ModRetro units onstage and proudly showed it off to the crowd. Ohanian, who has spoken very publicly about his love for Luckey’s gaming company, has also said he’s interested in creating his own vintage-style game.

There were a lot of colorful moments during Wednesday’s talk, most of which were generated by Luckey. At one point, he shared that he had been coming to CES since he was 16. Astute CES fans will note: You’re supposed to be 18 to get in. “I used a fake ID,” Luckey told a CES audience on Wednesday, to much laughter. “I pretended that I worked for a company that was exhibiting here,” the mogul said.

Cute retro games may be the future but so, too, is war, it would seem. Since 2017, Luckey has largely been focused on his defense startup Anduril. Earlier this year, in the wake of a Series G fundraising round, the company’s valuation swelled to $30.5 billion. Lately, the company has been collaborating with Meta on headsets for the U.S. military.

Anduril hardly came up during Wednesday’s talk, but toward the end of the conversation, Luckey pivoted briefly to a discussion about foreign policy to make some characteristically wild claims. “I was part of the problem for a long time, making all of my stuff in China,” he said. “Geopolitically, the United States and China are going through a divorce; it’s a messy divorce — and if people think that it’s going to end with reconciliation, they’re blind. It’s not,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following the success of TikTok and Instagram Reels, Disney announced that it’s bringing short-form video content to Disney+ in the U.S. this year in a bid to boost daily engagement. Disney made the announcement at its Tech + Data Showcase event at CES 2026.

The company said in the blog post that the experience “will evolve as it expands across news and entertainment and delivers a more personalized, dynamic experience that reinforces Disney+ as a must-visit daily destination.”

Disney told Deadline that the videos could include original short-form content, repurposed social clips, scenes from TV shows or movies, or a combination.

“We’re obviously thinking about integrating vertical video in ways that are native to core user behaviors,” Erin Teague, EVP of Product Management for Disney Entertainment and ESPN, told Deadline. “So, it won’t be a kind of a disjointed, random experience.”

The move comes as Disney launched a personalized vertical video feed in the ESPN app last year.

By introducing short-form video content to Disney+, the company is targeting younger users who are accustomed to watching quick clips on their phones rather than long-form content like TV shows and movies.

Disney+ won’t be the first streamer to explore vertical video, as Netflix launched a vertical feed last year that lets users scroll through clips from its original titles.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a lot we don’t know about the shooting of Renee Nicole Good, who was killed yesterday by federal immigration agents deployed to Minnesota. But in the chaotic aftermath of the shooting, one thing became immediately clear: The Trump administration was lying about what happened.

Shortly after news began circulating about the shooting, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement on X that “rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and the White House adviser Stephen Miller also described the incident as “domestic terrorism,” while President Donald Trump posted on his social network that Good “ran over the ICE Officer.”

Videos of the incident, taken by bystanders, show almost every element of McLaughlin’s statement to be false. There were no riots at the scene, and no rioters. The vehicle appears to be driving away from the armed federal agents, not toward them, and no one was run over. And there is no evidence that terrorism of any kind was involved. After the shooting, federal agents then reportedly prevented a bystander who identified himself as a physician from tending to Good. “They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told reporters. “Having seen the video of myself, I want to tell everybody directly, that is bullshit.”

A perverse absurdity of American law and culture, however, is that agents of the state empowered to use lethal force are rarely held to high standards for doing so. Good’s reasons for being in the neighborhood are not publicly known yet. What the witness sees, though, is simple: A scared woman is shot dead by an armed agent of the state. The Trump administration’s position is also simple: She deserved it. “Do you think this officer was wrong in defending his life against a deranged leftist who tried to run him over?” Vice President J. D. Vance posted.

Administration officials’ indifference to facts, to due process, to the dignity of the deceased, and to basic human decency is remarkable. They could have pleaded for patience and said the incident would be investigated—the standard response in such circumstances. They could have even done so while defending the federal agents they have deployed to terrorize areas they perceive as Democratic Party enclaves. Instead, they proceeded to make ostentatiously dishonest statements that they knew would be contradicted by the video evidence available to anyone with eyes to see it. The federal government now speaks with the voice of the right-wing smear machine: partisan, dishonest, and devoted to vilifying Trump’s perceived enemies rather than informing the public. Good’s mother, partner, and children have to cope not only with their unfathomable loss, but with a campaign designed to justify her killing. Their own lives will be subject to invasive scrutiny by the government and its allies, in a search for any derogatory information about Good that might somehow be used to justify her killing. For some, that won’t even be necessary. “I do not feel bad for the woman that was involved,” the Republican lawmaker Randy Fine told the right-wing network Newsmax.

As my colleague Quinta Jurecic has reported, the Trump administration has made a point of following through on absurd accusations by filing absurd charges. The most relevant example here is that of Marimar Martinez, who survived being shot multiple times by a federal agent in Chicago; DHS claimed that she, too, had rammed them with her car. The agent later bragged to his buddies about his eagle-eyed gunning-down of Martinez, who was  unarmed and hadn’t committed a crime. The charges against her were dropped.

The New York Times reported that the death of Good was the ninth shooting by an ICE officer since September, all of which officials called self-defense. In at least one of those incidents—the fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a Mexican immigrant—there was video evidence that contradicted DHS’s account. The administration has also charged Newark Mayor Ras Baraka with trespassing and Representative LaMonica McIver with assault, falsely accusing them of storming an ICE facility, when video of the encounter shows nothing of the kind. Baraka is now suing for defamation. Another supposed menace to society was accused of assault for scraping the knuckles of an FBI agent during a scuffle—the grand jury refused to indict over this harrowing example of anti-hand crime. In every one of these incidents, the administration lied about both the events and the civilians involved in them, in an attempt to justify the use of force or subsequent prosecution.

David A. Graham: A deadly shooting in Minnesota

The Trump administration has repeatedly targeted small and politically disempowered populations—Haitians, Somalis, trans people—in order to justify abuses of power. But its abuses of power are not limited to those communities. What the government can do to the most vulnerable among us, it can also do to you.

The blatant lies about Minneapolis serve several purposes. They perpetuate the false narrative that federal agents are in constant peril and therefore justified in using lethal force at the slightest hint of danger. They assure federal agents that they can harm or even kill American citizens with impunity, and warn those who might be moved to protest Trump’s immigration policies of the same thing. Perhaps most grim, they communicate to the public that if you happen to be killed by a federal agent, your government will bear false witness to the world that you were a terrorist.

This approach, of course, is quite familiar to communities that have been dealing with police abuses for as long as there have been professional police forces. In 2000, then–New York City Mayor and future Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani justified the killing of the Haitian American Patrick Dorismond by police by quipping that he was “no altar boy.” Embarrassingly for Giuliani, whose capacity for shame was overestimated even then, it turned out that Dorismond had literally been an altar boy. Dorismond’s mother responded to the campaign to justify her son’s killing with an observation that continues to haunt me decades later.

“They kill,” Dorismond said, “and after that, they kill him the other way—with the mouth.”

Taking Good’s life wasn’t enough. The moment she died, it became imperative for the administration to also destroy her memory.</div>

            <h2>What Having a Fake Disease Taught Me About Health Care</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-08</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every few weeks I turn up in a hospital gown at a medical exam room in Massachusetts and describe a set of symptoms that I don’t really have. Students listen to my complaints of stomach pain, a bad cough, severe fatigue, rectal bleeding, shortness of breath, a bum knee, HIV infection, even stab wounds; on one occasion I simply shouted incoherently for several minutes, as if I’d had a stroke. Then the students do their best to help.

I have been given nearly 100 ultrasounds in just the past year, and referred to behavioral counseling dozens of times. I have been consoled for my woes, thanked for my forthrightness, congratulated for my efforts to improve my diet. I have received apologies when they need to lower my gown, press on my abdomen, or touch me with a cold stethoscope. Our encounters, which sometimes run as long as 40 minutes, end with the students giving me their diagnoses; detailing every test, treatment, and drug they want me to have; and then answering all of my questions without ever looking at their watch. Before leaving, they commend me for coming in and promise to check back in on me. It’s a shame I have to feign an illness to get that kind of care.

I learned about fake medical care four years ago when my son, an M.D.-Ph.D. student, mentioned that he was being graded on his skill at treating “standardized patients”: people who are paid to role-play illness. I’m fascinated by the practice of medicine, so I found this notion irresistible. I applied for a job in the standardized-patient program at the University of Massachusetts, and after two full days of training, plus a lot of reading and videos, I was ready to get started.

The practice of faking medical encounters for the sake of education dates back to 1963 at the University of Southern California, but UMass developed one of the first formalized programs in 1982 and has been a model since. Such programs are now, well, standard: According to a count published in a 2023 review of the practice, 187 of the 195 accredited medical schools in the U.S. describe the use of standardized patients on their websites.

Each specific case that an SP might inhabit—and there are hundreds—comes with a minimum of two hours of additional training in person or via Zoom, along with more reading. We’re buried in a blizzard of unique details to memorize about the patients we portray. By the time I’m ready for my fake exam, I can rattle off what vaccinations I’ve had, how long I’ve worked at my job, whether I’ve had my tonsils out, when my mother died, how much weight I’ve gained or lost in recent months, which vitamins I take, how much coffee I drink, how chatty I tend to be, and whether I’ve traveled recently (and might have parasites!).

There’s no script for my encounters, because you never know what the students might ask, say, and do. So I improvise most of my responses, in keeping with the facts I’ve been given. What do I usually eat for breakfast? What do they make at the factory where I work? What sexual acts do my partner and I engage in? My ad-libs are acceptable, according to the grades I get from staff members who occasionally observe the encounters via camera. But many of my colleagues are professional actors, and their performances are superb. We sometimes work in pairs, and more than once I’ve found myself deeply moved—even to the verge of tears—by my partner’s fake suffering.

Of course, we SPs are not the only ones faking it in these sessions; the students are playing along, too. We score them on as many as 50 different elements, including their tone of voice (was it friendly but professional?), their body language (did they lean in to show engagement?), and their facility at palpating our spleens (did they dig in firmly in the right spot?). Most important, we are meant to check that they are learning empathy. Numerous studies have shown that more empathetic care is correlated with better clinical outcomes, perhaps because it makes patients more inclined to share their full medical history, and more likely to stick with whatever treatment has been recommended. In one survey, orthopedic-surgery patients reported that a doctor’s empathy was more central to their satisfaction than the time it took to get an appointment, how long they were stuck in the waiting room, or even what sort of treatment they ended up receiving.

It may not even matter if the doctor’s kindness is sincere, as long as it sounds that way to patients. Dave Hatem, an internist and professor emeritus at UMass who has helped oversee the school’s SP curriculum, told me that even just the act of trying to say empathetic things is valuable for students. “If you get the right words to come out of your mouth, and you do it often enough, then you get to the point where you really mean it,” he said.

Most of the medical students who examine me do seem genuine in their concern. I suspect that if it were up to them, they’d practice medicine this way for the whole of their careers. But however much they might want to provide the superb treatment that I experience as a standardized patient, the health-care system won’t let them.

Elaine Thompson is a recent graduate of Emory University’s medical school, where she learned to provide the same sort of long, thoughtful, whole-person interactions that I get from students. For the past three years, she has been an ear, nose, and throat resident at Johns Hopkins Medicine, one of the best medical centers in the world. Her real-life patient encounters now last for an average of 10 minutes.

“You quickly learn as a resident that the job is to move things along,” Thompson told me. “I’m still curious about my patients as people and want to learn about their families, but if it’s not relevant to their current problem, then asking about it opens a door that will add time to the visit.” So much for chatting to put them at ease, soliciting a full narrative of their symptoms, hearing all their concerns, asking about their job, uncovering anxieties, addressing financial and social challenges, and encouraging their questions. (In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Johns Hopkins Medicine said that it is committed to delivering “patient-centered training” and “whole person care.”)

The same is true for Emily Chin, who received her medical degree from UMass in 2023 and is now an ob-gyn resident at UC San Francisco. She told me that she got the message about keeping visits short early on from senior residents, who made a point of tracking the length of her encounters. “I’d just have time to check the cervix, do a quick ultrasound, and then make a decision about admitting or discharging the patient,” she said. Another source of pressure is the knowledge that spending any extra time with a patient means that dozens of other patients will be waiting longer to be seen: “You see the patients piling up in the waiting room, and you see the schedule screen going red.” (UCSF’s vice dean for education, Karen Hauer, did not object to this characterization, but noted that the school advises its residents on how to establish patient rapport when time is short.)

Residents also learn that time is money. Hospitals and practices view a doctor’s interactions with a patient in terms of “revenue value units.” Reimbursement for seeing a patient whose high cholesterol leads to a prescription for a statin might bring $60 into the hospital or clinic. Reimbursement for extra time spent discussing the patient’s fears of side effects and concerns about affording the drug’s co-pay or making dietary changes brings in $0. “That doesn’t exactly encourage providing the most empathetic, patient-centered care,” a UMass Memorial Health resident named Hans Erickson told me.

The residents I spoke with worried that these time pressures were only going to get worse when they finished residency and became full-fledged doctors. In light of those constraints, does it still make sense to emphasize highly empathetic care for students? I asked that question of Melissa Fischer, the physician who directs the SP program and other simulation training at UMass. Fischer argues that the lessons we impart to students can survive the crush of residency, even if they have to be applied in abbreviated ways. “That interest in building connections to patients stays,” she said. “They just have to find faster ways to build them.”

Lisa Howley, an educational psychologist who serves as the senior director for transforming medical education at the Association of American Medical Colleges, told me that training up a generation of more empathetic medical students will make the health-care system better. “We think of young medical learners as agents of potential change,” she told me. “They’ll see the gaps and weaknesses, and they’ll look for ways to make improvements.” Besides, what would be the benefit of forcing medical students to learn about patient encounters in the hectic, abbreviated format they’ll confront as residents? “It doesn’t make sense to apply those pressures early in their education,” she said. After all, we don’t teach student pilots how to fly a plane while trying to make up for time lost to flight delays or dealing with unruly passengers.

All of the residents I spoke with said they look for ways to connect with patients despite the harsh realities of the system. “The desire to get to know the patient as a whole person doesn’t go away; it’s just a matter of finding ways to bring it to the surface as a stressed resident,” Erickson said. Chin put it this way: “It’s not that it’s challenging to keep up empathy, it’s that it’s hard to be empathetic all the time.”

At the end of my fake encounters, I try to be encouraging. I tell the students how I, as a patient, felt treated by them, and then I challenge them to give ideas for how they might improve. Sometimes, when one of them has done a bang-up job of making me feel heard, I tell them that I hope they’ll be able to sustain that level of engagement when they’re a practicing doctor—and I always get the sense that the students hope so too.</div>

            <h2>Change May Be Coming to Iran</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/maduro-venezuela-iran/685551/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Few world capitals have been as shaken by the dramatic ouster of Nicolás Maduro as faraway Tehran. Anti-Americanism has united Iran and Venezuela in a tight alliance for more than two decades. As recently as 2022, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei welcomed Maduro to Tehran, praising the Venezuelan strongman’s “resistance” against America and his “anti-Zionist positions,” adding: “No two countries are as close as we are.”

Khamenei also promised that Iran would “come to the aid of its friends when they are faced with danger.” But when American troops rousted Maduro and his wife from bed early on the morning of January 3, neither Khamenei nor his more powerful allies in Moscow and Beijing came to the rescue.

By now, Khamenei has gotten used to losing friends. He appeared helpless to protect his main regional ally, Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, from being overthrown a year ago. Israeli strikes have decimated the so-called Axis of Resistance, a coalition of anti-Israel Arab militias backed by Iran. Khamenei has now also lost an alliance first forged with Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, who christened it the Axis of Unity. A former Iranian official quipped on X that Iran had to accept Hezbollah’s disarmament next: Donald Trump’s “new order is not that hard to understand!”

The blow couldn’t come at a worse time for Iran’s dictator. Khamenei’s regime faces a new round of street protests and a deepening economic crisis. Iran’s 12-day war with Israel and America ended inconclusively last year; the possibility of renewed attacks is never far from mind. The U.S. president has already compared the success of the operation in Caracas to last year’s bombing of Iran. And if that were not ominous enough, Maduro’s capture took place on the sixth anniversary of the Trump-ordered killing of Qassem Soleimani, Khamenei’s top general.

Read: A high-seas gambit that humiliates Putin

And so the regime reacted with evident panic. Reports on Iran’s state broadcaster insisted for hours that the United States might be lying about capturing Maduro. Once that line became impossible to sustain, a well-known former member of parliament blustered that Maduro would return to power “as a national hero” and that America’s “revolutionary youth would send Trump to the dustbin of history.” Ahmad Vahidi, the newly appointed deputy commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said that the operation signaled “America’s collapse and decline.”

Be that as it may, Khamenei’s partner in resistance had been spirited to a New York courtroom, and Russia and China, the great-power allies supposedly backing both Caracas and Tehran, had sat the whole episode out. What lesson was the Iranian regime to draw? One Guards-linked analyst concluded that international law was an illusion, and that Iran needed “military and economic power” to survive. Commentators in more reformist-leaning outlets countered that what Iran actually needed was a government with popular legitimacy.

Certainly the news from Caracas has emboldened the Iranian regime’s opponents. On social media, many Iranians joked about being jealous of Venezuelans. A journalist at a reformist daily taunted the rulers in Tehran: “If you don’t leave power with the vote of the people, you will have to do so by a larger foreign force.” A left-leaning dissident in Tehran simply posted, “Congratulations Venezuela.”

The implicit premise of these reactions is that Trump could be contemplating as bold an action in Tehran as he undertook in Caracas. One former U.S. official I spoke with was skeptical that the Trump administration has any interest in decapitating the Iranian regime. “Venezuela is a core U.S. interest in a way that Iran isn’t,” Alan Eyre, who was the Persian-language spokesperson for the State Department under President Barack Obama and is now a diplomatic fellow at the Middle East Institute, told me. “I think this administration is focused elsewhere, and is by and large content to leave Iran to Israel, unless and until Israeli actions in Iran threaten to further destabilize the region.”

Still, the chatter about regime change—whether affected by the U.S. and Israel or by protesters pressing against a weakened power structure—has been growing louder, and one figure has moved inescapably to its center. Former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, from his American exile, has declared himself Iran’s transitional leader, and many Iranian protesters have chanted support for him in recent days. Pahlavi has told The Wall Street Journal that he doesn’t advocate military strikes on Iran. But he didn’t oppose the American and Israeli attacks over the summer, and some of those close to him, including his wife, Yasmine Pahlavi, openly backed them.

Is there a conceivable future in which an American-military intervention installs Pahlavi in power? Venezuela doesn’t offer a very promising precedent. Control in Caracas has passed not to the popular democratic opposition leader, María Corina Machado, but to Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, whom U.S. officials reportedly chose to lead the country weeks ago. One can easily imagine that in Iran, too, Washington would bypass exiled oppositionists in favor of a pliant strongman. And Pahlavi is a divisive figure, with less sway among Iranian-regime critics than Machado has with their Venezuelan counterparts. In fact, Ali Javanmardi, Trump’s appointee to head the Voice of America’s Persian-language service, claimed on air on Sunday that Trump had “concluded that the opposition groups can’t come to a consensus and thus can’t be defined as the alternative” to the regime. Javanmardi added that the U.S. State Department believes that “the alternative is inside Iran.”

Inside Iran, the protest movement appears to be growing, and Khamenei, besieged by his people and surrounded on all sides by foreign adversaries, must know that his days are numbered. No matter who comes out on top when he’s gone, the core structures and central policies of his regime are bound to change. How and by whom the Islamic Republic will be dismantled, and what will succeed it, are the questions that remain.</div>

            <h2>The Maduro Indictment Appears Legally Solid</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/maduro-indictment-legal-analysis-noriega-precedent/685550/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hours after U.S. forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their home in Caracas, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on X that Maduro would soon “face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.” Bondi’s wording aside—typically lawyers understand the legal system as dispensing impartial justice, not “wrath”—the post underscores the administration’s claim that the Venezuelan invasion was justified because the United States was arresting a criminal defendant who has been charged with drug trafficking.

The indictment is relatively straightforward—especially when compared with Maduro’s rendition—and appears legally sound. Although Maduro has a number of options for challenging his prosecution, none of them is a sure bet. Critics of President Donald Trump who have grown used to federal courts checking his worst impulses may find themselves disappointed as the case against Maduro proceeds.

In significant part, the charging document repeats the allegations already set out by the government in a 2020 indictment against the Venezuelan leader, accusing Maduro of involvement in a cocaine-trafficking network stretching across the Western Hemisphere. The specific charges are the same: conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and to collaborate with narco-terrorist organizations to do so. On top of that are also two gun charges. It may sound odd that the United States can charge a foreign leader for possessing machine guns in his own country, but this sort of charge—a gun offense layered on top of an allegation of drug trafficking or violence—is, in contexts not involving heads of sovereign nations, a fairly common tool of federal prosecutors in international drug cases. To the extent that such a tactic seems like an overly broad use of prosecutorial power, that’s a reflection of the expansiveness of U.S. law and the Justice Department’s choice to treat Maduro like an everyday defendant.

The Justice Department has made a few tweaks since 2020, providing more detail on Maduro’s seizure of power after he lost Venezuela’s 2018 election and adding his wife and son to the list of defendants. Whereas the 2020 indictment focuses on Maduro’s alleged collaboration with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the Colombian guerrilla group known as FARC, the 2025 version adds a handful of other cartels and drug-trafficking groups to the mix. Newly woven into the indictment is the alleged role of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, whose supposed presence in the U.S. the administration has previously used as a paper-thin excuse to ship Venezuelan migrants to a nightmarish prison in El Salvador.

The government’s claims about Tren de Aragua are probably the most eyebrow-raising aspect of the indictment. “I don’t think of them as major transnational drug trafficker,” Will Freeman, a fellow for Latin American studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, told me. “It seems a bit surprising.” A critical reader could find other quirks—such as the absence of any mention of fentanyl trafficking, despite the administration’s previous insistence on blaming Maduro for the drug’s abuse by Americans. (Illicit fentanyl largely arrives in the U.S. from China.) But that is a problem for the administration’s public rhetoric, not the viability of the indictment.

Overall, though, the allegations against Maduro seem to more or less line up with what’s already known about the Venezuelan regime’s enmeshment with organized crime. The Trump administration’s reliance on the 2020 indictment is telling here. Those charges were filed by a Justice Department not yet deeply corrupted by the sort of aggressive political interference that has marked the president’s second term thus far, and by federal prosecutors whose Manhattan office was famous for its independence.

Although the indictment seems relatively unscathed by Trump’s signature recklessness, the same cannot be said of the circumstances of Maduro’s capture. Sending military forces into another country’s capital to seize its leader, unprovoked, is forbidden by the United Nations Charter, which prohibits states from using force against one another. The U.S. ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, has pointed to the charter’s exception for self-defense but failed to explain how the Venezuela operation could possibly fall into that category. What’s more, in the absence of congressional authorization—which Trump didn’t have—such an adventure is also likely illegal under all but the most extreme understandings of U.S. law. The administration’s arguments to the contrary depend on an overstretched reading of presidential powers that has been questioned even by advocates of strong executive authority. And while Vice President J. D. Vance pointed to the indictment against Maduro as a justification, the existence of criminal charges against a person does not provide the government with carte blanche to arrest a defendant in any way it likes.

But the dubious nature of his arrival in the U.S. may not help Maduro much in court. The Supreme Court has established repeatedly that even if someone is “kidnapped in the foreign country and brought by force against his will” to the United States, the government can nevertheless try that person in criminal court. In the early 1990s, the Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega failed to derail his drug-trafficking trial on those grounds after the United States captured and deposed him during the 1989 invasion of Panama.

Eventually, Noriega would be convicted by a South Florida jury and sentenced to 40 years in prison, of which he served 17 before being released and extradited to France for further criminal proceedings. He was the first foreign head of state to be captured by U.S. forces and tried in an American court. Maduro is the second, and Noriega’s other legal arguments offer a preview of what options might be available to Maduro’s defense team.

George Packer: Iraq was bad. This is absurd.

“I consider myself a prisoner of war,” Maduro said in court on Monday. Noriega also made this argument. It failed to win him his freedom, but it did allow him to wear his military uniform in court and secured him better prison conditions. Like Noriega, Maduro might also challenge the U.S. government’s ability to bring charges regarding conduct that took place outside the United States. In Noriega’s case, this, too, failed.

Maduro hinted at another potential argument when he insisted before Judge Alvin Hellerstein that he was “still president of my country.” This echoes Noriega’s claim that the United States lacked the authority to put him, as a foreign head of state, on trial and that international law likewise shielded him from criminal prosecution for any actions he had taken in his role as leader of Panama. But both the trial court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit rejected Noriega’s claims. Maduro may well have a stronger argument: Noriega, unlike Maduro for Venezuela, never legally served as Panama’s head of state under the country’s constitution. Still, despite the protections offered by international law, U.S. courts have tended to defer to the executive branch when it comes to such immunity claims.

The Noriega precedent has been on the books for decades, but its revitalization makes for an odd spectacle in this particular political moment. Trump ordered the arrest of a foreign leader who will now likely stand trial in the U.S. despite the immunity long observed under international law. Thanks to the Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling, though, Trump himself enjoys broad immunity from prosecution within the United States. The charges against Maduro may be legitimate, but the upcoming court proceedings—like the ongoing U.S. aggression toward Venezuela—will serve as yet another reminder of Trump’s own power and impunity.</div>

            <h2>A New Understanding of Human Beings’ Most Basic Desire</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/the-mattering-instinct-rebecca-newberger-goldstein-book-review/685536/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Philosophers are generally expected to display wisdom and calm in the face of existential questions. I am just not one of those philosophers. I spent 30 years racing away from these thoughts by running and swimming obsessively, pretending that I had no physical limits. Certain evasions are bound to fail: At 40, I suffered a cardiac arrest after an ill-advised treadmill workout. The sheer physicality of the event—the stopped heart, the failing body, the onerous recovery—threw into sharp relief a question that had always lurked beneath the surface: Does my life have a purpose? Or, put another way, how can I justify my existence? This dilemma gnaws at us in times of crisis and whispers to us in quiet moments of self-reflection. Rebecca Newberger Goldstein’s new book, The Mattering Instinct, helped me understand this feeling, to see it not as a personal quirk or a philosophical indulgence but as a fundamental aspect of what it means to be human.

We are, Goldstein asserts, “creatures of matter who long to matter.” This phrase captures the central paradox of the human condition: We are physical beings governed by the indifferent laws of nature, yet we are consumed by an obsession with our own significance. Her book is about, as she puts it, “a missing piece in the puzzle of understanding ourselves, one another, and our troubled times.” Goldstein, a philosopher and novelist known for her ability to bridge the worlds of science and the humanities, undertakes an ambitious project. She seeks to trace the origin of this profound desire and redefine what it means for a human life to flourish. She comes to a somewhat-surprising conclusion: that happiness isn’t always attainable or even desirable, but that anyone can achieve a good life by working to create order out of nature’s chaos.

Goldstein’s analysis hinges on an unexpected concept: the second law of thermodynamics. This is the principle of entropy, the inexorable tendency of any closed system to slide from order into chaos. Entropy is why houses fall into ruin, relationships fray, and bodies age. Life, in this framework, becomes a temporary act of defiance. Every living thing, Goldstein writes, is an intricate, energy-driven project engaged in a “ceaseless struggle against entropy.”

Using the “mattering map”—a classification system Goldstein first developed in her 1983 novel, The  Mind-Body Problem—she explains that this struggle manifests in different ways in different types of people. These types include the “heroic striver,” who believes the meaning of life is found in the next A+; the “transcender,” who seeks fulfillment in a relationship with the divine;  the “competitor,” who is motivated by defeating others; and the “socializer,” who seeks to matter by mattering to others.  I am—for better and occasionally for much worse—a heroic striver, which probably explains why I almost killed myself on that treadmill.

We each resist entropy in our own way, but in every case we are enacting a primitive, biological imperative that Goldstein refers to as self-mattering. Every organism is metabolically programmed to prioritize its own survival. “Biology’s response to the supreme law of physics,” she writes, “is what makes self-mattering deeper than any instinct, making it, rather, the organizing principle behind all the instincts.” If our genes could speak, “they would make for the best of self-esteem coaches,” she imagines. They would “incessantly and urgently exhort the organism forward,” saying, “You are special, oh so special.” This universal drive is the raw material of our story, as Goldstein tells it, but it is not the finished product. The uniquely human drama begins when people start to reflect back on this instinct.

This is the book’s central transformation. According to Goldstein, the leap from being simply a living thing to being a human occurs through the act of self-reflection, which turns us into what she dubs Homo iustificans—the creature who needs a reason. People’s capacity to “step back and survey themselves,” as the philosopher Thomas Nagel wrote, reveals a stark dissonance between our biological drive to survive and the fact that every life ends in death anyway. This realization gives rise to what Goldstein calls “the mother of all mattering questions—Do I matter?” The biological sense of importance is no longer enough. Instead, “We need to convince ourselves that our own self-mattering is warranted,” she writes. “We long to demonstrate that the reason we subjectively feel that we matter is that we objectively do.” That desire is what Goldstein defines as the “mattering instinct.”

Here, Goldstein makes a pivotal philosophical claim: Our inherent human dignity lies not in some immutable essence like a soul or a divine image, but in this very struggle. Recasting the story of Eden—a world without entropy—she argues that the expulsion from paradise was not a fall but a step into humanity, the moment we became “values-seeking creatures.” Goldstein isn’t the first philosopher to argue that we are driven by the quest to justify our existence, but she sees it as an overriding instinct, even when our attempts are flawed or lead us astray.

With this “mattering instinct” established as humans’ core driver, Goldstein redefines the goal of a well-lived life. She asks readers to look beyond what she considers a modern obsession with happiness, which she characterizes as a fleeting emotion, a mere “surge of neurotransmitters.” The true aim, she argues, is the richer, classical concept of “eudaimonia”—a deep and reflective sense that one’s life is being lived well. She borrows from Aristotle to underscore the point: Eudaimonia “is not found in amusement; for it would be absurd if the end were amusement, and our lifelong efforts and suffering aimed at amusing ourselves.” This thriving rests, instead, in feeling that our life is significant both to ourselves and to others.

Crucially, this state of flourishing can, and often does, coexist with great suffering. To illustrate this, Goldstein turns to figures such as Ludwig Wittgenstein, who experienced constant mental anguish yet who exclaimed on his deathbed, “Tell them I’ve had a wonderful life.” This, Goldstein contends, was a statement not about happiness but about eudaimonia. His life, for all its misery, had been ferociously engaged in a mattering project: He developed what is arguably the most rigorous philosophical system of the 20th century, the goal of which was to understand the limits of language and thought. This heroic undertaking, which brought him no small amount of distress, gave Wittgenstein’s life coherence and purpose.

Similarly, Goldstein examines the American philosopher William James, who had an existential crisis in his youth. In a thinly veiled anonymous account, James described the moment his sense of self collapsed: “Suddenly there fell upon me without any warning, just as if it came out of darkness, a horrible fear of existence,” he described it. “It was as if something hitherto solid within my breast gave way entirely, and I became a mass of quivering fear.” James’s recovery came from a decision to believe in his own “individual reality and creative power”—which contributed greatly to the field of empirical psychology, expanded American pragmatism, and reshaped theology in the 20th century. Both men struggled mightily in service of a project that made their lives feel not just bearable, but meaningful.

Of course, certain mattering projects are ill-conceived from the start, as Goldstein shows through the story of the former white supremacist Frank Meeink. According to his book, Autobiography of a Recovering Skinhead, after severe emotional and physical abuse during his childhood left him feeling worthless, Meeink was desperate never to be a victim again. He found a perverse sense of belonging and destiny in the neo-Nazi skinhead movement, which convinced him that he was, as he put it, a “warrior” and that being white was “all that mattered,” turning his extreme self-doubt into destructive power. Later, while in prison, Meeink grew close with Black inmates. After his release, a Jewish employer showed him unconditional respect and helped replace his hate with constructive self-worth. Transformed by these experiences, Meeink ultimately channeled his need to matter into a heroic project: dedicating his life to fighting extremism.

If the mattering instinct originates in life’s resistance to entropy, then this same principle can help provide a standard for what Goldstein calls “getting mattering right.” A flourishing, morally good life, she proposes, is counter-entropic: It increases “the spread of flourishing, knowledge, love, joyfulness, peace, kindness, comity, beauty.” A life lived wrongly is one that aligns with entropy, increasing the world’s sum of chaos, cruelty, and dissolution. “People’s effects on entropy,” she states plainly, “provide the best overarching means I know to assess their lives.”

Nowhere is this vision more powerfully embodied than in the subject of the book’s final portrait: Lou Xiaoying, an impoverished Chinese woman who survived by scavenging through rubbish and died around 2012. Over the course of her 88 years, she found and raised more than 30 abandoned baby girls left to die in dumpsters and on roadsides. As her adopted daughter Juju recalls, “If she had the strength enough to collect garbage, then how could she not recycle something as important as human lives?” Lou Xiaoying’s existence was one of almost uninterrupted  hardship, yet Juju describes her as happy, fulfilled by a purpose that was profoundly counter-entropic. She created life, connection, and love where society had left only waste and decay.

The Mattering Instinct is a testament to the idea that humans find purpose when, as the poet Rumi wrote, we “let the beauty we love be what we do.” In a world fractured by competing claims on what’s important, Goldstein offers a vision that is both intellectually resonant and humane, reminding us that the struggle to justify our existence is the very thing that makes our existence matter.

            <h2>A High-Seas Gambit Humiliates Putin</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/russia-putin-trump-venezuela-oil-tankers-marinera/685544/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the past two weeks, Russian authorities tried hard to protect an oil tanker that the Americans wanted to seize. On Christmas Eve, Moscow permitted the ship to fly the Russian tricolor, a symbolic warning for U.S. forces to keep their distance. The Russian foreign ministry then issued a demand for the Americans to leave the ship alone, and the Russian navy provided an escort, which reportedly included a submarine. None of it did any good.

Yesterday, as President Vladimir Putin celebrated Orthodox Christmas on a military base near Moscow, U.S. troops descended from helicopters onto the deck of the tanker, dealing the Kremlin a humiliation such as it has seldom faced on the high seas. Some Russian commentators called the raid an act of war, though the official response from Moscow sounded a lot more cautious: The foreign ministry urged the United States to respect the rights of the Russian citizens on board and to “put no obstacles for their soonest return to the motherland.”

The standoff, reminiscent of the tensest moments of the Cold War, deepened the dilemma Putin faces. The Trump administration kicked off the year with a series of belligerent moves, first sending troops into Caracas to arrest Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, then threatening a takeover of Greenland. Putin kept silent as the U.S. brought Maduro, his ally, to New York to face charges of trafficking drugs. While the Russian foreign ministry called on the U.S. to avoid “any further escalation,” some analysts speculated that the U.S. moves against Venezuela might offer benefits for Putin, heralding an era of great-power politics in which the U.S., Russia, and China carve up the world into their spheres of influence. But the American seizure of the tanker, known as the Marinera, was a reminder that between Moscow and Washington, a vast power differential remains.

The U.S. under Donald Trump has aggressively pushed Russia out of Latin America while giving no apparent ground in Europe. That dynamic could change if Trump makes good on his threats to take Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally. Several European leaders, including Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, have warned that such a move could spell the end of NATO, granting Putin his long-held wish to dismantle the alliance. In a post on social media yesterday, Trump sought to give his European allies at least a modicum of reassurance. “We will always be there for NATO,” Trump said. The United States under his leadership, he added, is the “only Nation that China and Russia fear and respect.”

Among Russian pundits and propaganda outlets, reactions to the Marinera’s fate reflected a mix of outrage and defeatism, as they realized that the U.S. has no intention of treating Moscow as an equal. “No one is carving up anything with us,” Dmitry Agranovsky, a Russian TV commentator, wrote on social media. “We are just the next in line.”

Some of the most influential military bloggers in Russia demanded an aggressive response from the Russian navy. “The Americans are not afraid of Russia,” wrote Alexei Dzermant, a political observer in neighboring Belarus, a Russian ally. “There obviously won’t be any trade of Venezuela for Ukraine.”

The idea for such a trade came up during the first Trump administration. Fiona Hill, who oversaw White House policy toward Moscow at the time, told Congress in 2019 that the Russians wanted to “make some very strange swap arrangement between Venezuela and Ukraine,” effectively suggesting that both of the nuclear superpowers should give each other free rein in their respective neighborhoods.

Hill recalled Russian diplomats and state media discussing the return of the Monroe Doctrine, a 19th-century policy in which the U.S. resisted European influence over the Western Hemisphere while staying out of Europe’s affairs. In the spring of 2019, Hill traveled to Moscow on behalf of the White House to reject the notion of swapping Ukraine for Venezuela.

The idea surfaced again this week, when Trump touted the U.S. raid against Maduro as part of a new Monroe Doctrine—or as he called it, the “Donroe Doctrine”—that would shape his approach to international affairs. “American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again,” Trump said in his announcement of Maduro’s arrest, on January 3.

Watching from Moscow, some members of the Russian political elite offered grudging praise for Trump while calling on the Kremlin to move with similar boldness. “Trump is showing us how we need to act,” the imperialist ideologue Aleksandr Dugin wrote on social media. “Right now, all of Russia is asking: Why do we not act this way toward our enemies?”

Dmitry Medvedev, the Putin acolyte and former president who now sits on the Kremlin’s security council, expressed much the same view in an interview with the state-run news agency Tass. He praised Trump and his team for “rigidly defending his country’s national interests, both political (with Latin America being the backyard of the United States) and economic (give us your oil and other natural resources).” In an apparent reference to the invasion of Ukraine, Medvedev added that the U.S. now has “nothing to reproach our country for.”

But the White House has shown none of the reciprocity Moscow seems to expect from what it sees as its fellow superpower. In the afterglow of the U.S. raid on Caracas, the Trump administration seems intent on asserting its claim to being the world’s preeminent decider, capable of imposing its will far beyond the Western Hemisphere. If the seizure of Russia’s ship in the North Atlantic did not make that clear enough, Pete Hegseth, the U.S. defense secretary, stated yesterday that the blockade of Venezuelan oil would be enforced “anywhere in the world.”

That kind of muscle flexing has long infuriated Putin. For nearly two decades, he has made it his mission to push back against what he describes as the hegemonic power of the United States. He first articulated this mission in a 2007 speech in Munich, when he declared that Russia would no longer tolerate the U.S. habit of using its military to get what it wanted. He has railed against American-led interventions in the Balkans, Iraq, and Afghanistan, calling them examples of an unbridled and intolerable “hyper-use of force.”

In 2011, when the U.S. and several of its European allies began a bombing campaign against the forces of Muammar Qaddafi in Libya, Putin lashed out. “What troubles me is not the fact of the military intervention itself,” he said. “I am concerned by the ease with which decisions to use force are taken in international affairs.” In his memoir, The Back Channel, the former diplomat and CIA director William Burns recalls how the death of Qaddafi affected Putin, who would replay footage of the Libyan dictator being dragged from a drainpipe and beaten by insurgents.

Afterward, the Russian president became far more aggressive in trying to counter U.S.-military interventions. He sent warplanes in 2015 to defend his ally Bashar al-Assad, in Syria, from a coalition of insurgent groups and revolutionary forces, some of them backed by the United States. Putin’s defense minister at the time, Sergei Shoigu, later mused that the Russian intervention in Syria had dissuaded the U.S. from seeking to overthrow regimes it didn’t like, thus “breaking the chain of color revolutions,” such as the popular uprisings in Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and elsewhere.

But the start of the Russian assault on Ukraine in 2022 forced Putin to scale back his global ambitions. He could not stop Islamist rebels from overthrowing Assad in 2024 and evicting Russia from its naval base in Syria. He offered little help to his allies in Iran last year when they came under attack from U.S. and Israeli warplanes. And he did nothing to save his ally in Caracas when Maduro’s turn came to face an American attack this weekend. The weapons that Venezuela had purchased from Russia over the years failed to shoot down a single American helicopter during the operation to detain the Venezuelan leader. “Seems those Russian air defenses didn’t quite work so well, did they?” Hegseth said in a taunting speech on Monday.

It remains to be seen how Russia might answer this latest round of American insults, but Putin’s options are severely limited by the demands of the war he started in Ukraine. The federal budget for the next three years envisions significant tax hikes to finance Russia’s enormous military spending (about 8 percent of GDP), and it will be sustainable only if the price of oil, Russia’s most important export, stays at an average of $70 a barrel.

Last month, the price of Russian crude sank to about half that level, and it could drop even lower if the U.S. manages to tap Venezuela’s oil reserves. One of Russia’s most influential billionaires, Oleg Deripaska, warned of the consequences after the U.S. swept into Caracas. “If our American ‘partners’ get the oil fields of Venezuela,” he wrote on social media, “they will control more than half of the world’s supplies of oil. And it looks like they plan to make sure that the price of our oil does not go higher than $50 per barrel.” At that level, Deripaska warned, it will be difficult for Putin’s version of state capitalism to make ends meet.

After the American move to seize Russian oil tankers, the Kremlin’s business model looks even shakier. Russia has relied on a “shadow fleet” of tankers to transport its oil to clients in China, India, and Turkey in circumvention of Western sanctions on its energy industry. The seizure of the Marinera suggests that this loophole will continue to tighten, leaving Putin less room to maneuver on the global stage, or even to finance his nearly four-year-old war in Ukraine. Yesterday morning, the U.S. seized another oil tanker close to Venezuela, suggesting that its campaign against the Russian shadow fleet is just beginning.</div>

What we call &quot;Dumb TVs,&quot; the industry calls &quot;monitors.&quot; Use that search term and you&#39;ll find plenty.

Yup, plenty out there in all the common sizes, just won&#39;t find them nearly as cheap as your average living room TV;

Yeah, the prices are initially surprising. I guess all the spying, ads, and preloaded crapware/shovelware have massively increased the margins on Smart TVs, so that competitive pressures brought the price to way below benevolent TVs. That should give us all an idea how many dollars worth of fuckery a Smart TV inflicts.

To be fair these displays are generally built to higher quality standards as well, they&#39;re meant to go into environments to run 16/7 or 24/7 and are warrantied as such so they&#39;re just made different and they sell far less of them then the consumer sets.

This is not a product endorsement; I have no familiarity with the product and all I did was search Amazon and pick the first result (which was also sponsored). That said: Amazon claims to sell this [amazon.com].

(This is not a store endorsement, either, but it looks like Amazon will let you put it in your shopping cart (and presumably buy it) without asking who is going to use it for what. I only mention this because someone else posted that some vendor refuses to sell monitors to individuals.)

Nothing connected to the internet is safe anymore.

While I don&#39;t agree with much that Ken Paxton does, I&#39;ll take this small win.  It&#39;s bad enough when &quot;smart&quot; TVs snoop what&#39;s being watched through apps and network connections -- this bullshit, screen-capturing whatever&#39;s being fed in via HDMI etc. and doing analysis on it to come up with &quot;insights&quot; to sell, yeah, fuck you very much.  I&#39;d never connect a TV to the Internet anyway, but I&#39;m in a small minority in that regard, and regular people have rights too.

Now that we&#39;re working on getting invasive surveillance technology out of the lives of everyday Americans minding their own business, perhaps, Mr. Paxton, you&#39;d like to have a word with Flock?   *crickets*

Everyone here is praising this. They&#39;re just also using the opportunity to trash on Praxton, which is perfectly justified.

No the slashdot logic would say Samsung should stop selling them in Texas. Or is that only when the EU does consumer protection laws?

Except it doesn&#39;t work when there is not enough water, when there are pests that are ready to destroy the new crop, or when they are burned out by the summer heat, which is a lot higher than it was just 20 years ago.

All of the above and more courtesy of the &quot;hoax&quot; of global warming.

I see the consequences where I live, which isn&#39;t very far from Germany and we don&#39;t have the &quot;monoculture&quot; problem, but still our trees are dying, so I don&#39;t need the moronic opinion of the gifted amateur from trumpistan who hasn&#39;t seen the outside of a city because of his fat ass.

Moronic opinions from locals are much better.  That&#39;s where you need to get all your moronic opinions from.  And, they&#39;re cheaper, too.

Secondly if you fuck up an ecosystem hard enough, then even the native species can cause massive problems, https://www.theguardian.com/co... [theguardian.com]

Except they are still burning and grazing the land any way ... so what&#39;s really the cause?

Agricultural practices can appear sustainable for a very long time before hitting the wall.

Despite that they still managed to lower their emissions, so fuck off, trumptard, a lying asshole from the country that&#39;s the cause for the global warming and plunders countries for their oil.

If a hectare is 10,000 square meters, does that mean it is 10 square kilometers?  Metric system is so confusing.

Sustainable forestry is actually unsustainable ... climate gets the blame.

Yes.  Why are there &quot;email systemS&quot; used by Congressional staff?  Those systems should be central, compartmentalized and secured.  Need justification?  FOIA.

Let&#39;s hope they&#39;re doing as much. The Chinese are unlikely to publicise when someone does pull a stunt like this...

At CES there was a robot clerk that spoke 50 languages.  Perhaps the US has something equivalent.

Let&#39;s not bicker and argue over who hacked who. China has huge... burgeoning economies of scale.

Anyway... I guess I&#39;ll have lasagna for dinner tonight.

TV&#39;s are that cheap *now*. But they still need RAM...which we all know is in short supply and soon likely won&#39;t be available at all.

I think we&#39;re about to see end of the cheap electronics. The days of sub $600 laptops and $200 TV&#39;s are gone.

A smart TV needs ram for the lowend soc it uses solely to drive the smart tv function, a dumb screen needs significantly less and can make do with a tiny amount built on a much older process. This isn&#39;t in competition with the kind of ram that&#39;s currently in high demand.

2GB is a lot when you&#39;re building 3x TV per minute and shipping them out by the literal boat-load. There are 8 billion people on this planet and more than half of them will buy a new TV in the next 10 years

A lot of old teletext enabled CRT TVs had simple 8 bit computers inside them. Wonder if anyone ever hacked them to do something else?

I doubt that someone made any considerable changes to them. Limited interfaces for external devices is probably the main issue.

They COULD drop all the smart shit and make a TV that is just you know a display, without advertising or requiring you to connect it to the internet.But..

And then it would be more costly because the TV is paid for by the ads and by tracking you.

TV&#39;s don&#39;t need ram unless you&#39;re buying a Smart TV, at which point the question is &quot;What kind of fucking moron buys a Smart TV?&quot;

Yes, exactly.  The hardware itself is a loss-leader; the real money comes from spying on you and feeding you ads.  The manufacturer can either make $200 profit on the hardware, once, or make a continuous revenue stream from ads and spying.  It&#39;s a no-brainer.

Which is why my TV was completely disconnected from the Internet. No Ethernet no WiFi.

Amazon hardware can connect between their devices (even those of neighbours) using their Sidewalk mesh network. Caveat emptor.

If enough people stop buying them, that trend would stop. It should works as well as stopping buying inkjet printers did.

A more modern variation on the theme is Max Headroom.

In my recollection, in 2001, if a 50 inch flat screen existed, it would have been more like $40,000.2021 or 2011 would be more realistic - maybe a typo?

I remember my first year of college in 2002.  We were talking about Plasma TV&#39;s, and every rich family would have a 42&quot; Plasma TV, it was seen as the ultimate home cinema accessory.  I believe they were even SD resolution, they predated the HD standards. There was even a rumour that crooks would drive around at night looking to see plasma TV&#39;s through windows so they would know who had money.

I&#39;m sure they were only around $1000 - $2000 back then, I remember a conversation with a friend, he said &quot;Man when we

I think I paid less than that for a 55 inch rear projection 1080i TV back then

If anyone is interested about a year ago a team tracked one of the last working models to a noodle factory in Japan and managed to relocate it to the US, its quite a journey:

What Happened to the World&#39;s Largest Tube TV? [youtube.com]

I finally gave up fighting my newer Visio and disconnected it from the internet.  I just use an AppleTV, but the Vizio still tries to force me to watch itâ(TM)s advertisements shortly after I turn it on.  It fails, but itâ(TM)s still an annoyance.  No more Vizio for me, this lifetime.

In the 00&#39;s we were promised that by 30&#39;s we would be able to wallpaper our houses with screens that were as cheap as paint, still not there yet.

I think its fair to say that generally speaking futurologists are full of shit and don&#39;t have any more insight into the future than anyone else.

Yeah makes me laugh when people say &quot;A 65&quot; screen at 4K 120hz is all you would ever need, why ever need anything more?&quot;  Get back to me when I can unfurl wallpaper displays that have the DPI of a Retina iphone which I can connect to be meters across.

They have shown prototypes of wallpaper type displays that looked great to me, baffles me as to why we don&#39;t see them in use?  Is it the effort of sticking them to a wall and connecting them together outweighing just buying a single sized TV?? (I guess there&#39;d b

Wallpaper displays were the promise of OLED for 20 years but they&#39;ve never quite been able to get the tech developed and reliable and cheap enough.  Even LG is starting to lean away from it despite being the only company who really managed to manufacture it at scale, it&#39;s remained a premium display with some caveats rather than the replacement for LCD.

Maybe MicroLED will fulfill that promise but that is also still another 5-10 years away from being truly scaled up.

What&#39;s the point of a &quot;retina&quot; display at 3 feet when you actually sit 10-15 feet away? A 65in 4k display IS a retina display at normal viewing distances.

A huge display is nice for certain applications like a dedicated home theater, but a lot of people don&#39;t want an enormous screen in a living room. If you REALLY want something big 100in displays have come down to consumer-accessible prices and nearfield projects can go quite a bit larger. The number of times when a &quot;wallpaper&quot; like display is actually help

Exactly - look up the THX specs - you need to be sitting about 6 feet from that 65&quot; 4K for most anyone to tell the difference.

I don&#39;t think this is correct? At the tech school where I taught we purchased a 40&quot; (might have even been 32&quot;) gas plasma display in ~2003 for $30,000. We purchased it to add to the auditorium behind the podium next to the projector screen. I remember the price very clearly because I thought at the time it was a colossal waste of resources.

I remember back in 2004, the Sony Store had a &quot;demo&quot; OLED screen that was about 10 inches (could have been slightly smaller or bigger, can&#39;t remember) and it was available for purchase for something like $25 000 (Canadian $).

Around this time I bought a Sony 16:9 32&quot; 1080i CRT.... looked incredible... weighted about 150 pounds.  Got it for about $1000.  At the time I was the only one I knew who had a HD TV... all sporting events were watched at my place!  I only got rid of the grey beast because I didn&#39;t w

That Sony OLED was released in 2007, not 2004... sorry, not like it was 20 years ago or anything.

I believe it was late 2003 or early 2004 when I purchased my first flat screen monitor for my computer. It was an NEC LCD1960NX 19&quot; multisync 4:3 1280x1024 LCD. It cost $1000 when I picked it up at Staples. It replaced a 21&quot; CRT monster I had sitting at my desk. I still have that NEC monitor and it works great. My first LCD TV was a Samsung 40&quot; I purchased in 2009 for $800 from Newegg, when I thought prices finally became reasonable, LOL. I still have that TV too and it works great as well.

It&#39;s a bit off-topic, but non-tube TVs have gotten a lot bigger too:  The early LCD TVs were small [orientdisplay.com]:

In the 1980s, there was rapid progress made in creating usable products with this new LCD research. Color LCD television screens were first developed in Japan during this decade. Because of the limit in response times due to large display size (correlated with a large number of pixels), the first TVs were handheld/pocket TVs. Seiko Epson, or Epson, created the first LCD TV, releasing it to the public in 1982, which was soon followed by their first fully colored display pocket LCD TV in 1984. Also in 1984 was the first commercial TFT LCD display: Citizen Watchâ(TM)s 2.7 inch color LCD TV. Shortly after, in 1988, Sharp Corporation created a 14 inch full-color TFT LCD that used an active matrix and had full-motion properties. Large-size LCDs now made LCD integration into large flat-panel displays like LCD screens and LCD monitors possible. LCD projection technology, first created by Epson, became readily available to consumers in compact and fully colored modes in 1989.

A 50-inch TV [...] now costs less than $200
This seemed to good to be true, so I checked Best Buy just like they said, and while Best Buy does have 50&quot; TV&#39;s that cost less than $200, filtering for &quot;non-Smart&quot; TV&#39;s increases the price to $450+.
I&#39;ll leave it as an exercise to the reader to figure out why a TV with less features would cost more.

After nine months of relative silence on the matter, President Donald Trump is once again making noise about taking over Greenland, by force if necessary.

Perhaps it’s the result of his sugar-high, brought on by last weekend’s military operation in Venezuela, a country that he now says he “runs” and whose potentially vast oil resources he claims to control.

In any case, U.S. allies worldwide are alarmed—some are even uncharacteristically objecting in public—by Trump’s unabashedly imperialist turn. Others, notably Russia and China, may be tempted by the implicit green light that he has signaled, intentionally or not, toward their own ambitions for regional domination of Ukraine and Taiwan, respectively.

Many are simply baffled by this obsession with territorial expansion. House Speaker Mike Johnson insists that Trump has no intention of launching a military invasion of Greenland. Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco Rubio notes that Trump wants to buy Greenland, not conquer the place—though this provides little reassurance about the president’s mindset.

Yet this desire to take over Greenland seems to stem from an impulse even cruder than one might suspect. Susan Glasser and Peter Baker reported in their book, The Divider, about Trump’s first term as president, that the idea was inspired by his friend and supporter billionaire perfume heir Ronald Lauder, who one day pointed to a map alleging to show the appeal of acquiring Greenland.

Not long after, the president raised the idea at a National Security Council meeting. As Trump himself recounted to the authors:

I said, “Why don’t we have that?” You take a look at a map. I’m a real-estate developer. I look at a corner, I say, “I’ve got to get that store for the building that I’m building,” etc. It’s not that different. I love maps. And I always said, “Look at the size of this [Greenland]. It’s massive. That should be part of the United States.”

Actually, it’s not that massive. Flat Mercator-projection maps, like the one Lauder showed Trump, exaggerate the size of landmasses near the Earth’s north and south poles. Greenland, which looks larger than the United States on such maps, is in fact only slightly larger than Mexico, which Trump hasn’t coveted for its size, even though it’s right on our border, not 1,200 miles from our closest coastline.

Still, could that be it? Trump’s a real-estate magnate; he sees a big slab of land; he wants it? Seems so. In fact, back in 2019, when he first talked publicly about buying the land, he thought his right to do so was so self-evident that he was shocked when the prime minister of Denmark—which has long controlled Greenland as an autonomous territory—told him it wasn’t for sale; he even canceled an upcoming visit to Copenhagen over her “nasty” rejection.

Other rationales for grabbing the island nation have since entered the picture, perhaps after briefings by aides who know that part of their job involves feeding the boss’ appetite, however bizarre. Though it’s largely uninhabited—with just 56,000 residents, most of them Inuits—Greenland does hold massive, though ice-covered, mineral deposits. And it has geostrategic value. During the Cold War, admirals talked about the “GIUK Gap,” the initials standing for Greenland, Iceland, and the United Kingdom. U.S. air and naval policy in those days was to keep Soviet ships and submarines holed up north of the Gap, so they don’t pose much of a threat; let them into the Gap, and they could threaten the Atlantic’s vital sea lanes. The same is true today, as the melting of Arctic ice allows Russian and Chinese vessels new routes into the lanes.

But so what? The U.S. can defend those lanes without annexing Greenland. It and Denmark are both members of NATO. The United States has an enormous air and missile-defense base in Greenland. It has also signed deals for vast access to bases in Denmark, and Danish leaders have offered to expand the terms and the size of U.S. troop deployments. There are also many other bases nearby, manned and operated by U.S. and various European defense forces.

This is one reason a country has allies and foreign bases—so it can defend its interests without having to invade or buy up half the world.

Of course, Trump’s renewed rumblings about Greenland—which seem less fantastical since his openly imperial operation in Venezuela—are disrupting those alliances. Some close U.S. allies voted to condemn the Caracas raid at an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council. Others—including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has taken great pains to avoid confrontations with the sensitive American president—warned Trump very sternly not to make serious moves on Greenland. Denmark’s prime minister said that such a move—one NATO country threatening the sovereignty of another—would destroy the alliance and crater the foundations of peace in Europe since World War II.

Commentators in South Korea and Japan who are closely aligned with their governments’ political positions have noted that Trump’s latest words and deeds provide growing evidence—even more so than earlier words and deeds—that the largest democracies in Asia can no longer rely on the U.S. for protection. The resulting dangers are considerable—the possibility of nuclear proliferation and new arms races (as allies, who have relied on America’s “nuclear umbrella” for their ultimate defense, conclude they need to erect their own) or even armed conflict (as, for instance, China or North Korea see the need to pounce while the U.S. veers away).

Back during Trump’s eruptions of bombast over Greenland in his first term, H.R. McMaster, who had recently stepped down (or been fired) as his national security adviser, waved away concerns, saying, “This is just President Trump being President Trump.”

Now, not quite a year into his much more volcanic and disruptive second term, McMaster’s wave-off reads as something other than reassurance today. Yes, this is President Trump. The world is very worried, and we should be too.

Shortly after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, city leaders began looking into whether the officer had violated state criminal law.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, “We collectively are going to do everything possible to get to the bottom of this, to get justice, and to make sure that there is an investigation that is conducted in full.” Police Chief Brian O’Hara followed up by saying that the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is “investigat[ing] whether any state laws within the state of Minnesota have been violated.”

If they conclude that state law has been violated, the question is: What next? Contrary to recent assertions from some federal officials, states can prosecute federal officers for violating state criminal laws, and there is precedent for that.

Although federal officers do have immunity in some circumstances, that protection applies only if their actions were authorized under federal law and “necessary and proper” in fulfilling federal duties. When federal officers violate federal law or act unreasonably when carrying out their duties, they can face state charges.

States have a long history of prosecuting federal officials for allegedly using excessive force on the job. And when federal courts agree that the force may not have been legally justified, they have allowed the state prosecution to proceed.

In a high-profile incident from the 1990s, for example, an FBI sniper shot and accidentally killed an unarmed woman while carrying out a siege of a cabin near Ruby Ridge, Idaho. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno decided not to pursue charges, but a county prosecutor in the state did, charging the sniper with involuntary manslaughter. The federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the state prosecution to proceed, concluding that there were “material questions of fact” about whether the sniper’s use of deadly force was reasonable. If it wasn’t, the court explained, he would not be immune from state prosecution. (The charges were later dropped after the prosecutor who brought the case left office.)

Similarly, in 1906, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a state prosecution to go ahead against two federal soldiers who had shot and killed a man they believed was stealing from federal property. As with the Idaho case, key facts were in dispute. The court concluded that if the man had stopped and surrendered, as multiple witnesses attested, “it could not reasonably be claimed that the fatal shot was fired in the performance of a duty imposed by the Federal law,” and the soldiers could be held liable.

There are also a host of cases from the early-1900s prohibition era in which states charged federal officers with murder, attempted murder, or other crimes when they used lethal force to carry out prohibition-related arrests or seize distillery equipment. Again, when federal courts concluded that the federal officers’ use of force appeared unreasonable—such as by shooting into cars that officers believed were transporting alcohol—the courts allowed the state prosecutions to proceed.

To be sure, there are also plenty of cases in which federal courts have instead dismissed state prosecutions on the grounds that the federal officers were properly discharging their federal duties. For example, the foundational Supreme Court case on this type of immunity dismissed a state murder prosecution of a U.S. marshal who had justifiably killed an attacker while protecting a Supreme Court justice. But when an officer’s actions are not authorized by federal law or are not “necessary and proper” to fulfill federal duties—such as when an officer uses unreasonable force—state prosecutions can and do go ahead.

If state or local prosecutors in Minnesota were to charge a federal officer with a state crime, that case would play out differently from a typical state criminal prosecution.

Most significantly, it would likely take place in federal court rather than state court. A federal statute allows federal officers to move state criminal cases from state to federal court if they have a defense rooted in federal law. Any federal officer charged with a state-law crime for actions committed on the job will almost certainly try to claim federal immunity from state prosecution. That defense will typically suffice to get the case into federal court, even if the immunity claim ultimately fails.

But the move to federal court doesn’t mean that federal players would take over the entire process. The state or local prosecutor would still prosecute the case in federal court. And the criminal charges would still be for state-law crimes. Importantly, this means that if an officer were convicted, the president could not pardon them. The president can pardon individuals only for federal crimes, not state crimes.

Additionally, if state or local prosecutors do bring charges, the pretrial litigation over immunity could well be lengthy. In the Idaho case discussed above, for example, the incidents took place in 1992, and it wasn’t until 2001 that the 9th Circuit ultimately ruled that the case could go ahead. The various lower-court proceedings and appeals took considerable time.

Despite these procedural complexities, the bottom line is that federal officers are not categorically immune from state prosecution for actions carried out while on duty. And states have long demonstrated that they are willing to bring such charges when it comes to excessive use of force.

When George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis, the nation’s immediate reaction was one of horror. That included Republican commentators, who expressed their shock at the slow murder of Floyd by suffocation, agreeing his treatment was both brutal and excessive. President Donald Trump called Floyd’s killing “sickening” and “revolting.” There were stray voices who immediately blamed Floyd for his own murder—a preview of the position the MAGA commentariat would eventually adopt—but at least in the beginning, Republicans in power reacted to a heinous murder caught on camera with disapproval.

Five and a half years later, we live in a very different world.

On Wednesday, videos circulated on social media of another killing in Minneapolis, of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer repeatedly shooting a woman in her car. We don’t know many details yet about the woman, but we do know she was killed. It’s a horrible loss of life.

To the president, though, weighing in a few hours later, it was “horrible” for another reason. “The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,” he wrote on Truth Social. “The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis.”

The video reveals this account to be a lie. The woman—identified by the Minnesota Star Tribune as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good—did not run over an ICE agent, and the car was turning away from the agents when one fired multiple shots into the vehicle.

Nevertheless, the MAGA commentary machine made it clear that the video wouldn’t disrupt their narrative around ICE and deportations. The party line quickly emerged: The victim was a threat whose killing was justified. And beyond that, the commentators identified the people truly at fault for the killing: Democrats who criticized ICE agents.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem declared the woman had been committing “domestic terror.” Tomi Lahren, a Fox News commentator, argued on Fox that “We would not be dealing with this kind of confrontation if these leaders would encourage these far-left activists to be peaceful.” On social media, she was more insistent: “ALL of this could be avoided if Democrat leaders would STOP encouraging and emboldening THUGS who attack and antagonize our law enforcement agents and officers!”

The powerful X account Libs of TikTok responded to a video of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz objecting to the shooting by arguing the woman had been trying to kill the officers. “This comes after you and your friends demonized ICE for months on end and incited violence against them,” the account wrote. “Hope this helps.”

“The Democrat party’s violent rhetoric against ICE agents now has their brainwashed followers trying to murder them with their cars,” another popular X account wrote.

“The Left and ONLY THE LEFT is 100% responsible for creating the conditions for this event,” wrote William Wolfe, a Southern Baptist leader who once worked in the Trump administration. “They spent the last 10 years telling their foot soldiers they are some merry band of morally superior resistance fighters.”

The official Trump administration position, too, was one with the influencers’. “[O]ne of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism,” an official DHS statement read. “An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.”

There was, in that reaction, no talk of investigation or urging of calm until facts could be determined. There was only right-wing influencer spin, converting the killing of an American into another point of political attack. “This is the direct consequence of constant attacks and demonization of our officers by sanctuary politicians who fuel and encourage rampant assaults on our law enforcement who are facing 1,300% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats,” the statement read.

To be clear, the incident, shown from a couple different angles, does not show murderous intent from the driver. The woman was parked in her SUV when two ICE agents got out of a pickup truck and walked over to her. One walked briskly, the other at a slow pace. The brisk-walking officer then tried to reach for the handle of the driver-side door. As he did so, the woman reversed a few feet, in an apparent attempt to resituate the car in order to drive away. When she braked, a third agent became visible standing in front of the car. She then shifted from reverse to drive and pulled forward at an angle, in an attempt to drive away from the officers. An officer pulled out his gun, sidestepped the car, and—as she was already pulling away—shot repeatedly toward the windshield or driver’s side window. The officer then calmly put his gun back in his holster and walked toward the car, which had crashed into another car down the street. It’s possible there was more to the incident than the videos show, but it seems very unlikely, based on the angle we’ve seen, that the officer was in any real danger.

It’s a shocking video, made all the more shocking by its circumstances: The woman, according to local news reports from the scene, was not a suspect leaving a crime or even an immigrant afraid of arrest, but a political protester trying to protect her neighbors. Federal agents were operating in Minneapolis as part of a major deportation campaign targeting its Somali community. The city’s government had not asked for the agents’ involvement and instead actively protested their presence.

We can’t be sure this will be the final evolution in the MAGA response to the incident. Others have hinted that they see this not just as a way to blame Democrats for their rhetoric, but to actually justify further violations of civil liberties and an expansion of the police state.

“National Guard needs to be deployed to Minneapolis,” the commentator Tim Pool argued. “This cannot be allowed to stand.”

“Leftists are reliably shocked when you don’t let them murder you,” one writer for the Blaze wrote. “But they are weak, you should not fear them, just crush them.”

“Many conservatives are calling on President Trump to SURGE THE MILITARY into Minneapolis after the traitorous mayor doubles down in favor of the anti-ICE terrorist,” another major account wrote.

Five years ago, the shocking murder of George Floyd was met with horror and deep, nonpartisan sadness, at least for a period. Today’s MAGA operation, though, is already at work rehabilitating his killer.

What happened on Wednesday morning in Minneapolis? If you believe Department of Homeland Security public affairs official Tricia McLaughlin, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers found themselves in mortal danger when “violent protesters” interrupted their “targeted operations.” As she put it, “One of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.” The officer responded by shooting the driver in the head, or, as McLaughlin put it, “He used his training and saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.”

The driver, reportedly a 37-year-old American woman, was killed.

We do not have to take Tricia McLaughlin’s word for it, though. We don’t even have to rely on eye witnesses or normal journalism to understand what happened this morning in Minneapolis. There is a video of it that anyone can watch, which pretty clearly shows what happened.

As Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey put it in a press briefing: “What I can tell you is the narrative that this was just done in self-defense is a garbage narrative. That is not true. It has no truth. And it needs to be stated very clearly, since we have already seen a video of it.”

Frey described the shooting as “an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.” But you don’t have to believe Frey either: because there is a video that you can watch for yourself.

Should you watch it? It was another infamous video that came out of Minneapolis that prompted one of the broadest recent discussions of whether we all need to watch incredibly graphic accounting of brutality government entities (in that case, the police; in this case, ICE) perpetrate against ordinary people. It’s disturbing to have to watch these things, to be the eyes of accountability, to witness any other human’s last unwilling moments on Earth, and it is particularly disturbing when you are a member of a persecuted group. But millions watched the footage of George Floyd’s killing. That is probably one of the main reasons there was accountability for the police officer who murdered him.

I work in news, so I don’t really have a choice in watch-it-or-don’t matters. I am here to tell you: On this one, you can watch it. In fact, you should watch it.

For one thing, it is disturbing but not as graphic as the Floyd video (at least, not in a bloody, intimate sense). The sounds, more than the visuals, are the things that will haunt you here. It shows the officers coming at the car, it shows the car driving away and then careening into the side of the road as it crashes. I had to watch a couple of times to understand when the shot happened and who took the shot. There is plenty of horrified screaming in the background, which is the stuff of nightmares, but you can get the idea by watching it on silent (if that is the kind of thing that will help you stomach it).

But it is also extremely clarifying in terms of specifically how inaccurate the DHS statement is. Sure, yes, this video captures under a minute in time. Perhaps later there will be facts that come out that add more credence to the understanding that this person was a threat—maybe. The entire idea of what happens next is headache-inducing; given the federal government’s initial posture—and the position of President Donald Trump more generally toward using the Department of Justice as his own plaything—it is already laughable to expect a fair probe of the incident from the federal government. The public should pressure local authorities to conduct such an investigation. Minneapolis Chief of Police Brian O’Hara assured reporters that the FBI was working with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension in the investigation, “and the purpose of their involvement would be to investigate whether any state laws within the state of Minnesota have been violated.” There would be many obstacles to justice if it is determined that a crime was committed here by state and local officials—though O’Hara already repeatedly referred to the place of the shooting as a “crime scene”—but we at least need that effort at justice.

To a much larger extent, I think what the 47 seconds the video does show makes it pretty clear. This was not a “must shoot to kill” moment.

Despite this clarity, narratives immediately spun out. The New York Times’ live blog on the situation, for example, made it seem like reality could only be ascertained by triangulating the narratives of the various involved authorities at play here: DHS on one hand and statements from the city’s mayor on the other. But you don’t need to triangulate between these supposedly official accounts. You can just watch the video.

And there is another reason you should watch the video. We currently live in a true upside-down universe, a universe in which you cannot trust your government to accurately characterize what is happening in the world. Sure, yes, that has been happening for a long time, since there were governments at all, never mind America’s. But we are living in a particularly noxious moment where the government we currently live under is willing to lie directly to our faces about what we can see with our own eyes. To wit,  Trump apparently watched the video too today, and as is his habit, he live-blogged his interpretation in a giant wall of text. After asserting that the woman who was killed was “obviously a professional agitator,” he claims that she “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE officer” and that “it is hard to believe he is alive.”

But no one was run over by the car. The shooting officer, in the video, can be seen calmly walking away toward the woman he just shot and killed.

So: Your federal government is already sprinting away with its spin on what happened this morning, with a narrative that will attempt to justify the woman who died as a dangerous protester and will cast the ICE agents who faced her down as heroes. As a different government official, Frey, put it, “Having seen the video of myself, I want to tell everybody directly: That is bullshit.” Which government official should you believe? Well, in this case, you don’t have to decide. You can just believe your own eyes.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We hope you like more AI in your Gmail inbox, because Google is &quot;bringing Gmail into the Gemini era.&quot; It&#39;ll be on by default, but the good news is that you can disable it.

The threat, issued on Thursday by Google&#39;s VP of product Blake Barnes, sees the company expanding the reach of a trio of inbox AI features that were previously only available to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. You know - the folks who actually wanted the stuff.

Now, Barnes explained, everyone will be getting a dose of Google&#39;s much-derided AI Overviews in their Gmail inbox, along with Help Me Write features and new Suggested Reply features that are supposed to be more contextual, based on a user&#39;s writing style, and helpful.

&quot;Just like they do in Google Search, AI Overviews turn information into answers without the digging,&quot; Barnes said. &quot;When you open an email with dozens of replies, Gmail synthesizes the entire conversation into a concise summary of key points.&quot;

Google is also rolling out natural language inbox search, which could be the most helpful of the new features. Unfortunately for the many non-paying plebeians using Gmail for free, that feature is only available for Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers - hey, gotta give them something if those previously paid AI features are being rolled out to everyone.

As for composition help, &quot;everyone can use Help Me Write to polish emails or draft them from scratch,&quot; Barnes said. Smart Replies - the prior trio of AI-generated responses to emails - are also being updated with Suggested Replies, &quot;which use the context of your conversation to offer relevant, one-click responses that match how you write.&quot;

AI proofreading, which we assume will be more helpful than the current squiggly underlining of incorrectly spelled words and poor grammar, is also being rolled out on Thursday, but just to Pro and Ultra subscribers, Google explained.

Barnes also threatened Gmail users with a full-on &quot;AI Inbox&quot; view that is only being rolled out to select testers for now, but will be more broadly available in the coming months. That view, as demonstrated in a video published by Google on Thursday, turns the standard Gmail inbox into a list of daily to-dos designed to help users prioritize their inbox workload &quot;based on signals like people you email frequently, those in your contacts list and relationships it can infer from message content.&quot;

Gmail users in the US with English set as their primary language are the first ones to be subjected to these new features, which a Google spokesperson told us should be gradually rolling out to users in the next few days.

For those worried about the privacy of their Gmail content, Google claimed in an email that it&#39;s not going to use personal message text to train its foundational models and does all AI processing in an isolated environment.

&quot;When Gmail connects the dots between your emails to answer a question, it does that work in a private space dedicated solely to your task,&quot; the spokesperson explained. &quot;The data is processed to give you an answer, and it never leaves that secure boundary.&quot;

Of course, this assumes the answers you get from Gemini in Gmail will be accurate, and that&#39;s far from a guarantee. Take, for example, a recent Google job posting for an AI answers quality engineer. While the job posting will see a new Google employee &quot;help the AI Answers Quality team deliver AI Overviews to users&#39; hard and complicated queries on the [search results page] and in AI Mode,&quot; where there&#39;s AI smoke, there may be AI fire, and it&#39;s entirely possible the version of Gemini that&#39;s stuffed into people&#39;s email inboxes could make mistakes, too.

For those who&#39;d prefer to skip the Gemini-ification of their email, Google also told us that the features can all be disabled, though that comes with a slight catch: Disabling AI in Gmail requires disabling Gmail smart features entirely, which means no more inbox tabs or messages sorted by type.

To disable Smart Features, just navigate to Settings -> General and scroll down until you see the &quot;Smart features&quot; header. Uncheck the &quot;Turn on smart features&quot; box and you should be good to go.

To avoid dealing with future forced AI insertion into your email business, it&#39;s also not a bad idea to check out a standalone email application like Thunderbird, or the built-in email client in your operating system, all of which support Gmail and don&#39;t require dealing with an ever-changing web interface to access your messages. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/08/rcisco_ise_bug_poc/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cisco patched a bug in its Identity Services Engine (ISE) and ISE Passive Identity Connector (ISE-PIC) products that allows remote attackers with admin-level privileges to access sensitive information - and warned that a public, proof-of-concept exploit for the flaw exists online.

ISE is Cisco&#39;s network access control and security policy platform, and companies use it to centrally manage and enforce security policies across users and devices.

The bug, tracked as CVE-2026-20029, received a medium-severity 4.9 CVSS rating and it affects ISE and ISE-PIC, regardless of device configuration. It&#39;s due to improper parsing of XML processed by ISE and ISE-PIC&#39;s web-based management interface.

&quot;An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file to the application,&quot; according to the Wednesday security advisory. &quot;A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the underlying operating system that could include sensitive data that should otherwise be inaccessible even to administrators.&quot;

Cisco credited Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative&#39;s bug hunter Bobby Gould with spotting and reporting this vulnerability.

&quot;This vulnerability does require authentication, so that&#39;s the first barrier to exploitation,&quot; ZDI&#39;s Head of Threat Awareness Dustin Childs told The Register, adding that ZDI doesn&#39;t expect to see widespread abuse of this flaw given its high-privilege requirements.

But, assuming that an attacker stole or otherwise obtained admin credentials, they &quot;could leak the contents of files on an affected system,&quot; Childs added.

The good news is that, as of now, Cisco and ZDI say they&#39;re not aware of any in-the-wild abuse of this CVE.

But considering the existence of a POC, which provides a blueprint on how to exploit the bug, we&#39;re guessing that CVE-2026-20029&#39;s exploitation status will soon change - so patch now.

It&#39;s unclear who published the POC, and Childs told us it wasn&#39;t ZDI. &quot;We have not published PoC for this bug and have no plans to do so,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re not aware where the public PoC was published.&quot;

Companies should prioritize implementing this fix as networking devices are long-time favorites among government-backed attackers - and especially those from China - which means companies shouldn&#39;t leave these holes open for long.

In November, Amazon warned that an &quot;advanced&quot; attacker had exploited a max-severity ISE bug (CVE-2025-20337) as a zero-day to deploy custom malware.

In July, researchers warned that miscreants had been exploiting another 10 out of 10 CVSS-rated ISE flaw (CVE-2025-20281), prompting Cisco to acknowledge in-the-wild activity and urge customers to patch.

The networking giant had originally disclosed CVE-2025-20281 in a June security advisory covering multiple max-severity flaws in the same ISE products, and later updated the bulletin as exploitation emerged. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today, it is hard to escape LLM bots and the endless slop they emit, but the Linux kernel might be largely safe … for now.

Linus Torvalds has spoken up on the contentious topic of LLM-assisted software development. Despite his previous guardedly positive stance, for now, he seems to have come out strongly against it in the context he cares about the most – developing code for the Linux kernel. But he also doesn&#39;t want the documentation to become a political battlefield over this point.

He was responding to a message from Oracle-affiliated kernel developer Lorenzo Stokes, which seems to us to be guardedly anti-LLM: &quot;Thinking LLMs are &#39;just another tool&#39; is to say effectively that the kernel is immune from this. Which seems to me a silly position.&quot;

There is zero point in talking about AI slop. That&#39;s just plain stupid.

Why? Because the AI slop people aren&#39;t going to document their patches as such. That&#39;s such an obvious truism that I don&#39;t understand why anybody even brings up AI slop.

The documentation is for good actors, and pretending anything else is pointless posturing.

As I said in private elsewhere, I do not want any kernel development documentation to be some AI statement. We have enough people on both sides of the &quot;sky is falling&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s going to revolutionize software engineering&quot;, I don&#39;t want some kernel development docs to take either stance.

It&#39;s why I strongly want this to be that &quot;just a tool&quot; statement.

And the AI slop issue is NOT going to be solved with documentation, and anybody who thinks it is either just naive, or wants to &quot;make a statement&quot;.

Neither of which is a good reason for documentation.

Rather than try to paraphrase the great man, we thought we&#39;d just give you his own words. However, we do also face the slight issue that it&#39;s not entirely clear to us what Torvalds&#39;s position here really is.

Stokes was replying to an email from Dave Hansen. As Linux benchmark and commentary site Phoronix reported in November, a team is working on a set of clear, unambiguous guidelines concerning LLM-bot-assisted contributions to the kernel.

It&#39;s a pressing issue. People are already using LLM coding assistants to work on kernel code: for instance, last year, Wikimedia developer Dmitry Brant blogged about Using Claude Code to modernize a 25-year-old kernel driver.

The Register has reported on Torvalds&#39;s various comments on LLM-bot-assisted coding several times in recent years. In 2024, he said that 90 percent of AI marketing is hype. (To be honest, the Reg FOSS desk thinks that&#39;s generous: we&#39;d be happy to learn it was as low as 90 per cent.) A year later, he commented that he was OK with vibe coding as long as it&#39;s not used for anything that matters, which was a little unexpected. The Reg&#39;s own Rupert Goodwins begged to differ, writing &quot;Vibe coding: What is it good for? Absolutely nothing (Sorry, Linus)&quot;.

For now, LLM coding assistants are so popular with so many that Torvalds is right: if the kernel flatly prohibits their use, then they&#39;ll get used anyway. They can and do emit code-like text, and lots of it, and currently they&#39;re cheap. Ban them, and they&#39;ll still be used – the users will just deny it.

Of course, they might not remain cheap. This vulture strongly suspects that another AI winter is coming. The first one was circa 1984, and the second about a decade later, with the end of the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project sponsored by Japan&#39;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). Now, all that is left of the FGCS is a web museum.

We suspect that the third and biggest AI winter is imminent. Some analysts think so too, while others feel that what&#39;s left behind will remain valuable. Right now, the &quot;generative AI&quot; industry is spending vast amounts to subsidize these models and their use, propping up the US economy in the hope of future trillion-dollar-scale profitability. If that doesn&#39;t happen and the industry collapses, the coding-assistant advocates may suddenly find that plain old human brainpower is much cheaper than hundreds of billions of dollars&#39; worth of datacentres.

Some large model prices are already increasing sharply. Put another few zeros on the end of the pricing and we suspect people may get much less keen on using them. This may yet prove to be a self-correcting issue, given a few years. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Datacenter building decisions tend to fall into two camps with colocation providers plumping for urban areas while hyperscalers seek sites where electricity, land, and construction costs come cheaper.

A study by the William Marsh Rice University in Texas, commonly referred to as Rice University, found that colocation facilities tend to be found in areas such as cities for proximity to their business customers, while hyperscale server farms follow a different tack.

Giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft prefer to concentrate massive facilities in a relatively small number of lower-density regions, where energy, land, and construction costs are lower, making economies of scale easier to achieve, the researchers say.

The study, by assistant professor of strategic management Tommy Pan Fang at Rice University and Shane Greenstein of Harvard Business School, offers a large-scale statistical analysis of datacenter location strategies across the US. The aim is to provide both policymakers and firms with a clearer understanding of how different types of facility get located in response to economic and strategic incentives.

Using county-level data, the researchers say they were able to model how population density, the mix of industries, and operating costs all help to predict where new datacenters are most likely to be sited.

Third-party providers, meaning colocation and hosting companies, locate in urban areas because that&#39;s where customers (financial, etc) are based, and they place a high value on low latency, secure storage, and compliance with regulatory standards.

But that doesn&#39;t mean that hyperscale campuses are likely to pop up in any old rural setting. As well as power and water, datacenters need network infrastructure that is sufficient to meet their requirements.

This is why areas such as Northern Virginia, the world&#39;s &quot;datacenter capital,&quot; have proven such a hotspot for server farms, and hyperscale facilities in particular. Here, between 10 to 15 percent of global hyperscale capacity is located, at least double that of anywhere else, having benefited from early network infrastructure investment that made it a draw for digital traffic, the researchers say.

But future datacenter expansion may follow a more hybrid pattern, according to the study&#39;s authors, with massive regional hubs complemented by strategic colocation facilities where latency becomes an issue.

Previous reports found that datacenters predominantly focused on AI workloads are less sensitive to latency, and may be located some distance from cities, so long as power is available.

Meanwhile, in Europe, the availability of land and high energy costs are the main factors, alongside long delays to get connected to the grid. High demand in the main Euro datacenter hubs is driving investment in emerging secondary markets, including Oslo and Madrid. ®

            <div id="article-text">NASA has postponed today&#39;s spacewalk outside the International Space Station (ISS) due to an undisclosed &quot;medical concern&quot; with a crew member.

The US space agency has shared few details, other than the fact that the issue arose yesterday and resulted in today&#39;s spacewalk being delayed. The single crew member involved is in stable condition, according to a NASA spokesperson.

The spokesperson added: &quot;Safely conducting our missions is our highest priority, and we are actively evaluating all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew-11&#39;s mission. These are the situations NASA and our partners train for and prepare to execute safely.&quot;

The SpaceX Crew-11 mission is the 11th SpaceX operational mission, and the crew consists of NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, JAXA astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.

While there is no definitive end date for the Crew-11 mission, the SpaceX Crew-12 mission is due to launch no earlier than February 15, 2026.

Fincke, a Space Shuttle veteran, was initially set to fly on Boeing&#39;s CST-100 Starliner Crew Flight Test before being made the pilot of the first operational mission of the Calamity Capsule. He was then moved to the SpaceX Crew-11 mission, along with Yui. Cardman was to have been the commander of the SpaceX Crew-9 mission before being removed (along with fellow astronaut Stephanie Wilson) to make room for the returning Starliner astronauts, Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams.

Station commander Fincke and flight engineer Cardman were set to venture outside the orbiting laboratory for a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk to route cables for a future solar array, install jumper cables, snap photos of hardware, and collect microorganism samples.

Shortly before NASA&#39;s announcement, Cardman shared an image of Yui reflected in the visor of a helmet. Yui and NASA astronaut Chris Williams were to run the suit-up operations for today&#39;s postponed spacewalk.

While Yui, Williams, Cardman, and Fincke were preparing for the spacewalk, Roscosmos flight engineers Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Oleg Platonov were investigating the use of AI to transcribe audio files documenting crew activities, and Sergei Mikaev worked on uninstalling a camera that photographed landmarks during the crew&#39;s sleep shift.

Williams and Yui later worked on physics and microbiology research.

While the nature of the medical concern is private, NASA is expected to share a new date for the upcoming spacewalk in the near future. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/08/ransomware_2025_emsisoft/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If 2025 was meant to be the year ransomware started dying, nobody appears to have told the attackers.

In its 2025 State of Ransomware in the US report, security firm Emsisoft says ransomware attacks continued to climb last year, with more victims appearing on extortion sites and more groups operating than ever before. The figures climbed even as police and prosecutors notched up a string of wins against ransomware groups, such as the global takedown of BlackSuit in August.

Trackers keeping an eye on ransomware leak sites logged more than 8,000 claimed victims worldwide in 2025, a rise of more than 50 percent compared to 2023. The counts come from outfits watching dark web shaming pages such as Ransomware.live and RansomLook.io, so they only include cases where crooks decided to post receipts. Plenty of victims, Emsisoft says, will have paid up, recovered, or kept quiet without ever appearing on a leak site.

Emsisoft&#39;s numbers also suggest there are more gangs in the game than there were a couple of years ago, with the count of active ransomware crews climbing from a few dozen in 2023 to well into three figures by the end of 2025. Instead of a handful of mega-brands dominating, the scene now looks messier, with lots of smaller outfits popping up, disappearing, and reappearing under new names as affiliates drift between operations.

That could explain why all the splashy takedowns haven&#39;t translated into fewer ransomware attacks. While pulling the plug on a gang&#39;s infrastructure might kill one brand, it rarely kills the people behind it, who tend to resurface quickly under a new name or latch onto the next crew looking for experienced hands.

Even so, the same handful of ransomware brands kept turning up again and again on leak sites last year, with names like Qilin, Akira, Cl0p, and Play racking up large victim counts. Emsisoft warns against treating those tallies like a proper leaderboard, though, since some gangs are far louder than others when it comes to naming and shaming victims.

The report also points to a change in how many ransomware break-ins actually start. Bugs and exposed services still play a role, but gangs are leaning harder on old-fashioned tricks such as phishing, stolen logins, and social engineering to get a foot in the door, with crews that include Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters favoring approaches that go straight around perimeter defenses rather than through them.

Emsisoft threat intelligence analyst Luke Connolly says the churn, along with this change in tactics, is what keeps ransomware ticking over: affiliates move on, names disappear, and the same attacks keep happening under different banners.

&quot;As long as affiliates remain plentiful and social engineering remains effective, victim counts are likely to continue rising,&quot; he said. ®

The new year has brought a wave of deals on wireless earbuds and headphones, from the fitness-focused Beats Powerbeats Fit to the open-ear Shokz OpenRun Pro. Now, Nothing has joined in with a sale of its own, offering the Nothing Headphone (1), CMF Headphone Pro, and Nothing Ear (3) earbuds at their lowest prices to date. The most notable deal, though, is on the Nothing Ear (a), which are currently available from Amazon and Nothing for $59 ($40 off) for the first time since Black Friday, matching their lowest price to date.

Nothing’s inexpensive wireless earbuds are among the more eye-catching you can buy, thanks to a bright yellow option and a super small, translucent charging case (they also come in black and white). That said, their appeal goes beyond looks, with a feature set that impressed us enough to make them our go-to pick for shoppers on a tight budget. They nail the basics, and their sound quality exceeds expectations for the price, delivering expressive, enjoyable audio that’s adjustable via Nothing’s companion app. You also get active noise cancellation to cut down on unwanted distractions, along with three sizes of silicone ear tips for a more comfortable, secure fit.

Battery life is good for the price, too, allowing you to eke out over eight hours of continuous playback on a single charge with ANC turned off (or 5.5 hours with it enabled), while an IP54 dust and water resistance rating means they can handle sweat and light rain. You also get support for multipoint Bluetooth pairing, allowing you to stay connected to two devices at once, and a low-latency gaming mode, which is unusual for a pair of earbuds under $100, let alone under $60. They even offer ChatGPT integration for Nothing phone owners thanks to a post-launch update, letting you query the LLM with a quick pinch.

Things are looking bright for those who want to nab a great TV in 2026 at a substantial discount. Even though the year’s biggest, brightest, and priciest TVs were announced at CES 2026, there’s usually a great deal happening on a mid- or high-end TV from LG, Sony, Hisense, or Samsung. With the Super Bowl coming up, you’re right to start hunting for deals now on TVs, as well as for speaker systems.

Right now, there are a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, sizes, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary screen for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built to provide the ultimate gaming or cinematic experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals.

Samsung’s Q8F is available for around $697.99 ($52 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo in its 55-inch configuration, which is a decent value for a QLED 4K TV. Its quantum dot LED panel boasts great contrast (especially in HDR content). The Q8F has a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.0 ports. This means you can play in 4K at up to 60Hz with a Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series S/X, or a PlayStation 5 Pro, or at a faster 120Hz refresh rate bumped down to 1440p resolution. Samsung is also including two free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with purchase, which will allow you to stream games directly to your TV through the cloud, eliminating the need for a console.

The TV is powered by Samsung’s Q4 AI processor, which is used to upscale HD video to 4K when necessary, to optimize the picture in real-time, and make navigating its interface feel snappy. Samsung also touts the Q8F’s audio system, which adjusts the EQ and boost dialogue volume when needed. If you’ve cut the cord with cable, you can watch over 2,700 free channels of TV (over 400 of which are exclusive to Samsung TVs) in addition to streaming services. You can save $302 by jumping up to the 85-inch model, which is on sale for around $1,697.99 or so at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.

If you’re looking for a 65-inch TV for watching sports, TV shows, movies, or playing video games, Hisense’s U65QF is a great choice, one you can currently purchase at Amazon and Best Buy for $699.99 ($147 off). The TV features a native 144Hz refresh rate and two HDMI 2.1 ports, both of which can take full advantage of the high-speed display. It also sports a pair of HDMI 2.0 ports — which can carry a 4K signal at up to 60Hz — and a port assortment that makes it a good choice for current-gen consoles, 4K Blu-ray players, and streaming devices. If you connect a gaming PC with an AMD graphics card, you can even take advantage of the TV’s support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, which reduces graphical glitches such as screen tearing.

The U65QF has an LED screen, which means it can’t match the black levels or per-pixel brightness control you’d get with an OLED display. However, its full array lighting panel offers 300 local dimming zones. The TV can control the brightness of each zone to reduce blooming, which is what happens when the area around a bright object (think a lit torch in a cave) looks unnaturally bright. Additionally, the TV has a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, so the image it produces should look good even in a room with some light interference. The U65QF also supports Dolby Vision, HLG, and HDR10 Plus for better color reproduction, and it features a Hi-View AI chip that automatically processes the image on screen so that it appears sharper.

As for its operating system, Hisense’s U65QF runs on Amazon’s Fire OS and features Amazon Alexa built in. You can use the smart assistant to control the TV’s many functions, search for content, control compatible smart home accessories, and look up answers to various questions with your voice. If you want an even larger screen, you can also pick up a 75-inch model for around $895.99 (originally $1,299) at Amazon and Best Buy.

TCL’s Nxtvision is an entry-level “art TV,” and both the 65- and 75-inch models are currently on sale at Best Buy for $999.99 ($300 off) and $1,699.99 ($100 off), respectively. The 4K TV set has a matte 120Hz QLED screen with a brightness of around 441 nits, and it can display more than 100,000 pre-generated AI artworks, your own photos, or one of over 300 pieces of art from its built-in library. It features two HDMI 2.1 ports best suited for current-gen game consoles and PC gaming, along with HDMI 2.0 ports, which are fine if you want to hook up a 4K Blu-ray player or previous-gen game system.

Verge senior reviewer John Higgins tested the A300W and liked the way the TV looked once its included bezel set was installed, which made the TV look more like an actual painting. He also liked that it uses Google’s TV platform, an operating system he found easy to navigate and use. However, it was noticeably dimmer than the other art TVs he tested, and the artwork quality could vary from piece to piece. Still, the A300W is a great choice if you’ve been curious about getting an art TV but don’t want to immediately make the jump to a higher-end model like Samsung’s Frame Pro.

If your budget is under $500, the 55-inch Hisense QD7 has a lot to offer, especially now that it’s on sale for $399.99 ($100 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. It features a QLED panel that can deliver more contrast and brightness than a typical LED TV, with support for HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision, with a peak brightness of 600 nits. The 4K set features a processor capable of AI upscaling and full array local dimming with 160 local dimming zones. A panel with full array local dimming offers better control of brightness and contrast than direct- or edge-lit LED panels (this video from LG shows how it works), providing a more consistent picture across the entire screen. The QD7’s obvious weak point is gaming, due to its 60Hz refresh rate, but if that’s not important to you, it remains a superb value. If you want a larger TV, you can get a 65-inch model for around $448 ($152 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.

If you want a TV that produces reference-quality images, Sony’s Bravia 8 II (K65XR80M2) is the best choice. It was selected as the top TV in Valve Electronics’ 10th annual TV Shootout based on objective and subjective tests conducted by a panel of experts comparing each set to the image on a $43,000 reference monitor (Disclosure: Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel was one of the judges). The 65-inch model is currently available with a $500 price cut, dropping it to around $2,998 at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.

Sony’s premium set has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, with two HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 120Hz and two HDMI 2.0 ports that top out at 4K / 60Hz. It doesn’t support Nvidia’s G-Sync or AMD’s FreeSync Pro, so there aren’t any specific features on this TV that PC gamers can take advantage of. The TV runs on Sony’s XR processor, which uses AI to adjust the color, contrast, and clarity of whatever you’re watching in real time to look better. Sony also says its TV has modes that are specifically calibrated for Netflix, Prime Video, and its own Sony Pictures Core streaming services.

The last-gen LG C4 remains one of the best OLED TVs you can buy, and the 65-inch model is currently on sale for $1,299.95 ($1,200 off) at B&H Photo. Like LG’s newer C5 OLED, it has a 120Hz panel with support for VRR, Nvidia G-Sync, and AMD FreeSync Premium (the option exists to enable a 144Hz mode if you dig in the TV’s options). Its embedded A9 AI Processor Gen7 offers higher-quality video upscaling and image optimization compared to the C3. The biggest difference between the C4 and C5 is their maximum brightness. The C4 tops out at an advertised 1,000 nits, while the C5 tops out at around 1,165 according to tests conducted by Tom’s Guide.

Additionally, the C4 features a three-channel audio system, which might sound impressive compared to other TVs, but still can’t compete with a soundbar. When you’re not watching videos or playing games, you can also enable the C4’s Gallery Mode to display art. Basically, the LG C4 offers many of the same features as the C5, but retails for nearly $400 less. You can also save on the 77-inch model, which is on sale for $1,799.95 ($1,700 off) at B&H Photo.

If you want an OLED, but don’t have a lot of space, Samsung’s 42-inch S90F is down to a new low of around $1.097.99 ($100 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. The TV features a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.1 ports, letting you play games in 4K at up to 120 frames per second. The ability to connect all your current-gen consoles and a gaming PC simultaneously without sacrificing resolution or speed is impressive for an OLED TV under $1,000. The TV can also access Samsung’s Gaming Hub, which allows you to play games available through Nvidia GeForce Go, Amazon Luna, and other cloud gaming services on your TV without any additional hardware — besides a controller, of course.

The S90F supports Samsung’s OLED HDR, and it has an NQ4 AI Gen3 processor that optimizes its picture quality and can upscale non-4K video. The TV also runs on Samsung’s Tizen operating system, which offers apps for every major streaming service, and features support for both Alexa and Samsung Bixby, so you can use either virtual assistant to control your various smart home gadgets. If you like the S90F’s features but want a larger TV, the 65-inch model is also on sale for an all-time low of around $1,597.99 ($102 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.

If you want a premium TV but don’t want an OLED set, Hisense’s U8QG is an excellent alternative that’s currently available at Amazon and Best Buy in its 65-inch configuration for $1,299.99 (about $200 off its regular 2025 price, but higher than it has recently sold for). The TV has a mini-LED panel with full-array local dimming, so blooming shouldn’t be a huge issue. It also features a 165Hz refresh rate and three HDMI 2.1 ports, making it a great choice for those with a gaming PC or a current-gen console like the PlayStation 5. It also supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, so gaming PCs outfitted with an AMD card should experience fewer graphical glitches, including screen tearing.

Hisense says the U8QG has a maximum screen brightness of 5,000 nits, which is substantially higher than the OLED TVs we’re recommending here. It also supports all your major HDR formats, including Dolby Vision IQ, HDR10 Plus, HLG, and Advanced HDR by Technicolor, so it’ll show vibrant colors regardless of how the video you’re watching — or game you’re playing — was mastered. Its AI processor was also designed to improve the clarity and brightness of SDR content, and the TV’s high refresh rate and peak brightness make up for the fact that its panel offers lower contrast than an OLED TV.

According to The Verge’s own John Higgins, Samsung’s Frame Pro is the best “art TV” you can buy for watching TV shows, and the 65-inch model is a couple hundred dollars off, selling for around $1,897.99 at Amazon and Best Buy. Both Amazon and Best Buy have also knocked the price of the larger 75-inch model to around $2,497.99 ($1000 off its original price).

Samsung’s art-inspired 4K TV features a 120Hz LED panel with a peak brightness of over 1,000 nits and better color accuracy (especially in filmmaker mode) than its competitors. Its matte screen reflects less light than a typical LCD or OLED screen, which is helpful whether you’re watching TV shows in a bright room or using the TV’s “Art Mode,” which allows you to display famous paintings. The TV comes with a small selection of free art, but you can gain access to more than 4,000 pieces by subscribing to the Samsung Art Store for $50 a year.

The Frame Pro also comes with the wireless Connect Box, which features four HDMI ports, two USB-A ports, a coaxial input, an ethernet port, and an optical audio input. You plug devices into the wireless Connect Box, which then sends audio and video from your source to the TV. Samsung recommends keeping it within 10 meters of the TV, but the wireless latency (lag) from the setup shouldn’t matter much when watching videos; however, it may be noticeable if you’re playing fast-paced video games, including first-person shooters.

            <div id="article-text">AI is everywhere, but it really shouldn’t be.

AI is everywhere, but it really shouldn’t be.

You can’t shake a stick without hitting an AI gadget at CES this year, with artificial smarts now embedded in just about every wearable, screen, and appliance across the show floor, not to mention the armies of AI companions, toys, and robots.

But those are just the beginning. We’ve seen AI pop up in much stranger places too, from hair clippers to stick vacs, and at least one case where even the manufacturer itself seemed unsure what made its products “AI.”

Here are the gadgets we’ve seen at CES 2026 so far that really take the “intelligence” out of “artificial intelligence.”

This is a product that would be silly enough without the AI add-on. These smart hair clippers help amateur hairdressers deliver the perfect fade by dynamically altering the closeness of the cut, helped along by an ominous face mask that looks like it belongs in an optician’s office.

But it’s taken to the next level by the real-time AI coach, which gives you feedback as you cut. Glyde told me it’s working on voice controls for the AI too, and that eventually it will be able to recommend specific hairstyles, so long as you’re willing to trust its style advice. Are you?

That was the message emblazoned across the SleepQ booth, where company reps were handing out boxes of pills — a multivitamin with ashwagandha extract according to the box, supposedly good for sleep, though I wasn’t brave enough to test that claim on my jetlag.

Manufacturer Welt, originally spun out of a Samsung incubator, calls its product “AI-upgraded pharmacotherapy.” It’s really just using biometric data from your smartwatch or sleep tracker to tell you the optimal time to take a sleeping pill each day, with plans to eventually cover anxiety meds, weight-management drugs, pain relief, and more.

There may well be an argument that fine-tuning the time people pop their pills could make them more effective, but I feel safe in saying we don’t need to start throwing around the term “AI-enhanced drugs.”

Startup Deglace claims that its almost unnecessarily sleek-looking Fraction vacuum cleaner uses AI in two different ways: first to “optimize suction,” and then to manage repairs and replacements for the modular design.

It says its Neural Predictive AI monitors vacuum performance “to detect issues before they happen,” giving you health scores for each of the vacuum’s components, which can be conveniently replaced with a quick parts order from within the accompanying app. A cynic might worry this is all in the name of selling users expensive and proprietary replacement parts, but I can at least get behind the promise of modular upgrades — assuming Deglace is able to deliver on that promise.

Most digital picture frames let you display photos of loved ones, old holiday snaps, or your favorite pieces of art. Fraimic lets you display AI slop.

It’s an E Ink picture frame with a microphone and voice controls, so you can describe whatever picture you’d like, which the frame will then generate using OpenAI’s GPT Image 1.5 model. The frame itself starts at $399, which gets you 100 image generations each year, with the option to buy more if you run out.

What makes the AI in Fraimic so dubious is that it might be a pretty great product without it. The E Ink panel looks great, you can use it to show off your own pictures and photos too, and it uses so little power that it can run for years without being plugged in. We’d just love it a lot more without the added slop.

Infinix, a smaller phone manufacturer that’s had success across Asia for its affordable phones, didn’t launch any actual new products at CES this year, but it did bring five concepts that could fit into future phones. Some are clever, like various color-changing rear finishes and a couple of liquid-cooling designs. And then there’s the AI ModuVerse.

Modular phone concepts are nothing new, so the AI hook is what makes ModuVerse unique — in theory. One of the “Modus” makes sense: a meeting attachment that connects magnetically, generating AI transcripts and live translation onto a mini display on the back.

But when I asked what made everything else AI, Infinix didn’t really have any good answers. The gimbal camera has AI stabilization, the vlogging lens uses AI to detect faces, and the microphone has AI voice isolation — all technically AI-based, but not in any way that’s interesting. As for the magnetic, stackable power banks, Infinix’s reps eventually admitted they don’t really have any AI at all. Color me shocked.

There’s a growing trend for AI and robotic cooking hardware — The Verge’s Jen Tuohy reviewed a $1,500 robot chef just last month — but Wan AIChef is something altogether less impressive: an AI-enabled microwave.

It runs on what looks suspiciously like Android, with recipe suggestions, cooking instructions, and a camera inside so you can see the progress of what you’re making. But… it’s just a microwave. So it can’t actually do any cooking for you, other than warm up your food to just the right temperature (well, just right plus or minus 3 degrees Celsius, to be accurate).

It’ll do meal plans and food tracking and calorie counting too, which all sounds great so long as you’re willing to commit to eating all of your meals out of the AI microwave. Please, I beg you, do not eat all of your meals out of the AI microwave.

The tech industry absolutely loves reinventing the vending machine and branding it either robotics or AI, and AI Barmen is no different.

This setup — apparently already in use for private parties and corporate events — is really just an automatic cocktail machine with a few AI smarts slapped on top.

The AI uses the connected webcam to estimate your age — it was off by eight years in my case — and confirm you’re sober enough to get another drink. It can also create custom drinks, with mixed success: When asked for something to “fuck me up,” it came up with the Funky Tequila Fizz, aka tequila, triple sec, and soda. What, no absinthe?

Should you buy your kid an AI toy that gives it a complete LLM-powered chatbot to speak to? Probably not. But what if that AI chatbot looked like chibi Elon Musk?

He’s just one of the many avatars offered by the Luka AI Cube, including Hayao Miyazaki, Steve from Minecraft, and Harry Potter. Kids can chat to them about their day, ask for advice, or even share the AI Cube’s camera feed to show the AI avatars where they are and what they’re up to. Luka says it’s a tool for fun, but also learning, with various educational activities and language options.

The elephant in the room is whether you should trust any company’s guardrails enough to give a young kid access to an LLM. Leading with an AI take on Elon Musk — whose own AI, Grok, is busy undressing children as we speak — doesn’t exactly inspire confidence.

            <h2>The MAGA-approved video of an ICE killing</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-08</strong></p>

            <div id="article-text">﻿After a federal agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis, the Trump administration found its preferred angle of the incident.

﻿After a federal agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis, the Trump administration found its preferred angle of the incident.

The clips are filmed from different angles. Some are zoomed in, making them indecipherably grainy, and others are slowed down. Some are 20 seconds while others are longer, sandwiched by commentary from users on social media platforms like X, Bluesky, Reddit, and TikTok. Each video — depicting the moment an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shoots and kills a woman in Minneapolis — is ever so slightly different, but the gunshots ringing out and the wailing bystanders are the same.

The shooting occurred just days after federal officials said they were sending thousands of immigration agents to Minnesota, following a viral YouTube video alleging fraud in social services. (The video provided little evidence of its claims.) Even before it was clear what had happened in the shooting, federal officials had readied their version of events. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said it was “an act of domestic terrorism” on the part of the woman who was shot. Noem claimed that ICE agents were trying to push their vehicle out of the snow when the woman “attacked them” and “attempted to run them over” with her car. On Truth Social, Donald Trump claimed, without evidence, that a woman who was screaming in the clip was a “professional agitator” and that the deceased driver, later identified as 37-year-old Renee Good, “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.”

The video attached to the Truth Social post is a grainy 13-second-long clip that is slowed down. It appears to be captured from above ground — possibly from a balcony or upstairs window — and a large tree blocks most of the frame. The footage is filmed facing the passenger side of Good’s car, and an ICE agent is near the driver’s-side headlight. As Good’s car pulls away and shots are fired, the ICE agent moves with the car, but it’s not clear whether he is hit by the vehicle or if he is reacting to it moving.

There is no shortage of footage and photos from the scene of the killing, but the specific video shared by Trump has become the smoking gun for the far right. Megyn Kelly shared versions of the same clip at least a dozen times on X, and the Libs of TikTok account described it as “the video the Democrats don’t want you to see!” Even in the president’s own social media post, the clip has the watermark of a local TV station. The clip is low quality compared to other videos from the incident to begin with, but as it is reshared, screen recorded, edited, slowed down, cropped, and zoomed in, it begins to take on a deep-fried quality — but no matter. In an era of hyper-partisan media that bleeds into propaganda, where X users earnestly tag the nonconsensual deepfake porn generator to ask if a claim is true, MAGA needs some piece of evidence to point to as incontrovertible proof. They found it in a short video with an obstructed view of the killing.

Many clips of the moments leading up to Good’s killing refute what the Trump administration claims happened. One video from a witness filmed from a different angle shows two other agents approach Good’s car, one of them yanking on her driver’s side door handle and barking at her to get out of the vehicle. (A neighbor who recorded the incident said agents told Good to leave.) Good puts the car in reverse and begins to turn away from the ICE agent near the front of the vehicle; a New York Times analysis of footage shows that the agent wasn’t in the path of the car when he fired three shots into Good’s vehicle. (In slowed-down clips, the agent appears to be filming Good on a phone before he pulls his weapon.) As the shots are fired, her car accelerates down the street before ramming into parked cars. The agent who shot Good slowly walks toward her crashed car and drives away from the scene shortly after.

We have been worrying about what an AI-in-everything world might do to our shared sense of reality — that the wide availability of generative tools would create an era of post-truth as deceptions take hold. To be sure, AI has played a part in the aftermath of Good’s killing, especially on X, where some users attempted to use Grok to “unmask” the ICE agent that shot and killed her. (In videos, the agent is wearing a neck gaiter pulled up above his nose, concealing half his face.) These fake AI re-creations of the shooter — along with an unconfirmed name that somehow caught on — have popped up on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and other platforms. But by so confidently claiming that one blurry clip shows evidence of domestic terrorism, the Trump administration is asking the public to disbelieve their own eyes, despite mounting contradictory evidence. Who needs AI manipulations when your preferred angle will do the job well enough?

Five years ago, a mile from where Good was shot, the public bore witness to another video clip that circulated around the world: police officer Derek Chauvin’s knee on the neck of George Floyd. The footage of Floyd’s murder was captured by 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, and the video triggered the largest protest movement in US history. Chauvin was convicted of Floyd’s murder in 2021, but still there was hand-wringing about the crime — whether Floyd was an innocent enough victim, whether the resulting racial reckoning across American society was warranted, whether the response to his death was dignified enough.

In a surreal image captured by the Times during an hourslong conversation with Trump this week, an aide holds up a laptop with the MAGA-approved grainy video of Good’s shooting. When pressed about the administration’s claims, Trump deflects. His base will see what they want to.

The Lazuli Space Observatory from Schmidt Sciences will be larger than Hubble.

Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife, Wendy, could help make history with a new project unveiled on Wednesday, the Lazuli Space Observatory. As reported by Science, the telescope was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society this week and could be the largest privately funded space telescope in history thanks to investments from the Schmidts.

Lazuli’s design features a 3.1-meter mirror, which would make it larger than NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope (but smaller than the James Webb Space Telescope). It will also be equipped with a wide-field camera, a broadband integral-field spectrograph, and a coronagraph. Those instruments will be used to study everything from exoplanets to supernovae, but Schmidt Sciences also envisions Lazuli being used for “rapid response” purposes, such as quickly swiveling to gather data on objects spotted by other telescopes.

Lazuli is part of the Schmidt Observatory System, which also includes three ground-based observatories: the Argus Array, Deep Synoptic Array (DSA), and Large Fiber Array Spectroscopic Telescope (LFAST). According to Schmidt Sciences, the system of telescopes “is grounded in a commitment to open science: data and software will be broadly shared by default.” Scientists from all over the world, at any career level, will be able to utilize the telescopes and access the data collected with them. All four, including Lazuli, could be operational before the end of the decade.

A new Copilot Checkout feature allows you to make purchases without leaving your chat.

Microsoft is launching a new feature in Copilot that will allow you to make purchases during conversations with the AI chatbot. Now, when you’re asking for suggestions about what kind of sneakers you should buy, Copilot can surface a checkout option for the product you choose directly inside the app.

An example shared by Microsoft shows someone using Copilot to search for a small lamp for their bedside table. The chatbot responds with a recommendation, along with a “Details” button for more information and a “Buy” option. Hitting the “Buy” button pulls up a checkout screen where you can enter shipping and payment information and confirm your purchase without visiting the retailer’s website.

It’s similar to the built-in checkout feature OpenAI has launched within ChatGPT and comes as part of a growing trend that has AI-powered agents shopping on a customer’s behalf. Google has launched agentic checkout in Search and AI Mode, while Perplexity’s AI-powered browser and chatbot can help users buy products, too, which Amazon isn’t very happy about.

Microsoft is rolling out in-chat checkouts on Copilot.com in the US, and it’s currently available with select retailers, including Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, Ashley Furniture, and some Etsy sellers. PayPal, Stripe, and Shopify are working with Microsoft to power payments.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1130905/americas-diet-guidelines-ignore-scientific-research-red-meat-beef-tallow/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new year has barely begun, but the first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Monday, the US’s federal health agency upended its recommendations for routine childhood vaccinations—a move that health associations worry puts children at unnecessary risk of preventable disease.

There was more news from the federal government on Wednesday, when health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.

That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.

These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. So this week let’s look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.

The government dietary guidelines have been around since the 1980s. They are updated every five years, in a process that typically involves a team of nutrition scientists who have combed over scientific research for years. That team will first publish its findings in a scientific report, and, around a year later, the finalized Dietary Guidelines for Americans are published.

The last guidelines covered the period 2020 to 2025, and new guidelines were expected in the summer of 2025. Work had already been underway for years; the scientific report intended to inform them was published back in 2024. But the publication of the guidelines was delayed by last year’s government shutdown, Kennedy said last year. They were finally published yesterday.

Nutrition experts had been waiting with bated breath. Nutrition science has evolved slightly over the last five years, and some were expecting to see new recommendations. Research now suggests, for example, that there is no “safe” level of alcohol consumption.

We are also beginning to learn more about health risks associated with some ultraprocessed foods (although we still don’t have a good understanding of what they might be, or what even counts as “ultraprocessed”.) And some scientists were expecting to see the new guidelines factor in environmental sustainability, says Gabby Headrick, the associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security in Washington DC.

Many of the recommendations are sensible. The guidelines recommend a diet rich in whole foods, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. They recommend avoiding highly processed foods and added sugars. They also highlight the importance of dietary protein, whole grains, and “healthy” fats.

But not all of them are, says Headrick. The guidelines open with a “new pyramid” of foods. This inverted triangle is topped with “protein, dairy, and healthy fats” on one side and “vegetables and fruits” on the other.

There are a few problems with this image. For starters, its shape—nutrition scientists have long moved on from the food pyramids of the 1990s, says Headrick. They’re confusing and make it difficult for people to understand what the contents of their plate should look like. That’s why scientists now use an image of a plate to depict a healthy diet.

“We&#39;ve been using MyPlate to describe the dietary guidelines in a very consumer-friendly, nutrition-education-friendly way for over the last decade now,” says Headrick. (The UK’s National Health Service takes a similar approach.)

And then there’s the content of that food pyramid. It puts a significant focus on meat and whole-fat dairy produce. The top left image—the one most viewers will probably see first—is of a steak. Smack in the middle of the pyramid is a stick of butter. That’s new. And it’s not a good thing.

While both red meat and whole-fat dairy can certainly form part of a healthy diet, nutrition scientists have long been recommending that most people try to limit their consumption of these foods. Both can be high in saturated fat, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease—the leading cause of death in the US. In 2015, on the basis of limited evidence, the World Health Organization classified red meat as “probably carcinogenic to humans.”

Also concerning is the document’s definition of “healthy fats,” which includes butter and beef tallow (a MAHA favorite). Neither food is generally considered to be as healthy as olive oil, for example. While olive oil contains around two grams of saturated fat per tablespoon, a tablespoon of beef tallow has around six grams of saturated fat, and the same amount of butter contains around seven grams of saturated fat, says Headrick.

“I think these are pretty harmful dietary recommendations to be making when we have established that those specific foods likely do not have health-promoting benefits,” she adds.

Red meat is not exactly a sustainable food, and neither are dairy products. And the advice on alcohol is relatively vague, recommending that people “consume less alcohol for better overall health” (which might leave you wondering: Less than what?).

There are other questionable recommendations in the guidelines. Americans are advised to include more protein in their diets—at levels between 1.2 and 1.6 grams daily per kilo of body weight, 50% to 100% more than recommended in previous guidelines. There’s a risk that increasing protein consumption to such levels could raise a person’s intake of both calories and saturated fats to unhealthy levels, says José Ordovás, a senior nutrition scientist at Tufts University. “I would err on the low side,” he says.

Some nutrition scientists are questioning why these changes have been made. It’s not as though the new recommendations were in the 2024 scientific report. And the evidence on red meat and saturated fat hasn’t changed, says Headrick.

In reporting this piece, I contacted many contributors to the previous guidelines, and some who had led research for 2024’s scientific report. None of them agreed to comment on the new guidelines on the record. Some seemed disgruntled. One merely told me that the process by which the new guidelines had been created was “opaque.”

“These people invested a lot of their time, and they did a thorough job [over] a couple of years, identifying [relevant scientific studies],” says Ordovás. “I’m not surprised that when they see that [their] work was ignored and replaced with something [put together] quickly, that they feel a little bit disappointed,” he says.

Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos

At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses into the lining of the uterus then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear. This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three recent papers published by Cell Press, scientists report what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus. Read our story about their work, and what might come next.

LLMs contain a LOT of parameters. But what’s a parameter?

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

What new legal challenges mean for the future of US offshore wind

For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? Concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the US’s struggling offshore wind industry.

            <h2>Using unstructured data to fuel enterprise AI success</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1129506/using-unstructured-data-to-fuel-enterprise-ai-success/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enterprises are sitting on vast quantities of unstructured data, from call records and video footage to customer complaint histories and supply chain signals. Yet this invaluable business intelligence, estimated to make up as much as 90% of the data generated by organizations, historically remained dormant because its unstructured nature makes analysis extremely difficult.

But if managed and centralized effectively, this messy and often voluminous data is not only a precious asset for training and optimizing next-generation AI systems, enhancing their accuracy, context, and adaptability, it can also deliver profound insights that drive real business outcomes.

A compelling example of this can be seen in the US NBA basketball team the Charlotte Hornets who successfully leveraged untapped video footage of gameplay—previously too copious to watch and too unstructured to analyze—to identify a new competition-winning recruit. However, before that data could deliver results, analysts working for the team first had to overcome the critical challenge of preparing the raw, unstructured footage for interpretation.

Unstructured data presents inherent difficulties due to its widely varying format, quality, and reliability, requiring specialized tools like natural language processing and AI to make sense of it.

Every organization’s pool of unstructured data also contains domain-specific characteristics and terminology that generic AI models may not automatically understand. A financial services firm, for example, cannot simply use a general language model for fraud detection. Instead, it needs to adapt the model to understand regulatory language, transaction patterns, industry-specific risk indicators, and unique company context like data policies.

The challenge intensifies when integrating multiple data sources with varying structures and quality standards, as teams may struggle to distinguish valuable data from noise.

When the Charlotte Hornets set out to identify a new draft pick for their team, they turned to AI tools including computer vision to analyze raw game footage from smaller leagues, which exist outside the tiers of the game normally visible to NBA scouts and, therefore, are not as readily available for analysis.

“Computer vision is a tool that has existed for some time, but I think the applicability in this age of AI is increasing rapidly,” says Jordan Cealey, senior vice president at AI company Invisible Technologies, which worked with the Charlotte Hornets on this project. “You can now take data sources that you&#39;ve never been able to consume, and provide an analytical layer that&#39;s never existed before.”

By deploying a variety of computer vision techniques, including object and player tracking, movement pattern analysis, and geometrically mapping points on the court, the team was able to extract kinematic data, such as the coordinates of players during movement, and generate metrics like speed and explosiveness to acceleration.

This provided the team with rich, data-driven insights about individual players, helping them to identify and select a new draft whose skill and techniques filled a hole in the Charlotte Hornets’ own capabilities. The chosen athlete went on to be named the most valuable player at the 2025 NBA Summer League and helped the team win their first summer championship title.

Before data from game footage can be used, it needs to be labeled so the model can interpret it. The x and y coordinates of the individual players, seen here in bounding boxes, as well as other features in the scene, are annotated so the model can identify individuals and track their movements through time.

From this successful example, several lessons can be learned. First, unstructured data must be prepared for AI models through intuitive forms of collection, and the right data pipelines and management records. “You can only utilize unstructured data once your structured data is consumable and ready for AI,” says Cealey. “You cannot just throw AI at a problem without doing the prep work.”

For many organizations, this might mean they need to find partners that offer the technical support to fine-tune models to the context of the business. The traditional technology consulting approach, in which an external vendor leads a digital transformation plan over a lengthy timeframe, is not fit for purpose here as AI is moving too fast and solutions need to be configured to a company’s current business reality.

Forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) are an emerging partnership model better suited to the AI era. Initially popularized by Palantir, the FDE model connects product and engineering capabilities directly to the customer’s operational environment. FDEs work closely with customers on-site to understand the context behind a technology initiative before a solution is built.

“We couldn&#39;t do what we do without our FDEs,” says Cealey. “They go out and fine-tune the models, working with our human annotation team to generate a ground truth dataset that can be used to validate or improve the performance of the model in production.”

Second, data needs to be understood within its own context, which requires models to be carefully calibrated to the use case. “You can&#39;t assume that an out-of-the-box computer vision model is going to give you better inventory management, for example, by taking that open source model and applying it to whatever your unstructured data feeds are,” says Cealey. “You need to fine-tune it so it gives you the data exports in the format you want and helps your aims. That&#39;s where you start to see high-performative models that can then actually generate useful data insights.”

For the Hornets, Invisible used five foundation models, which the team fine-tuned to context-specific data. This included teaching the models to understand that they were “looking at” a basketball court as opposed to, say, a football field; to understand how a game of basketball works differently from any other sport the model might have knowledge of (including how many players are on each team); and to understand how to spot rules like “out of bounds.” Once fine-tuned, the models were able to capture subtle and complex visual scenarios, including highly accurate object detection, tracking, postures, and spatial mapping.

Lastly, while the AI technology mix available to companies changes by the day, they cannot eschew old-fashioned commercial metrics: clear goals. Without clarity on the business purpose, AI pilot programs can easily turn into open-ended, meandering research projects that prove expensive in terms of compute, data costs, and staffing.

“The best engagements we have seen are when people know what they want,” Cealey observes. “The worst is when people say ‘we want AI’ but have no direction. In these situations, they are on an endless pursuit without a map.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? National security, specifically concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the struggling offshore wind industry in the US.

This pause affects $25 billion in investment in five wind farms: Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off Virginia. Together, those projects had been expected to create 10,000 jobs and power more than 2.5 million homes and businesses.

In a statement announcing the move, the Department of the Interior said that “recently completed classified reports” revealed national security risks, and that the pause would give the government time to work through concerns with developers. The statement specifically says that turbines can create radar interference (more on the technical details here in a moment).

Three of the companies involved have already filed lawsuits, and they’re seeking preliminary injunctions that would allow construction to continue. Orsted and Equinor (the developers for Revolution Wind and Empire Wind, respectively) told the New York Times that their projects went through lengthy federal reviews, which did address concerns about national security.

This is just the latest salvo from the Trump administration against offshore wind. On Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order stopping all new lease approvals for offshore wind farms. (That order was struck down by a judge in December.)

The administration previously ordered Revolution Wind to stop work last year, also citing national security concerns. A federal judge lifted the stop-work order weeks later, after the developer showed that the financial stakes were high, and that government agencies had previously found no national security issues with the project.

There are real challenges that wind farms introduce for radar systems, which are used in everything from air traffic control to weather forecasting to national defense operations. A wind turbine’s spinning can create complex signatures on radar, resulting in so-called clutter.

Previous government reports, including one 2024 report from the Department of Energy and a 2025 report from the Government Accountability Office (an independent government watchdog), have pointed out this issue in the past.

“To date, no mitigation technology has been able to fully restore the technical performance of impacted radars,” as the DOE report puts it. However, there are techniques that can help, including software that acts to remove the signatures of wind turbines. (Think of this as similar to how noise-canceling headphones work, but more complicated, as one expert told TechCrunch.)

But the most widespread and helpful tactic, according to the DOE report, is collaboration between developers and the government. By working together to site and design wind farms strategically, the groups can ensure that the projects don’t interfere with government or military operations. The 2025 GAO report found that government officials, researchers, and offshore wind companies were collaborating effectively, and any concerns could be raised and addressed in the permitting process.

This and other challenges threaten an industry that could be a major boon for the grid. On the East Coast where these projects are located, and in New England specifically, winter can bring tight supplies of fossil fuels and spiking prices because of high demand. It just so happens that offshore winds blow strongest in the winter, so new projects, including the five wrapped up in this fight, could be a major help during the grid’s greatest time of need.

One 2025 study found that if 3.5 gigawatts’ worth of offshore wind had been operational during the 2024-2025 winter, it would have lowered energy prices by 11%. (That’s the combined capacity of Revolution Wind and Vineyard Wind, two of the paused projects, plus two future projects in the pipeline.) Ratepayers would have saved $400 million.

Before Donald Trump was elected, the energy consultancy BloombergNEF projected that the US would build 39 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. Today, that expectation has dropped to just 6 gigawatts. These legal battles could push it lower still.

What’s hardest to wrap my head around is that some of the projects being challenged are nearly finished. The developers of Revolution Wind have installed all the foundations and 58 of 65 turbines, and they say the project is over 87% complete. Empire Wind is over 60% done and is slated to deliver electricity to the grid next year.

To hit the pause button so close to the finish line is chilling, not just for current projects but for future offshore wind efforts in the US. Even if these legal battles clear up and more developers can technically enter the queue, why would they want to? Billions of dollars are at stake, and if there’s one word to describe the current state of the offshore wind industry in the US, it’s “unpredictable.”

            <h2>Deploying a hybrid approach to Web3 in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/07/1129490/deploying-a-hybrid-approach-to-web3-in-the-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the concept of “Web 3.0” first emerged about a decade ago the idea was clear: Create a more user-controlled internet that lets you do everything you can now, except without servers or intermediaries to manage the flow of information.

Where Web2, which emerged in the early 2000s, relies on centralized systems to store data and supply compute, all owned—and monetized by—a handful of global conglomerates, Web3 turns that structure on its head. Instead, data and compute are decentralized through technologies like blockchain and peer-to-peer networks.

What was once a futuristic concept is quickly becoming a more concrete reality, even at a time when Web2 still dominates. Six out of ten Fortune 500 companies are exploring blockchain-based solutions, most taking a hybrid approach that combines traditional Web2 business models and infrastructure with the decentralized technologies and principles of Web3.

Popular use cases include cloud services, supply chain management, and, most notably financial services. In fact, at one point, the daily volume of transactions processed on decentralized finance exchanges exceeded $10 billion.

Among the advantages of Web3 for the enterprise are greater ownership and control of sensitive data, says Erman Tjiputra, founder and CEO of the AIOZ Network, which is building infrastructure for Web3, powered by decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), blockchain-based systems that govern physical infrastructure assets.

More cost-effective compute is another benefit, as is enhanced security and privacy as the cyberattack landscape grows more hostile, he adds. And it could even help protect companies from outages caused by a single point of failure, which can lead to downtime, data loss, and revenue deficits.

But perhaps the most exciting opportunity, says Tjiputra, is the ability to build and scale AI reliably and affordably. By leveraging a people-powered internet infrastructure, companies can far more easily access—and contribute to—shared resource like bandwidth, storage, and processing power to run AI inference, train models, and store data. All while using familiar developer tooling and open, usage-based incentives.

“We’re in a compute crunch where requirements are insatiable, and Web3 creates this ability to benefit while contributing,” explains Tjiputra.

In 2025, AIOZ Network launched a distributed compute platform and marketplace where developers and enterprises can access and monetize AI assets, and run AI inference or training on AIOZ Network’s more than 300,000 contributing devices. The model allows companies to move away from opaque datasets and models and scale flexibly, without centralized lock in.

Despite the promise, it is still early days for Web3, and core systemic challenges are leaving senior leadership and developers hesitant about its applicability at scale.

One hurdle is a lack of interoperability. The current fragmentation of blockchain networks creates a segregated ecosystem that makes it challenging to transfer assets or data between platforms. This often complicates transactions and introduces new security risks due to the reliance on mechanisms such as cross-chain bridges. These are tools that allow asset transfers between platforms but which have been shown to be vulnerable to targeted attacks.

“We have countless blockchains running on different protocols and consensus models,” says Tjiputra. “These blockchains need to work with each other so applications can communicate regardless of which chain they are on. This makes interoperability fundamental.”

Regulatory uncertainty is also a challenge. Outdated legal frameworks can sit at odds with decentralized infrastructures, especially when it comes to compliance with data protection and anti-money laundering regulations.

“Enterprises care about verifiability and compliance as much as innovation, so we need frameworks where on-chain transparency strengthens accountability instead of adding friction,” Tjiputra says.

And this is compounded by user experience (UX) challenges, says Tjiputra. “The biggest setback in Web3 today is UX,” he says. “For example, in Web2, if I forget my bank username or password, I can still contact the bank, log in and access my assets. The trade-off in Web3 is that, should that key be compromised or lost, we lose access to those assets. So, key recovery is a real problem.”

Although such systemic challenges won’t be solved overnight, by leveraging DePIN networks, enterprises can bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, without making a wholesale switch. This can minimize risk while harnessing much of the potential.

AIOZ Network’s own ecosystem includes capacity for media streaming, AI compute, and distributed storage that can be plugged into an existing Web2 tech stack. “You don’t need to go full Web3,” says Tjiputra. “You can start by plugging distributed storage into your workflow, test it, measure it, and see the benefits firsthand.”

The AIOZ Storage solution, for example, offers scalable distributed object storage by leveraging the global network of contributor devices on AIOZ DePIN. It is also compatible with existing storage systems or commonly used web application programming interfaces (APIs).

“Say we have a programmer or developer who uses Amazon S3 Storage or REST APIs, then all they need to do is just repoint the endpoints,” explains Tjiputra. “That&#39;s it. It’s the same tools, it&#39;s really simple. Even with media, with a single one-stop shop, developers can do transcoding and streaming with a simple REST API.”

Built on Cosmos, a network of hundreds of different blockchains that can communicate with each other, and a standardized framework enabled by Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), AIOZ Network has also prioritized interoperability. “Applications shouldn’t care which chain they’re on. Developers should target APIs without worrying about consensus mechanisms. That’s why we built on Cosmos and EVM—interoperability first.”

This hybrid model, which allows enterprises to use both Web2 and Web3 advantages in tandem, underpins what Tjiputra sees as the longer-term ambition for the much-hyped next iteration of the internet.

“Our vision is a truly peer-to-peer foundation for a people-powered internet, one that minimizes single points of failure through multi-region, multi-operator design,” says Tjiputra. “By distributing compute and storage across contributors, we gain both cost efficiency and end-to-end security by default.

“Ideally, we want to evolve the internet toward a more people-powered model, but we’re not there yet. We’re still at the starting point and growing.”

Indeed, Web3 isn’t quite snapping at the heels of the world’s Web2 giants, but its commercial advantages in an era of AI have become much harder to ignore. And with DePIN bridging the gap, enterprises and developers can step into that potential while keeping one foot on surer ground.

Europe’s drone-filled vision for the future of war

Last spring, 3,000 British soldiers deployed an invisible automated intelligence network, known as a “digital targeting web,” as part of a NATO exercise called Hedgehog in the damp forests of Estonia’s eastern territories.The system had been cobbled together over the course of four months—an astonishing pace for weapons development, which is usually measured in years. Its purpose is to connect everything that looks for targets—“sensors,” in military lingo—and everything that fires on them (“shooters”) to a single, shared wireless electronic brain.Eighty years after total war last transformed the continent, the Hedgehog tests signal a brutal new calculus of European defense. But leaning too much on this new mathematics of warfare could be a risky bet. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: How one controversial startup hopes to cool the planet

Stardust Solutions believes that it can solve climate change—for a price.The Israel-based geoengineering startup has said it expects nations will soon pay it more than a billion dollars a year to launch specially equipped aircraft into the stratosphere. Once they’ve reached the necessary altitude, those planes will disperse particles engineered to reflect away enough sunlight to cool down the planet, purportedly without causing environmental side effects.

But numerous solar geoengineering researchers are skeptical that Stardust will line up the customers it needs to carry out a global deployment in the next decade. They’re also highly critical of the idea of a private company setting the global temperature for us.

Inside the decades-long fight over Yahoo’s misdeeds in ChinaWhen you think of Big Tech these days, Yahoo is probably not top of mind. But for Chinese dissident Xu Wanping, the company still looms large—and has for nearly two decades.In 2005, Xu was arrested for signing online petitions relating to anti-Japanese protests. He didn’t use his real name, but he did use his Yahoo email address. Yahoo China violated its users’ trust—providing information on certain email accounts to Chinese law enforcement, which in turn allowed the government to identify and arrest some users.Xu was one of them; he would serve nine years in prison. Now, he and five other Chinese former political prisoners are suing Yahoo and a slate of co-defendants—not because of the company’s information-sharing (which was the focus of an earlier lawsuit filed by other plaintiffs), but rather because of what came after.

            <h2>ChatGPT Health has arrived</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-08</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.
