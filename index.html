            <h2>Volvo invented the seat belt 67 years ago; now it has improved it</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/how-volvos-new-adaptive-seat-belts-will-reduce-injuries-during-a-crash/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">With the launch of its all-new, all-electric EX60, Volvo has put lessons learned from the EX30 and EX90 to use. The EX60 is built on Volvo’s new SPA3 platform, made only for battery-electric vehicles. It boasts up to 400 miles (643 km) of range, with fast-charging capabilities Volvo says add 173 miles (278 km) in 10 minutes. Mega casting reduces the number of parts of the rear floor from 100-plus to one piece crafted of aluminum alloy, reducing complexities and weld points.

Inside the cabin, however, the real achievement is Volvo’s new multi-adaptive safety belt. Volvo has a history with the modern three-point safety belt, which was perfected by in-house engineer Nils Bohlin in 1959 before the patent was shared with the world. Today at the Volvo Cars Safety Center lab, at least one brand-new Volvo is crashed every day in the name of science. The goal: to test not just how well its vehicles are protecting passengers but what the next frontier is in safety technology.

Senior Safety Technical Leader Mikael Ljung Aust is a driving behavior specialist with 20 years under his belt at Volvo. He says it’s easy to optimize testing toward one person or one test point and come up with a good result. However, both from the behavioral perspective and from physics, people are different. What’s not different, he points out, is how people drive.

“We’re shaped into a very similar automated behavior when we drive, so that makes the collision prevention side of things a bit easier,” Ljung Aust says. “But on the injury-prevention side of things is where the seat belt comes in, we’re working on the principle of equal safety for all. The idea is that independent of who you are in terms of size, shape, weight, all of these things, you should have exactly the same protection.”

Basically, a seat belt is made up of a retractor mechanism, buckle assembly, webbing material, and a pretensioner device. Of these parts, the pretensioner is the one tasked with tightening the seatbelt webbing in a collision. As such, it reduces the forward movement of the passenger before the airbag deploys at speeds of up to 200 mph (321 km/h). All of these parts remain the same for Volvo’s newest seat belt iteration. It’s the tiny brain attached to the assemblage that’s different.

Volvo’s new central computing system, HuginCore (named after a bird in Norse mythology), runs the EX60 with more than 250 trillion operations per second. It has been developed in-house, together with its partners Google, Nvidia, and Qualcomm.

“With the HuginCore system we can collect a lot of data and make decisions in the car instantly and combine that with the belt’s ability to choose different load levels,” says Åsa Haglund, head of the Volvo Cars Safety Center. “A box of possibilities opens up where you can detect what type of crash it is and who is in the car and choose a more optimal belt force.”

Load limiters control how much force the safety belt applies on the human body during a crash. Volvo’s new system pushes the load-limiting profiles from three to 11, marking a major increase in adjustability. It’s kind of like an audio system, Ljung Aust muses. A sound system with 10 discrete steps up the volume ladder offers varied profiles along the way, while one with only one or two steps addresses fewer preference levels.

Using data from exterior, interior, and crash sensors, the car reacts to a collision in milliseconds—less than the blink of an eye, Ljung Aust says. In the case of a crash, it’s critical to hold the hips into the car, he explains, but the upper body should fold forward in a frontal crash in a nice, smooth motion to meet the airbag. Otherwise, the body is exposed to the same force as the slowing car.

Tempering that motion means adjusting for the size of the passenger to avoid injury; for instance, if the sensors detect a larger occupant in a severe crash, it’s designed to reduce the risk of head injury by using a higher belt load setting. Conversely, a smaller passenger in a lesser fender bender gets a lower belt load setting to reduce the incidence of rib fractures. Haglund notes that while one might make assumptions about what body type is more vulnerable in a crash, it has more to do with the kind of crash itself.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to crash safety, but the multi-adaptive seat belt is a closer step toward individual protection. Ljung Aust likens the new seat belt system to an octopus; the “tentacles” are the sensors that feed information to the brain. From there, the processor collects the data that Volvo uses to make improvements over time. Over-the-air updates will send future improvements to the car’s HuginCore system.

The timing is where artificial intelligence plays a big part. For every crash, there is an optimal set of outcomes to trigger the belt force. The result needs to happen like that, he says with a snap of his fingers.

Modern safety belts use load limiters to control how much force the safety belt applies on the human body during a crash. But with the new safety belt’s expanded load-limiting profiles, it can optimize performance for each situation and individual. “What is changing is the level of sophistication in how we act on that information,” Ljung Aust says. “We can now be more nuanced with the forces we apply to keep you under the lowest pressure possible [in a crash].”

Not enough people know how a seat belt works, says Ljung Aust, and they should.

“If you find out how it works, you realize it’s pretty cool and it actually makes a difference,” he says. “And to the extent that you were not inclined to wear it before or not be happy about it, maybe that has a positive influence on your attitude. Having a seat belt is literally the best thing you can do.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Apple stops supporting older iPhones and iPads with the latest version of iOS or iPadOS, it usually isn’t the end of the line—Apple keeps releasing new security-only patches for those devices for another year or two, keeping them usable while their hardware is still reasonably capable.

Once those updates dry up, it’s rare for Apple to revisit those older operating systems, but the company does sometimes make exceptions. That was the case yesterday, when the company released a batch of updates for long-retired iOS and iPadOS versions that otherwise hadn’t seen a new patch in months or years. Those updates include iOS 12.5.8, available for devices as old as 2013’s iPhone 5S and 2014’s iPhone 6; iOS 15.8.6, available for devices like the iPhone 6S, iPhone 7, and iPad Air 2; and iOS 16.7.13, available for devices like the iPhone 8 and iPhone X.

Both iOS 15 and iOS 16 were last patched in mid-2025, but iOS 12’s last patch was released in January of 2023.

These updates don’t patch security flaws or add new features. According to Apple’s release notes for the iOS 12 and iOS 15 updates, all they do is update a security certificate to ensure that iMessage, FaceTime, and Apple account sign-in will continue working past January 2027, when the operating systems’ original certificate would have expired.

Apple’s iOS 18.7.4 update also changes out the certificate, though that update is less surprising, since iOS 18 is still being actively patched for the iPhone XS, iPhone XR, and other devices that can’t run iOS 26. Oddly, the iOS 16 update doesn’t mention the security certificate, and there’s no equivalent update for devices stuck on iOS 17.

Devices running old iOS versions like iOS 12, 15, and 16 are difficult if not impossible to use as general-purpose smartphones and tablets these days. Many of these devices have just 1 or 2GB of RAM, and their built-in Safari versions will be missing features and security patches needed to browse the modern Internet safely. Third-party apps also mostly stop supporting old iOS versions after a year or two.

But plenty of old iPhones and iPads find second or third lives as single-use appliances and simple messaging devices—up until just a couple of years ago, my own iPhone 5S served as a kid’s white noise machine on overnight trips. I wouldn’t call these 12- and 13-year-old phones and tablets “actively supported,” but it’s nice to see Apple commit to keeping them minimally functional over such an extended period.</div>

            <h2>Trade wars muzzle allied talks on Trump's Golden Dome missile shield</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/trade-wars-muzzle-allied-talks-on-trumps-golden-dome-missile-shield/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Gen. Michael Guetlein, the senior officer in charge of the US military’s planned Golden Dome missile defense shield, has laid out an audacious schedule for deploying a network of space-based sensors and interceptors by the end of President Donald Trump’s term in the White House.

The three-year timeline is aggressive, with little margin for error in the event of budget or technological setbacks. The shield is designed to defend the US homeland against a range of long-range weapons, including Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), cruise missiles, and newer threats like hypersonic weapons and drones.

“By the summer of ’28, we will be able to defend the entire nation against ballistic missiles, as well as other generation aerial threats, and we will continue to grow that architecture through 2035,” Guetlein said Friday in a presentation to representatives from the US defense industry.

Supporters of Golden Dome say it is necessary to defend the United States against emerging threats from potential adversaries like Russia and China, each of which have vast arsenals of ballistic missiles and more maneuverable hypersonic missiles that are difficult to detect, and even harder to track and shoot down. Critics cite Golden Dome’s high cost and its potential to disrupt the global order, an eventuality they say would make the US homeland more prone to attack.

Guetlein’s team is moving fast in many areas. The Pentagon has inked deals with companies to develop prototypes for space-based missile interceptors, and Golden Dome is underpinned by billions of dollars of preexisting investment in sensor technology, reusable launchers, and mass-produced satellites.

These investments give Golden Dome a head start that former President Ronald Reagan’s similarly scoped Strategic Defense Initiative lacked in the 1980s. The initiative, nicknamed “Star Wars,” was drastically downsized as the Cold War wound down and the government struggled with ballooning costs and technical roadblocks.

But progress in at least one important area has stalled on the Golden Dome program. The Pentagon will need cooperation, if not tangible contributions, from allies to create the best possible version of the missile defense shield. Fundamentally, it comes down to geography. Places like the Canadian Arctic and Greenland are well positioned to detect incoming missiles coming over the horizon from Russia or China. They might also be useful for hosting next-gen ground-based interceptors, which today are based in Alaska and California.

Guetlein said his interactions with allies have been limited. It’s the consequence of another of the Trump administration’s core policies: tariffs.

“International partners, I have not been allowed to talk to yet because of the trade wars,” Guetlein said. “The administration wants to get all that laying flat before I start having conversations with our allied partners. But everything we are doing is allied by design.”

Without detailed discussions with allies, the Pentagon’s Golden Dome appears to be one-sided.

“We are already planning on how to integrate our allied partners into our architecture,” Guetlein said. [We’re] already understanding what they can bring to the fight, whether that be capability, whether that be through FMS (foreign military sales), or whether that be territory that we need to access to put sensors, or what have you.”

Canada and Denmark, which counts Greenland as an autonomous territory, are longtime allies of the United States. Both nations are members of NATO, and Canada is part of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), an organization whose mission is already aligned with that of the Golden Dome. However, the Trump administration has targeted both nations for high tariffs, apparently in a bid to achieve the White House’s trade and security objectives.

Trump’s obsession with acquiring Greenland, where the Space Force already has a military base, soured US relations with Denmark over the last year. The White House threatened additional tariffs on Denmark and other European countries until Denmark agreed to sell Greenland to the United States.

Then, after strong European pushback, Trump suddenly reversed course last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He withdrew threats to take Greenland by force and announced an unspecified “framework” with NATO for a future deal regarding the island. Trump told CNBC the framework involved partnerships on missile defense and mining: “They’re going to be involved in the Golden Dome, and they’re going to be involved in mineral rights, and so are we.”

In a statement, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen responded to Trump signaling an openness to a “constructive dialogue” on Arctic security, including the Golden Dome, “provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity.”

The White House’s backpedaling may have lowered the temperature of US relations with Denmark, at least for now. But Canada is still in Trump’s crosshairs. In a social media post Friday, Trump claimed Canada was “against” plans to include Greenland in the Golden Dome program. Kirsten Hillman, Canada’s ambassador to the United States, told CBS News she didn’t know what Trump was talking about.

The back-and-forth followed Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s rebuke of Trump’s foreign policy during a speech at Davos last week. In another sign of the withering US-Canada partnership, Trump threatened in a social media post Saturday to impose a 100 percent tariff on Canada if it follows through on a trade deal with China.

Canadian officials last year disclosed they were in talks to participate in the Golden Dome. In an interview with The War Zone published earlier this month, the operational commander of NORAD’s Canadian region advocated for “integrated missile defense” and “ground-based effectors” but said Canada’s role in a space-based layer would be a “political decision.”

“We look at it as Continental Shield,” said Royal Canadian Air Force Maj. Gen. Chris McKenna. “Golden Dome is the US brand on it. From our point of view, it’s great air missile defense and what we will put on the table to defend the continent with. And so I think there are ongoing negotiations between our governments with respect to what the specific investments will be.”

Guetlein’s comments on Golden Dome last week were part of an “industry day” hosted by Space Systems Command, the Los Angeles-based unit charged with procurement for most of the Space Force’s major programs. Asked what his top priority is this year, Guetlein said his emphasis is on the shield’s command and control system, the “glue layer” that ties together everything else necessary to make Golden Dome work. His deadline to demonstrate the command-and-control system is this summer.

The kinetic, or hit-to-kill, elements of the missile shield will come next. “In the summer of ’27, I have to integrate the interceptors, and in ’28 I have to demonstrate operational capability that is fielded against credible threats,” Guetlein said.

This would bring some version of Golden Dome into service before President Trump leaves the White House, a timetable used for several other programs, including NASA’s Artemis mission to land astronauts on the Moon. Officials are willing to trade perfection for speed. Guetlein’s intention is to “rapidly get an 85 percent product in the field.”

But a comprehensive missile defense shield, if economically and technically feasible, would take many more years to complete. Some pieces of what could become Golden Dome already exist, such as ground-based midcourse interceptors and an array of missile detection sensors on land, at sea, and in space.

Other elements were well along in development before Trump’s second term in the White House. These include a constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to better track hypersonic missiles and relay data to help US and allied forces shoot them down. This network, led by the Space Development Agency, began launching in 2023 but is not yet operational.

The Pentagon has already kicked off the preliminary steps to buy space-based interceptors. The shield will need hundreds or thousands of orbiting platforms on alert to shoot down a ballistic missile in flight. The Defense Department also aims to field modernized ground-based interceptors and Golden Dome’s command and control network, the system Guetlein identified as his top priority for this year.

Satellites are getting cheaper and easier to build. SpaceX has manufactured and launched approximately 11,000 Starlink satellites in less than seven years. No other company comes close to this number, but there are businesses looking at building standardized satellites that could be integrated with a range of payloads, including Earth-viewing cameras, radars, communication antennas, or perhaps, a missile interceptor.

But the interceptors themselves are brand new. Nothing like them has ever been put into space and tested before. Last year, the Space Force asked companies to submit their ideas for space-based interceptor, or SBI, prototypes. The military awarded 18 companies small prototype development deals in November. The Space Force did not identify the winners, and the value of each contract fell below the $9 million public disclosure threshold for Pentagon programs.

These 18 awards are focused on boost-phase SBIs, weapons that can take out a missile soon after it leaves its silo. From a physics perspective, this is one of the most difficult things to ask an interceptor to do because the weapon must take into account atmospheric disruptions and reentry heating to reach its target. In December, the Space Force issued a follow-up request for prototype proposals looking at space-based midcourse interceptors capable of destroying a ballistic missile while it is coasting through space.

The Pentagon has not said how many SBIs it will need for Golden Dome, or what they will look like. Essentially, an orbiting interceptor will be a flying fuel tank with a rocket and a sensor package to home in on its target. But the Space Force and its prospective Golden Dome contractors, which include industry giants Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, have not disclosed the interceptors’ design specs or how many the shield will need.

Guetlein said Pentagon leaders have empowered him with “unprecedented authorities” on the Golden Dome program. He said Friday his office has full authority over the program’s technical aspects, along with Golden Dome’s procurement, contracting, hiring, security, and budget.

President Trump directed the military to start the Golden Dome program in an executive order last January and nominated Guetlein to head the effort. The Senate confirmed him for the job in a voice vote last July. After the initial pomp of Golden Dome’s announcement, including multiple Oval Office photo ops, military officials went quiet. Guetlein cited security concerns for the Pentagon’s silence on one of Trump’s marquee defense programs.

“I was confirmed on the 18th of July. On the 19th of July, I popped No. 1 on the intel collect list for our adversaries,” Guetlein said. “On the 20th of July, they started hacking our defense industrial base, and the Secretary (of Defense) asked us to go silent. So, we have been quiet. I have not been talking to industry consortiums. I have not been talking to the press. I have not been talking to the think tanks. And it wasn’t until September that I was allowed to even start talking to the Hill (Congress).”

Despite this absence of dialogue, lawmakers approved $23 billion in a down payment for Golden Dome last summer. The final cost of the system is anyone’s guess, but the deployment and sustainment of Golden Dome will certainly cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of multiple decades. Just getting the missile shield through a partial activation will cost $175 billion over three years, according to the White House.

Guetlein is off and running with the one-time infusion of $23 billion Congress gave him last year. “The budget authority… for the first $23 billion, it has no strings, no color, no year,” he said. “I can move that money around at will.”

He’s about to receive another $13.4 billion in this year’s defense budget, pending the appropriation bill’s final passage in the Senate and President Trump’s signature.

“I’ve got the Space Force buying SBIs. I’ve got the Army buying munitions and sensors. I’ve got the Navy buying munitions. I’ve got the Missile Defense Agency buying next-generation interceptors, glide phase interceptors, and a whole host of other capabilities,” Guetlein said.

Despite their willingness to fund Golden Dome, lawmakers still aren’t satisfied with the information they are getting from the Pentagon. In a document adjoining this year’s defense budget bill, members of the House and Senate defense appropriations subcommittees wrote they were “unable to effectively assess resources available” and unable to “conduct oversight” of the Golden Dome program “due to insufficient budgetary information” provided by the Department of Defense.

The lawmakers wrote that they “support the operational objectives of Golden Dome” and directed the Pentagon to “provide a comprehensive spend plan” for the missile shield within 60 days of the budget bill becoming law.

“Unfortunately because of the intel threat, we can only brief you at the classified level on what the architecture is,” Guetlein said.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.—The annual 24 hour race that kicks off the American racing season took place this past weekend at Daytona International Speedway. Each year, the crowd gets bigger and bigger, drawn in large part by the hybrid prototypes that contest the GTP class for overall victory. After Formula 1, these are some of the most complex, sophisticated race cars ever to turn a wheel—and it doesn’t hurt that they look extremely cool too. But yet again, endurance racing wants to offer more than just entertainment.

A large number of automotive technologies or safety features that we mostly take for granted today made their way into road cars from the race track. Seatbelts, rear view mirrors, turbocharged engines, aerodynamics, direct-injection engines, dual-clutch gearboxes, and more owe their existence to competition. Although, truth be told, direct examples of racing technology transfer in the mid-21st century seem less common than the intangible benefits gained when a bunch of motorsports-trained engineers have lunch every day with their road car colleagues.

That is starting to change, though, but now the domain is in simulation. Vast amounts of data are generated during the course of a race—each of the 11 GTP cars that raced at Daytona collects 1,600 different channels of data from onboard sensors, with nearly as many on the GTD machines that are based on road-going cars like Porsche’s 911 or Chevrolet’s Corvette. With 60 cars running for 24 hours—and that’s just the first race of the year—that’s a heck of a lot of high-quality data being generated, and now IMSA wants to leverage that to help automotive and technology companies develop better simulation tools, with the creation of IMSA Labs.

The sanctioning body has also extended its activities with NASA, signing a partnership with the space agency to work together on “telemetry, diagnostics and sensor methodologies.”

Car racing is, at its heart, a sport. And it’s also entertainment. But it also serves as an engineering exercise, with each race series balancing those three elements to different degrees. And the engineering is why companies like Bosch get involved.

“We have our technology up from the Bosch side that we use in our everyday vehicle engineering,” said Joe Capuano, regional president of Bosch Engineering. “We’re able to bring those components in different ways to the racetrack where obviously the requirements are different and it’s really a loop of learning. So we take our base components, we apply ’em in different ways to the needs of the race teams, and then we take the feedback from the races and we can improve our products that we have in our automotive portfolio,” Capuano said.

A company like General Motors, which competes in IMSA under both the Cadillac and Chevrolet brands, mostly does it to beat other automakers. But that’s not the only reason.

“It really teaches engineers, teaches us to advance quickly, be able to analyze data, adapt, discard things. And inside General Motors we really connect engineering and motorsports directly,” said Eric Warren, vice president of global motorsports competition at GM. “Motorsports really resides in the engineering groups. So as we develop new simulation methods and things… it directly connects with the groups that are designing our cars. And so not only do we get to compete from that standpoint, that drives this brand against brand, but also helps us train engineers to really relate to those technologies and drive that technology that ends up on the road,” Warren said.

“Literally what we do is we learn here on the weekend and then Monday morning we’re back in the office and we’re designing based on what we learned over the weekend into the products that we can drive ourselves through the rest of the week,” explained Matthew Cabe, president and CEO of Michelin North America.

This season, the tire maker has introduced a new tire for IMSA’s GTP class, as well as the near-identical cars in the World Endurance Championship, that contains more than 50 percent recycled and renewable material, while being more durable and no less performant than its older, less sustainable versions of seasons past. And the payoff for road cars is real: the tire maker’s CrossClimate tires make use of the same “slick intermediate” technology that adds grip in the wet that the French company proved at Le Mans a little over a decade ago.

The latest frontier in the automotive industry is the rise of the software-defined vehicle. Automakers are redesigning from scratch the electronic systems and architectures that run their cars.

“You’ll read and see a lot about software defined vehicles… and you think we’ve been doing that in racing forever,” said David Salters, president of Honda Racing Corporation USA. “So typically you have the minimum number of [electronic control unit] boxes on the car, you try and control the system end to end, and your engineers write the software. And the lovely thing about GTP is it is open software architecture. If we can think it, we can write it and do it. So in our case, we have an F1 ECU sat there, and we control all the software platform. We have a group of people—it actually helped us recruit people because it’s super interesting—and we literally develop stuff in days and hours,” Salters said.

“So we’re sort of walking the walk, it’s underneath. And so just software development, energy management, traction control; the traction control system we have on the car, Honda has a technical forum once a year, and we were asked to present what we’ve done with the traction control. It’s sort of self-aware,” Salters said.

“As David said, the vehicle is very software driven, but what is unique about particularly this race is, the conditions change, right? You have different drivers and totally different conditions,” said Warren. “You look at other race series: you have a short window, you’re optimizing on the razor’s edge, and you’re like, okay, you hit that. In this form of racing, particularly IMSA, it’s overnight, the track’s cold, you’ve got tire choices, and so you have to broaden your ability to model the vehicle, how to control the vehicle.”

Going racing to make better road cars is a pretty obvious reason to get involved if you’re a car company, but the sport can have benefits to other industries. For example, the Williams F1 team’s engineering arm took its knowledge of aerodynamics and used it to make open-front supermarket freezer cabinets stay colder with less energy. With IMSA Labs, the idea is to take the data from a race full of cars and use it to make better simulations. And like most other industries, it’s hard to escape the presence of machine learning and AI.

“It seems natural that an automaker and a tire company and a company like Bosch would want to use this space,” said IMSA President John Doonan. “But now it is our goal that the companies that I just mentioned and others will use this space to develop the next version of software that’s maybe not used in racing, maybe used in a broader audience, or prove out a product that’s already on the market. And as David and Eric mentioned, the data-rich environment that we have allows them to do that in real time in a very extreme—it doesn’t get more extreme than 24 hours across the street—environment like that,” Doonan said.

“Just by training imitationary techniques on the human data that’s generated, we can with just a few hundred laps drive cars at the top 1 percent of human performance. And to me that speaks volumes about quality of the data,” said Siddhartha Sen, principal research manager at Microsoft Research.

“You wouldn’t be able to do that if the data wasn’t high quality. Machine learning is all about cleaning noisy data and dealing with, honestly, all kinds of crap that you get right? And here the quality of the data, the sensors that’s collected, the attention that’s paid to that data is amazing… So honestly, as an AI researcher, as someone running an AI program, it is kind of a dream, you’re almost like at a candy store when you see this kind of quality of data and the diverse ways in which people drive,” Sen said.

“In general I found that the gap between simulation and reality can be made quite low with racing, and the only demand I’ve seen, that kind of low gap, [is] maybe the flight simulators… it’s just uncanny how people who, in online racing sims, perform, and that can kind of translate to what they see on the actual track. And I think that kind of low gap is a reason why we’re able to create models that can actually be useful in real life. And this is why I’m very excited about the platform in general, not just because of the data we’re going to collect, [but] the fact that it’s human data, and it’s diverse human data, which, by the way, is all the craze these days. Everything we’re doing with LLMs, we’re just trying to imitate how humans do things,” Sen said.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For close to a century, geoscientists have pondered a mystery: Where did Earth’s lighter elements go? Compared to amounts in the Sun and in some meteorites, Earth has less hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur, as well as noble gases like helium—in some cases, more than 99 percent less.

Some of the disparity is explained by losses to the solar system as our planet formed. But researchers have long suspected that something else was going on too.

Recently, a team of scientists reported a possible explanation—that the elements are hiding deep in the solid inner core of Earth. At its super-high pressure—360 gigapascals, 3.6 million times atmospheric pressure—the iron there behaves strangely, becoming an electride: a little-known form of the metal that can suck up lighter elements.

Study coauthor Duck Young Kim, a solid-state physicist at the Center for High Pressure Science & Technology Advanced Research in Shanghai, says the absorption of these light elements may have happened gradually over a couple of billion years—and may still be going on today. It would explain why the movement of seismic waves traveling through Earth suggests an inner core density that is 5 percent to 8 percent lower than expected were it metal alone.

Electrides, in more ways than one, are having their moment. Not only might they help solve a planetary mystery, they can now be made at room temperature and pressure from an array of elements. And since all electrides contain a source of reactive electrons that are easily donated to other molecules, they make ideal catalysts and other sorts of agents that help to propel challenging reactions.

One electride is already in use to catalyze the production of ammonia, a key component of fertilizer; its Japanese developers claim the process uses 20 percent less energy than traditional ammonia manufacture. Chemists, meanwhile, are discovering new electrides that could lead to cheaper and greener methods of producing pharmaceuticals.

Today’s challenge is to find more of these intriguing materials and to understand the chemical rules that govern when they form.

Most solids are made from ordered lattices of atoms, but electrides are different. Their lattices have little pockets where electrons sit on their own.

Normal metals have electrons that are not stuck to one atom. These are the outer, or valence, electrons that are free to move between atoms, forming what is often referred to as a delocalized “sea of electrons.” It explains why metals conduct electricity.

The outer electrons of electrides no longer orbit a particular atom either, but they can’t freely move. Instead, they become trapped at sites between atoms that are called non-nuclear attractors. This gives the materials unique properties. In the case of the iron in Earth’s core, the negative electron charges stabilize lighter elements at non-nuclear attractors that were formed at those super-high pressures, 3,000 times that at the bottom of the deepest ocean. The elements would diffuse into the metal, explaining where they disappeared to.

The first metal found to form an electride at high pressure was sodium, reported in 2009. At a pressure of 200 gigapascals (2 million times greater than atmospheric pressure) it transforms from a shiny, reflective, conducting metal into a transparent glassy, insulating material. This finding was “very weird,” says Stefano Racioppi, a computational and theoretical chemist at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, who worked on sodium electrides while in the lab of Eva Zurek at the University at Buffalo in New York state. Early theories, he says, had predicted that at high pressure, sodium’s outer electrons would move even more freely between atoms.

The first sign that things were different came from predictions in the late 1990s, when scientists were using computational simulations to model solids, based on the rules of quantum theory. These rules define the energy levels that electrons can have, and hence the probable range of positions in which they are found in atoms (their atomic orbitals).

Simulating solid sodium showed that at high pressures, as the sodium atoms get squeezed closer together, so do the electrons orbiting each atom. That causes them to experience increasing repulsive forces with one another. This changes the relative energies of every electron orbiting the nucleus of each atom, Racioppi explains—leading to a reorganization of electron positions.

The result? Rather than occupying orbitals that allow them to be delocalized and move between atoms, the orbitals take on a new shape that forces electrons into the non-nuclear attractor sites. Since the electrons are stuck at these sites, the solid loses its metallic properties.

Adding to this theoretical work, Racioppi and Zurek collaborated with researchers at the University of Edinburgh to find experimental evidence for a sodium electride at extreme pressures. Squeezing crystals of sodium between two diamonds, they used X-ray diffraction to map electron density in the metal structure. This, they reported in September 2025, confirmed that electrons really were located in the predicted non-nuclear attractor sites between sodium atoms.

Electrides are ideal candidates for catalysts—substances that can speed up and lower the energy needed for chemical reactions. That’s because the isolated electrons at the non-nuclear attractor sites can be donated to make and break bonds. But to be useful, they would need to function at ambient conditions.

Several such stable electrides have been discovered over the last 10 years, made from inorganic compounds or organic molecules containing metal atoms. One of the most significant, mayenite, was found by surprise in 2003 when material scientist Hideo Hosono at the Institute of Science Tokyo was investigating a type of cement.

Mayenite is a calcium aluminate oxide that forms crystals with very small pores—a few nanometers across—called cages, that contain oxygen ions. If a metal vapor of calcium or titanium is passed over it at high temperature, it removes the oxygen, leaving behind just electrons trapped at these sites—an electride.

Unlike the high-pressure metal electrides that switch from conductors to insulators, mayenite starts as an insulator. But now its trapped electrons can jump between cage sites (via a process called quantum tunnelling)—making it a conductor, albeit 100 to 1,000 times less conductive than a metal like aluminum or silver. It also becomes an excellent catalyst, able to surrender electrons to help make and break bonds in reactions.

By 2011, Hosono had begun to develop mayenite as a greener and more efficient catalyst for synthesizing ammonia. Over 170 million metric tons of ammonia, mostly for fertilizers, is produced annually via the Haber-Bosch process, in which metal oxides facilitate hydrogen and nitrogen gases reacting together at high pressure and temperature. It is an energy-intensive, expensive process—Haber-Bosch plants account for some 2 percent of the world’s energy use.

In Haber-Bosch, the catalysts bind the two gases to their surfaces and donate electrons to help break the strong triple bond that holds the two nitrogen atoms together in nitrogen gas, as well as the bonds in hydrogen gas. Because mayenite has a strong electron-donating nature, Hosono thought mayenite would be able to do it better.

In Hosono’s reaction, mayenite itself does not bind the gases but acts as a support bed for nanoparticles of a metal called ruthenium. First, the nanoparticles absorb the nitrogen and hydrogen gases. Then the mayenite donates electrons to the ruthenium. These electrons flow into the nitrogen and hydrogen molecules, making it easier to break their bonds. Ammonia thus forms at a lower temperature—300 to 400° C—and lower pressure—50 to 80 atmospheres— than with Haber-Bosch, which takes place at 400 to 500° C and 100 to 400 atmospheres.

In 2017, the company Tsubame BHB was formed to commercialize Hosono’s catalyst, with the first pilot plant opening in 2019, producing 20 metric tons of ammonia per year. The company has since opened a larger facility in Japan and is setting up a 20,000-ton-per year green ammonia plant in Brazil to replace some of the nation’s fossil-fuel-based fertilizer production. The company estimates that this will avoid 11,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually—about equal to the annual emissions of 2,400 cars.

There are other applications for a mayenite catalyst, says Hosono, including a lower-energy conversion of CO2 into useful chemicals like methane, methanol or longer-chain hydrocarbons. Other scientists have suggested that mayenite’s cage structure also makes it suitable for immobilizing radioactive isotope waste in nuclear power stations: The electrons could capture negative ions like iodine and bromide and trap them in the cages.

Mayenite has even been studied as a low-temperature propulsion system for satellites in space. When it is heated to 600° C in a vacuum, its trapped electrons blast from the cages, causing propulsion.

The list of materials known to form electrides keeps growing. In 2024, a team led by chemist Fabrizio Ortu at the University of Leicester in the UK accidentally discovered another room-temperature-stable electride made from calcium ions surrounded by large organic molecules, together known as a coordination complex.

He was using a method known as mechanical chemistry—“You put something in a milling jar, you shake it really hard, and that provides the energy for the reaction,” he says. But to his surprise, electrons from the potassium he had added to his calcium complex were not donated to the calcium ion. Instead, what formed “had these electrons that were floating in the system,” he says, trapped in sites between the two metals.

Unlike mayenite, this electride is not a conductor—its trapped electrons do not jump. But they allow it to facilitate reactions that are otherwise hard to get started, by activating unreactive bonds, doing a job much like a catalyst. These are reactions that currently rely on expensive palladium catalysts.

The scientists successfully used the electride on a reaction that joins two pyridine rings—carbon rings containing a nitrogen atom. They are now examining whether the electride could assist in other common organic reactions, such as substituting a hydrogen atom on a benzene ring. These substitutions are difficult because the bond between the benzene ring carbon and its attached hydrogen is very stable.

There are still problems to sort out: Ortu’s calcium electride is too air- and water-sensitive for use in industry. He is now looking for a more stable alternative, which could prove particularly useful in the pharmaceutical industry to synthesize drug molecules, where the sorts of reactions Ortu has demonstrated are common.

There remain many unresolved mysteries about electrides, including whether Earth’s inner core definitely contains one. Kim and his collaborators used simulations of the iron lattice to find evidence for non-nuclear attractor sites, but their interpretation of the results remains “a little bit controversial,” Racioppi says.

Sodium and other metals in Group 1 and Group 2 of the periodic table of elements—such as lithium, calcium, and magnesium—have loosely bound outer electrons. This helps make it easy for electrons to shift to non-nuclear attractor sites, forming electrides. But iron exerts more pulling power on its outer electrons, which sit in differently shaped orbitals. This makes the increase in electron repulsion under pressure less significant and thus the shift to electride formation difficult, Racioppi says.

Electrides are still little known and little studied, says computational materials scientist Lee Burton of Tel Aviv University. There is still no theory or model to predict when a material will become one. “Because electrides are not typical chemically, you can’t bring your chemical intuition to it,” he says.

Burton has been searching for rules that might help with predictions and has had some success finding electrides from a screen of 40,000 known materials. He is now using artificial intelligence to find more. “It’s a complex interplay between different properties that sometimes can all depend on each other,” he says. “This is where machine learning can really help.”

The key is having reliable data to train any model. Burton’s team only has actual data from the handful of electride structures experimentally confirmed so far, but they also are using the kind of modeling based on quantum theory that was carried out by Racioppi to create high-resolution simulations of electron density within materials. They are doing this for as many materials as they can; those that are confirmed by real-world experiments will be used to train an AI model to identify more materials that are likely to be electrides—ones with the discrete pockets of high electron density characteristic of trapped electron sites. “The potential,” says Burton, “is enormous.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/as-data-from-space-spikes-an-innovative-ground-station-company-seeks-to-cash-in/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A company that seeks to disrupt the way in which data from space is received and transmitted has found some key investors and customers.

On Tuesday morning Northwood Space announced that it has closed a $100 million Series B round of funding to support a rapid ramp-up in the deployment of its phased-array radar system, known as Portal. The company also said it has received a $49.8 million contract from the US Space Force to augment the Satellite Control Network, which provides telemetry and tracking for the military’s satellites.

“We made our last fundraise announcement in April of 2025, so less than a year, but there’s been a lot of activity and progress on the Northwood side that reflects the importance of ground as an enabler for pushing forward more capable missions on shorter timelines,” said Bridgit Mendler, co-founder and CEO of Northwood, during a media roundtable. “That’s why we’re here, that’s why we’re building what we’re building, is because we believe that there’s a lot of important capability in space that needs to be built faster, and the way to do that is through a vertically integrated ground network.”

The funding announcements cap a busy year for Northwood, which emerged from stealth as a small startup in February 2024. The company was founded on the premise that there is a bottleneck in the capability of commercial ground stations to download increasing amounts of data gathered by satellites in orbit, and that this will only get worse. Northwood and its investors are betting that the existing network of commercial ground stations, many of which were deployed a decade or longer ago, cannot keep up with the pace of new satellites arriving in orbit.

In June the company demonstrated its second-generation phased-array antenna, known as Portal. Instead of needing to point directly at their target to collect a signal, like a parabolic dish antenna, phased-array antennas produce a beam of radio waves that can “point” in different directions without moving the antenna. It can also communicate with multiple satellites, in multiple orbits, at a single time.

By the end of the year, Northwood, based in El Segundo, California, had shown the ability to build eight of these Portal arrays a month. And in January the company had deployed operational Portal antennas across two continents. These deployments, which comprise an area of 8 to 15 meters, have the equivalent capability of a 7-meter parabolic dish, said Griffin Cleverly, co-founder and chief technical officer of Northwood.

“Across our initial Portal sites, it will be a few dozen spacecraft that each of them can handle,” he said. “And then, as we get into 2027, with much more scale manufacturing, we’ll easily be able to handle hundreds of satellites with our network.”

Northwood’s entry into the development of ground stations—there are about half a dozen major players in the industry, some long-established others new—came as the Space Force was looking to modernize its Satellite Control Network.

According to a government report published in 2023, the network makes 450 daily contacts with satellites and supports the launch and operations of these vehicles. The report found that the network faced “sustainment and obsolescence issues while demands on the system are increasing.”

The Space Force is seeking to address these issues as well as the proliferation of satellites in low-Earth orbit, and came to Northwood looking to scale up its system to meet these needs. Northwood began working with the Space Force in September.

The company seeks to address both government and commercial customers with the Portal system and future antennas. One growth area much discussed in recent months has been orbital data centers, which would necessitate the movement of huge amounts of data to and from space. Mendler said Northwood was “enthusiastic” to support such initiatives.

“Our overall perspective on the space industry was that volume of data was going to go up, use cases were going to go up,” Mendler said of the reasons for founding Northwood.

“And that has definitely borne out, whether we’re talking about communications, which has also been surging, or manufacturing or energy or compute, all of these different use cases in space, there’s a lot of appetite to address them,” she added. “The way that we think about ourselves is someone who conceives of solutions for how to make that all happen and then is accountable to actually see them through.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a memo sent out to staff last month, OpenAI CEO issued a “code red” urging employees to double down on improving the company’s flagship product ChatGPT, as financial pressure loomed and competitors gained ground.

The company continues to frantically chase some much-needed revenue. Despite Altman calling ads a “last resort for us as a business model” in 2024, the company announced earlier this month that ChatGPT will soon start spamming users with them.

Its cash burn rate is immense. The company is planning to spend well over $1 trillion in the coming years on data center infrastructure, despite revenue lagging far behind. Experts have warned that the company could run out of cash within the next 18 months. To its most skeptical critics, it’s an Enron-like financial disaster that’s waiting to happen.

So maybe it’s not surprising that the company is opting to pump the brakes. During a livestreamed town hall event on Monday, Altman said that OpenAI is looking to “dramatically slow down” hiring as the company continues to lose billions of dollars each quarter, as Business Insider reports.

“What I think we shouldn’t do, and what I hope other companies won’t do either, is hire super aggressively, then realize all of a sudden AI can do a lot of stuff, and you need fewer people, and have to have some sort of very uncomfortable conversation,” Altman told attendees. “So I think the right approach for us will be to hire more slowly but keep hiring.”

The news comes amid widespread concerns over soaring unemployment in the US. While consumer spending has increased, the labor market has been hit hard by businesses curbing hiring significantly, often citing heavy investments in AI.

Altman’s admission also suggests that several years of aggressive hiring in the AI sector could be screeching to a halt as the industry continues to face pressure from investors getting antsy about the waning prospects of a return.

The news is particularly notable after years of AI companies embracing an unprecedented hiring spree, desperately trying to poach talent from their competitors by offering them astronomical pay packages.

Whether Altman’s announcement signals that those days are over for good remains to be seen. Big tech’s spending binge is set to drag on in the coming years. Many have already made massive commitments to scale up operations by expanding enormous data centers.

At the same time, selling those future prospects to investors could become more difficult as well. OpenAI, for instance, is already struggling with stalling subscriber growth — and that’s before pestering its users with ads or paywalling existing features behind expensive monthly subscriptions. (The company is currently mulling over how much to charge for ads.)

As former Fidelity manager George Noble fulminated in a scorching thread on X, the AI industry may have already hit a point of diminishing returns. Companies still have a lot to prove — for instance, chatbots still suffer from rampant hallucinations — as the goalposts continue to be moved.

“The low-hanging fruit is gone,” he wrote. “Every incremental improvement now requires exponentially more compute, more data centers, more power.”

Meanwhile, Google — one of OpenAI’s biggest competitors — can rely on an already-established business with existing revenue streams to prop up its AI spending.

In short, Altman’s significant hiring slowdown could be indicative of a tough time ahead. And if critics are to be believed, the wheels could already be starting to come off.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re just days away from NASA’s historic return to the Moon.

The agency’s Artemis 2 mission will see a crew of four astronauts travel far beyond the dark side of the Earth’s natural satellite, reaching the farthest point that humans have ever traveled from Earth. They will get unfettered views of the Moon’s surface during the flyby, getting within just 4,600 miles of its far side, before making their four-day return to Earth.

On Friday, the four astronauts officially entered quarantine in preparation for the mission, a conventional precaution ahead of any prolonged trips into space, to “ensure that they don’t pick up any illness that could delay their mission by limiting their exposure to others in the days before they lift off,” as NASA explained.

“This period, called the health stabilization program, typically starts about 14 days before launch,” the agency wrote. “Beginning quarantine now preserves flexibility as teams work toward potential opportunities in the February launch period.”

The team will still be allowed to be in contact with their friends and family, as long as they “observe quarantine guidelines… avoid public places, wear masks, and maintain distance from others they come into contact with,” per the agency.

NASA will conduct its wet dress rehearsal (WDR) in advance of a launch as early as January 31. The rehearsal is designed to run through the entire launch — while the astronauts are still in quarantine — to ensure that all systems are go.

If all goes according to plan, the agency’s Space Launch System rocket could launch as early as February 6, though an official date has yet to be announced.

However, the rocket has already been rolled out to historic Launch Complex-39B at Kennedy Space Center, alongside the Orion spacecraft that will carry the crew into space.

It’s an exciting prospect, as it’ll be the first time humans have ventured to the Moon in over half a century.

“Artemis 2 will be a momentous step forward for human spaceflight,” said NASA administrator Jared Isaacman in a recent statement. “This historic mission will send humans farther from Earth than ever before and deliver the insights needed for us to return to the Moon — all with America at the helm.”

The space agency’s follow-up mission, Artemis 3, could allow the first astronauts to walk on the lunar surface since Apollo 17 in December 1972.

The mission is scheduled to launch sometime next year, but NASA has plenty of decisions to make — like which spacecraft to pick to carry the crew from lunar orbit down to the surface.

            <h2>Elon Musk Haters Have Found a Hilariously Easy Way to Make Money on Polymarket</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-27</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk has long garnered a reputation for being massively wrong in his promises and predictions about the future.

In 2024, for instance, he said that AI would become “smarter than the smartest human” by 2025. He said his company’s SpaceX Starship rocket, which is still exploding during test flights, will land on Mars this year. Like clockwork, he’s predicted that self-driving cars will become a reality “next year” every year for well over a decade now. He promised robotaxis without human safety monitors by mid-2025, which the company still has yet to accomplish.

We could go on and on. In short, it’d be far easier to count the occasions on which he’s been right than when he’s been wrong.

Now, as NBC News reports, users on online prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket are making big bucks off of Musk’s astonishing track record for being wrong about the future. Case in point, Polymarket user David Bensoussan made a ten percent return after betting $10,000 that Musk wouldn’t follow through on his threat of forming a new political party following his falling out with president Donald Trump.

He also successfully bet against Musk’s prediction that Tesla would launch an “unsupervised” version of its erroneously-named “Full Self-Driving” software by the end of 2025.

To Bensoussan, it’s a matter of principle.

“He does have a solid fan base, and so if I can help separate them from some of their money, I’m always happy to do that,” he told NBC. “He has a habit of exaggerating timelines, and of saying he’s going to do these amazing things and attaching more immediacy than what his intent may necessarily be.”

It’s an ironic inversion of the ethos of many of Musk’s investors, who have long warned to never bet against the mercurial CEO.

In total, Bensoussan’s ploy to bet against Musk’s wildly optimistic predictions has paid off, garnering him over $36,000.

Online prediction markets have surged in popularity in recent years. While benefitting from a largely unfettered regulatory vacuum, sites like Polymarket and Kalshi have also become embroiled in major insider trading controversies. Case in point, earlier this year, an anonymous bettor netted a cool $410,000 after accurately predicting the Trump administration’s attacks on Venezuela mere hours before Trump issued orders authorizing the strikes.

Even Musk himself has frequently voiced his support for prediction markets. His AI company, xAI, has deep integrations of both Kalshi and Polymarket.

But as it turns out, actively betting against his many attempts to reassure investors that a major technological revolution is just around the corner — a gambit that has largely worked out for him in the past — could be pretty lucrative.

As for current predictions, the online platforms aren’t exactly eager to stand behind his latest prophecies. For instance, only 13 percent of Kalshi users believe Musk will make good on his recent threat to buy airline Ryanair by the end of this year. The airline’s CEO, Michael O’Leary, had questioned the economics of adding SpaceX Starlink internet to airliners, resulting in petty name-calling.

As NBC points out, Musk also tried to manipulate prediction markets by calling a bet on Polymarket that Tesla will launch a robotaxi service before July 2025 a “money-making opportunity.”

Markets expectedly rose, with odds tripling to about 40 percent.

However, as the rules stipulated, a robotaxi service would only count if it was open to the general public — something that only materialized well after July 2025 — leading to plenty of users getting “burned.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A doctor who witnessed the brutal shooting of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents says that the agents didn’t even bother trying to save the victim’s life as he bled out on the ground — because they were too busy counting the bullet wounds.

The harrowing testimony, detailed in a sworn court filing, contradicts key details in the accounts given by the Department of Homeland Security and top officials in the Trump administration, which insist that the 37-year-old ICU nurse threatened agents and attempted to reach for his gun during an altercation in Minneapolis on Saturday.

According to the witness, a 29-year-old physician who isn’t identified by name in the court document, Pretti was yelling at the agents but did not attack them or brandish any sort of weapon before the situation escalated fatally.

“Suddenly, an ICE agent shoved him to the ground,” the witness said, referring to the Border Patrol officers. “My view of the altercation was partially obstructed, but after a few seconds, I saw at least four ICE agents point guns at the man. I then saw the agents shoot the man at least six or seven times.”

When he rushed to the scene and told Border Patrol he was a physician and wanted to attend to the victim, the agents demanded to see his physician’s license — “which I obviously didn’t have,” he said.

Shockingly, he noticed that “none of the ICE agents who were near the victim were performing CPR” despite him clearly being in “critical condition,” so the doctor continued his protests.

“Normally, I would not have been so persistent, but as a physician, I felt a professional and moral obligation to help this man,” he said, “especially since none of the agents were helping him.”

Once the agents finally let him through, the first red flag that jumped out at him was that the victim was lying on his side.

“That is not standard practice when a victim has been shot. Checking for a pulse and administering CPR is standard practice,” he said. “Instead of doing either of those things, the ICE agents appeared to be counting his bullet wounds.”

The doctor checked for a pulse, found that Pretti had none, and immediately began CPR. According to the physician, Pretti had at least three bullet wounds in his back, another on his upper left chest, and possibly one on his neck. The doctor left after EMS arrived at the scene and took charge.

He described how the scene had left him shaken afterwards.

“When I returned to my apartment, I was extremely distraught,” the doctor said. “I was sobbing and shaking uncontrollably.”

Soon, tear gas began to flood into his apartment from a protest outside, and he left to drive to a friend’s house, “still crying and shaking” and “barely able to speak.”

Pretti’s killing has added to the intense backlash against ICE and Border Patrol’s brutal crackdown in Minneapolis, where the federal agents have clashed with onlookers, rounded up both citizen and non-citizen children, and shot and killed another protestor, 37-year-old Renee Good.

Contradicting the mountains of video evidence taken at the scene, the DHS maintains that Pretti, a nurse that treated sick and wounded veterans at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” Agency secretary Kristi Noem called his actions “domestic terrorism,” and White House Deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller accused him of being an “assassin.”

“The victim was not actively threatening ICE agents or the public — he was just yelling at the agents because he objected to ICE’s presence in our city,” he said in the filing.

“I am not sure when I will return to my apartment,” he added. “I do not feel safe in my city.”

            <h2>Tesla Kills Autopilot After Storm of Criticism, Paywalls Basic Features</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/tesla-kills-autopilot-criticism">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The concept for Tesla’s driver-assistance system, Autopilot, has been around for well over a decade. Elon Musk’s EV maker has long used the term to describe features like advanced cruise control and auto-steer, all the while admitting that drivers still need to be able to take over at any time.

But in light of plummeting sales and shrinking profits, Tesla has killed the feature in the United States and Canada for good. It’s a major reversal after over a decade of Musk making yearly — and flat-out wrong — predictions of achieving fully autonomous, or Level 5, driving “next year.”

Autopilot has also been caught up in several high-profile investigations by federal regulators, following hundreds of crashes and dozens of deaths involving the feature. The EV maker has also faced a litany of lawsuits over the software, including a $329 million wrongful death settlement last year.

To raise much-needed revenue now that car sales have taken a major hit, the company has instead paywalled most of the basic features. Starting on February 14, Tesla owners will need to shell out a steep $99 a month to enable features like autosteer or advanced lane keep assist, something the vehicles were previously capable of without a subscription. (Traffic Aware Cruise Control, however, will remain standard, even without a subscription.)

The timing is suspect, to say the least. As Ars Technica points out, a court ruled in December that Tesla deceived its customers by implying that its “Autopilot” branding amounts to “deceptive marketing,” giving the company a mere 60 days to fix any misleading claims or be banned from selling cars in California, one of its biggest markets.

The start of the subscription service almost perfectly aligns with that deadline, although it remains unclear what exactly motivated the company to kill Autopilot. Another major motivating factor may be Musk’s $1 trillion pay package, which requires the company to reach 10 million active subscriptions to its driver assistance software.

Tesla’s branding for the features has been especially confusing as of late, differentiating between Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), a highly controversial and easily fooled add-on package that also still requires the driver to stay engaged at all times, despite its misleading name.

As of February 14, owners will only be able to either pay $99 a month for an FSD subscription — or live with the fact that their vehicles’ driver assistance capabilities will be considerably reined in. Before that date, users can still shell out a steep $8,000 to permanently unlock FSD.

Musk has boasted that it’s an incredible value add — and one that’s going to become even more expensive as time goes on.

“I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD’s capabilities improve,” Musk warned in a January 22 tweet. “The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD).”

When such an “unsupervised” version of FSD will materialize remains a mystery. However, given Musk’s track record of making predictions about the tech, such a future may still be many years out — if it ever materializes.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you thought humanity already had its hands full with climate change, think again.

With satellites and space junk increasingly cluttering our planet’s low Earth orbit, a team of scientists warn that this entire region could suddenly collapse into a destructive maelstrom of swirling debris, posing a threat to any spacecraft that dares to venture up there, and hurling dangerous missiles of space junk down onto our planet below.

Their study, which is yet-to-be-peer reviewed, builds on a theoretical scenario first laid out by NASA scientist Donald Kessler, which describes how just a few accidental collisions between satellites could quickly cascade into a vicious cycle in which the resulting debris causes even more smash-ups, and thus even more debris. At worst, the ensuing vortex of dangerous debris could trap us on our planet and set back spaceflight for decades.

With more satellites being launched into low Earth orbit than ever, this scenario — dubbed Kessler syndrome — is starting to be considered as a serious possibility. Elon Musk’s SpaceX alone maintains a “megaconstellation” of over 9,000 expendable satellites, with Amazon set to follow suit with its own megaconstellation and China working on yet another.

Kessler originally envisioned this orbital catastrophe unfolding over many years. But the new work adds a grim twist to the mix. What if a Kessler syndrome type scenario was suddenly kicked off by a violent solar storm? These outbursts by the Sun blast the Earth with electromagnetic waves that can disrupt electrical grids and communications. In theory, a powerful enough one could cut off our contact with satellites and fry their navigation systems, leaving them with no means to stay on course.

It’s a concerning possibility. With all that stuff up there, SpaceX’s expendable satellites have to constantly perform maneuvers to avoid hitting each other and other objects, with over 300,000 of these maneuvers performed last year.

Investigating this possibility, the researchers created a new metric called the CRASH clock, which measures how long it would take a catastrophic collision to occur if the satellites lose navigation in a crisis like a solar storm.

The gist is that things would go south very quickly. The researchers calculated that satellites may be having a “close approach,” or pass within one kilometer of each other, once every 36 seconds in low Earth orbit — an uncomfortably close distance in space.

Factoring that in, they put the CRASH clock at just 5.5 days, meaning that humanity would have very little time to intervene if this solar storm did occur. On the other hand, if we were struck by a solar event of this magnitude — like the infamous Carrington Event in 1859, which took out the planet’s burgeoning telegraph infrastructure and today would likely cause blackouts the world over— we would probably have more immediate concerns to worry about.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google is rolling out the ability for users to ask follow-up questions directly from AI Overviews, which are the AI-generated summaries at the top of Google Search results. Now, users will be able to jump into a conversational back and forth with AI Mode, Google’s conversational Search feature for complex questions.

The tech giant also announced that it’s making Gemini 3 the new default model for AI Overviews globally. The company said in a blog post that this update will give users “a best-in-class AI response right on the search results page.”

Tuesday’s announcements mark Google’s ongoing efforts to make Search less of a static search results experience and more of an interactive, AI-driven experience.

“People come to Search for an incredibly wide range of questions – sometimes to find information quickly, like a sports score or the weather, where a simple result is all you need,” Robby Stein, VP of Product, Google Search, said in a blog post. “But for complex questions or tasks where you need to explore a topic deeply, you should be able to seamlessly tap into a powerful conversational AI experience.”

Google says its testing shows that users prefer an experience that flows naturally into a conversation, and that asking follow-up questions while preserving context from AI Overviews makes Search more helpful.

The new experience is designed to feel like a single flow, with links that let users move from a quick snapshot to a deeper conversation as needed, the tech giant says.

The updates come a few days after Google announced that it’s bringing “Personal Intelligence” to AI Mode, enabling it to tap into your Gmail and Google Photos to provide more individualized responses. The company debuted Personal Intelligence earlier this month in the Gemini app to allow the AI assistant to tailor its responses by connecting across your Google ecosystem, starting with Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history.

Google also recently brought AI Overviews to Gmail, letting users search their inbox using natural language to get quick answers instead of having to rely on traditional keyword search and open multiple emails to find specific information. The company made the announcement alongside the debut of its new AI Inbox.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google on Tuesday announced an expanded set of Android theft protection features, designed to make its mobile devices less of a target for criminals. Building on existing tools like Theft Detection Lock, Offline Device Lock, and others introduced in 2024, the newly launched updates include stronger authentication safeguards and enhanced recovery tools, the company said.

While iPhones are often the preferred targets for thieves because of their resale value, Android devices are also subject to theft. That’s particularly true for high-end Android smartphones like the Google Pixel Pro devices, premium foldables, and other top devices from well-known makers like Samsung.

With the new features, users of Android devices running Android 16 or higher will have more control over the Failed Authentication Lock feature that automatically locks the device after an excessive number of failed login attempts. Now, users will have access to a dedicated on/off toggle switch in the device’s settings.

The devices will also offer stronger protection against a thief trying to guess a device owner’s PIN, pattern, or password by increasing the lockout time after failed attempts. Plus, Identity Check, a feature rolled out for Android 15 and higher last year, now covers all features and apps that use biometrics — like banking apps or the Google Password Manager.

Remote Lock, a tool that lets you lock a lost or stolen device from a web browser, will now include an optional security challenge or question. With this feature, available to Android 10+, only the real device owner can initiate the lock for added security.

In Brazil, two theft protection features will now be enabled by default, including the Theft Detection Lock, which uses on-device AI to sense motion that could indicate a “snatch-and-run” theft. The Remote Lock feature will also be automatically turned on and accessible from the website android.com/lock.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/indian-states-weigh-australia-style-ban-on-social-media-for-children/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">India could become the next major test case for age-based social media bans, as states weigh Australia-style restrictions on children’s access to platforms amid a growing global regulatory push.

The push has begun at the state level, with the western state of Goa becoming the latest to study whether to bar children under 16 from social media platforms. “Australia has brought in a law ensuring a ban on social media for children below the age of 16,” said Goa’s IT minister Rohan Khaunte this week. “Our department people have already pulled out those particular papers. We are studying them, if possible, [will] implement a similar ban on children below 16 for usage of social media.”

Like Goa, the southern state of Andhra Pradesh is also considering adopting Australia’s approach. Earlier this month, the state’s IT and education minister, Nara Lokesh, suggested the move, saying officials were studying Australia’s law.

“I believe we need to create a strong legal enactment,” Lokesh said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.

The Andhra Pradesh government has already constituted a Group of Ministers to study whether restrictions or a ban on minors’ access to social media platforms would be legally and practically feasible. The panel is chaired by Lokesh and includes key cabinet ministers.

In addition to the two Indian states, the issue has also drawn judicial scrutiny, with the Madras High Court urging India’s federal government in December to consider Australia-style restrictions, highlighting how concerns about children’s online safety are driving regulatory debates well beyond legislatures.

Any move to restrict children’s access to social media in India would carry significant implications for global technology companies, for which the South Asian nation is a critical growth market. Government estimates put India’s internet user base at more than one billion, with a large share of those users coming online at a young age, making the country central to the user and advertising strategies of platforms such as Meta, Google, and X.

A Meta spokesperson said the company shared lawmakers’ goal of creating “safe, positive online experiences for young people,” but argued that parents — rather than governments — should decide which apps their teenagers use. “Governments considering bans should be careful not to push teens toward less safe, unregulated sites, or logged-out experiences that bypass important protections – like the default safeguards we offer in Instagram’s Teen Accounts,” the spokesperson said.

Passed through the Online Safety Amendment (Social Media Minimum Age) Act 2024 and approved by parliament in November 2024 before taking effect in December 2025, Australia’s under-16 social media ban has already exposed enforcement challenges for platforms.

Last year, Meta began notifying Australian teenagers that their accounts would be shut down, signaling the difficulty of accurately determining users’ ages, particularly when people are not always truthful at sign-up. The law, which also included Twitch but exempted Pinterest, Discord, GitHub, Roblox, and Steam, among others, has reignited concerns about digital age-verification systems, which pose privacy and security risks due to the sensitive data they require.

Australia’s move is being closely watched beyond India, with governments in countries including Denmark, France, and Spain, as well as Indonesia and Malaysia, studying similar restrictions.

Kazim Rizvi, founding director of New Delhi–based think tank The Dialogue, told TechCrunch that while there is growing pressure to regulate children’s use of social media, internet governance falls under federal law, meaning states cannot amend national statutes such as the Information Technology Act or the Digital Personal Data Protection Act. He added that some states, including Andhra Pradesh, are therefore likely to seek the central government’s support — an outcome that remains uncertain.

India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, passed in August 2023, includes specific protections for children’s data, requiring verifiable parental consent before processing personal data of individuals under 18 and prohibiting tracking, behavioural monitoring, and targeted advertising directed at minors. However, the operational rules for these provisions are being phased in through 2027, giving platforms time to implement the required safeguards.

Google, Snap, and X did not respond to requests for comment. India’s IT ministry also did not respond when contacted.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">RIP, Amazon convenience stores: gone and probably soon forgotten.

Amazon announced on Tuesday that it will close its brick-and-mortar Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh stores and will instead expand its capacity for same-day grocery delivery, as well as its Whole Foods Market footprint.

These stores were used to grow Amazon’s cashierless Just Walk Out technology, which tracks what items customers grab, allowing them to pay for their groceries without a more formal checkout process. The company is instead focusing on offering that technology to third parties, like concession stands at sports stadiums.

“While we’ve seen encouraging signals in our Amazon-branded physical grocery stores, we haven’t yet created a truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model needed for large-scale expansion,” the company wrote in a blog post.

These retail closures will not impact customers who use Amazon for grocery delivery.

It’s not surprising that Amazon will divest from its branded retail stores, given that Amazon has been cutting down on its physical retail presence over the last few years. Upon closing down some stores in 2024, an Amazon spokesperson said that the company “couldn’t make the economics work with the lease cost.”

Amazon isn’t giving up on the brick-and-mortar side of its business, though. Instead, it will embrace the fact that people have a stronger brand affinity with Whole Foods Market than the Amazon Go convenience store.

Amazon will open more than 100 new Whole Foods stores over the next few years. The company says Whole Foods has seen over 40% sales growth and expansion to 550 stores since it was acquired by Amazon in 2017.

Amazon also plans to open more Whole Foods Market Daily Shop locations — a smaller version of the grocery store with an emphasis on convenience and grab-and-go meals. These seem similar to the idea behind Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh stores, but people probably feel better about grabbing a salad from Whole Foods than the Amazon Fresh store… even though they’re the same company.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Help desk automation is a billion-dollar industry, and one of the most likely to be disrupted by tech built upon AI. Major players like Zendesk, ServiceNow and Freshworks currently dominate the space, but lots of smaller startups are betting that reshuffling workflows will give them a chance to cut in.

Risotto is one of those startups, and after today, it will have plenty of runway to test its theory. The company on Tuesday said it has raised a $10 million seed round led by Bonfire Ventures, with participation from 645 Ventures, Y Combinator, Ritual Capital, and Surgepoint Capital.

Designed to autonomously resolve help desk tickets, Risotto sits between ticket management systems like Jira and the complex internal tooling needed to resolve them. The product is built on a third-party foundation model, but CEO Aron Solberg says the core of the business is the infrastructure that sits between the model and the customer, keeping the non-deterministic nature of the model in check.

“Our special sauce is the prompt libraries, the eval suites, and the thousands and thousands of real-world examples that the AI gets trained on to ensure it actually does what it’s expected to do,” Solberg told TechCrunch.

Working with the payroll company Gusto, Risotto was able to automate away 60% of the company’s support tickets. Its current work is focused on conventional ticketing systems, but Risotto is also positioning itself for a more radical shift in the industry, as AI triggers more fundamental changes in the way help desks function.

“With 95% of our customers, humans still solve tickets the traditional way,” Solberg said. “But we see the newer companies shifting to have the primary interface between humans and the technology be an LLM.”

In practical terms, this would mean tasks are managed through tools like ChatGPT for Enterprise, which coordinate help-desk tickets alongside a range of other professional tasks. Solberg says his team has already worked on integrations with ChatGPT for Enterprise and Gemini, connecting Risotto over MCP.

If that approach becomes more common, it would mean significant changes for the industry at large. Risotto and similar products would function as tools that would be called by a central AI, offering more focused and reliable service than a general-purpose system could perform on its own. It’s a new paradigm for thinking about SaaS products — one where reliability and context-management are more important than human-friendly interfaces.

In the meantime, Risotto’s most immediate value proposition comes from taming the mess of different IT systems. As Solberg sees it, there is still plenty of value in making it easier to use existing ticketing systems.

“One of our customers has four full-time employees just to manage Jira,” Solberg says. “And that’s to say nothing about implementing AI. That’s just to wrangle the platform itself.”

It measures 3.9 millimeters at its thinnest point and is engineered to withstand up to 200,000 folds over its lifetime. The phone will come in black with 512GB of storage in the U.S.

The phone carries a higher price tag than any other smartphone on the U.S. market, surpassing even a fully loaded iPhone 17 Pro Max with 2TB of storage and Samsung’s own $2,000 Galaxy Z Fold.

The Galaxy Z TriFold will be available throughout the U.S. at Samsung Experience Stores and Samsung.com. Notably, it won’t be available through mobile carriers.

The phone is the first foldable of its kind to be available in the U.S., as Huawei’s trifold Mate XT isn’t sold in the U.S. It’s worth noting that Apple is rumored to be releasing its first folding phone later this year.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/minnesota-legal-response/685768/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">American citizens have been brutalized, pepper-sprayed, and killed on the streets of Minneapolis. For many, one particular breakdown is a final, damning cause for despair: Minnesota’s apparent inability to investigate and potentially prosecute the federal agents responsible. The Department of Homeland Security on Saturday reportedly blocked Minnesota officials from examining the scene of Alex Pretti’s shooting. Access was refused even after state officials got a judicial search warrant. As a result, key forensic evidence was almost certainly lost. This comes after state officials were excluded from the investigation into Renee Good’s death.

Federal obstruction of Minnesota’s criminal investigation merits more creative pushback from the state: Leaving investigations in the hands of DHS alone sends a powerful message to ICE officers. It tells them that even if they effectively execute a U.S. citizen who presents no threat on camera on a public street, they will face no consequences—a recipe for future tragedies. The state’s interest in finding a way to at least create some deterrence to deadly federal lawlessness is not just a matter of justice: It is also a way of keeping its people safe moving forward.

Robert F. Worth: Welcome to the American winter

This is not a completely novel situation. Criminality is often shielded by large organizations, and clever lawyers have come up with clever strategies for dealing with it. For example, in the early 20th century, prosecutors resorted to pretextual indictments to go after the mob—the tax-evasion case against Al Capone being the most famous such prosecution. Because prosecutors could not scrape together evidence of his core crimes, Capone was convicted first of contempt of court and then of tax evasion.

Now, as then, when a direct path to justice is blocked, states need to find a work-around. The federal prosecution of the Minneapolis officers responsible for George Floyd’s death offers a model. For example, the officers Tou Thao, Thomas Lane, and Alexander Kueng were held criminally liable for acts beyond the killing. First, all of them failed to provide medical assistance to Floyd as he was dying. Second, Lane and Kueng made misleading omissions, while Kueng also lied to investigators in the immediate aftermath of Floyd’s death. Drilling down on these facts reveals specific paths forward for state prosecutors even when a direct investigation of the killings is blocked.

Evidence of both these two kinds of crimes has already emerged in the two recent ICE killings. After Good was shot, ICE agents blocked a physician from aiding her. Minnesota law not only imposes misdemeanor liability for failures to aid in general, but in shooting cases obligates the person who fired the wounding shot to “render immediate reasonable assistance.” When a shooting victim then dies, penalties in Minnesota for failing to aid the injured person can involve up to two years’ imprisonment.

In the Pretti case, the alleged obstruction of key evidence-gathering steps gives state prosecutors another potent opening, especially because ICE agents acted in overt defiance of a judicial warrant. Minnesota has a criminal obstruction-of-justice statute that applies to situations in which someone prevents a police officer or other agents from carrying out their official duties. You don’t get much more official than executing a judicial warrant. Concealing evidence after the fact is a separate offense that also fits what is publicly known about both the Good and Pretti cases. The resulting criminal penalties would attach to anyone who conspired in that concealment. This could reach more senior figures within the administration who acted to hinder justice by using lies and slander to deflect responsibility and—worse—to score political points from the deaths.

Minnesota, and other blue states, should also enact new laws that make federal obstruction harder. The Pretti case shows that ICE officials were willing to ignore a state-court warrant. Perhaps anticipating that, Minnesota officials went to federal court on Saturday, potentially after the scene of Pretti’s shooting had been compromised, and obtained a temporary restraining order about evidence preservation. The legal basis for such orders, however, may be fragile. Minnesota and other states would thus do well to shore up their capacity to get a rapid federal-court injunction against evidence tampering. For rather technical reasons, there is a very specific way to make sure this possibility is always available: Enact a law that allows a state’s attorney to seek damages of more than $75,000 against anyone who has violated the constitutional rights of a Minnesota citizen. Then allow the state’s attorney to file suit in federal court, and to expeditiously seek a bench warrant to preserve evidence. In practical effect, this would be a device to transform ICE’s obstruction into not just a violation of state law, but also of a federal-court order.

Criminal liability by its nature comes too late to stop harms from happening. States such as Minnesota should also look to civil law as a basis for stopping baleful and unlawful ICE tactics. This also requires some creative thinking—taking a legal tool designed for other purposes and fitting it to our new reality.

Many states have what’s called a public-nuisance law. This allows the state to go to court and get an injunction against the use of a property in ways that disrupt life for many around it, such as, for example, if a quarry produces noise and vibrations that make it hard for those in the neighborhood to sleep, or if the odors of a feedlot make using a particular street intolerable. States have reached beyond this sort of historical usage recently, employing public-nuisance laws creatively even when the problem is not tied to one specific piece of land. For instance, they have brought public-nuisance suits against opioid makers, gun sellers, companies responsible for lead contamination, and Confederate monuments. Public-nuisance law has proved a malleable stopgap when other kinds of regulation fail.

It’s not a big leap to see an application here. If fentanyl production or the existence of a Jefferson Davis statue can be legally deemed public nuisances, why can’t a deluge of violent, masked, and armed people flooding the streets of a city, maiming, brutalizing, and even killing along the way? This deluge is perhaps even closer to a classic public nuisance because it involves an activity that impedes the safe and orderly use of public streets.

Minnesota’s public-nuisance law has a useful wrinkle—one that other states worried about prospective ICE deployments would do well to imitate. It allows attorneys for the state to obtain injunctions against a “criminal gang.” A gang, in Minnesota law, is simply “any” group of people who repeatedly violate certain criminal laws. It doesn’t matter whether they work for the Latin Kings or Stephen Miller. What matters is that they create an ongoing risk of violent harm to the public.

A public-nuisance injunction could focus on specific people or tactics, or sweep more broadly. Such an injunction, moreover, would single out ICE officers’ unlawful, violent acts, as distinct from the lawful performance of official duties. Though certain immunities for federal officials are recognized, it is hard to see why they would apply to a public-nuisance injunction focused on lawless acts. That said, there’s no guarantee here: The Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts has shown itself willing to create new and unprecedented legal immunities for federal misconduct without a scintilla of historical support. It could always do so here too.

To be clear, a public nuisance suit would face daunting odds. It might seem implausible on its face to say ICE is a “nuisance,” especially before one accounts for the Good and Pretti killings. But states need to reach for every possible tool to meet the moment. And the legal theory behind a public-nuisance ICE injunction stands on firmer ground than the Tenth Amendment suits filed in recent weeks by Minnesota and Illinois. Unlike these constitutional cases, a public-nuisance complaint flexes a well-recognized and historically based exercise of state sovereignty. True, its application is novel. But that simply tells us that we live in a moment of new political challenges.

Until now, states and cities have been in denial about those challenges. They have not grasped the profound and potentially irreversible rupture in federal-state relations that’s under way. They have moved slowly, encumbered by a belief that a reversion to the old ways of federal-state cooperation might still be possible. The killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti—and the federal response to those killings—ought to put this lingering nostalgia to rest. A return to the days of state-federal cooperation will not happen unless the states reassert themselves to protect their citizens and punish federal lawlessness.</div>

            <h2>South Carolina Is America’s New Measles Norm</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/measles-elimination-south-carolina/685773/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, starting in January, the United States experienced its largest documented measles outbreak in more than three decades, when an epidemic centered on West Texas sickened at least 762 people. Now a fast-moving outbreak in South Carolina seems poised to surpass it: Local officials have logged 700 infections, and the virus is still rapidly spreading.

As public-health officials scramble to contain the virus, they’re also trying to figure out whether these two outbreaks are connected—specifically, whether the version of the pathogen that kick-started the West Texas cases has been circulating within the nation’s borders ever since. If the answer is yes, it will mean that measles has once again become a permanent resident of this country, after 26 years of only limited outbreaks imported from abroad. Given that the U.S. clocked more than 2,200 measles cases in 2025—more than it has had in a single year since 1991—the experts I spoke with already consider this the reality that Americans are living in. One of the fastest-spreading viral diseases ever documented has once again become a routine threat.

At this point, researchers are working to find the connective tissue among some of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. within the past year, including the ones centered in West Texas, Utah, Arizona, and South Carolina. Technically, the epidemics still could have been caused by separate reintroductions of measles from at least one international source. But “that’s a hard stretch,” Robert Bednarczyk, a global-health researcher and epidemiologist at Emory’s Rollins School of Public Health, told me. The most likely and so far best-supported scenario, he said, is also the simplest one—that the virus spread so fiercely and quickly through these communities that it was able to hitch a ride elsewhere in the country when infected people traveled.

If further evidence proves that scenario true, the Pan American Health Organization could strip the U.S. of its official measles-elimination status—which the country has held since 2000—at a meeting scheduled for April. (A country achieves elimination status when it can show that the virus hasn’t been circulating for 12 consecutive months; it loses the status when researchers show that measles has been spreading for a year straight.) Already, PAHO has publicly confirmed that scientists have found the same strain of measles in Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, and South Carolina, as well as in Canada, Mexico, and multiple other North American countries. (In response to a request for comment, a PAHO spokesperson clarified that although these detections had been made, the committee was still seeking further evidence.)

Health officials also recently announced that South Carolina’s outbreak has seeded cases elsewhere, including Washington State. Still, the case for measles’ continuous transmission can’t yet be considered a slam dunk. To prove it definitively, researchers will need to show that geographically distant outbreaks in the U.S. are epidemiologically linked and that there is not   sufficient evidence suggesting that the virus bounced back and forth between countries.

Two types of information are essential to these investigations. First, researchers look into the travel histories of infected people, who might have brought the virus from one state to another. Second, they compare genetic sequences pulled from the virus across locations. Measles mutates slowly enough that researchers can in many cases search for essentially the same strain when tracking its movements. But the virus does accumulate some changes in its genome, and the further apart two cases are in time, the more genetically distinct their genetic material should be. If measles was being continuously transmitted, scientists might expect to see slightly different iterations of the virus racking up mutations as it traveled, say, from Texas to South Carolina. If measles had been introduced separately to those locations, the sequences pulled from each state might more closely resemble genetic information from an international source, Pavitra Roychoudhury, a pathogen-genomics expert at the University of Washington, told me.

But some of the data that officials need may be lacking. For months, experts have been concerned that the U.S. has been severely undercounting its measles cases and that the virus had been circulating in some communities long before it was officially detected. Cases of the disease can be easy to miss, Helen Chu, an immunologist at the University of Washington, told me. The early days of measles are usually marked by common symptoms such as fever and cough; to the untrained eye, the virus’s rash can look like many of the reddish, patchy blemishes that many other pathogens cause. The overwhelming majority of measles cases in the U.S. have also concentrated in communities that have low vaccination rates, which often have less access to medical care and the sort of testing that would also collect viral samples. Many people who deliberately decline vaccination for their families are also skeptical of seeking medical care in general, or of public-health officials investigating outbreaks.

With inconsistent data, researchers may be left sorting through genetic sequences that neither point clearly to one another nor obviously implicate separate sources. “There’s a judgment call in that gray area,” William Moss, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told me. “How different is different?” The last time measles spread endemically in the United States, this sort of genomic analysis was not commonplace.

Should PAHO find that measles is spreading concertedly in the U.S. again, the nation’s leaders may shrug off the change. At times, top officials at the Department of Health and Human Services appear to have dismissed the notion of continuous spread: In November, Jim O’Neill, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s deputy and the CDC’s acting director, posted on social media that “preliminary genomic analysis suggests the Utah and Arizona cases are not directly linked to Texas.” (Neither the Trump administration nor PAHO has released the details about the data it reviewed or how similar any identified strains are.) And last week, the CDC’s new Principal Deputy Director Ralph Abraham described the prospect of the U.S. losing its measles-elimination status as “just the cost of doing business with our borders being somewhat porous for global and international travel.” Certain communities, he added, “choose to be unvaccinated. That’s their personal freedom.”

In an email, Emily G. Hilliard, HHS’s press secretary, echoed Abraham’s comments, describing current outbreaks as “largely concentrated in close-knit, under-vaccinated communities with prevalent international travel that raises the risk of measles importation,” and noting that the United States still has a lower measles burden than Canada, Mexico, and much of Europe do.

In practice, the April decision will be a matter of semantics. Whatever the outcome, the U.S. has been weathering a worsening measles situation for years now, as vaccination rates have ticked down and outbreaks have grown larger and more common. In the past year, the Trump administration has made it substantially more difficult for local public-health-response teams to address and contain outbreaks too. HHS reportedly delayed communications from the CDC to officials in West Texas and held back federal funds to fight the outbreak for two months. More recently, HHS pledged to send $1.4 million to address South Carolina’s outbreak, though it began months ago. (One recent analysis suggests that measles outbreaks of this scale can cost upwards of $10 million.) The administration has repeatedly downplayed the benefits of immunization, while exaggerating the importance of nutritional supplementation for combatting measles. Kennedy has also spent decades repeating disproved claims that vaccines such as the measles-mumps-rubella immunization can cause autism. (Hilliard wrote that Kennedy has consistently said that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles, but she also emphasized in her email that people should consult with health-care providers about whether vaccination is best for their family.)

Should immunity erode further—as experts watching the Trump administration’s actions expect it to—measles will find it even easier to move across the country, until epidemics bleed so thoroughly together that their links become irrefutable. Already, the nation’s leaders have made clear where the U.S. stands on measles: It is an acceptable norm.</div>

            <h2>George Saunders Brings Morality Back to Fiction</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/george-saunders-moral-novel-vigil/685772/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It was once commonly understood that fiction was in the wisdom business, that it offered not only aesthetic pleasure but also moral improvement. This function of literature was not tough to spot. One of the first English novels was Samuel Richardson’s 1740 work, Pamela: Or, Virtue Rewarded—a title not meant ironically. Through the 19th century, many authors turned directly to the reader with philosophical and social (if sometimes ironic) commentary: “It is a truth universally acknowledged”; “It was the best of times”; “All happy families are alike.” For readers not up to the challenge of full George Eliot novels, her enterprising publisher compiled a volume of Eliot’s many Wise, Witty, and Tender Sayings, in order to more broadly distribute “a morality as pure as it is impassioned.”

Such open authorial musing, and maybe literature’s wisdom-seeking function itself, has been out of vogue during the past century of show-don’t-tell storytelling. Although this has surely spared us some clunky sermonizing, it has brought downsides as well. Too many writers seem to have overlooked what I consider to be a key piece of the mission. I can’t tell you how many novels I’ve abandoned in the belief that the writer has nothing to teach me—and, worse, is not even trying to learn. Over the past couple of years, as the evident decline of literary reading has been blamed on the ubiquity of smartphones or the supposed withdrawal of men, I’ve suspected that some readers might be tuning out fiction (or turning to the classics over contemporary work) for another reason: the sense that today’s novelists are not aiming to help with the practical matter of how to live.

George Saunders is an eminent exception to contemporary literature’s broader retreat from wisdom-seeking. The Booker-winning and best-selling author has not embedded direct, Eliot-style philosophizing within his fiction, but he is distinctive for thoroughly embracing the role of moral guide—and for seeing his preacher-writer role resonate with an unusually large audience. His fiction has always had an ethical thrust, at its strongest in inventive and often brilliant short stories that channel the economically weak and exploited. And Saunders’s enterprising publisher has lately offered his wise, witty, and tender sayings in stand-alone works: Congratulations, by the Way was adapted from a graduation speech enjoining kindness; A Swim in a Pond in the Rain is a version of his Syracuse University course about Russian writers who, he explains, “regard fiction not as something decorative but as a vital moral-ethical tool.” In A Swim, Saunders has given grateful critics a tidy summary of his message: “that every human being is worthy of attention and that the origins of every good and evil capability of the universe may be found by observing a single, even very humble, person and the turnings of his or her mind.”

Amen. I mean that sincerely. So it was with some disappointment that I discovered that Saunders’s new novel, Vigil—although showcasing his great gifts for voice, farce, and tick-tick-tick plotting—suffers from the all-too-human foible of claiming high ideals while failing to actually abide by them. As in some too-pious novels of earlier eras, Vigil’s abundantly clear moral vision is enabled only by dodging the hardest ethical (and artistic) problem: the pragmatic task of fitting our morals to the confounding reality of human experience.

Like Lincoln in the Bardo, Saunders’s other novel, Vigil is set on the spooky cusp between life and death. The narrator, Jill, is essentially a supernatural priest—a ghost whose task is to swoop into the minds of the dying to provide “comfort” and “elevation” before judgment is rendered. Murdered at age 22, Jill has, after inhabiting and forgiving her murderer, reached a special state of being: “vast, unlimited in the range and delicacy of my voice, unrestrained in love, rapid in apprehension, skillful in motion, capable, equally, of traversing, within a few seconds’ time, a mile or ten thousand miles.” (Never has a novelist found a tidier vehicle for his own mission.) Jill has learned in her elevated state to see every individual as “an inevitable occurrence,” a fated being with choices “so severely delimited” that what feels like free will is actually “a sort of lavish jailing.”

Jill’s “charge,” her new assignment, is an oil tycoon named K. J. Boone, who at 87 is dying of cancer and past the point of speech. In the novel’s first pages, Jill observes a wall of photos: Boone on oil rigs, at his many homes, and “leaning confidently against a podium, speaking to a tremendous crowd.” When she enters his mind, she finds “a steady flow of satisfaction, even triumph.” She scans for doubts and mistakes but finds “nothing, or nearly nothing. He was as sure of himself as ever a charge of mine had been.”

It was an odd thing to finish Vigil feeling that an oil tycoon had been treated unfairly. Saunders has for decades critiqued capitalist systems, but still, I figured I knew where this deathbed visitation must go: As Jill observed the turnings of Boone’s mind, she would uncover the self-satisfied titan’s hidden nobility and frailty; meanwhile, Boone would confront his uncertainties and failings, and the false caricatures at the novel’s start would by the end give way to a nuanced, proportionate truth.

What happens instead is more like a mobbing. Boone is relentlessly hounded by figments of his guilty memory, by other ghosts, and by his daughter—all of whom emphasize his nefarious role in delaying action to combat climate change. The lead ghost campaigner, a slapstick Frenchman, pelts Boone with apparitions: odd weather patterns, extinct birds, a starved man from a decimated Indian village. Boone’s daughter, praying at his bedside, veers into thinking about a documentary that one of her “libdope” friends tricked her into watching, which left her greatly disappointed in her father. Boone refuses chance after chance to admit error.

Although the prosecution of Boone is, characteristically of Saunders, often funny and sometimes moving, it is also unmistakably unkind. Saunders seems unwilling to convey Boone’s more sympathetic attributes without some swift reminder that he’s a bastard. Boone is self-made, but his memories of a dirt-poor childhood are undercut, one page later, by a scene in which he berates his employees and enjoys it. We see Boone snap at his “chubby bimbo” oncology nurse, call Jill a “stupid bitch,” and repeatedly insist that in his whole life, he “had done nothing wrong, not a goddamn thing,” and that anyone who suggests otherwise is an “idiot.” Of his exceptional professional success—Boone’s entire career—we are told only that “it had all been accomplished” with “work, hard work, but no real struggle. Up, up, up he went” and “never along the way had there been a moment of hesitation or doubt” until these “losers, trivial people,” began to “piss and moan” about climate change.

Read: ‘The Moron Factory,’ a short story by George Saunders

Boone’s major crime is, rather than selling oil to a world hungry for it, an act of dishonesty—largely a lie of omission. Although his company’s internal data showed a warming planet, Boone gave speeches, funded research, and sponsored lobbying and advertising campaigns to muddle the scientific consensus and delay regulatory action. This is an interesting choice of sin, because the failure to cop to inconvenient truths is precisely the cardinal sin of Vigil itself: the refusal to let Jill or Boone become more complex than cartoons.

Jill remains impossibly sentimental and pure of heart, even as she grows horrified by Boone and considers abandoning her effort to comfort him. As for Boone, we might invoke the Russians. Saul Bellow once wrote that what made Dostoyevsky a great novelist was his understanding that “the writer’s convictions, perhaps fanatically held, must be tamed by truth.” It seems to me that Saunders’s perhaps fanatical loathing of oil executives—Boone bears many similarities, in particular, to former Exxon CEO Lee Raymond—was not here tamed by the reality of how people find their roles in the world and justify the (sometimes villainous) choices those roles might require. Saunders proffers no evidence that Boone, say, wrestled with the responsibilities of leadership, or was charming or generous, or cared to do anything with other people but dominate them. One truth of which Vigil seems deliberately oblivious is that many of those who inspire confidence and deference, as Boone did, have something going for them. But the book cannot credit Boone with commonplace human thoughtfulness. Even his allies damn him by association: His fond daughter’s prayers reveal her to be a haughty, materialistic racist, and the ghosts of his former collaborators are transparently demonic, letting loose “hellish cackling laughter” at the memory of duping the public. I had the feeling of watching a show trial in which the defense, under the gaze of a stern commissar, has been forbidden to make a case.

I will avoid spoiling the precise mechanics of the ending, except to say that the reader’s satisfaction in Jill’s ultimate choice depends on a familiar idea that even the worst sinners deserve another chance—as long as they confess. This might be an ordinary perspective for a priest, but it felt strangely authoritarian for a fiction writer. Vigil’s lesson appears to be that right is right, wrong is wrong, and the primary challenge of virtuous living lies not in discerning or applying wisdom but rather in mustering, from a state of completed revelation, the grace to admit and forgive crystal-clear sins. The confidence of Vigil’s final judgment seems out of step with Saunders’s view, as stated in A Swim, that “the aim of art” is “to ask the big questions” such as: “How are we supposed to be living down here?”

I should at this point concede that I enjoyed every swift page of Vigil’s prose. It is stuffed with lively wit and striking images, and I was delighted as usual by Saunders’s ability, like that of Hollywood’s defter practitioners, to rib himself and winkingly manipulate his tropes. But I was taken aback by the malice of staging a deathbed inquisition that reduces the decedent, whatever his offenses, to cliché. I would argue, if I might preach at Saunders for a moment, that the most sacred duty of the writer is to do full justice—to inhabit, alongside even maddening wickedness, a charitable understanding of the way a person sees himself—and that to do so is much kinder than merely offering a caricatured figure a shot at avoiding eternal torment.

Saunders has done far better, in Lincoln and in stories such as “Pastoralia” and “The Semplica-Girl Diaries,” both at depicting the morally compromised and at humanely deflating the apparently righteous. My disappointment in Vigil came down to the waste of a perfect setup for exhibiting the worldly redemption of art—that is, its power to redeem us from insensitivity and self-satisfaction. Maybe despite Saunders’s best intentions, the novel instead stubbornly insists on a brutal worldview in which the way someone first appears turns out to be exactly how they are. In such a world, literature cannot serve much moral purpose. Perhaps it is an inevitable occurrence, as Jill would put it, that with age and eminence, we become a bit too firm in our judgments. Thank goodness, then, that so much can be forgiven.

            <div id="article-text">Updated at 11:01 a.m. ET on January 27, 2026

It took only a few minutes before everyone in the church knew that another person had been shot. I was sitting with Trygve Olsen, a big man in a wool hat and puffy vest, who lifted his phone to show me a text with the news. It was his 50th birthday, and one of the coldest days of the year. I asked him whether he was doing anything special to celebrate. “What should I be doing?” he replied. “Should I sit at home and open presents? This is where I’m supposed to be.”

He had come to Iglesia Cristiana La Viña Burnsville, about 15 miles south of the Twin Cities, to pick up food for families who are too afraid to go out—some have barely left home since federal immigration agents deployed to Minnesota two months ago. The church was filled with pallets of frozen meat and vegetables, diapers, fruit, and toilet paper. Outside, a man wearing a leather biker vest bearing the insignia of the Latin American Motorcycle Association, his blond beard flecked with ice crystals, directed a line of cars through the snow.

The man who had been shot—fatally, we later learned—was Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse who had been recording agents outside a doughnut shop. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security claimed that he had threatened agents with a gun; videos of the shooting show him holding only his phone when he is pushed down by masked federal agents and beaten, his licensed sidearm removed from its holster by one agent before another unloads several shots into his back. Pretti’s death was a reminder—if anyone in Minnesota still needed one—that people had reason to be hiding, and that those trying to help them, protect them, or protest on their behalf had reason to be scared.

The church has a mostly Hispanic and working-class flock. Its pastor, Miguel Aviles, who goes by Pastor Miguel, told me that it had sent out about 2,000 packages of food since the federal agents had arrived. Many of the people in hiding, he said, “have asylum cases pending. They already have work permits and stuff, but some of them are legal residents and still they’re afraid to go out. Because of their skin color, they are afraid to go out.”

Federal agents have arrested about 3,000 people in the state, but they have released the names of only about 240 of those detained, leaving unclear how many of the larger number have committed any crimes. Many more thousands of people have been affected by the arrests and the fear they have instilled. Minnesota Public Radio estimates that in school districts “with widespread federal activity, as many as 20 to 40 percent of students have been absent in recent weeks.”

I don’t know what the feds expected when they surged into Minnesota. In late November, The New York Times reported on a public-benefit fraud scheme in the state that was executed mainly by people of Somali descent. Federal prosecutors under the Biden administration had already indicted dozens of people, but after the Times story broke, President Trump began ranting about Somalis, whom he referred to as “garbage”; declared that he didn’t want Somali immigrants in the country; and announced that he was sending thousands of armed federal immigration agents to Minneapolis. This weekend, he posted on social media that the agents were there because of “massive monetary fraud.” The real reason may be that a majority of Minnesotans did not vote for him. Trump has said that “I won Minnesota three times, and I didn’t get credit for it. That’s a crooked state.” He has never won Minnesota.

Perhaps the Trump-administration officials had hoped that a few rabble-rousers would get violent, justifying the kind of crackdown he seems to fantasize about. Maybe they had assumed that they would find only a caricature of “the resistance”—people who seethed about Trump online but would be unwilling to do anything to defend themselves against him.

Instead, what they discovered in the frozen North was something different: a real resistance, broad and organized and overwhelmingly nonviolent, the kind of movement that emerges only under sustained attacks by an oppressive state. Tens of thousands of volunteers—at the very least—are risking their safety to defend their neighbors and their freedom. They aren’t looking for attention or likes on social media. Unless they are killed by federal agents, as Pretti and Renee Good were, other activists do not even necessarily know their names. Many use a handle or code name out of fear of government retaliation. Their concerns are justified: A number of people working as volunteers or observers told me that they had been trailed home by ICE agents, and some of their communications have already been infiltrated, screenshotted, and posted online, forcing them to use new text chains and code names. One urgent question among observers, as the videos of Pretti’s killing spread, was what his handle might have been.

Olsen had originally used the handle “Redbear” in communicating with me, but later said I could name him. He had agreed to let me ride along while he did his deliveries. As he loaded up his truck with supplies, he wore just a long-sleeved red shirt and vest, apparently unfazed by the Minnesota cold.

“This is my first occupation,” Olsen said as I climbed into the truck. “Welcome to the underground, I guess.”

The number of Minnesotans resisting the federal occupation is so large that relatively few could be characterized as career activists. They are ordinary Americans—people with jobs, moms and dads, friends and neighbors. They can be divided into roughly three groups.

The largest is the protesters, who show up at events such as Friday’s march in downtown Minneapolis, and at the airport, where deportation flights take off. Many protesters have faced tear gas and pepper spray, and below-zero temperatures—during the Twin Cities march on Friday, I couldn’t take notes; the ink in my pens had frozen.

Then there are the people who load up their car with food, toiletries, and school supplies from churches or schools to take to families in hiding. They also help families who cannot work meet their rent or mortgage payments. In addition to driving around with Olsen, I rode along with a Twin Cities mom of young kids named Amanda as she did deliveries (she asked me to use only her first name). Riding in her small car—her back row was taken up by three child seats and a smattering of stray toys—she told me that she’d gotten involved after more than 100 students at her kids’ elementary school simply stopped coming in. Parents got organized to provide the families with food, to shepherd their kids to school, and to arrange playdates for those stuck inside.

Amanda’s father and husband are immigrants, she said, and she speaks Spanish. “I can be a conduit between those who want to help and those who need help,” she told me. She calls each family before knocking on the door, so they don’t have to worry that they are being tricked by ICE. At one home, a woman asked us to go around back because a suspicious vehicle was idling out front. At another home, a little girl in pigtails beamed as Amanda handed her a Target bag full of school supplies.

Finally, there are those most at risk of coming into violent contact with federal agents, a group that’s come to be popularly known as ICE Watch, although the designation is unofficial—as far as I can tell, you’re in ICE Watch if you watch ICE. These are the whistle-wielding pedestrians and drivers calling themselves “observers” or “commuters” who patrol for federal agents (usually identifiable by their SUVs with out-of-state plates) and alert the neighborhood to their presence. Pretti and Good, the two Minneapolis residents killed by federal agents, fit in this category.

Trump-administration officials and MAGA influencers have repeatedly called these activists “violent” and said they are involved in “riots.” But the resistance in Minnesota is largely characterized by a conscious, strategic absence of physical confrontation. Activists have made the decision to emphasize protection, aid, and observation. When matters escalate, it is usually the choice of the federal agents. Of the three homicides in Minneapolis this year, two were committed by federal agents.

“There’s been an incredible, incredible response from the community. I’ve seen our neighbors go straight from allies to family—more than family—checking in on each other, offering food and rides for kids and all kinds of support, alerting each other if there’s ICE or any kind of danger,” Malika Dahir, a local activist of Somali descent, told me.

If the Minnesota resistance has an overarching ideology, you could call it “neighborism”—a commitment to protecting the people around you, no matter who they are or where they came from. The contrast with the philosophy guiding the Trump administration couldn’t be more extreme. Vice President Vance has said that “it is totally reasonable and acceptable for American citizens to look at their next-door neighbors and say, ‘I want to live next to people who I have something in common with. I don’t want to live next to four families of strangers.’” Minnesotans are insisting that their neighbors are their neighbors whether they were born in Minneapolis or Mogadishu. That is, arguably, a deeply Christian philosophy, one apparently loathed by some of the most powerful Christians in America.

On Wednesday, I met with two volunteers who went by the handles “Green Bean” and “Cobalt.” They picked me up in the parking lot of a Target, not far from where Good was killed two weeks earlier. Cobalt works in tech but has recently been spending more time on patrol than at her day job. Green Bean is a biologist, but she told me the grant that had been funding her work hadn’t been renewed under the Trump administration. Neither of them had imagined doing what they were doing now. “I’m supposed to be creeping around in the woods looking at insects,” Green Bean said.

Most commuters work in pairs—a co-pilot listens in on a dispatcher who provides the locations of ICE encounters and can run plates through a database of cars that federal agents have used in the past. Green Bean explained what happens when they identify an ICE vehicle. (Both ICE and Border Patrol are in Minneapolis, but everyone just calls them ICE.) The commuters will follow the agents, honking loudly, until they leave the neighborhood or stop and get out.

The commuters—as my colleague Robert Worth reported—do not have a centralized leadership but have been trained by local activist groups that have experience from past protests against police killings, and recent immigration-enforcement sweeps in L.A. and Chicago. The observers are taught to conscientiously follow the law, including traffic rules, and to try to avoid physical confrontation with federal agents.

If the agents detain someone, the observers will try to get that person’s name so they can inform the family. But ICE prefers to make arrests—which the ICE Watchers call “abductions”—quietly. More often than not, Green Bean said, when these volunteers draw attention, the agents will “leave rather than dig in.” She added, “They are huge pussies, I will be honest.”

As we cruised through the Powderhorn neighborhood, practically every business had an ICE OUT sign in the window. Graffiti trashing ICE was everywhere, as were posters of Good labeled AMERICAN MOM KILLED BY ICE. Listening to the dispatcher, Cobalt relayed directions to Green Bean about the locations of ICE vehicles, commuters who had been boxed in or threatened by agents, and possible “abductions.”

About 30 minutes into the patrol, Green Bean saw a white Jeep Wagoneer with out-of-state plates and read out the numbers. “Confirmed ICE,” Cobalt said, and we began following the Wagoneer as it drove through the neighborhood. Another car of commuters joined us, making as much noise as possible.

After about 10 minutes, the Wagoneer got onto the highway. Green Bean followed until we could be sure that it wasn’t doubling back to the neighborhood, and then we turned around.

Most encounters with ICE end like that. But sometimes situations deteriorate—as with Good, who was killed while doing a version of what Green Bean and Cobalt were now doing. The task is stressful for the observers, who understand that even minor encounters can turn deadly.

The next day, I drove around with another pair of commuters who went by “Judy” and “Lime.” Both told me they were anti-Zionist Jews who had been involved in pro-Palestinian and Black Lives Matter protests. Lime’s day job is with an abortion-rights organization, and Judy is a rabbi. “I did protective presence in the West Bank,” Lime told me, referring to a form of protest in which activists try to deter settler violence by simply being present in Palestinian communities. “This is very similar.”

About an hour into our drive, we came across an ICE truck. Judy started blaring the horn, and I heard her mutter to herself: “We’re just driving, we’re just driving, which is legal. I hate this.” I asked them both if they were scared. “I do not feel scared, but I probably should,” Lime said.

Judy said she had been out on patrol days after Good was killed, and had gotten boxed in and yelled at by federal agents. “It was very scary,” Judy told me. “Murdering someone definitely works as an intimidation tactic. You just have no idea what is going to happen.” She said that ICE agents had taken a picture of her license plate and then later showed up at her house, leaning out of their car to take another picture—making it clear to Judy that they knew who she was.

Green Bean had told me the same thing—that agents had come to her house, followed her when she left, and then blocked her vehicle and screamed at her to “stop fucking following us. This is your last warning.” Green Bean was able to laugh while retelling this. “I just stared at them until they left,” she said.

We drove past Good’s memorial. Tributes to her—flowers and letters—were still there, covered in a light powder of snow. We didn’t yet know at the time that residents would soon set up another memorial, for Pretti.

The broad nature of the civil resistance in Minnesota should not lead anyone to believe that no one there supports what ICE is doing. Plenty of people do. Trump came close to winning the state in 2024, and many people here, especially outside the Twin Cities, believe the administration’s rhetoric about targeting “the worst of the worst,” despite what the actual statistics reveal.

“You don’t have to go too far south” to find places where Minnesotans “welcome ICE into their restaurants and bars and sort of love what they do,” Tom Jenkins, the lead pastor of Mount Cavalry Lutheran Church in suburban Eagan, which is also helping with food drives, told me. “A lot of people are still cheering ICE on because they don’t think that whatever people are telling them or showing them is real.”

Although most of the coverage has understandably focused on the cities, suburban residents told me that they had seen operations all over the state. “There are mobile homes not far from where I live,” Jenkins said. Agents “were there every day, you know: 10, 15, 20 agents working the bus stops and bus drop-offs.” He added: “They’re all over.”

Even among those involved in opposing ICE in Minnesota, people have a range of political views. The nonviolent nature of the movement, and the focus on caring for neighbors, has drawn in volunteers with many different perspectives on immigration, including people who might have been supportive if the Trump administration’s claims of a targeted effort to deport violent criminals had been sincere.

“One of the things that I believe, and I know most of the Latino community agrees, is that we want the bad people out. We want the criminals out,” Pastor Miguel, who immigrated from Mexico 30 years ago, told me. “All of us came here looking for a better life for us and for our children. So when we have criminals, rapists—when we have people who have done horrible things in our streets, in our communities—we are afraid of them. We don’t want them here.”

The problem is that federal agents are not going after just criminals. Growing distraught, Pastor Miguel said that one of the men who helped organize the food drive, a close friend of his who he believed had legal status, had been picked up by federal agents the day before I visited.

“I just—I didn’t have words,” he said. “And yet I cannot crumble; I cannot fall. Because all these families also need us.”

Two days after Pretti was killed, my colleague Nick Miroff broke the news that Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official who had led the operation in Minneapolis, would be leaving the city and replaced by Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan. Bovino, strutting around in body armor or his distinctive long coat, seemed to relish his role as a villain to his critics, encouraging aggressive tactics by federal agents and sometimes engaging in them himself. The day I accompanied Green Bean and Cobalt, Bovino fumbled with a gas canister before throwing it into a sparse crowd of protesters.

Bovino’s departure seemed an admission that Minnesotans aren’t the only Americans who won’t tolerate more deaths at the hands of federal agents. The people of Minnesota have forced the Trump administration into a strategic retreat—one inflicted not as rioters or insurgents, but as neighbors.

After Friday’s protest, when thousands marched in frigid downtown Minneapolis, chanting, “No Trump, no troops, Twin Cities ain’t licking boots!” I spoke with a young protester named Ethan McFarland, who told me that his parents are immigrants from Uganda. He had recently asked his mother to show him her immigration papers, in case she got picked up. This kind of state oppression, he said, is exactly what his mother was “trying to get away from” when she came to the United States.

McFarland’s remarks reminded me of something Stephen Miller, the Trump adviser, had written: “Migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands.” In Minnesota, the opposite was happening. The “conditions and terrors” of immigrants’ “broken homelands” weren’t being re-created by immigrants. They were being re-created by people like Miller. The immigrants simply have the experience to recognize them.

The federal surge into Minneapolis reflects a series of mistaken MAGA assumptions. The first is the belief that diverse communities aren’t possible: “Social bonds form among people who have something in common,” Vance said in a speech last July. “If you stop importing millions of foreigners into the country, you allow social cohesion to form naturally.” Vance’s remarks are the antithesis to the neighborism of the Twin Cities, whose people do not share the narcissism of being capable of loving only those who are exactly like them.

A second MAGA assumption is that the left is insincere in its values, and that principles of inclusion and unity are superficial forms of virtue signaling. White liberals might put a sign in their front yard saying IMMIGRANTS WELCOME, but they will abandon those immigrants at the first sensation of sustained pressure.

And in Trump’s defense, this has turned out to be true of many liberals in positions of power—university administrators, attorneys at white-shoe law firms, political leaders. But it is not true of millions of ordinary Americans, who have poured into the streets in protest, spoken out against the administration, and, in Minnesota, resisted armed men in masks at the cost of their own life.

The MAGA faith in liberal weakness has been paired with the conviction that real men—Trump’s men—are conversely strong. Consider Miller’s bizarre meltdown while addressing Memphis police in October. “The gangbangers that you deal with—they think that they’re ruthless? They have no idea how ruthless we are. They think they’re tough? They have no idea how tough we are,” Miller said. “They think they’re hard-core? We are so much more hard-core than they are.” Around this time, Miller moved his family onto a military base—for safety reasons.

The federal agents sent to Minnesota wear body armor and masks, and bear long guns and sidearms. But their skittishness and brutality are qualities associated with fear, not resolve. It takes far more courage to stare down the barrel of a gun while you’re armed with only a whistle and a phone than it does to point a gun at an unarmed protester.

Every social theory undergirding Trumpism has been broken on the steel of Minnesotan resolve. The multiracial community in Minneapolis was supposed to shatter. It did not. It held until Bovino was forced out of the Twin Cities with his long coat between his legs.

The secret fear of the morally depraved is that virtue is actually common, and that they’re the ones who are alone. In Minnesota, all of the ideological cornerstones of MAGA have been proved false at once. Minnesotans, not the armed thugs of ICE and the Border Patrol, are brave. Minnesotans have shown that their community is socially cohesive—because of its diversity and not in spite of it. Minnesotans have found and loved one another in a world atomized by social media, where empty men have tried to fill their lonely soul with lies about their own inherent superiority. Minnesotans have preserved everything worthwhile about “Western civilization,” while armed brutes try to tear it down by force.

No matter how many more armed men Trump sends to impose his will on the people of Minnesota, all he can do is accentuate their valor. No application of armed violence can make the men with guns as heroic as the people who choose to stand in their path with empty hands in defense of their neighbors. These agents, and the president who sent them, are no one’s heroes, no one’s saviors—just men with guns who have to hide their faces to shoot a mom in the face, and a nurse in the back.</div>

            <h2>Greg Bovino Loses His Job</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/greg-bovino-demoted-minneapolis-border-patrol/685770/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Gregory Bovino has been removed from his role as Border Patrol “commander at large” and will return to his former job in El Centro, California, where he is expected to retire soon, according to a DHS official and two people with knowledge of the change.

Bovino’s sudden demotion is the clearest sign yet that the Trump administration is reconsidering its most aggressive tactics after the killing Saturday of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents under Bovino’s command.

Earlier today, President Trump appeared to signal in a series of social-media posts a tactical shift in the administration’s mass-deportation campaign. Trump wrote that he spoke with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz—whom the White House has blamed for inciting violence—and the two men are now on “a similar wavelength.” Tom Homan, the former ICE chief whom Trump has designated “border czar,” will head to Minnesota to assume command of the federal mobilization there, Trump said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and her close adviser Corey Lewandowski, who were Bovino’s biggest backers at DHS, are also at risk of losing their jobs, two of the people told me.

Read: The hype man of Trump’s mass deportations

For the past seven months, Bovino has been the public face of a traveling immigration crackdown on cities governed by Democrats. Noem and other Trump officials gave Bovino the “commander” title and sent him and his masked border agents to Chicago, Charlotte, New Orleans, and then Minneapolis. Bovino became a MAGA social-media star as he traveled the country with his own film crew and used social media to hit back at Democratic politicians and random critics online. Veteran ICE and CBP officials grew more and more uneasy as Bovino worked outside his agency’s chain of command and appeared to relish his role as a political actor.

In Minneapolis, the Trump administration used Bovino as its lead spokesperson, scheduling daily press conferences where he defended agents’ rough tactics and cast blame on protesters and local officials. Border Patrol commanders typically avoid engaging in political arguments with elected officials.

Bovino’s fall comes two days after Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis fatally shot Pretti, an intensive-care nurse who worked with veterans. Hours after the shooting, Bovino appeared at a press conference and echoed statements by the Department of Homeland Security alleging Pretti sought to “massacre” the federal agents. Bovino repeatedly claimed that Border Patrol agents, not Pretti, were the victims.

Videos of the encounter showed no evidence for his claims. Pretti, who was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, did not draw a firearm or attack the agents. The videos show one agent disarming Pretti in the moments just before another agent shot him in the back.

DHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials did not immediately respond to questions about Bovino’s departure from Minnesota and his current role. Asked about Bovino and Noem, a White House spokesperson referred to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s statement today that Noem has the president’s “utmost confidence and trust.”

In another post, Trump said he also spoke with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. “Lots of progress is being made!” the president wrote. “Tom Homan will be meeting with him tomorrow in order to continue the discussion.”</div>

            <h2>What the Administration Is Signaling to Federal Agents After Minnesota</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/01/trump-minnesota-shootings-ice-border-patrol/685771/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Perhaps the most disturbing part of the Trump administration’s immigration operation in Minnesota is not just that agents of the state are killing peacefully protesting citizens on the streets. It’s that they’re doing it with the expectation of impunity, backed by top government officials who are brazenly lying about what happened.

The response from President Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and other officials has sent a clear message: When immigration agents kill peaceful protesters, the government will defend them unconditionally, no matter if clear video evidence contradicts its version of events. It will resist investigating shootings, and it will do everything it can to block probes by other authorities. Vice President Vance has even claimed that federal agents have “absolute immunity” for their actions. This approach all but guarantees more killings.

The culture of impunity runs from the bottom to the top. It includes the federal agents who shot Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, multiple times in Minneapolis on Saturday morning, despite videos that appear to show that the agents had already removed his holstered gun, and despite knowing that many bystanders were filming. (If this is what Border Patrol feels comfortable doing on camera, one can only guess how they might act in private.) It also encompasses the administration officials who offered false accounts immediately, without bothering to wait for the facts.

Videos show Pretti filming officers before being pepper-sprayed and tackled by multiple officers, who then shot him while he was on the ground. Yet the Homeland Security secretary accused Pretti of “domestic terrorism” and said that he’d “attacked” agents, a claim that FBI Director Kash Patel repeated. Noem also said that Pretti had been “brandishing” a gun. (He had been legally carrying a concealed weapon, a right that the administration has previously celebrated.) Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche argued that because Pretti was shouting and had “a phone right up to ICE’s face,” he was not protesting peacefully. The Trump aide Stephen Miller labeled him an “assassin,” and the Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino said that Pretti “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” No known evidence backs any of this up, and videos show that much of it is provably false.

When law-enforcement officers shoot civilians, it is common—if unsavory—for government officials to defend them. The Trump administration has gone far beyond this. Fatal shootings are almost always subject to investigation. After an ICE agent killed Renee Good earlier this month, Blanche (who once was Trump’s personal lawyer) said that the FBI would not launch a civil-rights investigation into the shooting. Instead, MS NOW reported, the Justice Department instructed the FBI to seek a search warrant to investigate Good for possible criminal liability. A federal magistrate rejected the warrant, which is unusual—except that, as the magistrate noted, Good is dead and could not legally be considered a suspect. An FBI agent resigned after she was allegedly pressured to stop pursuing a civil-rights inquiry into the ICE officer, Jonathan Ross, who’d shot Good.

Something similar started to play out immediately after Pretti’s death. Federal agencies seem unsure what, if any, investigation is occurring, according to The Washington Post, although White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said today that DHS and CBP are investigating the Pretti shooting, including reviewing body-cam footage. Federal agents refused to give even “the most basic information” to Minneapolis police at the scene, Chief Brian O’Hara said yesterday, and they initially blocked the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the state’s criminal-investigation office, from accessing the crime scene. The state then went to court and obtained an order from a (Trump-appointed) federal judge blocking the destruction of evidence. That such a move was even necessary is astonishing.

A state-level agency like the BCA has nowhere near the resources or expertise that federal agencies do, and local investigators face legal hurdles when investigating federal agents. Yet administration officials have so clearly declared their position with lies and prejudicial statements that any federal investigation would be suspect from the start—another example of how Trump’s politicization of the Justice Department has undermined its ability to do its job.

Compared with the aftermath of Good’s shooting, more Republicans are expressing concerns about the operation in Minneapolis and Pretti’s killing. Even Trump has vacillated somewhat. He blamed Democrats for Pretti’s death but was noncommittal in a conversation with The Wall Street Journal about whether the agents involved had acted appropriately, in contrast to his quick blaming of Good for her own death. He has since conceded that ICE agents may have made a “mistake” in her case. Vance has also backtracked some, abandoning his claims of “absolute immunity.” (Law-enforcement officers are entitled to what’s known as “qualified immunity,” or protection from liability unless breaking clear legal or constitutional boundaries.)

Even as Republicans grow wary, they have tried to blame Trump’s aides rather than the president himself; Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, for example, lamented that the president was “getting bad advice.” But the culture of impunity proceeds directly from Trump. He has enthusiastically embraced the idea that the federal government should serve his personal whims. He argued that investigations into himself, even for overt offenses such as taking home boxes of sensitive documents, were improper. And he has made clear that when people act to assist him, whether they are aides or January 6 rioters, he will use his clemency powers to protect them from consequences.

Trump has spent years dehumanizing immigrants, exhorting law enforcement to treat suspects more roughly, and attacking the rule of law. The killings in Minnesota aren’t the collateral damage of Trump’s approach to governance. They’re a direct result.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Anyone who thinks the contemplative life amounts to a form of quietism or a retreat from the world’s suffering should spend some time shadowing Joan Halifax, the Zen priest and anthropologist. I’d been curious about Halifax for years, ever since I heard about an annual trek that she leads through the mountains of Nepal, bringing a cadre of doctors and dentists to remote mountain villages with little access to health care.

Each summer over the course of two weeks or so, this Nomads Clinic covers more than 100 miles on foot and horseback, at altitudes of nearly 18,000 feet. These “medical mountaineers,” as they’ve been called, all volunteers, sleep in tents, often in freezing temperatures. But after some 40 annual trips to Nepal—Halifax is normally based in Santa Fe—she recently decided it was time to hang it up.

Watch. Last Saturday’s “Weekend Update” segment (streaming on Peacock) explains how Saturday Night Live benefits from making pop culture a little bit cringe, Michael Tedder writes.

Read. Before her murder made her a true-crime obsession, Elizabeth Short was a real person. Black Dahlia tries to separate truth from myth in the infamous case, Sarah Weinman writes.

Last Wednesday, covering President Trump’s speech at the World Economic Forum, I remarked, “Perhaps the Germans have a word for the experience of watching your country’s leader embarrass himself and the country on the global stage.” Several Germanophone readers wrote in to tell me that, in fact, they do—or at least one that partly captures the feeling. Fremdscham is a term for vicarious embarrassment, a sort of inverse of schadenfreude. I’m going to have to add this one to my vocabulary. Now, if we can only find a way to shoehorn presidential presence into it!

            <div id="article-text">Getting at home deliveries and expanding Whole Foods seems a lot more reasonable than trying to push the just walk out creepiness. No surprised that it wasn&#39;t a winning idea.

Also Amazon as a brand has a negative connotation to most people, but they win out over their competitors because of their shipping rates and speeds. But in the brick and mortar space that has other options that are as equally convenient and less creepy, not surprising that they aren&#39;t keeping up.

No one wanted to be intensely surveilled while shopping?   Never would have thought.   Sure, grocery stores today have tons of cameras (look up!) but typically they only use the footage when they need it as evidence to convict a shoplifter.

Too bad about the Amazon Fresh, I used it for years as a convenient Amazon returns drop off location.Of course never bought anything, as it was substantially overpriced with the same stock as the nearby Walmart (and the panopticon check out didn&#39;t instill confidence).

Indeed. What is hilarious is that, apparently, many people are suffering from similar issues and cannot actually put the &quot;general&quot; in general intelligence in whatever thinking they are capable of. And hence the hype continues, despite very clear evidence that it cannot deliver.

As to &quot;AGI&quot;, that is a &quot;never&quot; for LLMs. The approach cannot do it. We still have no credible practical mathematical models how AGI could be done.

Obviously. Anything and any lie to keep the hype going.

The actual reality is that LLMs are not _capable_ of &quot;novel&quot; discoveries. All they can do, occasionally, is find something were everything is known, but there is a simplistic step missing to connect things. And that is it.

What this dishonest asshole implies is that this will change and LLMs may well get that capability. That will not happen. The Math used does not allow it.

He plays down the idea that LLMs are about to come up with a game-changing new discovery. “I don’t think models are there yet,” he says. “Maybe they’ll get there. I’m optimistic that they will.”

But, he insists, that’s not the mission: “Our mission is to accelerate science. And I don’t think the bar for the acceleration of science is, like, Einstein-level reimagining of an entire field.”Notice the important part before the sentence; he&#39;s talking about &quot;game-changing new discovery&quot; not regular nuts and bolts of scientific work.

Way too $$$. I rather carry an iPad mini if I need that much screen real estate.

That&#39;s $2700 more than I&#39;d ever pay for a phone, and I don&#39;t even want a foldable.

No one need most of the phones at the price point they are available. &quot;Need&quot; isn&#39;t what is being addressed here. The world is full of people who don&#39;t give a crap about spending this kind of money, that&#39;s why these luxury products exist.

Indeed. I have a $80,000 daily driver, but I don&#39;t &quot;need&quot; it. My previous car cost me only $3,500. Also not a need being addressed.

At least this one is doing something unique for that price. The world is filled with expensive phones that have only incremental improvements over their cheaper brethren. Maybe you get a bit more performance, or slightly better cameras, or a slightly better screen. But a phone that unfolds into a full 10&quot; tablet (a full-sized iPad, not an iPad Mini), that&#39;s something that no other phone can do, and one that offers a significant potential utility.

Of course, very few people will be able to justify the price,

Men who the ... will buy a thing that don&#39;t even have a microsdcard on it and no stylus.

We will see more and more of these luxury goods coming out that only 10-20% of the people can afford, and they still won&#39;t own it. A smartphone is an expensive device they sell you for good money, and they continue making good money on it, because you have no choice but run the OS and the apps they want you to run. I still can&#39;t understand how most people don&#39;t see or care about that. Happy and own nothing, indeed.

I wouldn&#39;t mind a folding phone, if they were better priced and had good cameras. For some reason they seem the designs seem to be very questionable.

Take the Pixel Fold. It has the lesser Pixel cameras, not the high end Pro ones. Even those have lagged a bit in the last few years, but that&#39;s another story. It also has pointless cameras like the under screen ones. It&#39;s a foldable, you don&#39;t need a selfie camera, you can use the rear camera and front screen at the same time. Complete waste of money and puts a

I don&#39;t know about the first part.  There has never been a shortage of luxury goods on offer most people can&#39;t afford, or at least could never justify the expense to own.  I expect most slashdot posters could easily find $2900 to buy a phone. Now I also expect most of us could find a whole lot of things we&#39;d rather buy first. Look what a lot of guys spend on a Golf Clubs, a boat, (sports car vs basic reliable/safe transportation), classic car, theater room, gold plated ridding mower, gaming PC, watches, oth

Ownership is a fetish. A phone is not a family heirloom, it&#39;s not a house, it&#39;s not a watch you pass down to your great grandson. It&#39;s a device with a very limited life expectancy, why care about &quot;ownership&quot;? If it serves its function for a few years people will be happy customers.

There&#39;s things worth owning and things not worth owning, both in the figurative sense as you used it here, and in the literal sense like streaming music or movies.

It&#39;s not. You can expect the average Fold device to last the expected life of the phone (typically 3-6 years). If you&#39;re a wild child this phone probably isn&#39;t for you, but then most high end luxury phones probably aren&#39;t suited for you. There are rugged phones for people who don&#39;t treat their devices with basic respect. To be clear I&#39;m one of those people, I drop my phone constantly. My last phone died in a grand fireball after the screen and battery were punctured by a falling toolbox. But we are 8 genera

I guess I can just have a phone instead of having a car.

In what year do you live where you can get a car for $2899?

I believe you are remembering a quote from George Orwell&#39;s 1984: &quot;He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.&quot;

They made a huge mistake here. Destroying the book (there are literately scanners for scanning books without destroying the book) means that they no longer have the book they claim to have the right to use.

How exactly is training from physical books, copyright infringement? This is exactly the kind of use that is allowed under fair use. Once you purchase a physical book, you are allowed to do what you want with it, even scan it to your computer and do data analysis on it or index it, as long as you don&#39;t republish it. AI companies are certainly not republishing books they use for training.

Actually, under copyright law you&#39;re allowed the same freedoms to use audio CD content under fair use. You can&#39;t republish the audio, but you certainly are allowed to index it, analyze it, and even use it for research including AI training.

Very true but then if a &#39;black box&quot; (LLM) can reproduce the exact works...? Note as much as you can do anything you want with paper and ink of the book, the same is not true about particular composition of the ink molecules on the paper (ie the &quot;text&quot;, the works). The *COPY&quot;right is about making copy of the essence of the work.

I do not know how the copyright applies to a human that can do the same, ie reproduce exact work out of memory.

The problem is when someone coaxes the model to output a significant portion of a work verbatim.

Yes they can read it in and process as much as they see fit, but if some prompt demonstrates an ability for it to reconstitute the original work, or something that from a human would be called an infringing knock off, what then?

Cool story! I got my first 386SX in 1992, with a whopping 2MB RAM, so 1Gb would have blown my mind... &quot;Imagine how well Prince of Persia will run&quot; with my brain at that time xD

How come blatant large-scale download of online and offline copyrighted works and reuse in derivative works is OK if &quot;AI&quot; corporations does it, but download by private persons of similar works for reading / viewing is classified as piracy? (OK, besides the &quot;AI&quot; hype that it&#39;s somehow not a derivative work, &quot;corporate&quot; may be a hint ...)

And you aren&#39;t even profiting from it...they&#39;re using it to (hopefully) generate endless profits as well.

Alsup ruled that the scanning was format shifting and thus &#39;fair use&#39;. Alsup ruled that their usage of downloaded works for training was &#39;fair use&#39;. But Anthropic kept copies of downloaded works &#39;as a library&#39; - including works they didn&#39;t use for the model training. Alsup ruled that that was not fair use. Alsup also said he would not delay the trial while Anthropic appealed (which is something that usually happens), hence why Anthropic settled.

&quot;Alsup ruled that the scanning was format shifting and thus &#39;fair use&#39;. Alsup ruled that their usage of downloaded works for training was &#39;fair use&#39;.&quot;And the first is clearly fair use regardless of prevailing attitudes here.  The second certainly could be depending on the terms of the downloads.

&quot;But Anthropic kept copies of downloaded works &#39;as a library&#39; - including works they didn&#39;t use for the model training. Alsup ruled that that was not fair use.&quot;And it is not, but it also isn&#39;t inherently illegal.  Ca

There is no more clear case of fair use than this: buying physical books. Once a person or business buys a book, they don&#39;t get to continue to control what happens to that book.

But...what about AI regurgitating all that copyrighted data? Yes, it does regurgitate the data, but only in ways that are compatible with fair use.

At most, a paragraph or two.Researchers have gotten the major models to regurgitate the vast majority of books by starting with a paragraph of the book. The notion that training only tweaks probabilities is complete and utter nonsense. Alsup was 95% wrong in his decision. He was blatantly lied to by Anthropic, and he bought the crap hook, line, and sinker; lock, stock, and barrel.

Is the book the paper and ink or something more? I am unclear on what to think about it. There is no way to point to any particular place in the LLM that &quot;holds the copy&quot; but if interacted with correctly it can actually reproduce the work. But so do some humans.

This fits to how I see the best use of LLMs: As a knowledge base and library you can talk to.

That they just cut open millions of books shows how lazy they were. They could&#39;ve just built a battery of scanbots and resold the books afterwards. Or just get them from the local library.

There are some real dimwit arseholes running some silicon valley gigs, that&#39;s for sure. And TFA proves this once again.

It&#39;s one of Vernor Vinge&#39;s lesser-known books (or at least I&#39;ve heard less about it), and doing almost *exactly* this was one of the big story arcs.

Humans can read books, most of them can&#39;t memorize them word for word. If a computer is reading a book, and not creating a copy of it, same thing? Not if the LLM&#39;s can spit out the work verbatim. But if you give them rails to say, &quot;hey you read this book, don&#39;t violate copyright&quot; who cares if they &#39;read&#39; the book. (granted anthropic probably has digital copies of all these books to train their modes...)

We gamers expect the word retiring, not refreshing. Unless you are a Bryan.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents have now killed two U.S. citizens in Minnesota under the made-up banner of “absolute immunity” for federal law enforcement officials, regardless of what they do or how they do it. The notion of immunity for state actors in American law goes back decades, and much of what we are seeing on the ground now in terms of violent immigration enforcement has its antecedents in long-standing and deeply flawed American ideas about good guys versus bad guys and who bears the burden of law enforcement run amok. On this week’s Amicus podcast, as the nation struggles to process the executions of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, Dahlia Lithwick was joined by Alex Reinert, the Max Freund Professor of Litigation and Advocacy at Cardozo School of Law. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: ICE agents, like all federal agents, are protected by qualified immunity, and that protects them from lawsuits for constitutional violations committed in the course of duty. And we’ve had that for a long time. Help us understand this foundational idea that for the most part, law enforcement officers cannot be held liable for their actions when they violate your rights. How did we get here?

Alex Reinert: Really, there are two foundational ideas in play in these cases involving federal officials. One is what I’m about to talk about, which is qualified immunity, and a second is something called Bivens doctrine, which is a common law doctrine that used to allow people to sue federal officials for constitutional violations. Let’s start with qualified immunity, which is not long-standing in the sense that it’s really a modern introduction to the law of constitutional torts. It was introduced by the Supreme Court in 1967 in the context of a Freedom Riders case. That was the context in which a lawsuit was brought against state and local officials, and the Supreme Court basically said: We think, even though Congress didn’t spell it out in detail in a statute that gave you the right to sue these officials, and even though Congress didn’t say anything about an immunity doctrine, we think this common law doctrine that may have existed in 1871 should be incorporated into our constitutional tort regime. Fast-forward to 1982, which is where we got a case called Harlow v. Fitzgerald. In that case the Supreme Court said: We also think there should be an immunity doctrine that applies to federal officials.

What it means in practice is that any officer—whether state, local, or federal—who violates the Constitution won’t be held liable unless there is some prior case that makes it clear, from a court’s perspective, that the officer’s conduct was obviously a violation of the Constitution.

So qualified immunity is only really used, or it really only has an impact, when an officer is violating the Constitution. If officers don’t violate the Constitution, they don’t need the protection of qualified immunity. It’s only when officers violate the Constitution that they are able to obtain the protection of qualified immunity.

On its face, if you explained it to somebody and said that we should only hold officers liable when they were on reasonable notice of the unlawfulness of their conduct, people might look at it and think that makes sense. In practice, it has been applied in the widest range of circumstances where most people would say: How is it possible? How is it possible that somebody could get immunity when, for instance, they’re ordered by their supervisor not to fire a shot and they fire six shots and kill someone? When they are executing a search warrant and they decide to steal about $200,000 worth of valuables and a court says, Well, there’s qualified immunity because there wasn’t a prior case in point saying that when you’re executing a search warrant, you can’t steal money? Those are the kinds of cases in which qualified immunity comes into play.

It’s probably shocking to the ordinary person that in this country, a country purported to be governed by the rule of law, and where the Constitution is thought of as foundational, it turns out that violations of the Constitution by our highest-level officers and officials aren’t remediable because of this doctrine of qualified immunity.

Explain Bivens doctrine now, to set the table for what follows.

This is the other part of what is a perverse design of our constitutional scheme. Bivens is special because it applies only to federal officials. When state and local officials violate our rights, there’s a statute that goes all the way back to Reconstruction enacted in 1871 that allows us to sue state and local officials for violations of our constitutional rights. Qualified immunity still applies, but at least there’s a right to sue. There is no similar statute when federal officials violate the Constitution.

In 1971, in a case by the name of Bivens, the Supreme Court said: We think that we are going to find a right to sue in the Fourth Amendment, for Fourth Amendment violations when federal officials violate someone’s rights. Over the course of the next 10 years, the Supreme Court expanded that doctrine to include Eighth Amendment violations, and claims for sex discrimination. During the 1970s, lower courts were also rapidly expanding the Bivens doctrine.

All that changed in 1980. From 1980 on, the Supreme Court said: We are not going to entertain Bivens actions. And the court has given us a variety of reasons to the point where today, when the Supreme Court hears a Bivens claim, it basically says: We’re not sure that this court would even recognize the right to sue federal officials for constitutional violations. We’re certainly not going to extend that right to sue beyond the narrow category of the three cases in which the Bivens right was recognized in the 1970s. Furthermore, we’re going to confine those categories very narrowly.

I come back to this principle that we have a Constitution that is supposed to be meaningful in this country and it’s supposed to govern the conduct of all of our officers. It’s perverse that we have a federal Constitution that means less for federal officials than it does for state and local officials. We have a federal Constitution that is harder to enforce against federal officials than almost anyone else. That’s really a product of the Bivens doctrine.

And the last piece of this that I think is really important, just historically, for people to understand is that this wasn’t the model of remediation we had in the 19th century. You could sue federal officers in the 19th century when they violated your rights. It was not a unique occurrence. It was accepted that this was a way for people to obtain remedies. It also was accepted that it was a way to test the legality of executive conduct, of the policies and conduct of federal officials. Now we live in this world in which there are so many barriers to that kind of accountability, to those tests for legality.

That’s just a bad way to design courts. We want to learn from our mistakes. We want law to be able to develop if it should. It’s also bad, obviously, for people who are bringing these kinds of claims. I also think  it’s bad for policing. We want police to do their job consistent with the Constitution. Having answers to the question of when they violate rights and when they don’t should be, and is, important to them. So we’re losing all these opportunities in these cases to develop the law in ways that I think should help everyone.

Last week the AP reported a whistleblower complaint that showed that in violation of long-standing Fourth Amendment principles, ICE is taking the position that they can just enter folks’ homes without a judicial warrant. They can just use an administrative warrant. The whistleblower complaint alleges that the secret memo outlining this policy, signed by acting deputy ICE Director Todd Lyons, says, “although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the INA, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”

I think it is extremely concerning and also an untenable interpretation of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court hasn’t addressed this question, but the whole premise of the warrant requirement is that there should be some independent adjudicator—someone outside the executive branch—to decide whether or not there is a justification for invading the sanctity of someone’s home. Administrative warrants don’t provide that; judicial warrants do. That doesn’t mean judicial warrants are perfect, but they are at least outside the executive branch. It’s important from a separation-of-powers perspective, of course, and it’s important from an institutional design perspective. We already have so much about the immigration system over which the executive has so much authority: the appointment of immigration judges, all of these policy memos. So to fold the power to issue warrants, and act on warrants, into the executive in this way is just an extreme power grab. And the line about use of force gets us back to what we were talking about with Bivens and qualified immunity, which is when the officers use force in those circumstances, when they go overboard in their use of force—as inevitably some will—what kinds of remedies will there be? Those will be few and far between.

It reminds me of Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence in Noem v. Vasquez-Perdomo, where he says, essentially, People are talking about use of force, but this case isn’t about use of force. If there is a use of force, then people should be able to go to court and sue. He says all that in his concurrence, but at the same time we know that Justice Kavanaugh is one of the justices who has led the charge for undermining the Bivens remedy. It’s exactly what the Supreme Court does in so many contexts in the civil rights world. They’ll say: We’re not going to give you this remedy here, but don’t worry. There’s all these other ways you can enforce your rights. And then when they’re over there in the other box, they say: Well, we’re not going to allow you to enforce your rights here because there’s something else over here. Pam Karlan calls it a shell game and it works like this: When I’m over here, I’m going to say, Don’t worry about me limiting your rights because there’s some other way for you to enforce them. And then I’m just going to undermine your means of enforcing them in that other part of the jurisprudence. So it is troubling to the extreme that ICE officers are going to be acting on this authority.

Since 2020, and the murder of George Floyd and the flash of recognition that police reform was past due, there has been a significant public silence. As a consequence, in that silence, we have to grapple with that which makes us very uncomfortable. By “we” I mean a culture that has turned a blind eye to a lot of these issues and is suddenly startled by the ways police immunity and impunity have been weaponized for immigration enforcement. So help us think through reform in ways that are conducive to meaningful accountability and conducive to having a civic life that doesn’t include masked officers pepper-spraying or shooting somebody who’s already restrained on the ground. How do we think in a bigger, more generous way about getting to where we want to be?

I guess I would think about it in at least two different ways. The first is part of the reason there’s resistance to increasing accountability, particularly for our policing apparatus. It has to do with the sense that it’s a hard job. And it’s a job that at some level, most people think we need people to do. And what do we do when something that people see as really important, that’s also hard, what do we do when that imposes costs? When that imposes costs on people who did nothing wrong, who are left traumatized, maybe dead, seriously injured? I’ve always thought that the problem with a lot of the doctrine we’ve been talking about is it leaves those costs on the people who suffered them. It leaves those costs directly on the people who suffered them. But if we allow it, if we think there’s something good that comes out of policing, if we think it creates some value for the public at large, why should the costs be borne solely by the people who suffered most significantly as a result of it? So that’s one piece of it that always resonates with me about why some of the doctrine we’ve been talking about is so wrong.

For a while, or at least for I don’t know how long of a moment after the murder of George Floyd, there was a conversation. I would go to demonstrations and I’d see signs that said “End qualified immunity.” There was a way in which the doctrine that previously mostly lawyers knew about or scholars were talking about and mostly other people didn’t know about, that doctrine came into the public consciousness and became important. I think there is still some of that going on. I think there is still some momentum for that.

When we think about accountability, we usually think about accountability for an individual, an individual who behaved in some unlawful way. It makes sense to think about accountability that way. But the problems we’re talking about are systemic. That doesn’t mean there aren’t some individuals, the so-called bad apples, who no matter what kind of training we have, no matter what way we approach hiring, no matter what kind of supervision we provide, there are some people who may just act egregiously because they can, because they have a badge. But I think for the most part, the problems we’re talking about are systemic. And if the problems are systemic, then talking about accountability for individuals isn’t necessarily the right frame. I think we need to approach solutions to the problem systemically. And those solutions are as much about: Who ends up paying the damages for the people who suffer? Should it be the individual officer or should it be the departments that employ them? As a matter of practice, it’s always the departments who employ them. So we need to find a way for those agencies to learn better from the kinds of misconduct that their officers enter into. But it’s also about the legal regime that we set up to allow people to sue and what kinds of things they sue for, the way we allow people, really limit the ability of people, to bring so-called injunctive relief and systemic reform of departments.

So if we think about accountability more broadly, and we think about the problems we’ve been talking about, through a systemic lens, it’s not so much about the individual officer. It’s about creating a legal regime that allows us to get answers to the questions of how people were mistreated, whether the way in which they were mistreated was unlawful, and making sure that we can build systems so that it doesn’t keep happening. Because right now we’re in a world where it is happening over and over again and it seems like there are very few tools in our toolbox to prevent the reoccurrence.

Early Saturday morning, it appeared as if enough Senate Democrats were willing to fund the Department of Homeland Security and its deportation machine, if that’s what it took to keep the rest of the government open.

The House had passed funding for the DHS late last week, with seven centrist Democrats joining nearly all Republicans to get it over the line. The Senate was to take it up this week alongside a handful of other funding bills. It was expected that, as with the House vote, enough Democrats would hold their noses and support it, even if it meant absorbing blowback from a furious Democratic base that has been dusting off the largely dormant “Abolish ICE” slogan. Democratic negotiators felt that approving full-year, carefully negotiated spending bills and reasserting Congress’ power of the purse over a freewheeling executive branch was the priority of the moment.

“There is much more we must do to rein in DHS, which I will continue to press for,” Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement last Tuesday, once the deal was released. She listed some pittances she had secured in the DHS bill, such as more money for body cameras for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. She knew, though, that wouldn’t ease any anger within the base. Ultimately, she leveled.

“But the hard truth,” she added, “is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need.”

All of this changed on Saturday in Minneapolis, when Border Patrol agents killed 37-year-old observer Alex Pretti. All of this changed when videos showed Pretti subdued, being pepper-sprayed and then shot, over and over again, without brandishing the firearm that he was permitted to carry. All of this changed when, as after the killing of Renee Good, White House adviser Stephen Miller and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem absurdly described Pretti as a “domestic terrorist” or “assassin.” After Pretti’s killing and the administration’s eyesight-defying remorselessness over what happened, there was no way Senate Democrats could put their fingerprints on a bill to fund the administration’s deportation machine.

“I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands,” Patty Murray said Saturday.

She was hardly the only one. Democrats who’ve previously broken from the pack to join Republicans in advancing government funding bills, like Sens. Tim Kaine, Catherine Cortez Masto, Angus King, and Jacky Rosen, all said the same. On the House side, meanwhile, one Democrat who had voted for the DHS funding bill, New York Rep. Tom Suozzi, offered a mea culpa on social media, saying that he had “long been critical of ICE’s unlawful behavior and I must do a better job demonstrating that.”

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer put a bow on Democrats’ new posture Saturday night: Democrats would filibuster DHS funding without changes. And it didn’t sound like there was much handwringing about it.

Does this make a partial government shutdown, after funding lapses after Jan. 30, inevitable? Let’s say much more likely. The situation is complicated for reasons including, but not limited to, the weather.

The funding bill the Senate will be voting on does not just cover DHS. It combines half a dozen bills that the House has passed in January funding everything from the Pentagon to the State Department to the departments of Health and Human Services, Transportation, Education, Labor, and more. Although this package includes only half of the 12 yearly appropriations bills, the specific departments it includes—especially Defense and HHS—comprise a comfortable majority of annual spending.

Senate Democrats are calling on their Republican counterparts, in Schumer’s words, to “work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill.” In other words, to strip DHS funding from the package, pass everything else, and then allow for more time to negotiate the DHS budget.

Would Republicans be willing to do this? They typically don’t take orders from Democrats. But Republican leaders, just as much as Democratic ones, don’t want appropriators’ delicate work on the biggest funding bills to get sent to an incinerator of fury. The New York Times reported Saturday that “recognizing the depth of Democratic rage,” Senate Republicans “immediately began examining whether they could separate the homeland security funding from the rest of the package and preserve the bulk of what had been a bipartisan deal to fund a large chunk of the government.” Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, said her committee was “exploring all options.”

If—if—leaders in the Senate reach an agreement to amend the package, then there’s another problem: The House is on recess this week, and House Republicans’ leaders wouldn’t be particularly enthused about summoning members to Washington to revote on a package amended at Democrats’ request. Plus, a substantial portion of the continental United States is buried under a sheet of ice and snow, conditions that aren’t conducive to travel.

It’s important to note that a lapse in DHS funding wouldn’t impede deportation operations much. As Patty Murray repeatedly said when she was trying to push the deal through, ICE is sitting on substantial funds that were made available to it in Republicans’ party-line megabill last year.

Murray is still saying that, posting on Sunday that “Americans must be eyes wide open that blocking the DHS funding bill will not shut down ICE. ICE is now sitting on a massive slush fund it can tap, whether or not we pass a funding bill.”

“But,” she added, “we all saw another American shot and killed in broad daylight.” They’re not about to bless it with their votes.

On Saturday, Alex Pretti was pushed to the ground and fatally shot by federal agents. Video shows that, moments before, Pretti was holding a cellphone in one hand and had his other hand up. Pretti was 37 and worked as an ICU nurse at a VA hospital. He enjoyed biking and had a dog named Joule.

Later that day, What Next’s Mary Harris spoke to Dimitri Drekonja, a colleague and friend of Pretti’s, who remembers him as “a kind guy” who modeled cooperation and who, right out of school, took one of the hardest jobs available to nurses. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: How did you learn about what happened?

Dimitri Drekonja: We were at [my son’s ski] race in the morning, and one of the other parents said, “Did you hear there was another shooting?” It sort of filtered through: “It sounds like another shooting.” “Another person died.” And there was a lot of sort of like, “This is just heavy.” “Awful.”

And then we got back from the race, and on a group chat, someone said, “ICE executed Alex Pretti.” [Editor’s note: It later became clear that the officers were with Customs and Border Protection.] It was from our group that we had had when we had first hired him to be study staff on our research project. It was like, What? You have to be kidding me.

I had seen one of the videos. [In it,] you can’t see the defined definitions of someone’s face and recognize them. But once the name was out there and I saw the build, the facial hair, it’s like, Oh, shit, that was Alex.

People have asked, “Are you surprised that he was protesting?” And, in all honesty, no one can be surprised that anyone in Minneapolis is protesting. We see 80-year-olds out protesting. We see kids out protesting. The city is pretty, pretty pissed off about what is happening, and people are out there doing their civic duty of being out there peacefully protesting.

Have you been able to watch the videos? I can’t stop myself watching the videos.

I don’t know how you watch someone you know—

I have not sought them out. I mean, my wife has shown me some, like, “Oh, God, with this new view you can see …” I’ve seen a few that way. It’s awful.

You posted on social media that you were feeling white-hot rage. What do you do with that feeling in this moment?

Right now, delay going to dinner with friends because I don’t feel terribly sociable. I’ve been really appreciative of people who have been reaching out to say, “Hey, sorry to hear—sounds like Alex was a great guy. This is hard.”

I think other people are enraged. I think the worst thing right now would be to have random violence. I’ve been really proud of Minneapolis—the scope and scale of the protests, the fact that they have been peaceful.

The administration has said your friend must have been trying to kill officers. Is there something you want to tell people who may have that belief about Alex?

The thing that I would say is that I have known Alex for years. I’ve known him to be a kind guy, a guy quick with a laugh, a joke, willing to help. He has never shared a conspiracy theory or shared anger at a group or been unpatriotic. I mean, he is the kind of guy that you would want as your neighbor and your friend. I would be thrilled if he were to move into the house next door.

We have a shared interest in mountain biking. We were planning on going out together. I was always the one who was having to say, “No, sorry, my kid has a race this week. Can’t do it.” But we liked the same trail systems, and we talked about riding them.

I have observed him clinically. He is fabulous, he gives great assessments, he’s enthusiastic, he is smart, and I will just say that anybody going into the ICU fresh out of nursing school—you’re gonna deal with very sick patients. A [large] percent of the patients in the ICU will die, and you’ll have to deal with grieving, upset families. You’ll have to use all your skills to try to keep that person alive. To do that right out of nursing school is impressive.

Sometimes medicine is a hierarchical place. He was not like that, and I loved that. I would run into him, and he would say, “Hey, Dimitri, how’s it going? It’s good to see you again.” I love that he had that informal relationship. I love it was modeled for trainees who worked with us. Like, yeah, this is how you do it: You’re colleagues, you’re friendly, you are nice to each other, and you work well together.

            <div id="article-text">Catholics need to develop critical thinking skills to counter the dark side of AI and counter unnatural attachments to chatbots, the pope said this week in a message marking the Church&#39;s social communications day.

American-born pope Leo XIV also called on AI creators and platform CEOs to think about something other than maximizing profit and plundering the cultural archive to feed their models.

And he said individuals had a duty to protect their own image, face, and voice to prevent nefarious uses of AI, from cyber bullying to deep fakes.

Pope Leo was speaking on the Church&#39;s 60th World Day of Social Communications, which falls on the feast of St Francis of Sales (as all good Salesians would of course know.)

&quot;Faces and voices are sacred,&quot; he reminded readers as &quot;God…created us in his image and likeness.&quot;

But he swiftly moved from the theological to the technological, warning: &quot;By simulating human voices and faces, wisdom and knowledge, consciousness and responsibility, empathy and friendship… artificial intelligence [could] not only interfere with information ecosystems, but also encroach upon the deepest level of communication, that of human relationships.&quot;

Pope Leo made no mention of a recent conference of exorcists which warned that AI could lead to &quot;new forms of necromancy and communication with the deceased.&quot;

But he said the drive to &quot;maximize engagement on social media&quot;, and group people into &quot;bubbles of easy consensus and easy outrage&quot; reduces populations&#39; ability to think crucially and made them more polarized.

This is &quot;further exacerbated by a naive and unquestioning reliance on artificial intelligence as an omniscient &#39;friend,&#39; a source of all knowledge, an archive of every memory, an &#39;oracle&#39; of all advice.&quot;

He said AI is turning people into &quot;passive consumers of unthought thoughts&quot; while &quot;the masterpieces of human genius in the fields of music, art and literature are being reduced to mere training grounds for machines.&quot;

Likewise, lack of transparency in algorithms and &quot;inadequate social representation of data&quot; will trap individuals in networks that can manipulate their thoughts, and exacerbate existing social inequality and injustices.

The Pontiff also highlighted the potential for disinformation and the need for real world reporting, else we descend into mistrust, confusion, and insecurity.&quot; (Francis of Sales is both the patron saint of journalists and the deaf.)

And he highlighted the fact that behind this &quot;enormous invisible force that affects us all&quot; are a handful of companies, giving rise to &quot;significant concerns about the oligopolistic control of algorithmic systems and artificial intelligence.&quot;

He said, &quot;The task laid before us is not to stop digital innovation, but rather to guide it and to be aware of its ambivalent nature.&quot; Each one of us needs to raise &quot;our voice in defense of human persons, so that we can truly assimilate these tools as allies.&quot;

This meant &quot;those at the helm of online platforms&quot; needed to ensure their business are about more than profit but also consider the common good. Developers need to practice transparency and promote &quot;informed consent.&quot;

More prosaically, AI-generated or manipulated content should be clearly labelled, while &quot;authorship and sovereign ownership of the work of journalists and other content creators must be protected.&quot;

And media, information, and AI literacy needs to be built into education at all levels, with Catholics developing critical thinking skills – and ensuring their God-given images are not pinched by scammers or AI models.

&quot;We need faces and voices to speak for people again,&quot; Leo concluded. &quot;We need to cherish the gift of communication as the deepest truth of humanity, to which all technological innovation should also be oriented.&quot; ®

            <h2>China-linked group accused of spying on phones of UK prime ministers' aides – for years</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/chinalinked_hackers_accused_of_yearslong/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Chinese state-linked hackers are accused of spending years inside the phones of senior Downing Street officials, exposing private communications at the heart of the UK government.

The Telegraph reports that the activity focused on phones used by senior aides around former prime ministers Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Rishi Sunak, with the suspected access stretching back to 2021. Intelligence sources described the compromise as extensive, with one saying the activity went &quot;right into the heart of Downing Street,&quot; although it remains unclear whether the prime ministers&#39; own devices were accessed directly.

Salt Typhoon, the Chinese-linked group previously blamed for telecom intrusions overseas, has been named as a likely culprit in the reported snooping. The espionage outfit is known for breaking into telecoms providers, enabling them to skim metadata and communications without ever needing to install anything on a handset.

Even without full access to message content or live calls, call logs and location data are often enough to build a clear picture of who is talking to whom, how frequently, and from where.

Intelligence officials quoted by The Telegraph said attackers may have been able to read texts or listen in on calls involving senior figures, but added that the metadata alone would have been useful.

The breaches were reportedly discovered only in 2024, after the US disclosed that Chinese-linked hacking groups had gained deep access to telecommunications providers worldwide. US officials have since acknowledged that attackers could, in some cases, record calls &quot;at will,&quot; underlining concerns that state-backed groups had embedded themselves deep inside communications networks.

So far, the UK has stuck to talking about a &quot;cluster of activity&quot; linked to Salt Typhoon, without saying much about what that involved. US officials, by contrast, have been far more direct about who was targeted and when, confirming that senior political figures and multiple telecoms firms were caught up in the operation ahead of the 2024 election.

The Telegraph reports that there were &quot;many&quot; separate attacks on Downing Street staff phones and wider government communications, particularly during Sunak&#39;s time in office. MI5 issued an espionage alert to Parliament last November, warning of Chinese state spying, but neither the scope nor the impact of the suspected telecoms compromise has been detailed publicly.

The allegations surfaced days before current UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due to travel to China on the first visit by a British prime minister since 2018, with trade and investment firmly on the agenda. Critics have accused the government of taking too soft a line on Beijing while approving plans for a large Chinese embassy in London near sensitive communications infrastructure.

China&#39;s foreign ministry dismissed the allegations as baseless and accused Western governments of politicizing cybersecurity, echoing Beijing&#39;s response to earlier Salt Typhoon disclosures.

Intelligence sources quoted in the report suggested UK telecoms networks were in better shape than those in the US, pointing to the Telecommunications Security Act passed in 2021. Even so, a senior US official described the global Salt Typhoon operation as &quot;one of the more successful campaigns in the history of espionage,&quot; highlighting how hard such intrusions are to detect once attackers are embedded deep inside network infrastructure.

As with previous Salt Typhoon cases, the hardest part may not be working out what was accessed, but proving the attackers are no longer there. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/nws_gao_ai_translation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">US spending watchdogs have called on the National Weather Service (NWS) to deliver an updated plan for its AI language translation project to reduce the risk posed by extreme weather events to people not proficient in English.

The call from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) comes as vast swathes of the US are pinned down by a winter storm that has already claimed lives.

But the NWS AI translation effort has been caught between a drive to reach as many people as possible, administration changes, and a White House Executive order to cement the role of English as the country&#39;s official language.

The GAO report [PDF] noted that 26 million people in the US have &quot;limited ability to read, speak, write, or understand English.&quot; Two-thirds of people with limited English speak Spanish, while other major languages include Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Tagalog. French rounds out the top ten.

If they can&#39;t understand the NWS&#39;s emergency weather messages sent to mobile phones or via radio and TV, this can lead to deaths and injuries, economic effects, and &quot;confusion,&quot; for example, during evacuation efforts.

Text alerts, or WEAs, are already distributed in Spanish, while the Emergency Alert System (EAS) over radio and TV is English-only. Most other non-alert messaging is English-only too.

There are FCC requirements to support additional languages for WEAs by June 2028. At the same time, Executive Order 14224, signed on March 1, 2025, designated English as the official language of the US. This has caused uncertainty over exactly how far the NWS should go in extending its translated alerts.

It has also created uncertainty around the NWS experiments in using AI to provide translations of alerts.

This started in 2021, with &quot;translated products on a public website since October 2023,&quot; the report said. It added that as of December 2025, AI was used to &quot;translate selected products issued by about a quarter of its weather forecast offices and the National Hurricane Center into five languages.&quot;

The GAO said the NWS had contracted with a commercial vendor to develop its translation systems, &quot;and relies on internal bilingual NWS staff to help train the AI models.&quot; From 2022 to last year, it spent about $2.7 million on the project, which covered five languages.

Training models for a new language took about three months, with NWS bilingual staff and contractors reviewing translations. Once up and running, the &quot;translation process generally takes about one minute and is integrated into the system that forecasters use to generate weather products.&quot;

But the program was briefly paused as of March 2025 due to the need for department-level approval of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) contracts for more than $100,000.

A new deal was subsequently signed, but at a lower level, meaning plans to support further languages are on ice until at least April 2026. The report says that officials did not seek further funds for the AI project in 2026 as they were awaiting guidance on the implementation of the executive order.

The GAO said the AI program could extend the accessibility of &quot;weather products&quot; and reduce risks to public health and safety during extreme weather events.

But the watchdog said the NWS &quot;could better manage the project by establishing and communicating measurable performance goals, resource needs, and strategies to address internal and external challenges.&quot;

It called for an updated implementation plan to help &quot;NWS use its existing resources to support the highest priority activities, realistically plan for the future of the project, and communicate resource needs to Congress.&quot;

But the agency also highlighted the need for human input too as literal translations do not always capture nuance. For example, a brochure on rip tide safety &quot;used corrientes de resaca for rip current, which for certain Spanish speakers translates to &#39;hangover current.&#39;&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/nasa_anomaly_review_maven/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA is setting up an anomaly review board to look into the fate of its Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft, which was last heard from on December 6.

Attempts to make contact with the Mars orbiter are ongoing. The final fragments of data indicated that the spacecraft was tumbling and had possibly changed trajectory. The MAVEN team is analyzing snippets of data recovered from a December 6 radio science campaign to develop a timeline of possible events and likely root causes of the issue.

James Godfrey, retired Spacecraft Operations Manager for ESA&#39;s Mars Express, pondered what might have happened to MAVEN in a message to The Register.

&quot;The fact that it appears to be rotating in an unexpected manner (tumbling?) and might have experienced an orbital change (I guess from inconsistent Doppler data) does suggest an energetic event.

&quot;It&#39;s unlikely that anything has hit it – not much space debris at Mars. So more likely something onboard.&quot;

If the spacecraft had entered a normal safe mode, controllers should have been able to communicate with it. &quot;So whatever has happened, it hasn&#39;t been able to reach safe mode for some unknown reason,&quot; Godfrey speculated.

&quot;So problems that could result in loss of attitude, possible orbit change, would suggest problems affecting GNC [Guidance, Navigation, and Control]. Could be an onboard computer failure, stuck valve, run out of fuel etc. Possibly a problem with the reaction wheels? In any case, something that caused the thrusters to fire in an unbalanced fashion from which the spacecraft was unable to recover autonomously.&quot;

All possibilities are bad news for MAVEN, both as a mission and a telecommunications relay for NASA&#39;s Mars rovers, Curiosity and Perseverance. The spacecraft entered Mars orbit on September 22, 2014, with a two-year planned mission. It has since endured for well over a decade, gathering data on the planet&#39;s atmosphere.

Attempts to contact the probe were further complicated by the solar conjunction, when the Sun lies between the Earth and Mars, blocking communication.

Godfrey noted this was &quot;a more challenging conjunction than the run-of-the-mill&quot; and the fact &quot;the Sun being very active at the moment won&#39;t help.&quot;

All of which makes MAVEN&#39;s recovery at this stage improbable. The thermal and power status of the spacecraft is not known, nor is its location.

The assembly of a formal anomaly review board is an indicator that, while NASA has yet to throw in the towel, things are not looking good for MAVEN, and managers want to understand what happened. ®

            <h2>France to replace US videoconferencing wares with unfortunately named sovereign alternative</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/27/france_videoconferencing_visio/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">France has officially told Zoom, Teams, and the rest of the US videoconferencing herd to take a hike in favor of its own homegrown app.

The plan, announced on Monday, is to shove US videoconferencing tools out of the French public sector altogether, with Zoom, Teams, Webex, and Google Meet making way for a state-built alternative that Paris says keeps its data, infrastructure, and legal exposure firmly at home.

The platform, called Visio, is being developed and rolled out by the government&#39;s Interministerial Directorate for Digital Affairs (DINUM) and is set to become the default, and eventually exclusive, video meeting tool for public servants.

The announcement was made by the Ministry of the Economy and Finance as part of France&#39;s broader push for digital sovereignty. The government says that using foreign videoconferencing platforms exposes official communications to overseas infrastructure, laws, and political pressures it would rather avoid.

&quot;This project is a concrete illustration of the Prime Minister and the Government&#39;s commitment to regaining our digital independence,&quot; said David Amiel, minister delegate for the Civil Service and State Reform. &quot;We cannot risk having our scientific exchanges, our sensitive data, and our strategic innovations exposed to non-European actors. Digital sovereignty is simultaneously an imperative for our public services, an opportunity for our businesses, and insurance against future threats.&quot;

According to the announcement, Visio has already been tested by tens of thousands of civil servants and is now being scaled up for wider use across ministries, agencies, and public bodies. The plan is for Visio to be in routine use across the state by 2027, after which external videoconferencing licenses would no longer be renewed. Large parts of the public sector, including tax and social security bodies, have already started the switch.

Security is the main sales pitch, with Paris stressing that Visio runs on infrastructure it controls and is built to comply with French and EU data protection and confidentiality rules. There&#39;s money in it as well, at least on paper: Paris estimates that moving 100,000 users off commercial platforms saves around €1 million a year in license fees.

France is also keen to stress that Visio is not meant to be a bare-bones substitute. The platform will, eventually at least, boast transcription and live captions, but without shipping the audio off to someone else&#39;s cloud. The subtext is less about convenience and more about avoiding US jurisdiction over data.

However, there is one small but telling irony lurking in the announcement. Calling a state videoconferencing platform &quot;Visio&quot; all but guarantees confusion with Microsoft&#39;s long-established diagramming software of the same name, suggesting that, while France is moving to cut US dependencies, it may not have spent quite as much time on branding.

Whether Visio sticks or joins the long list of state IT projects that never quite replace the tools people actually like will only become clear over time. For now, though, France has made its position clear: when it comes to official video calls, Uncle Sam is no longer invited. ®

            <h2>Succession: Linux kernel community gets continuity plan for post-Linus era</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-27</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Linux kernel project has finally answered one of the biggest questions gripping the community: what happens if Linus Torvalds is no longer able to lead it?

The &quot;Linux project continuity document,&quot; drafted by Dan Williams, was merged into its documentation last week, just ahead of the release of Linux 6.19-rc7. Notably, the document&#39;s path is Documentation/process/conclave.rst.

It notes that the kernel development project is &quot;widely distributed, with over 100 maintainers each working to keep changes moving through their own repositories.&quot;

But &quot;the final step... is a centralized one where changes are pulled into the mainline repository.&quot; And that is &quot;normally done by Linus Torvalds,&quot; though &quot;there are others who can do that work when the need arises.&quot;

It delicately adds: &quot;Should the maintainers of that repository become unwilling or unable to do that work going forward (including facilitating a transition), the project will need to find one or more replacements without delay.&quot;

So what will happen? The process centers on &quot;$ORGANIZER&quot; who is &quot;the last Maintainer Summit organizer or the current Linux Foundation (LF) Technical Advisory Board (TAB) Chair as a backup.&quot;

The document says: &quot;Within 72 hours, $ORGANIZER will open a discussion with the invitees of the most recently concluded Maintainers Summit. A meeting of those invitees and the TAB, either online or in-person, will be set as soon as possible in a way that maximizes the number of people who can participate.&quot;

In the event of no summit happening in the previous 15 months, the TAB will choose the attendees. Invitees can bring in other maintainers as needed. The meeting will be chaired by $ORGANIZER and will &quot;consider options for the ongoing management of the top-level kernel repository consistent with the expectation that it maximizes the long term health of the project and its community.&quot;

&quot;Next steps&quot; will then be communicated to the broader community through the ksummit@lists.linux.dev mailing list. The Linux Foundation, with guidance from the TAB, will &quot;take the steps necessary to support and implement this plan.&quot;

The document follows discussion of succession and continuity at the 2025 Maintainers Summit. This included what would happen during a &quot;smooth transition&quot; if Torvalds decides it is time to move on, as well as the process &quot;should something happen.&quot;

While Torvalds has a firm grip on Linux, as the continuity plan notes, he has himself mused on his own future and the fact the maintainer community, at least for the kernel, is getting grayer.

At the Open Source Summit in 2024, he noted: &quot;Some people are probably still disappointed that I&#39;m still here. I mean, it is absolutely true that kernel maintainers are aging.&quot;

He was asked by fellow pioneer Dirk Hohndel of Verizon what the community needs to do to ensure the next generation is ready, &quot;so that in 10, 15, 20, 30 years your role can be handed off to someone else.&quot;

Torvalds replied: &quot;We&#39;ve always had a lot of people who are very competent and could step up.&quot; As for an aging community, he said new people still come in and become main developers within three years. &quot;It&#39;s not impossible at all.&quot;

And Torvalds is not the only maintainer making plans as the open source community matures. Some projects have, of course, fallen by the wayside over the years. Some remain embedded in the ecosystem, even as their originators and maintainers get older.

One option is handing them over to a foundation. Others like curl originator Daniel Stenberg have remained fiercely independent – with discreet arrangements to pass on their GitHub details when the time comes. ®

﻿An outage that started Sunday morning got the new US-specific version of TikTok off to a terrible start.

As we moved into the third day of the TikTokalypse, the app appears to have finally stabilized in the US, as we verified that it’s possible to consistently publish new videos and even have other people watch them. That hasn’t been a simple task since the service started having problems early Sunday morning, but on Tuesday morning, I was able to post a new short video and watch one published by my colleague in the UK.

A statement from TikTok USDS, the new Trump admin-assigned owners and operators of the brand in the United States, said it has “made significant progress in recovering our U.S. infrastructure” with its still-unnamed US data center partner. It also noted that US users may continue to experience some bugs, particularly when it comes to posting new content. While I am able to see videos from outside the US, a newly-created UK account failed to load, as well as a number of other profiles.

TikTok USDS has said that the problem started due to a power outage at a data center, followed by a “cascading systems failure.” In the meantime, theories and rumors have swirled about TikTok’s new terms of service, the goals of its new owners, how the algorithm in the US may be manipulated, and the possibility of censorship around topics like ICE’s actions in Minneapolis and Jeffrey Epstein. A number of people have said they’re leaving the service and deleting their accounts, while some have suggested using different apps like UpScrolled.

How any of that may have changed behind the scenes or may change in the future is impossible to tell without a much broader analysis, but the service does appear to be operational again, brainrot videos and all.

We’ve made significant progress in recovering our U.S. infrastructure with our U.S. data center partner. However, the U.S. user experience may still have some technical issues, including when posting new content. We’re committed to bringing TikTok back to its full capacity as soon as possible. We’ll continue to provide updates. Thanks for your patience.

Gemini 3 is coming to AI Overviews and you can ask follow-ups for a ‘seamless Search experience.’

Google is making Search less about links and more about AI. The company is upgrading its AI-powered search features, adding Gemini 3 to AI Overviews and letting users ask follow-up questions “seamlessly” to make sure Search can answer “whatever’s on your mind,” a move that feels closer to using an AI chatbot than a search engine.

If Overviews’ summary leaves you wanting more, you can now jump straight into a conversation with AI Mode. “A quick snapshot when you need it, and deeper conversation when you want it,” says Google Search vice president of product Robby Stein. Switching between the two features looks incredibly easy — just scroll and type — going by a test video Stein shared last year.

Overviews are getting an upgrade too, with Gemini 3 now the default model powering the AI-generated summaries globally, Stein says. The model, which wowed observers when it launched last year, means Overview answers will be “best-in-class,” Stein says. Users have had mixed results with previous models.

The upgrades come as part of a broader seismic shift at Google as the company seems to be transitioning away from Search and pushes AI interactions above links. Google did not immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment on when it plans to do away with Search entirely.

Disclosure: Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company, has filed a lawsuit against Google, seeking damages from its illegal ad tech monopoly.

            <div id="article-text">Highguard won’t be the next Fortnite, but I’ll enjoy it while it lasts.

Highguard won’t be the next Fortnite, but I’ll enjoy it while it lasts.

The routine is familiar by now. A new online shooter with bright, colorful graphics launches and rockets up the charts despite the fact that you maybe haven’t even heard of it. Or maybe it just has a really forgettable name. But everyone seems to be talking about it, and it’s free, so you figure you may as well jump in. This moment of promise and anticipation may end up being the best this game will ever be — and there’s a good chance that feeling won’t last long.

I could be describing any number of games, but the most recent example is Highguard, which just launched on the PS5, Xbox, and Steam. The 3v3 shooter is the first release from Wildlight Entertainment, a new studio made up of veterans from Apex Legends, Titanfall, and Call of Duty. That pedigree is enough to pay some attention to the game, which was originally revealed as the final announcement at The Game Awards last month. But it’s also doing some interesting things. The developers call it a “raid shooter,” but I’ve found it easiest to understand as a sort of first-person shooter take on a MOBA like League of Legends; each team has a base, and your job is to balance getting improved gear, protecting your own base, and completing various objectives to take down your enemies’ HQ. Also, you can ride a bear.

It’s a complicated setup, and after a few matches I’m not entirely convinced I fully understand the flow of matches, which could be a problem for wider adoption. It’s certainly not as pick-up-and-play as something like Fortnite. Though as you’d expect from people who worked on Titanfall, the action feels great, with excellent gunplay and smooth movement. It’s also a hero shooter, so you pick from characters with Overwatch-style ultimate powers that can let you quickly turn a battle in your favor, or smash through your opponents’ defenses. They can be a lot of fun when you pull them off properly.

When you’re in the midst of a tight skirmish, defending your teammates while they try to defuse a bomb, the appeal of Highguard is apparent. At its best it’s fast and tense and forces you to be decisive. But its complex nature also means that things can feel a little strange and messy. For one thing, the team sizes are small yet the maps are large, and so you spend a good chunk of each match wandering around a mostly empty level searching for chests to improve your armor or find a better gun. You do have a mount to speed this up, but even still, I’ve found the early portions of matches to be incredibly slow and not very exciting.

As the ill-fated Concord showed, the most important thing for a new online shooter is what it does differently, although even that isn’t a guarantee of success. But you need a hook to compete in a space with such established players as Fortnite, Counter-Strike, and the annualized behemoth that is Call of Duty. Battlefield 6 managed to break through with sheer force of will, while the likes of Valorant, Helldivers 2, and Apex Legends have settled into a seemingly steady place where they aren’t the biggest games, but they have a strong, healthy player base. But the list of failures is also large: Anthem, Spectre Divide, XDefiant, Spellbreak, just to name a few. Many had interesting hooks — It’s Fortnite but fantasy! You can control two bodies at once! — but it wasn’t enough.

As much fun as I’m having with Highguard during the launch week, I’m also not convinced that its strategic matches, slick gunplay, and oddball fantasy setting are enough for lasting success in such a competitive space. It’s different, but not that different, and it can be hard to explain what it really is. The odds are certainly against it. So for now I’ll just enjoy the experience while it lasts — and be ready to do this all over again in March.

            <div id="article-text">The kind-hearted ICU nurse shot by ICE agents was my childhood best friend.

The kind-hearted ICU nurse shot by ICE agents was my childhood best friend.

The day Alex Pretti was shot 10 times in the street by federal agents, I was delivering a eulogy for my grandfather, who died the way we’re supposed to: old, asleep, surrounded by family. Because it’s my job to coordinate visuals for this website, I locked myself in a bathroom stall, watched a video of the shooting twice, and emailed a photographer, asking if he could get onto the streets and start documenting what was happening in Minneapolis.

As I reviewed photos of protesters and tear gas in the wake of his death, I didn’t realize, in the hours before his name was released to the public, that the man millions of people had seen lying facedown on the pavement from multiple angles of eyewitness video was my childhood best friend.

We have become familiar with being barraged by videos of people we do not know getting detained and ripped from their families and beaten by agents whose salaries we pay. As social media does its work putting bits and pieces together about each day of unfolding tragedy, more and more of us will realize that those pieces belong to someone we know.

Alex and I grew up across the street from each other in a quiet neighborhood in Green Bay, Wisconsin, a town maniacal about its football team and without much else to do. The street we lived on had recently been a field, now populated with a smattering of three-bedroom houses rapidly constructed in a treeless subdivision. I met Alex when he was three years old and I was four. Our family’s lives were exceedingly visible to each other, without fences or much foliage, and we knew the comings and goings of one another’s households.

Alex was an easy playmate: generous, curious, sweet. His mother always ensured he had a tidy haircut and a clean room. He had a little sister. He told me the truth about Santa, and I told him the truth about where babies come from.

We rollerbladed and had sleepovers, excitedly dragging our sleeping bags across the street from one house to the other. We built palatial forts in the snowdrifts after the plows went through. Lawn sprinklers in summers became portals to different realms and time periods; we ran through the strands of water with towels tied around our necks as capes. When Alex had his bedroom window open, I could hear him singing all the way from my own open window. His voice was operatic and strong, carrying above the suburban drone of leafblowers and lawnmowers. He loved mandarin oranges and macaroni and cheese, and we agreed it was especially pleasing when all the food on our plates was orange.

Over the last few days, I’ve seen a lot of posts on social media about how you don’t have to watch the video, about how it’s okay to protect yourself from it, because we don’t need to watch another public execution. But when an Associated Press journalist called his parents after their son was shot, they hadn’t heard the news. The journalist sent them the video, and they said it looked like their son.

There is something destabilizing about having known someone only as a child and then hearing they were gunned down in the street. The person you see in your mind lying in that street is still a child. I’m sure his mother feels that way, too, or she sees him at every age all at once, including those he did not live to see.

After Alex was wrestled down to the ground, and after a federal agent pulled the trigger and Alex went still, nine more shots were fired into his body. I keep reading reports that there was a struggle before the first gunshot, but all I see is a person trying to keep his head off the ground while seven masked men surround and beat him. Certainly, through his training as an ICU nurse, he knew that it was important to protect his head. Once in the old neighborhood, when he was seven or eight, he’d fallen off his bike, his helmet splitting cleanly in half like a cantaloupe. He showed the halves to all the neighbor kids as a way to warn them to never ride without one.

The lies being told about him by America’s most powerful people are flagrantly incongruous to anyone who watches the videos. He doesn’t reach for his weapon at his waistband, which he had the legal right to carry, and which an agent removed from him before they killed him. He was not approaching the officers when they pepper-sprayed him and tackled him to the ground. He was helping up a woman who those same agents had just shoved to the curb.

My family moved away as I started high school, and Alex’s mother asked to talk with me before we left. She wanted to understand how she could stay close to her son and keep him safe while still allowing him the freedom to grow as he got older. Was it okay if she asked him to check in when he went to a new location with friends, she wondered. Would those friends make fun of him, or would they recognize that he was loved?

The other video that’s gone most viral of Alex shows him providing a final salute for an ICU patient at the VA hospital where he worked. Alex speaks in a low, reverent tone before a flag-draped body, demonstrating the same compassion we saw in the footage of him helping a woman who’d been pushed to the ground by federal agents. It’s the same caring tenor of his voice in his last words: Are you okay?</div>

Starting February 2nd, Pornhub will block UK users who haven’t verified their age.

Pornhub will soon begin restricting UK users from accessing its website in response to the country’s “failed” online safety regulations, according to an announcement on Tuesday. The site’s owner, Aylo, says it will block users who haven’t already verified their age on the platform starting February 2nd, 2026, as reported earlier by 404 Media.

As part of efforts to comply with the UK’s Online Safety Act, Pornhub began requiring users in the country to provide proof of their age by uploading a government ID, entering a credit card, through their mobile network, or using another method.

The UK’s Online Safety Act became law in 2023 with the goal of preventing kids from accessing “harmful” material online. But rules mandating “strong age checks” under the legislation came into force last year, impacting porn sites and other platforms like Bluesky, Xbox, Reddit, and Discord. Many users have already found ways around this, whether it involves using a virtual private network (VPN) or tricking age-estimating face scans.

Aylo claims the Online Safety Act makes the internet “more dangerous” for children, while harming the privacy of users in the UK. “We cannot continue to operate within a system that, in our view, fails to deliver on its promise of child safety, and has had the opposite impact,” Aylo’s announcement says. “We believe this framework in practice has diverted traffic to darker, unregulated corners of the internet, and has also jeopardized the privacy and personal data of UK citizens.”

People who have already gone through the age verification process on Pornhub will still be able to access the site by logging in, while everyone else will get shut out after February 2nd, according to the post. The block will also apply to the other adult websites owned by Aylo, including YouPorn and Redtube.

Pornhub has already gone dark in nearly two dozen states across the US, including Florida, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, Utah, and others, in response to local age verification laws.

The Tech Transparency Project identified dozens of apps that can create nonconsensual sexualized deepfakes beyond xAI’s Grok.﻿

Removing or restricting access to Grok’s AI image editor might not be enough to stop the flood of nonconsensual sexualized images being generated by AI. A report from the Tech Transparency Project (TTP) released on Tuesday found dozens of AI “nudify” apps similar to Grok on Google and Apple’s platforms, as previously reported by CNBC.

TTP identified 55 apps on the Google Play Store and 48 on Apple’s App Store that can “digitally remove the clothes from women and render them completely or partially naked or clad in a bikini or other minimal clothing.” These apps were downloaded over 705 million times worldwide, generating $117 million in revenue.

According to CNBC, Google has suspended “several” of the apps TTP spotted and Apple has removed 28 of them (two of which were later restored). This is not the first report on AI nudify apps slipping through the cracks — Apple and Google had to respond to a similar report from 404 Media in 2024.

TTP’s report comes in response to calls for Apple and Google to remove X and Grok from their app stores after Grok generated millions of nonconsensual sexualized images, mainly of women and children. Grok and X are now facing investigations in the EU and in the UK, as well as a lawsuit from at least one victim.

Apple and Google have addressed the apps in TTP’s report, but X and Grok remain freely available on both companies’ app stores. As The Verge’s Elizabeth Lopatto has pointed out, Apple and Google were quick to remove the ICEBlock app, “while allowing X to generate degrading images of a woman ICE killed.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Today, an estimated 2.2 billion people still have either limited or no access to the internet, largely because they live in remote places. But that number could drop this year, thanks to tests of stratospheric airships, uncrewed aircraft, and other high-altitude platforms for internet delivery.

Even with nearly 10,000 active Starlink satellites in orbit and the OneWeb constellation of 650 satellites, solid internet coverage is not a given across vast swathes of the planet.

One of the most prominent efforts to plug the connectivity gap was Google X’s Loon project. Launched in 2011, it aimed to deliver access using high-altitude balloons stationed above predetermined spots on Earth. But the project faced literal headwinds—the Loons kept drifting away and new ones had to be released constantly, making the venture economically unfeasible.

Although Google shuttered the high-profile Loon in 2021, work on other kinds of high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) has continued behind the scenes. Now, several companies claim they have solved Loon’s problems with different designs—in particular, steerable airships and fixed-wing UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles)—and are getting ready to prove the tech’s internet beaming potential starting this year, in tests above Japan and Indonesia.

Regulators, too, seem to be thinking seriously about HAPS. In mid-December, for example, the US Federal Aviation Administration released a 50-page document outlining how large numbers of HAPS could be integrated into American airspace. According to the US Census Bureau’s 2024 American Community Survey (ACS) data, some 8 million US households (4.5% of the population) still live completely offline, and HAPS proponents think the technology might get them connected more cheaply than alternatives.

Despite the optimism of the companies involved, though, some analysts remain cautious.

“The HAPS market has been really slow and challenging to develop,” says Dallas Kasaboski, a space industry analyst at the consultancy Analysis Mason. After all, Kasaboski says, the approach has struggled before: “A few companies were very interested in it, very ambitious about it, and then it just didn’t happen.”

Hovering in the thin air at altitudes above 12 miles, HAPS have a unique vantage point to beam down low-latency, high-speed connectivity directly to smartphone users in places too remote and too sparsely populated to justify the cost of laying fiber-optic cables or building ground-based cellular base stations.

“Mobile network operators have some commitment to provide coverage, but they frequently prefer to pay a fine than cover these remote areas,” says Pierre-Antoine Aubourg, chief technology officer of Aalto HAPS, a spinoff from the European aerospace manufacturer Airbus. “With HAPS, we make this remote connectivity case profitable.”

Aalto HAPS has built a solar-powered UAV with a 25-meter wingspan that has conducted many long-duration test flights in recent years. In April 2025 the craft, called Zephyr, broke a HAPS record by staying afloat for 67 consecutive days. The first months of 2026 will be busy for the company, according to Aubourg; Zephyr will do a test run over southern Japan to trial connectivity delivery to residents of some of the country’s smallest and most poorly connected inhabited islands.

Because of its unique geography, Japan is a perfect test bed for HAPS. Many of the country’s roughly 430 inhabited islands are remote, mountainous, and sparsely populated, making them too costly to connect with terrestrial cell towers. Aalto HAPS is partnering with Japan’s largest mobile network operators, NTT DOCOMO and the telecom satellite operator Space Compass, which want to use Zephyr as part of next-generation telecommunication infrastructure.

“Non-terrestrial networks have the potential to transform Japan’s communications ecosystem, addressing access to connectivity in hard-to-reach areas while supporting our country’s response to emergencies,” Shigehiro Hori, co-CEO of Space Compass, said in a statement.

Zephyr, Aubourg explains, will function like another cell tower in the NTT DOCOMO network, only it will be located well above the planet instead of on its surface. It will beam high-speed 5G connectivity to smartphone users without the need for the specialized terminals that are usually required to receive satellite internet. “For the user on the ground, there is no difference when they switch from the terrestrial network to the HAPS network,” Aubourg says. “It’s exactly the same frequency and the same network.”

New Mexico–based Sceye, which has developed a solar-powered helium-filled airship, is also eyeing Japan for pre-commercial trials of its stratospheric connectivity service this year. The firm, which extensively tested its slick 65-meter-long vehicle in 2025, is working with the Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank. Just like NTT DOCOMO, Softbank is betting on HAPS to take its networks to another level.

Mikkel Frandsen, Sceye’s founder and CEO, says that his firm succeeded where Loon failed by betting on the advantages offered by the more controllable airship shape, intelligent avionics, and innovative batteries that can power an electric fan to keep the aircraft in place.

“Google’s Loon was groundbreaking, but they used a balloon form factor, and despite advanced algorithms—and the ability to change altitude to find desired wind directions and wind speeds—Loon’s system relied on favorable winds to stay over a target area, resulting in unpredictable station-seeking performance,” Frandsen says. “This required a large amount of balloons in the air to have relative certainty that one would stay over the area of operation, which was financially unviable.”

He adds that Sceye’s airship can “point into the wind” and more effectively maintain its position.

“We have significant surface area, providing enough physical space to lift 250-plus kilograms and host solar panels and batteries,” he says, “allowing Sceye to maintain power through day-night cycles, and therefore staying over an area of operation while maintaining altitude.”

Satellite internet currently comes at a price tag that can be too high for people in developing countries, says Kasaboski. For example, Starlink subscriptions start at $10 per month in Africa, but millions of people in these regions are surviving on a mere $2 a day.

Frandsen and Aubourg both claim that HAPS can connect the world’s unconnected more cheaply. Because satellites in low Earth orbit circle the planet at very high speeds, they quickly disappear from a ground terminal&#39;s view, meaning large quantities of those satellites are needed to provide continuous coverage. HAPS can hover, affording a constant view of a region, and more HAPS can be launched to meet higher demand.

“If you want to deliver connectivity with a low-Earth-orbit constellation into one place, you still need a complete constellation,” says Aubourg. “We can deliver connectivity with one aircraft to one location. And then we can tailor much more the size of the fleet according to the market coverage that we need.”

Starlink gets a lot of attention, but satellite internet has some major drawbacks, says Frandsen. A big one is that its bandwidth gets diluted once the number of users in an area grows.

In a recent interview, Starlink cofounder Elon Musk compared the Starlink beams to a flashlight. Given the distance at which those satellites orbit the planet, the cone is wide, covering a large area. That’s okay when users are few and far between, but it can become a problem with higher densities of users.

For example, Ukrainian defense technologists have said that Starlink bandwidth can drop on the front line to a mere 10 megabits per second, compared with the peak offering of 220 Mbps when drones and ground robots are in heavy use. Users in Indonesia, which like Japan is an island nation, also began reporting problems with Starlink shortly after the service was introduced in the country in 2024. Again, bandwidth declined as the number of subscribers grew.

In fact, Frandsen says, Starlink’s performance is less than optimal once the number of users exceeds one person per square kilometer. And that can happen almost anywhere—even relatively isolated island communities can have hundreds or thousands of residents in a small area. “There is a relationship between the altitude and the population you can serve,” Frandsen says. “You can’t bring space closer to the surface of the planet. So the telco companies want to use the stratosphere so that they can get out to more rural populations than they could otherwise serve.” Starlink did not respond to our queries about these challenges.

Sceye and Aalto HAPS see their stratospheric vehicles as part of integrated telecom networks that include both terrestrial cell towers and satellites. But they’re far from the only game in town.

World Mobile, a telecommunications company headquartered in London, thinks its hydrogen-powered high-altitude UAV can compete directly with satellite mega-constellations. The company acquired the HAPS developer Stratospheric Platforms last year. This year, it plans to flight-test an innovative phased array antenna, which it claims will be able to deliver bandwidth of 200 megabits per second (enough to enable ultra-HD video streaming to 500,000 users at the same time over an area of 15,000 square kilometers—equivalent to the coverage of more than 500 terrestrial cell towers, the company says).

Last year, World Mobile also signed a partnership with the Indonesian telecom operator Protelindo to build a prototype Stratomast aircraft, with tests scheduled to begin in late 2027.

Richard Deakin, CEO of World Mobile’s HAPS division World Mobile Stratospheric, says that just nine Stratomasts could supply Scotland’s 5.5 million residents with high-speed internet connectivity at a cost of £40 million ($54 million) per year. That’s equivalent to about 60 pence (80 cents) per person per month, he says. Starlink subscriptions in the UK, of which Scotland is a part, come at £75 ($100) per month.

Companies working on HAPS also extol the convenience of prompt deployments in areas struck by war or natural disasters like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, after which Loon played an important role. And they say that HAPS could make it possible for smaller nations to obtain complete control over their celestial internet-beaming infrastructure rather than relying on mega-constellations controlled by larger nations, a major boon at a time of rising geopolitical tensions and crumbling political alliances.

Analysts, however, remain cautious, projecting a HAPS market totaling a modest $1.9 billion by 2033. The satellite internet industry, on the other hand, is expected to be worth $33.44 billion by 2030, according to some estimates.

The use of HAPS for internet delivery to remote locations has been explored since the 1990s, about as long as the concept of low-Earth-orbit mega-constellations. The seemingly more cost-effective stratospheric technology, however, lost to the space fleets thanks to the falling cost of space launches and ambitious investment by Musk’s SpaceX.

Google wasn’t the only tech giant to explore the HAPS idea. Facebook also had a project, called Aquila, that was discontinued after it too faced technical difficulties. Although the current cohort of HAPS makers claim they have solved the challenges that killed their predecessors, Kasaboski warns that they’re playing a different game: catching up with now-established internet-beaming mega constellations. By the end of this year, it’ll be much clearer whether they stand a good chance of doing so.

Humans have long dreamed of living among the stars, and for two decades hundreds of us have done so aboard the International Space Station (ISS). But a new era is about to begin in which private companies operate orbital outposts—with the promise of much greater access to space than before.

The ISS is aging and is expected to be brought down from orbit into the ocean in 2031. To replace it, NASA has awarded more than $500 million to several companies to develop private space stations, while others have built versions on their own. Read why we made them one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year, and check out the rest of the list.

Why one developer won’t quit fighting to connect the US’s gridsMichael Skelly hasn’t learned to take no for an answer. For much of the last 15 years, the energy entrepreneur has worked to develop long-haul transmission lines to carry wind power across the Great Plains, Midwest, and Southwest. But so far, he has little to show for the effort.

Skelly has long argued that building such lines and linking together the nation’s grids would accelerate the shift from coal- and natural-gas-fueled power plants to the renewables needed to cut the pollution driving climate change. But his previous business shut down in 2019, after halting two of its projects and selling off interests in three more.

Skelly contends he was early, not wrong. And he has a point: markets and policymakers are increasingly coming around to his perspective. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">In the three years since ChatGPT’s explosive debut, OpenAI’s technology has upended a remarkable range of everyday activities at home, at work, in schools—anywhere people have a browser open or a phone out, which is everywhere.

Now OpenAI is making an explicit play for scientists. In October, the firm announced that it had launched a whole new team, called OpenAI for Science, dedicated to exploring how its large language models could help scientists and tweaking its tools to support them.

The last couple of months have seen a slew of social media posts and academic publications in which mathematicians, physicists, biologists, and others have described how LLMs (and OpenAI’s GPT-5 in particular) have helped them make a discovery or nudged them toward a solution they might otherwise have missed. In part, OpenAI for Science was set up to engage with this community.

And yet OpenAI is also late to the party. Google DeepMind, the rival firm behind groundbreaking scientific models such as AlphaFold and AlphaEvolve, has had an AI-for-science team for years. (When I spoke to Google DeepMind’s CEO and cofounder Demis Hassabis in 2023 about that team, he told me: “This is the reason I started DeepMind … In fact, it’s why I’ve worked my whole career in AI.”)

So why now? How does a push into science fit with OpenAI’s wider mission? And what exactly is the firm hoping to achieve?

I put these questions to Kevin Weil, a vice president at OpenAI who leads the new OpenAI for Science team, in an exclusive interview last week.

Weil is a product guy. He joined OpenAI a couple of years ago as chief product officer after being head of product at Twitter and Instagram. But he started out as a scientist. He got two-thirds of the way through a PhD in particle physics at Stanford University before ditching academia for the Silicon Valley dream. Weil is keen to highlight his pedigree: “I thought I was going to be a physics professor for the rest of my life,” he says. “I still read math books on vacation.”

Asked how OpenAI for Science fits with the firm’s existing lineup of white-collar productivity tools or the viral video app Sora, Weil recites the company mantra: “The mission of OpenAI is to try and build artificial general intelligence and, you know, make it beneficial for all of humanity.”

Just imagine the future impact this technology could have on science he says: New medicines, new materials, new devices. “Think about it helping us understand the nature of reality, helping us think through open problems. Maybe the biggest, most positive impact we’re going to see from AGI will actually be from its ability to accelerate science.”

He adds: “With GPT-5, we saw that becoming possible.”

As Weil tells it, LLMs are now good enough to be useful scientific collaborators. They can spitball ideas, suggest novel directions to explore, and find fruitful parallels between new problems and old solutions published in obscure journals decades ago or in foreign languages.

That wasn’t the case a year or so ago. Since it announced its first so-called reasoning model—a type of LLM that can break down problems into multiple steps and work through them one by one—in December 2024, OpenAI has been pushing the envelope of what the technology can do. Reasoning models have made LLMs far better at solving math and logic problems than they used to be. “You go back a few years and we were all collectively mind-blown that the models could get an 800 on the SAT,” says Weil.

But soon LLMs were acing math competitions and solving graduate-level physics problems. Last year, OpenAI and Google DeepMind both announced that their LLMs had achieved gold-medal-level performance in the International Math Olympiad, one of the toughest math contests in the world. “These models are no longer just better than 90% of grad students,” says Weil. “They’re really at the frontier of human abilities.”

That’s a huge claim, and it comes with caveats. Still, there’s no doubt that GPT-5, which includes a reasoning model,  is a big improvement on GPT-4 when it comes to complicated problem-solving. Measured against an industry benchmark known as GPQA, which includes more than 400 multiple-choice questions that test PhD-level knowledge in biology, physics, and chemistry, GPT-4 scores 39%, well below the human-expert baseline of around 70%. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 (the latest update to the model, released in December) scores 92%.

The excitement is evident—and perhaps excessive. In October, senior figures at OpenAI, including Weil, boasted on X that GPT-5 had found solutions to several unsolved math problems. Mathematicians were quick to point out that in fact what GPT-5 appeared to have done was dig up existing solutions in old research papers, including at least one written in German. That was still useful, but it wasn’t the achievement OpenAI seemed to have claimed. Weil and his colleagues deleted their posts.

Now Weil is more careful. It is often enough to find answers that exist but have been forgotten, he says: “We collectively stand on the shoulders of giants, and if LLMs can kind of accumulate that knowledge so that we don’t spend time struggling on a problem that is already solved, that’s an acceleration all of its own.”

He plays down the idea that LLMs are about to come up with a game-changing new discovery. “I don’t think models are there yet,” he says. “Maybe they’ll get there. I’m optimistic that they will.”

But, he insists, that’s not the mission: “Our mission is to accelerate science. And I don’t think the bar for the acceleration of science is, like, Einstein-level reimagining of an entire field.”

For Weil, the question is this: “Does science actually happen faster because scientists plus models can do much more, and do it more quickly, than scientists alone? I think we’re already seeing that.”

In November, OpenAI published a series of anecdotal case studies contributed by scientists, both inside and outside the company, that illustrated how they had used GPT-5 and how it had helped. “Most of the cases were scientists that were already using GPT-5 directly in their research and had come to us one way or another saying, ‘Look at what I’m able to do with these tools,’” says Weil.

The key things that GPT-5 seems to be good at are finding references and connections to existing work that scientists were not aware of, which sometimes sparks new ideas; helping scientists sketch mathematical proofs; and suggesting ways for scientists to test hypotheses in the lab.

“GPT 5.2 has read substantially every paper written in the last 30 years,” says Weil. “And it understands not just the field that a particular scientist is working in; it can bring together analogies from other, unrelated fields.”

“That’s incredibly powerful,” he continues. “You can always find a human collaborator in an adjacent field, but it’s difficult to find, you know, a thousand collaborators in all thousand adjacent fields that might matter. And in addition to that, I can work with the model late at night—it doesn’t sleep—and I can ask it 10 things in parallel, which is kind of awkward to do to a human.”

Most of the scientists OpenAI reached out to back up Weil’s position.

Robert Scherrer, a professor of physics and astronomy at Vanderbilt University, only played around with ChatGPT for fun (“I used to it rewrite the theme song for Gilligan’s Island in the style of Beowulf, which it did very well,” he tells me) until his Vanderbilt colleague Alex Lupsasca, a fellow physicist who now works at OpenAI, told him that GPT-5 had helped solve a problem he’d been working on.

Lupsasca gave Scherrer access to GPT-5 Pro, OpenAI’s $200-a-month premium subscription. “It managed to solve a problem that I and my graduate student could not solve despite working on it for several months,” says Scherrer.

It’s not perfect, he says: “GTP-5 still makes dumb mistakes. Of course, I do too, but the mistakes GPT-5 makes are even dumber.” And yet it keeps getting better, he says: “If current trends continue—and that’s a big if—I suspect that all scientists will be using LLMs soon.”

Derya Unutmaz, a professor of biology at the Jackson Laboratory, a nonprofit research institute, uses GPT-5 to brainstorm ideas, summarize papers, and plan experiments in his work studying the immune system. In the case study he shared with OpenAI, Unutmaz used GPT-5 to analyze an old data set that his team had previously looked at. The model came up with fresh insights and interpretations.

“LLMs are already essential for scientists,” he says. “When you can complete analysis of data sets that used to take months, not using them is not an option anymore.”

Nikita Zhivotovskiy, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley, says he has been using LLMs in his research since the first version of ChatGPT came out.

Like Scherrer, he finds LLMs most useful when they highlight unexpected connections between his own work and existing results he did not know about. “I believe that LLMs are becoming an essential technical tool for scientists, much like computers and the internet did before,” he says. “I expect a long-term disadvantage for those who do not use them.”

But he does not expect LLMs to make novel discoveries anytime soon. “I have seen very few genuinely fresh ideas or arguments that would be worth a publication on their own,” he says. “So far, they seem to mainly combine existing results, sometimes incorrectly, rather than produce genuinely new approaches.”

I also contacted a handful of scientists who are not connected to OpenAI.

Andy Cooper, a professor of chemistry at the University of Liverpool and director of the Leverhulme Research Centre for Functional Materials Design, is less enthusiastic. “We have not found, yet, that LLMs are fundamentally changing the way that science is done,” he says. “But our recent results suggest that they do have a place.”

Cooper is leading a project to develop a so-called AI scientist that can fully automate parts of the scientific workflow. He says that his team doesn’t use LLMs to come up with ideas. But the tech is starting to prove useful as part of a wider automated system where an LLM can help direct robots, for example.

“My guess is that LLMs might stick more in robotic workflows, at least initially, because I’m not sure that people are ready to be told what to do by an LLM,” says Cooper. “I’m certainly not.”

LLMs may be becoming more and more useful, but caution is still key. In December, Jonathan Oppenheim, a scientist who works on quantum mechanics, called out a mistake that had made its way into a scientific journal. “OpenAI leadership are promoting a paper in Physics Letters B where GPT-5 proposed the main idea—possibly the first peer-reviewed paper where an LLM generated the core contribution,” Oppenheim posted on X. “One small problem: GPT-5’s idea tests the wrong thing.”

He continued: “GPT-5 was asked for a test that detects nonlinear theories. It provided a test that detects nonlocal ones. Related-sounding, but different. It’s like asking for a COVID test, and the LLM cheerfully hands you a test for chickenpox.”

It is clear that a lot of scientists are finding innovative and intuitive ways to engage with LLMs. It is also clear that the technology makes mistakes that can be so subtle even experts miss them.

Part of the problem is the way ChatGPT can flatter you into letting down your guard. As Oppenheim put it: “A core issue is that LLMs are being trained to validate the user, while science needs tools that challenge us.” In an extreme case, one individual (who was not a scientist) was persuaded by ChatGPT into thinking for months that he’d invented a new branch of mathematics.

Of course, Weil is well aware of the problem of hallucination. But he insists that newer models are hallucinating less and less. Even so, focusing on hallucination might be missing the point, he says.

“One of my teammates here, an ex math professor, said something that stuck with me,” says Weil. “He said: ‘When I’m doing research, if I’m bouncing ideas off a colleague, I’m wrong 90% of the time and that’s kind of the point. We’re both spitballing ideas and trying to find something that works.’”

“That’s actually a desirable place to be,” says Weil. “If you say enough wrong things and then somebody stumbles on a grain of truth and then the other person seizes on it and says, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s not quite right, but what if we—’ You gradually kind of find your trail through the woods.”

This is Weil’s core vision for OpenAI for Science. GPT-5 is good, but it is not an oracle. The value of this technology is in pointing people in new directions, not coming up with definitive answers, he says.

In fact, one of the things OpenAI is now looking at is making GPT-5 dial down its confidence when it delivers a response. Instead of saying Here’s the answer, it might tell scientists: Here’s something to consider.

“That’s actually something that we are spending a bunch of time on,” says Weil. “Trying to make sure that the model has some sort of epistemological humility.”

Another thing OpenAI is looking at is how to use GPT-5 to fact-check GPT-5. It’s often the case that if you feed one of GPT-5’s answers back into the model, it will pick it apart and highlight mistakes.

“You can kind of hook the model up as its own critic,” says Weil. “Then you can get a workflow where the model is thinking and then it goes to another model, and if that model finds things that it could improve, then it passes it back to the original model and says, ‘Hey, wait a minute—this part wasn’t right, but this part was interesting. Keep it.’ It’s almost like a couple of agents working together and you only see the output once it passes the critic.”

What Weil is describing also sounds a lot like what Google DeepMind did with AlphaEvolve, a tool that wrapped the firms LLM, Gemini, inside a wider system that filtered out the good responses from the bad and fed them back in again to be improved on. Google DeepMind has used AlphaEvolve to solve several real-world problems.

OpenAI faces stiff competition from rival firms, whose own LLMs can do most, if not all, of the things it claims for its own models. If that’s the case, why should scientists use GPT-5 instead of Gemini or Anthropic’s Claude, families of models that are themselves improving every year? Ultimately, OpenAI for Science may be as much an effort to plant a flag in new territory as anything else. The real innovations are still to come.

“I think 2026 will be for science what 2025 was for software engineering,” says Weil. “At the beginning of 2025, if you were using AI to write most of your code, you were an early adopter. Whereas 12 months later, if you’re not using AI to write most of your code, you’re probably falling behind. We’re now seeing those same early flashes for science as we did for code.”

He continues: “I think that in a year, if you’re a scientist and you’re not heavily using AI, you’ll be missing an opportunity to increase the quality and pace of your thinking.”

How do tech companies check if their users are kids?

This question has taken on new urgency recently thanks to growing concern about the dangers that can arise when children talk to AI chatbots. For years Big Tech asked for birthdays (that one could make up) to avoid violating child privacy laws, but they weren’t required to moderate content accordingly. Two developments over the last week show how quickly things are changing in the US and how this issue is becoming a new battleground, even among parents and child-safety advocates.

In one corner is the Republican Party, which has supported laws passed in several states that require sites with adult content to verify users’ ages. Critics say this provides cover to block anything deemed “harmful to minors,” which could include sex education. Other states, like California, are coming after AI companies with laws to protect kids who talk to chatbots (by requiring them to verify who’s a kid). Meanwhile, President Trump is attempting to keep AI regulation a national issue rather than allowing states to make their own rules. Support for various bills in Congress is constantly in flux.

So what might happen? The debate is quickly moving away from whether age verification is necessary and toward who will be responsible for it. This responsibility is a hot potato that no company wants to hold.

In a blog post last Tuesday, OpenAI revealed that it plans to roll out automatic age prediction. In short, the company will apply a model that uses factors like the time of day, among others, to predict whether a person chatting is under 18. For those identified as teens or children, ChatGPT will apply filters to “reduce exposure” to content like graphic violence or sexual role-play. YouTube launched something similar last year.

If you support age verification but are concerned about privacy, this might sound like a win. But there&#39;s a catch. The system is not perfect, of course, so it could classify a child as an adult or vice versa. People who are wrongly labeled under 18 can verify their identity by submitting a selfie or government ID to a company called Persona.

Selfie verifications have issues: They fail more often for people of color and those with certain disabilities. Sameer Hinduja, who co-directs the Cyberbullying Research Center, says the fact that Persona will need to hold millions of government IDs and masses of biometric data is another weak point. “When those get breached, we’ve exposed massive populations all at once,” he says.

Hinduja instead advocates for device-level verification, where a parent specifies a child’s age when setting up the child’s phone for the first time. This information is then kept on the device and shared securely with apps and websites.

That’s more or less what Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, recently lobbied US lawmakers to call for. Cook was fighting lawmakers who wanted to require app stores to verify ages, which would saddle Apple with lots of liability.

More signals of where this is all headed will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Trade Commission—the agency that would be responsible for enforcing these new laws—is holding an all-day workshop on age verification. Apple’s head of government affairs, Nick Rossi, will be there. He’ll be joined by higher-ups in child safety at Google and Meta, as well as a company that specializes in marketing to children.

The FTC has become increasingly politicized under President Trump (his firing of the sole Democratic commissioner was struck down by a federal court, a decision that is now pending review by the US Supreme Court). In July, I wrote about signals that the agency is softening its stance toward AI companies. Indeed, in December, the FTC overturned a Biden-era ruling against an AI company that allowed people to flood the internet with fake product reviews, writing that it clashed with President Trump’s AI Action Plan.

Wednesday’s workshop may shed light on how partisan the FTC’s approach to age verification will be. Red states favor laws that require porn websites to verify ages (but critics warn this could be used to block a much wider range of content). Bethany Soye, a Republican state representative who is leading an effort to pass such a bill in her state of South Dakota, is scheduled to speak at the FTC meeting. The ACLU generally opposes laws requiring IDs to visit websites and has instead advocated for an expansion of existing parental controls.

While all this gets debated, though, AI has set the world of child safety on fire. We’re dealing with increased generation of child sexual abuse material, concerns (and lawsuits) about suicides and self-harm following chatbot conversations, and troubling evidence of kids’ forming attachments to AI companions. Colliding stances on privacy, politics, free expression, and surveillance will complicate any effort to find a solution. Write to me with your thoughts.

            <h2>The power of sound in a virtual world</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/26/1124655/the-power-of-sound-in-a-virtual-world/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In an era where business, education, and even casual conversations occur via screens, sound has become a differentiating factor. We obsess over lighting, camera angles, and virtual backgrounds, but how we sound can be just as critical to credibility, trust, and connection.

That’s the insight driving Erik Vaveris, vice president of product management and chief marketing officer at Shure, and Brian Scholl, director of the Perception & Cognition Laboratory at Yale University. Both see audio as more than a technical layer: It’s a human factor shaping how people perceive intelligence, trustworthiness, and authority in virtual settings.

&quot;If you&#39;re willing to take a little bit of time with your audio set up, you can really get across the full power of your message and the full power of who you are to your peers, to your employees, your boss, your suppliers, and of course, your customers,&quot; says Vaveris.

Scholl’s research shows that poor audio quality can make a speaker seem less persuasive, less hireable, and even less credible.

&quot;We know that [poor] sound doesn&#39;t reflect the people themselves, but we really just can&#39;t stop ourselves from having those impressions,&quot; says Scholl. &quot;We all understand intuitively that if we&#39;re having difficulty being understood while we&#39;re talking, then that&#39;s bad. But we sort of think that as long as you can make out the words I&#39;m saying, then that&#39;s probably all fine. And this research showed in a somewhat surprising way, to a surprising degree, that this is not so.&quot;

For organizations navigating hybrid work, training, and marketing, the stakes have become high.

Vaveris points out that the pandemic was a watershed moment for audio technology. As classrooms, boardrooms, and conferences shifted online almost overnight, demand accelerated for advanced noise suppression, echo cancellation, and AI-driven processing tools that make meetings more seamless. Today, machine learning algorithms can strip away keyboard clicks or reverberation and isolate a speaker’s voice in noisy environments. That clarity underpins the accuracy of AI meeting assistants that can step in to transcribe, summarize, and analyze discussions.

The implications across industries are rippling. Clearer audio levels the playing field for remote participants, enabling inclusive collaboration. It empowers executives and creators alike to produce broadcast-quality content from the comfort of their home office. And it offers companies new ways to build credibility with customers and employees without the costly overhead of traditional production.

Looking forward, the convergence of audio innovation and AI promises an even more dynamic landscape: from real-time captioning in your native language to audio filtering, to smarter meeting tools that capture not only what is said but how it’s said, and to technologies that disappear into the background while amplifying the human voice at the center.

&quot;There&#39;s a future out there where this technology can really be something that helps bring people together,&quot; says Vaveris. &quot;Now that we have so many years of history with the internet, we know there&#39;s usually two sides to the coin of technology, but there&#39;s definitely going to be a positive side to this, and I&#39;m really looking forward to it.

In a world increasingly mediated by screens, sound may prove to be the most powerful connector of all.

This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Shure.

Megan Tatum: From MIT Technology Review, I&#39;m Megan Tatum, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.This episode is produced in partnership with Shure.Our topic today is the power of sound. As our personal and professional lives become increasingly virtual, audio is emerging as an essential tool for everything from remote work to virtual conferences to virtual happy hour. While appearance is often top of mind in video conferencing and streaming, audio can be as or even more important, not only to effective communication, but potentially to brand equity for both the speaker and the company.Two words for you: crystal clear.My guests today are Erik Vaveris, VP of Product Management and Chief Marketing Officer at Shure, and Brian Scholl, Director of the Perception & Cognition Laboratory at Yale University.Welcome, Erik and Brian.

Erik Vaveris: Thank you, Megan. And hello, Brian. Thrilled to be here today.

Megan: Fantastic. Thank you both so much for being here. Erik, let&#39;s open with a bit of background. I imagine the pandemic changed the audio industry in some significant ways, given the pivot to our modern remote hybrid lifestyles. Could you talk a bit about that journey and some of the interesting audio advances that arose from that transformative shift?

Erik: Absolutely, Megan. That&#39;s an interesting thing to think about now being here in 2025. And if you put yourself back in those moments in 2020, when things were fully shut down and everything was fully remote, the importance of audio quality became immediately obvious. As people adopted Zoom or Teams or platforms like that overnight, there were a lot of technical challenges that people experienced, but the importance of how they were presenting themselves to people via their audio quality was a bit less obvious. As Brian&#39;s noted in a lot of the press that he&#39;s received for his wonderful study, we know how we look on video. We can see ourselves back on the screen, but we don&#39;t know how we sound to the people with whom we&#39;re speaking.

If a meeting participant on the other side can manage to parse the words that you&#39;re saying, they&#39;re not likely to speak up and say, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m having a little bit of trouble hearing you.&quot; They&#39;ll just let the meeting continue. And if you don&#39;t have a really strong level of audio quality, you&#39;re asking the people that you&#39;re talking to devote way too much brainpower to just determining the words that you&#39;re saying. And you&#39;re going to be fatiguing to listen to. And your message won&#39;t come across. In contrast, if you&#39;re willing to take a little bit of time with your audio set up, you can really get across the full power of your message and the full power of who you are to your peers, to your employees, your boss, your suppliers, and of course your customers. Back in 2020, this very quickly became a marketing story that we had to tell immediately.

And I have to say, it&#39;s so gratifying to see Brian&#39;s research in the news because, to me, it was like, &quot;Yes, this is what we&#39;ve been experiencing. And this is what we&#39;ve been trying to educate people about.&quot; Having the real science to back it up means a lot. But from that, development on improvements to key audio processing algorithms accelerated across the whole AV industry.

I think, Megan and Brian, you probably remember hearing loud keyboard clicking when you were on calls and meetings, or people eating potato chips and things like that back on those. But you don&#39;t hear that much today because most platforms have invested in AI-trained algorithms to remove undesirable noises. And I know we&#39;re going to talk more about that later on.

But the other thing that happened, thankfully, was that as we got into the late spring and summer of 2020, was that educational institutions, especially universities, and also businesses realized that things were going to need to change quickly. Nothing was going to be the same. And universities realized that all classrooms were going to need hybrid capabilities for both remote students and students in the classroom. And that helped the market for professional AV equipment start to recover because we had been pretty much completely shut down in the earlier months. But that focus on hybrid meeting spaces of all types accelerated more investment and more R&D into making equipment and further developing those key audio processing algorithms for more and different types of spaces and use cases. And since then, we&#39;ve really seen a proliferation of different types of unobtrusive audio capture devices based on arrays of microphones and the supporting signal processing behind them. And right now, machine-learning-trained signal processing is really the norm. And that all accelerated, unfortunately, because of the pandemic.

Megan: Yeah. Such an interesting period of change, as you say. And Brian, what did you observe and experience in academia during that time? How did that time period affect the work at your lab?

Brian: I&#39;ll admit, Megan, I had never given a single thought to audio quality or anything like that, certainly until the pandemic hit. I was thrown into this, just like the rest of the world was. I don&#39;t believe I&#39;d ever had a single video conference with a student or with a class or anything like that before the pandemic hit. But in some ways, our experience in universities was quite extreme. I went on a Tuesday from teaching an in-person class with 300 students to being on Zoom with everyone suddenly on a Thursday. Business meetings come in all shapes and sizes. But this was quite extreme. This was a case where suddenly I&#39;m talking to hundreds and hundreds of people over Zoom. And every single one of them knows exactly what I sound like, except for me, because I&#39;m just speaking my normal voice and I have no idea how it&#39;s being translated through all the different levels of technology.

I will say, part of the general rhetoric we have about the pandemic focuses on all the negatives and the lack of personal connection and nuance and the fact that we can&#39;t see how everyone&#39;s paying attention to each other. Our experience was a bit more mixed. I&#39;ll just tell you one anecdote. Shortly after the pandemic started, I started teaching a seminar with about 20 students. And of course, this was still online. What I did is I just invited, for whatever topic we were discussing on any given day, I sent a note to whoever was the clear world leader in the study of whatever that topic was. I said, &quot;Hey, don&#39;t prepare a talk. You don&#39;t have to answer any questions. But just come join us on Zoom and just participate in the conversation. The students will have read some of your work.&quot;

Every single one of them said, &quot;Let me check my schedule. Oh, I&#39;m stuck at home for a year. Sure. I&#39;d be happy to do that.&quot; And that was quite a positive. The students got to meet a who&#39;s who of cognitive science from this experience. And it&#39;s true that there were all these technological difficulties, but that would never, ever have happened if we were teaching the class in real life. That would&#39;ve just been way too much travel and airfare and hotel and scheduling and all of that. So, it was a mixed bag for us.

Erik: That is really interesting. And that&#39;s such a cool idea. And it&#39;s so wonderful that that worked out. I would say that working for a global company, we like to think that, &quot;Oh, we&#39;re all together. And we&#39;re having these meetings. And we&#39;re in the same room,&quot; but the reality was we weren&#39;t in the same room. And there hadn&#39;t been enough attention paid to the people who were conferencing in speaking not their native language in a different time zone, maybe pretty deep into the evening, in some cases. And the remote work that everybody got thrown into immediately at the start of the pandemic did force everybody to start to think more about those types of interactions and put everybody on a level playing field.

And that was insightful. And that helped some people have stronger voices in the work that we were doing than they maybe did before. And it&#39;s also led businesses really across the board, there&#39;s a lot written about this, to be much more focused on making sure that participants from those who may be remote at home, may be in the office, may be in different offices, may be in different time zones, are all able to participate and collaborate on really a level playing field. And that is a positive. That&#39;s a good thing.

Megan: Yeah. There are absolutely some positive side effects there, aren&#39;t there? And it inspired you, Brian, to look at this more closely. And you&#39;ve done a study that shows poor audio quality can actually affect the perception of listeners. So, I wonder what prompted the study, in particular. And what kinds of data did you gather? What methodology did you use?

Brian: Yeah. The motivation for this study was actually a real-world experience, just like we&#39;ve been talking about. In addition to all of our classes moving online with no notice whatsoever, the same thing was true of our departmental faculty meetings. Very early on in the pandemic, we had one of these meetings. And we were talking about some contentious issue about hiring or whatever. And two of my colleagues, who I&#39;d known very well and for many, many years, spoke up to offer their opinions. And one of these colleagues is someone who I&#39;m very close with. We almost always see eye to eye. He was actually a former graduate student of mine once upon a time. And we almost always see eye to eye on things. He happened to be participating in that meeting from an old not-so-hot laptop. His audio quality had that sort of familiar tinny quality that we&#39;re all familiar with. I could totally understand everything he was saying, but I found myself just being a little skeptical.

I didn&#39;t find his points so compelling as usual. Meanwhile, I had another colleague, someone who I deeply respect, I&#39;ve collaborated with, but we don&#39;t always see eye to eye on these things. And he was participating in this first virtual faculty meeting from his home recording studio. Erik, I don&#39;t know if his equipment would be up to your level or not, but he sounded better than real life. He sounded like he was all around us. And I found myself just sort of naturally agreeing with his points, which sort of was notable and a little surprising in that context. And so, we turned this into a study.

We played people a number of short audio clips, maybe like 30 seconds or so. And we had these being played in the context of very familiar situations and decisions. One of them might be like a hiring decision. You would have to listen to this person telling you why they think they might be a good fit for your job. And then afterwards, you had to make a simple judgment. It might be of a trait. How intelligent did that person seem? Or it might be a real-world decision like, &quot;Hey, based on this, how likely would you be to pursue trying to hire them?&quot; And critically, we had people listen to exactly the same sort of scripts, but with a little bit of work behind the scenes to affect the audio quality. In one case, the audio sounded crisp and clear. Recorded with a decent microphone. And here&#39;s what it sounded like.

Audio Clip: After eight years in sales, I&#39;m currently seeking a new challenge which will utilize my meticulous attention to detail and friendly professional manner. I&#39;m an excellent fit for your company and will be an asset to your team as a senior sales manager.

Brian: Okay. Whatever you think of the content of that message, at least it&#39;s nice and clear. Other subjects listened to exactly the same recording. But again, it had that sort of tinny quality that we&#39;re all familiar with when people&#39;s voices are filtered through a microphone or a recording setup that&#39;s not so hot. That sounded like this.

Audio Clip: After eight years in sales, I&#39;m currently seeking a new challenge which will utilize my meticulous attention to detail and friendly professional manner. I&#39;m an excellent fit for your company and will be an asset to your team as a senior sales manager.

Brian: All right. Now, the thing that I hope you can get from that recording there is that although it clearly has this what we would call, as a technical term, a disfluent sound, it&#39;s just a little harder to process, you are ultimately successful, right? Megan, Erik, you were able to understand the words in that second recording.

Brian: And we made sure this was true for all of our subjects. We had them do word-for-word transcription after they made these judgments. And I&#39;ll also just point out that this kind of manipulation clearly can&#39;t be about the person themselves, right? You couldn&#39;t make your voices sound like that in real world conversation if you tried. Voices just don&#39;t do those sorts of things. Nevertheless, in a way that sort of didn&#39;t make sense, that was kind of irrational because this couldn&#39;t reflect the person, this affected all sorts of judgments about people.

So, people were judged to be about 8% less hirable. They were judged to be about 8% less intelligent. We also did this in other contexts. We did this in the context of dateability as if you were listening to a little audio clip from someone who was maybe interested in dating you, and then you had to make a judgment of how likely would you be to date this person. Same exact result. People were a little less datable when their audio was a little more tinny, even though they were completely understandable.

The experiment, the result that I thought was in some ways most striking is one of the clips was about someone who had been in a car accident. It was a little narrative about what had happened in the car accident. And they were talking as if to the insurance agent. They were saying, &quot;Hey, it wasn&#39;t my fault. This is what happened.&quot; And afterwards, we simply had people make a natural intuitive judgment of how credible do you think the person&#39;s story was. And when it was recorded with high-end audio, these messages were judged to be about 8% more credible in this context. So those are our experiments. What it shows really is something about the power of perception. We know that that sort of sound doesn&#39;t reflect the people themselves, but we really just can&#39;t stop ourselves from having those impressions made. And I don&#39;t know about you guys, but, Erik, I think you&#39;re right, that we all understand intuitively that if we&#39;re having difficulty being understood while we&#39;re talking, then that&#39;s bad. But we sort of think that as long as you can make out the words I&#39;m saying, then that&#39;s probably all fine. And this research showed in a somewhat surprising way to a surprising degree that this is not so.

Megan: From an industry perspective, Erik, what are your thoughts on those study results? Did it surprise you as well?

Erik: No, like I said, I found it very, very gratifying because we invest a lot in trying to make sure that people understand the importance of quality audio, but we kind of come about that intuitively. Our entire company is audio people. So of course, we think that. And it&#39;s our mission to help other people achieve those higher levels of audio in everything that they do, whether you&#39;re a minister at a church or you&#39;re teaching a class or you&#39;re performing on stage. When I first saw in the news about Brian&#39;s study, I think it was the NPR article that just came up in one of my feeds. I read it and it made me feel like my life&#39;s work has been validated to some extent. I wouldn&#39;t say we were surprised by it, but iIt made a lot of sense to us. Let&#39;s put it that way.

Brian: This is what we&#39;re hearing. Oh, sorry. Megan, I was going to say this is what we&#39;re hearing from a lot of the audio professionals as they&#39;re saying, &quot;Hey, you scientists, you finally caught up to us.&quot; But of course-

Brian: Erik, you&#39;re in an unusual circumstance because you guys think about audio every day. When we&#39;re on Zoom, look, I can see the little rectangle as well as you can. I can see exactly how I look like. I can check the lighting. I check my hair. We all do that every day. But I would say most people really, they use whatever microphone came with their setup, and never give a second thought to what they sound like because they don&#39;t know what they sound like.

Megan: Avoid listening to yourself back as well. I think that&#39;s common. We don&#39;t scrutinize audio as much as we should. I wonder, Erik, since the study came out, how are you seeing that research play out across industry? Can you talk a bit about the importance of strong, clear audio in today&#39;s virtual world and the challenges that companies and employees are facing as well?

Erik: Yeah. Sure, Megan. That&#39;s a great question. And studies kind of back this up, businesses understand that collaboration is the key to many things that we do. They know that that&#39;s critical. And they are investing in making the experiences for the people at work better because of that knowledge, that intuitive understanding. But there are challenges. It can be expensive. You need solutions that people who are going to walk into a room or join a meeting on their personal device, that they&#39;re motivated to use and that they can use because they&#39;re simple. You also have to overcome the barriers to investment. We in the AV industry have had to look a lot at how can we bring down the overall cost of ownership of setting up AV technology because, as we&#39;ve seen, the prices of everything that goes into making a product are not coming down.

Simplifying deployment and management is critical. Beyond just audio technology, IoT technology and cloud technology for IT teams to be able to easily deploy and manage classrooms across an entire university campus or conference rooms across a global enterprise are really, really critical. And those are quickly evolving. And integrations with more standard common IT tools are coming out. And that&#39;s one area. Another thing is just for the end user, having the same user interface in each conference room that is familiar to everyone from their personal devices is also important. For many, many years, a lot of people had the experience where, &quot;Hey, it&#39;s time we&#39;re going to actually do a conference meeting.&quot; And you might have a few rooms in your company or in your office area that could do that. And you walk into the meeting room. And how long does it take you to actually get connected to the people you&#39;re going to talk with?

There was always a joke that you&#39;d have to spend the first 15 minutes of a meeting working all of that out. And that&#39;s because the technology was fragmented and you had to do a lot of custom work to make that happen. But these days, I would say platforms like Zoom and Teams and Google and others are doing a really great job with this. If you have the latest and greatest in your meeting rooms and you know how to join from your own personal device, it&#39;s basically the same experience. And that is streamlining the process for everyone. Bringing down the costs of owning it so that companies can get to those benefits to collaboration is kind of the key.

Megan: I was going to ask if we could dive a little deeper into that kind of audio quality, the technological advancements that AI has made possible, which you did touch on slightly there, Erik. What are the most significant advancements, in your view? And how are those impacting the ways we use audio and the things we can do with it?

Erik: Okay. Let me try to break that down into-

Erik: ... a couple different sections. Yeah. No, and one that&#39;s just so exciting. Machine-learning-based digital signal processing, or DSP, is here and is the norm now. If you think about the beginning of telephones and teleconferencing, just going way back, one of the initial problems you had whenever you tried to get something out of a dedicated handset onto a table was echo. And I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all heard that at some point in our life. You need to have a way to cancel echo. But by the way, you also want people to be able to speak at the same time on both ends of a call. You get to some of those very rudimentary things. Machine learning is really supercharging those algorithms to provide better performance with fewer trade-offs, fewer artifacts in the actual audio signal.

Noise reduction has come a long way. I mentioned earlier on, keyboard sounds and the sounds of people eating, and how you just don&#39;t hear that anymore, at least I don&#39;t when I&#39;m on conference calls. But only a few years ago, that could be a major problem. The machine-learning-trained digital signal processing is in the market now and it&#39;s doing a better job than ever in removing things that you don&#39;t want from your sound. We have a new de-verberation algorithm, so if you have a reverberant room with echoes and reflections that&#39;s getting into the audio signal, that can degrade the experience there. We can remove that now. Another thing, the flip side of that is that there&#39;s also a focus on isolating the sound that you do want and the signal that you do want.

Microsoft has rolled out a voice print feature in Teams that allows you, if you&#39;re willing, to provide them with a sample of your voice. And then whenever you&#39;re talking from your device, it will take out anything else that the microphone may be picking up so that even if you&#39;re in a really noisy environment outdoors or, say, in an airport, the people that you&#39;re speaking with are going to hear you and only you. And it&#39;s pretty amazing as well. So those are some of the things that are happening today and are available today.

Another thing that&#39;s emerged from all of this is we&#39;ve been talking about how important audio quality is to the people participating in a discussion, the people speaking, the people listening, how everyone is perceived, but a new consumer, if you will, of audio in a discussion or a meeting has emerged, and that is in the form of the AI agent that can summarize meetings and create action plans, do those sorts of things. But for it to work, a clean transcription of what was said is already table stakes. It can&#39;t garbled. It can&#39;t miss key things. It needs to get it word for word, sentence for sentence throughout the entire meeting. And the ability to attribute who said what to the meeting participants, even if they&#39;re all in the same room, is quickly upon us. And the ability to detect and integrate sentiment and emotion of the participants is going to become very important as well for us to really get the full value out of those kinds of AI agents.

So audio quality is as important as ever for humans, as Brian notes, in some ways more important because this is now the normal way that we talk and meet, but it&#39;s also critical for AI agents to work properly. And it&#39;s different, right? It&#39;s a different set of considerations. And there&#39;s a lot of emerging thought and work that&#39;s going into that as well. And boy, Megan, there&#39;s so much more we could say about this beyond meetings and video conferences. AI tools to simplify the production process. And of course, there&#39;s generative AI of music content. I know that&#39;s beyond the scope of what we&#39;re talking about. But it&#39;s really pretty incredible when you look around at the work that&#39;s happening and the capabilities that are emerging.

Megan: Yeah. Absolutely. Sounds like there are so many elements to consider and work going on. It&#39;s all fascinating. Brian, what kinds of emerging capabilities and use cases around AI and audio quality are you seeing in your lab as well?

Brian: Yeah. Well, I&#39;m sorry that Brian himself was not able to be here today, but I&#39;m an AI agent.

Brian: Just kidding. The fascinating thing that we&#39;re seeing from the lab, from the study of people&#39;s impressions is that all of this technology that Erik has described, when it works best, it&#39;s completely invisible. Erik, I loved your point about not hearing potato chips being eaten or rain in the background or something like that. You&#39;re totally right. I used to notice that all the time. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve noticed that recently, but I also didn&#39;t notice that I haven&#39;t noticed that recently, right? It just kind of disappears. The interesting thing about these perceptual impressions, we&#39;re constantly drawing intuitive conclusions about people based on how they sound. And that might be a good thing or a bad thing when we&#39;re judging things like trustworthiness, for example, on the basis of a short audio clip.

But clearly, some of these things are valid, right? We can judge the size of someone or even of an animal based on how they sound, right? A chihuahua can&#39;t make the sound of a lion. A lion can&#39;t make the sound of a chihuahua. And that&#39;s always been true because we&#39;re producing audio signals that go right into each other&#39;s ears. And now, of course, everything that Erik is talking about, that&#39;s not true. It goes through all of these different layers of technology increasingly fueled by AI. But when that technology works the best way, it&#39;s as if it isn&#39;t there at all and we&#39;re just hearing each other directly.

Erik: That&#39;s the goal, right? That it&#39;s seamless open communication and we don&#39;t have to think about the technology anymore.

Brian: It&#39;s a tough business to be in, I think, though, Erik, because people have to know what&#39;s going on behind the surface in order to value it. Otherwise, we just expect it to work.

Erik: Well, that&#39;s why we try to put the logo of our products on the side of them so they show up in the videos. But yeah, it&#39;s a good point.

Megan: And we&#39;ve talked about virtual meetings and conversations quite a bit, but there&#39;s also streamed and recorded content, which are increasingly important at work as well. I wondered, Erik, if you could talk a bit about how businesses are leveraging audio in new ways for things like marketing campaigns and internal upskilling and training and areas like that?

Erik: Yeah. Well, one of the things I think we&#39;ve all seen in marketing is that not everything is a high production value commercial anymore. And there&#39;s still a place for that, for sure. But people tend to trust influencers that they follow. People search on TikTok, on YouTube for topics. Those can be the place that they start. And as technology&#39;s gotten more accessible, not just audio, but of course, the video technology too, content creators can produce satisfying content on their own or with just a couple of people with them. And Brian&#39;s study shows that it doesn&#39;t really matter what the origins of the content are for it to be compelling.

For the person delivering the message to be compelling, the audio quality does have to hit a certain level. But because the tools are simpler to use and you need less things to connect and pull together a decent production system, creator-driven content is becoming even more and more integral to a marketing campaign. And so not just what they maybe post on their Instagram page or post on LinkedIn, for example, but us as a brand being able to take that content and use that actually in paid media and things like that is all entirely possible because of the overall quality of the content. So that&#39;s something that&#39;s been a trend that&#39;s been in process really, I would say, maybe since the advent of podcasts. But it&#39;s been an evolution. And it&#39;s come a long, long way.

Another thing, and this is really interesting, and this hits home personally, but I remember when I first entered the workforce, and I hope I&#39;m not showing my age too badly here, but I remember the word processing department. And you would write down on a piece of paper, like a memo, and you would give it to the word processing department and somebody would type it up for you. That was a thing. And these days, we&#39;re seeing actually more and more video production with audio, of course, transfer to the actual producers of the content.

In my company, at Shure, we make videos for different purposes to talk about different initiatives or product launches or things that we&#39;re doing just for internal use. And right now, everybody, including our CEO, she makes these videos just at her own desk. She has a little software tool and she can show a PowerPoint and herself and speak to things. And with very, very limited amount of editing, you can put that out there. And I&#39;ve seen friends and colleagues at other companies in very high-level roles just kind of doing their own production. Being able to buy a very high quality microphone with really advanced signal processing built right in, but just plug it in via USB and have it be handled as simply as any consumer device, has made it possible to do really very useful production where you are going to actually sound good and get your message across, but without having to make such a big production out of it, which is kind of cool.

Megan: Yeah. Really democratizes access to sort of creating high quality content, doesn&#39;t it? And of course, no technology discussion is complete without a mention of return on investment, particularly nowadays. Erik, what are some ways companies can get returns on their audio tech investments as well? Where are the most common places you see cost savings?

Erik: Yeah. Well, we collaborated on a study with IDC Research. And they came up with some really interesting findings on this. And one of them was, no surprise, two-thirds or more of companies have taken action on improving their communication and collaboration technology, and even more have additional or initial investments still planned. But the ROI of those initiatives isn&#39;t really tied to the initiative itself. It&#39;s not like when you come out with a new product, you look at how that product performs, and that&#39;s the driver of your ROI. The benefits of smoother collaboration come in the form of shorter meetings, more productive meetings, better decision-making, faster decision-making, stronger teamwork. And so to build an ROI model, what IDC concluded was that you have to build your model to account for those advantages really across the enterprise or across your university, or whatever it may be, and kind of up and down the different set of activities where they&#39;re actually going to be utilized.

So that can be complex. Quantifying things can always be a challenge. But like I said, companies do seem to understand this. And I think that&#39;s because, this is just my hunch, but because everybody, including the CEO and the CFO and the whole finance department, uses and benefits from collaboration technology too. Perhaps that&#39;s one reason why the value is easier to convey. Even if they have not taken the time to articulate things like we&#39;re doing here today, they know when a meeting is good and when it&#39;s not good. And maybe that&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s helping companies to justify these investments. But it&#39;s always tricky to do ROI on projects like that. But again, focusing on the broader benefits of collaboration and breaking it down into what it means for specific activities and types of meetings, I think, is the way to go about doing that.

Megan: Absolutely. And Brian, what kinds of advancements are you seeing in the lab that perhaps one day might contribute to those cost savings?

Brian: Well, I don&#39;t know anything about cost savings, Megan. I&#39;m a college professor. I live a pure life of the mind.

Brian: ROI does not compute for me. No, I would say we are in an extremely exciting frontier right now because of AI and many different technologies. The studies that we talked about earlier, in one sense, they were broad. We explored many different traits from dating to hiring to credibility. And we isolated them in all sorts of ways we didn&#39;t talk about. We showed that it wasn&#39;t due to overall affect or pessimism or something like that. But in those studies, we really only tested one very particular set of dimensions along which an audio signal can vary, which is some sort of model of clarity. But in reality, the audio signal is so multi-dimensional. And as we&#39;re getting more and more tools these days, we can not only change audio along the lines of clarity, as we&#39;ve been talking about, but we can potentially manipulate it in all sorts of ways.

We&#39;re very interested in pushing these studies forward and in exploring how people&#39;s sort of brute impressions that they make are affected by all sorts of things. Meg and Erik, we walk around the world all the time making these judgments about people, right? You meet someone and you&#39;re like, &quot;Wow, I could really be friends with them. They seem like a great person.&quot; And you know that you&#39;re making that judgment, but you have no idea why, right? It just seems kind of intuitive. Well, in an audio signal, when you&#39;re talking to someone, you can think of, &quot;What if their signal is more bass heavy? What if it&#39;s a little more treble heavy? What if we manipulate it in this way? In that way?&quot;

When we talked about the faculty meeting that motivated this whole research program, I mentioned that my colleague, who was speaking from his home recording studio, he actually didn&#39;t sound clear like in real life. He sounded better than in real life. He sounded like he was all around us. What is the implication of that? I think there&#39;s so many different dimensions of an audio signal that we&#39;re just being able to readily control and manipulate that it&#39;s going to be very exciting to see how all of these sorts of things impact our impressions of each other.

Megan: And there may be some overlap with this as well, but I wondered if we could close with a future forward look, Brian. What are you looking forward to in emerging audio technology? What are some exciting opportunities on the horizon, perhaps related to what you were just talking about there?

Brian: Well, we&#39;re interested in studying this from a scientific perspective. Erik, you talked about how when you started. When I started doing this science, we didn&#39;t have a word processing department. We had a stone tablet department. But I hear tell that the current generation, when they send photos back and forth to each other, that they, as a matter, of course, they apply all sorts of filters-

Brian: ... to those video signals, those video or just photographic signals. We&#39;re all familiar with that. That hasn&#39;t quite happened with the audio signals yet, but I think that&#39;s coming up as well. You can imagine that you record yourself saying a little message and then you filter it this way or that way. And that&#39;s going to become the Wild West about the kinds of impressions we make on each other, especially if and when you don&#39;t know that those filters have been operating in the first place.

Megan: That&#39;s so interesting. Erik, what are you looking forward to in audio technology as well?

Erik: Well, I&#39;m still thinking about what Brian said.

Erik: I have to go back again. I&#39;ll go back to the past, maybe 15 to 20 years. And I remember at work, we had meeting rooms with the Starfish phones in the middle of the table. And I remember that we would have international meetings with our partners there that were selling our products in different countries, including in Japan and in China, and the people actually in our own company in those countries. We knew the time zone was bad. And we knew that English wasn&#39;t their native language, and tried to be as courteous as possible with written materials and things like that. But I went over to China, and I had to actually be on the other end of one of those calls. And I&#39;m a native English speaker, or at least a native Chicago dialect of American English speaker. And really understanding how challenging it was for them to participate in those meetings just hit me right between the eyes.

We&#39;ve come so far, which is wonderful. But I think of a scenario, and this is not far off, there are many companies working on this right now, where not only can you get a real time captioning in your native language, no matter what the language of the participant, you can actually hear the person who&#39;s speaking&#39;s voice manipulated into your native language.

I&#39;m never going to be a fluent Japanese or Chinese speaker, that&#39;s for sure. But I love the thought that I could actually talk with people and they could understand me as though I were speaking their native language, and that they could communicate to me and I could understand them in the way that they want to be understood. I think there&#39;s a future out there where this technology can really be something that helps bring people together. Now that we have so many years of history with the internet, we know there&#39;s usually two sides to the coin of technology, but there&#39;s definitely going to be a positive side to this, and I&#39;m really looking forward to it.

Megan: Gosh, that sounds absolutely fascinating. Thank you both so much for such an interesting discussion.

Meet the new biologists treating LLMs like aliens

How large is a large language model? We now coexist with machines so vast and so complicated that nobody quite understands what they are, how they work, or what they can really do—not even the people who build them.That’s a problem. Even though nobody fully understands how it works—and thus exactly what its limitations might be—hundreds of millions of people now use this technology every day.

To help overcome our ignorance, researchers are studying LLMs as if they were doing biology or neuroscience on vast living creatures—city-size xenomorphs that have appeared in our midst. And they’re discovering that large language models are even weirder than they thought. Read the full story.—Will Douglas Heaven

Job titles of the future: Head-transplant surgeon

The Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero has been preparing for a surgery that might never happen. His idea? Swap a sick person’s head—or perhaps just the brain—onto a younger, healthier body.Canavero caused a stir in 2017 when he announced that a team he advised in China had exchanged heads between two corpses. But he never convinced skeptics that his technique could succeed—or to believe his claim that a procedure on a live person was imminent.

Canavero may have withdrawn from the spotlight, but the idea of head transplants isn’t going away. Instead, he says, the concept has recently been getting a fresh look from life-extension enthusiasts and stealth Silicon Valley startups. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Slush, the Finnish nonprofit behind one of the most influential startup gatherings in Europe, has named Noora Saksa as its new Chief Executive Officer, a shift that indicates a strategic evolution for the organisation as it expands beyond its flagship event model.

Saksa assumes the top role after years as Slush’s Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, where she managed core operations, finances, and ecosystem programmes.

Her trajectory within the organisation reflects a deep operational understanding of Slush’s mission: to connect founders, investors, and builders in ways that help founders advance on their journeys.

In stepping into the CEO role, Saksa inherits an agenda that extends far beyond an annual conference in Helsinki.

Under her leadership, Slush aims to grow year-round engagement through digital experiences and local ecosystem programmes, and to deepen its reach in founder support globally.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Board members see her operational experience and ecosystem insight as assets for Slush’s next chapter.

Slush remains organised largely by a core team of young professionals and volunteers, a structure that has supported its rapid growth since the early 2010s.

The event brings together thousands of founders and investors each year, and the organisation’s year-round platform aims to sustain connections long after the main event ends.

In her opening statement as CEO, Saksa said the focus will remain on building meaningful experiences that help founders tackle practical challenges, expand networks, and find capital. Her intimate knowledge of Slush’s operations positions her to balance growth ambitions with the organisation’s mission-driven ethos.

Noora Saksa has played a central role at Slush as Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, overseeing operations, finances, and startup-focused programmes. Before her tenure at Slush, she held leadership roles in entrepreneurial student societies and worked in startup support functions. Saksa studied Industrial Engineering and Management at Aalto University with an exchange at Eindhoven University of Technology. Her experience spans operational strategy, ecosystem building, and partnership development within Nordic innovation communities.

            <h2>Rainbow Weather raises $5.5M to refine real-time weather forecasting</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/rainbow-weather-raises-5-5m-to-refine-real-time-weather-forecasting">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Warsaw, Poland 26 January 2026 – Rainbow Weather has raised $5.5 million in seed funding to push weather forecasting further into the short-term, high-precision territory it believes the industry still underserves.

The Warsaw-based climate tech startup focuses on hyperlocal, minute-by-minute forecasts, zeroing in on what happens in the next few hours rather than days out.

The round was backed by a syndicate of investors, including Yuri Gurski, founder of Flo Health, one of Europe’s best-known consumer tech unicorns.

Rainbow Weather’s core product is a mobile app that delivers four-hour precipitation forecasts calculated from the exact moment a user checks the weather.

Open the app at 3:51 am, and it forecasts conditions through 7:51am, refreshed every 10 minutes and mapped down to a one-square-kilometre grid. That level of temporal and spatial precision is what the company says sets it apart from mainstream weather apps.

Most major providers, including AccuWeather, Apple Weather, and The Weather Company, still rely on approaches that either simplify cloud movement or depend on large-scale numerical models designed for longer forecasts. According to Rainbow Weather, both methods struggle when conditions change quickly.

“Many legacy forecasting providers rely on optical flow for short-term precipitation forecasting. That’s a fast but simplistic method that treats clouds as shapes in motion, without any understanding of atmospheric physics,” explained Alexander Matveenko, co-founder of Rainbow Weather. “A second category of services uses large-scale mathematical models that do incorporate physical principles, but they’re so cumbersome and slow that they can’t respond quickly to real-time weather changes.”

Rainbow Weather positions itself in between, using machine learning to fuse high-resolution data from radar, satellites, weather stations, and even smartphone barometers. By combining these sources, the company claims it can reduce the noise and bias inherent in individual datasets, then generate forecasts faster than traditional systems.

The app currently focuses on short-term precipitation, but it has expanded into tracking wildfires and hurricanes, a feature added after the Palisades fire in Los Angeles. That expansion reflects a broader ambition to become a real-time risk awareness tool, not just a rain predictor.

The new funding will be used to extend Rainbow Weather’s forecasting window from four hours to 24 hours, add more weather parameters beyond precipitation, and grow its B2B offering.

The commercial weather intelligence market is expected to grow steadily over the next decade, driven by industries that depend on precise, near-term forecasts, from logistics and agriculture to aviation and drone operations.

Rainbow Weather says it has surpassed one million installs and has launched APIs aimed at companies that “can’t afford to get weather wrong.” It has also partnered with an unnamed long-term forecasting firm, supplying near-term data to improve broader climate models.

The founding team brings a track record of exits in applied AI. CEO Yuriy Melnichek previously founded AIMatter, acquired by Google, as well as consumer apps later bought by Pinterest and Farfetch. Matveenko previously sold mapping startup MapData to Mapbox.

Alongside its commercial products, the team also runs weatherindex.ai, an open-source project that evaluates short-term precipitation forecasts from major providers in real time. The tool compares live forecasts against verified airport weather reports, using standard accuracy metrics. It’s an unusual move in an industry not known for transparent benchmarking.

For Rainbow Weather, that openness is part of the pitch. The company is betting that as climate volatility increases, users and businesses will care less about next week’s weather and more about what happens in the next hour, and whether the forecast can be trusted.

Rainbow Weather is a next-gen climate tech startup for ultra-accurate short-term forecasts founded in 2021 by Yuriy Melnichek, who previously built AIMatter (acquired by Google), a neural network-based AI platform, as well as the video creation and editing app Vochi (acquired by Pinterest), and fashion marketplace Wanna (acquired by Farfetch), and Alexander Matveenko, a founder of artificial intelligence mapping startup MapData that he sold to Mapbox in 2017.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based AI video startup Synthesia has raised $200 million in a Series E round, nearly doubling its valuation to around $4 billion and cementing its position as one of Europe’s most valuable AI companies.

The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors, underscoring continued appetite for applied AI products that have already found a clear commercial use.

Synthesia builds generative AI tools that let companies create videos using AI-generated avatars instead of cameras, studios, or presenters. The technology has found a strong foothold in corporate training, internal communications, and product explainers, areas where speed, scale, and consistency often matter more than production gloss.

“Synthesia was founded on two core beliefs: first, that AI will bring the cost of content creation down to zero. And secondly, that AI video provides a better, more engaging way for organizations to communicate and learn,” said Victor Riparbelli, Synthesia’s co-founder and CEO.

Synthesia says a significant share of Fortune 100 companies now use its platform, a rare level of enterprise penetration for a European AI startup at this stage. Rather than chasing consumer virality, the company has built its business around predictable, high-value enterprise use cases, a strategy investors have increasingly rewarded over the past year.

The funding comes at a moment when enthusiasm around generative AI has shifted from experimentation to execution. Enterprises are no longer asking whether AI video works, but how reliably it can plug into existing workflows.

Synthesia’s pitch is that AI-generated video should be as routine as slides or documents, created quickly, updated easily, and deployed globally without production bottlenecks.

At a $4 billion valuation, Synthesia joins a small group of European AI companies that have managed to scale beyond regional relevance.

Its rise also highlights a broader pattern: applied AI startups, focused on specific business functions rather than general-purpose models, are attracting some of the largest growth rounds in the market.

For the UK tech ecosystem, the deal is another signal that London remains a serious hub for commercial AI, even as regulatory debates continue around model safety, copyright, and synthetic media.

Synthesia has previously positioned itself as cautious about misuse, building safeguards around consent and disclosure for its avatars, a stance that may become more important as scrutiny of AI-generated content increases.

The challenge ahead is less about proving demand and more about maintaining trust and differentiation as competitors multiply.

But with deep enterprise adoption, a clear product focus, and backing from one of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, Synthesia is entering its next phase with momentum firmly on its side.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/mews-raises-e255m-to-accelerate-ai-and-automation-in-hospitality">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amsterdam-based hospitality tech platform Mews has raised €255 million (about $300 million) in a Series D funding round as it pushes deeper into automation and AI-powered workflows for hotels around the world.

The round was led by EQT Growth with new participation from Atomico and HarbourVest Partners, alongside existing backers including Kinnevik, Battery Ventures and Tiger Global. The investment values the company at roughly $2.5 billion.

Founded in 2012 by Richard Valtr and Matt Welle, Mews builds a cloud-native “operating system” for hotels  software that ties together reservations, check-ins, housekeeping, payments and more in one platform.

Its technology is designed to replace legacy systems that many hotels still rely on, offering a more flexible, connected way to manage day-to-day operations.

The new funding will be used to expand the company’s AI and automation capabilities at the core of its product.

That includes embedding agent-driven systems that can take on complex routine tasks, reduce manual work for staff and streamline how hotels handle everything from guest interactions to revenue management.

Mews says its platform already supports more than 15,000 properties in 85 countries, and in 2025 it processed nearly 42.3 million check-ins and handled nearly $20 billion in transaction volume.

The software also helped generate over $500 million in additional revenue for hoteliers through features like its Mews Spaces module.

In a statement, CEO Matt Welle said the new capital will help Mews build an operating system that handles operational complexity so hotel teams can focus on guest experience rather than juggling disparate tools.

“We are engineering an operating system that is changing how hoteliers interact with their guests,” CEO Matt Welle said, adding that the goal is to lighten the cognitive load on staff and make everyday operations smoother.

Industry observers say the round is one of the largest ever in hospitality software and reflects broader investor interest in infrastructure-level platforms that bring AI and fintech together for real-world business operations.

As hotels embrace digital transformation, technology that can automate workflows and personalise guest experiences  without adding complexity is increasingly in demand.

For Mews, the challenge now is execution: turning generous funding into tangible upgrades that deliver value for hoteliers of all sizes.

But with strong adoption, a global footprint and a growing suite of automation tools, the company is positioning itself as a central technology partner at a time when hotels are looking to modernise their operations and enhance guest satisfaction.
