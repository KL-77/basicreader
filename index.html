            <h2>Early Universe's supermassive black holes grew in cocoons like butterflies</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/early-universes-supermassive-black-holes-grew-in-cocoons-like-butterflies/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the James Webb Space Telescope sent its first high-definition infrared images back to Earth, astronomers noticed several tiny, glowing, crimson stains. These objects, quickly named “Little Red Dots,” were too bright to be normal galaxies, and too red to be simple star clusters. They appeared to house supermassive black holes that were far more massive than they had any right to be.

But now a new study published in Nature suggests a solution to the Little Red Dots mystery. Scientists think young supermassive black holes may go through a “cocoon phase,” where they grow surrounded by high-density gas they feed on. These gaseous cocoons are likely what the JWST saw as the Little Red Dots.

The first explanation scientists had for the Little Red Dots was that they were compact, distant galaxies, but something felt off about them right from the start. “They were too massive, since we saw they’d have to be completely filled with stars,” says Vadim Rusakov, an astronomer at the University of Manchester and lead author of the study. “They would need to produce stars at 100 percent efficiency, and that’s not what we’re used to seeing. Galaxies cannot produce stars at more than 20 percent efficiency, at least that’s what our current knowledge is.”

The next possible solution for the Little Red Dots was that they were supermassive black holes, but this didn’t fit the data either. For decades, astronomers have observed a consistent relationship between a galaxy and its central supermassive black hole: Usually, the black hole accounts for about 0.1 percent of the galaxy’s total mass. It’s a tidy cosmic ratio that suggests the two grow together in a tightly coordinated manner. The Little Red Dots broke that rule.

Initial analyses suggested if the dots were in fact supermassive black holes, they’d have to be nearly as massive as their host galaxies, varying between 10 and 100 percent of their total mass. The problem was that the dots were visible at very high red shift, which means astronomers saw them as they were when the Universe was roughly 1 billion years old. An “overmassive” black hole as heavy as its entire galaxy in a 1-billion-year-old Universe begged the question how something could grow that big, that fast—we didn’t have any answers for that.

But then Rusakov and his colleagues started noticing odd things in the JWST data. “You normally expect other signals from supermassive black holes, like X-rays, and we didn’t see those signals,” Rusakov says. The oddities didn’t end with the absence of X-rays.

Because black holes can’t be observed directly, astronomers measure their mass by looking at gas orbiting around them. As the gas swirls down into the black hole, it heats up and glows. The gravity of a supermassive black hole pulls that gas at incredible speeds, with the material reaching thousands of kilometers per second. This speed causes what’s known as the Doppler effect, broadening where the light from the gas moving toward the observer on Earth shifts to blue, and the gas moving away shifts to red, stretching the spectral lines into a wide, flat shape. By measuring the width of these lines, we calculate the velocity of the gas and, by extension, the mass of the black hole.

In the case of the Little Red Dots, the lines appeared incredibly wide, leading to those staggering mass estimates. The shape of the lines, though, looked strange. It wasn’t a typical rounded bell-curve but rather a sharp triangle sitting on top of broad, wing-like tails.

The breakthrough came when the team realized they weren’t looking at gas moving fast. They were looking at light getting lost in the fog.

In the case of Little Red Dots, the fog was a dense cocoon of ionized gas—specifically, a thick cloud of free electrons surrounding the black holes. The unusual shape of the spectral lines, Rusakov’s team reports in the paper, is due to the process called Thomson scattering. Photons emitted by gas near the black hole are likely hitting these free electrons, and their direction and energy gets shifted with each collision. After billions upon billions of such collisions, a spectral line that was originally quite narrow becomes broad, mimicking the look of high-velocity gas.

By applying a scattering model to data from the Little Red Dot galaxies, Rusakov’s team found that the intrinsic velocity of the gas was actually much lower than we thought. Scientists concluded that the black holes are likely 100 times smaller than previous estimates. Instead of being “overmassive” monsters that defy our understanding of physics, they are likely “young” supermassive black holes, roughly 10 million to 100 million times the mass of our Sun. This puts them much closer to the standard galaxy-to-black-hole mass ratio we see in the local Universe.

The JWST apparently caught these black holes at the phase in their lifecycle we’ve never seen before.

The study suggests that the Little Red Dots represent a previously unknown stage of supermassive black holes’ evolution. “They look like a [developing] butterfly or something in this young state that kind of grows wrapped in some sort of gas that also feeds it,” Rusakov says. “It’s definitely new in the sense people didn’t predict there should be such a cocoon phase in the supermassive black holes’ lifecycle.”

During this phase, a young supermassive black hole is growing rapidly, buried deep within a dense shell of gas and dust. This cocoon is so thick that it acts as a cosmic shield that blocks the high-energy X-rays and radio waves that typically signal the presence of an active black hole. Rusakov’s team thinks their cocoon hypothesis explains one of the most persistent mysteries of Little Red Dots—why they are so bright in infrared light but virtually invisible to X-ray telescopes like Chandra. The X-rays are being absorbed by the same dense material that is scattering the light. “This was a neat solution in that sense,” Rusakov says.

But while the scattering model elegantly solves the mass problem and the missing X-rays, questions remain. Astronomers still need to determine exactly how long this cocoon phase lasts and how common it is in the early Universe. So far, the team studied 12 Little Red Dot objects. As more high-resolution data pours in from JWST, researchers will be able to see if every Little Red Dot follows this pattern. And this, Rusakov thinks, should give us some insights into how our own galaxy came to be.

Based on the JWST observations, it seems like most of the signal we see coming from early-stage galaxies like Little Red Dots is the light from supermassive black holes. “There’s this big, simplified question: Does the galaxy start with the supermassive black hole or with the stars? Is that a chicken or the egg?” Rusakov says. “We don’t know exactly what happens in this first sort of stage of galaxy formation. But our model gives us a new way to look at this kind of object.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/2025-sees-teslas-annual-revenue-fall-for-the-first-time/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla published its financial results for 2025 this afternoon. If 2024 was a bad year for the electric automaker, 2025 was far worse: For the first time in Tesla’s history, revenues fell year over year.

Earlier this month, Tesla revealed its sales and production numbers for the fourth quarter of 2025, with a 16 percent decline compared to Q4 2024. Now we know the cost of those lost sales: Automotive revenues fell by 11 percent to $17.7 billion.

Happily for Tesla, double-digit growth in its energy storage business ($3.8 billion, an increase of 25 percent) and services ($3.4 billion, an increase of 18 percent) made up some of the shortfall.

Although total revenue for the quarter fell by 3 percent, Tesla’s operating profits grew by 20 percent. But declining income from operations, which also got much more expensive, saw Tesla’s net profit plummet 61 percent, to $840 million. Without the $542 million from regulatory credits, things would have looked even bleaker.

Selling 1,636,129 cars in 2025 generated $69.5 billion in revenue, 10 percent less than Tesla’s 2024 revenue. But storage and energy increased 27 percent year over year to $12.7 billion, and services grew by 19 percent year over year to $12.5 billion. Together, these two divisions now contribute meaningful amounts to the business, unlike just a few short years ago.

As a result, total revenues for 2025 only fell by 3 percent. But Tesla saw a 38 percent drop in income from operations, and its expenses went up by 23 percent. As a result, the company’s once-envied profit margin was just 4.9 percent for the year, down from 7.2 percent last year. (In 2022, Tesla had a 23.8 percent profit margin.)

Consequently, its $3.8 billion net profit for the year was a reduction of 46 percent compared to 2024. Tesla blames falling sales and lower regulatory credits for its decreased revenue and falling profits, despite those regulatory credits contributing $2 billion—52 percent of its annual net profit.

There were few specifics in the outlook section of Tesla’s presentation to its investors. It claims that this year will see volume production of its two-seat Cybercab robotaxi, the long-delayed Tesla Semi class 8 truck, and its next Megabuck energy storage system. Tesla also says it expects its investment in AI to start contributing to its annual profit, although elsewhere in the presentation, we learned that the company recently agreed to invest $2 billion into xAI, the deepfake- and CSAM-generating company owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.</div>

            <div id="article-text">RAMP—the predominantly Russian-language online bazaar that billed itself as the “only place ransomware allowed”—had its dark web and clear web sites seized by the FBI as the agency tries to combat the growing scourge threatening critical infrastructure and organizations around the world.

Visits to both sites on Wednesday returned pages that said the FBI had taken control of the RAMP domains, which mirrored each other. RAMP has been among the dwindling number of online crime forums to operate with impunity, following the takedown of other forums such as XSS, which saw its leader arrested last year by Europol. The vacuum left RAMP as one of the leading places for people pushing ransomware and other online threats to buy, sell, or trade products and services.

“The Federal Bureau of Investigation has seized RAMP,” a banner carrying the seals of the FBI and the Justice Department said. “This action has been taken in coordination with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice.” The banner included a graphic that appeared on the RAMP site, before it was seized, that billed itself as the “only place ransomware allowed.”

RAMP was founded in 2012 and rebranded in 2021, according to security firm Rapid 7. The platform served Russian, Chinese, and English speakers and counted more than 14,000 registered users, who underwent strict vetting before being accepted or paid a $500 fee for anonymous participation. The forum provided discussion groups, cyberattack tutorials, and a marketplace for malware and services. Its chief administrator said in 2024 the site earned $250,000 annually.

In a message posted to a rebranded XSS site, a purported RAMP member announced the shutdown.

I regret to inform you that the police authorities have taken control of the Ramp forum. This event has destroyed years of my work building the freest forum in the world, and while I hoped this day would never come, I always knew in my heart it was possible. It’s a risk we all take.

Although I no longer manage Ramp and will not be creating a new forum from scratch, I will continue to purchase access. My main business remains unchanged…

Good luck to everyone, take care of yourselves and your loved ones,

There’s no word of arrests or detentions of any RAMP operators or users. The seizure notice invited people to submit tips through the FBI’s IC3 portal. US authorities have yet to release a statement mentioning the takedown.

DNS records show that servers resolving the RAMP domain now belong to the FBI. It’s not known if the agents now have access to user databases and other sensitive site information. If so, site users who weren’t careful may be tracked down by law enforcement.</div>

            <h2>Seven things to know about how Apple's Creator Studio subscriptions work</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/seven-things-to-know-about-how-apples-creator-studio-subscriptions-work/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple’s new Creator Studio subscription bundle officially launches today, offering access to a wide range of updated professional apps for an all-or-nothing price of $12.99 a month or $129 a year. Teachers and students can get the same apps for $2.99 a month, or $29.99 a year.

The bundle includes either access to or enhanced features for a total of 10 Apple apps, though the base versions of several of these are available for free to all Mac and iPad owners:

When companies introduce a subscription-based model for long-standing apps with an established user base, they often shift exclusively to a subscription model, offering continuous updates in return for a more consistent revenue stream. But these aren’t always popular with subscription-fatigued users, who have seen virtually all major paid software shift to a subscription model in the last 10 or 15 years, and who in recent years have had to deal with prices that are continuously being ratcheted upward.

Apple’s subscription shift looks a little less like Adobe’s approach to Photoshop and a little more like Microsoft’s approach to Office: many of these apps, particularly the Mac versions, will remain available for free or as standalone one-time purchases from the App Store.

In lieu of running through each of these apps’ new features one by one, we’ve gathered answers to some questions about how the new subscriptions will work and how they’ll compare to the standalone versions of the apps.

Apple still offers Mac App Store versions of the following apps as one-time purchases:

If you’ve already bought those apps from the Mac App Store at any point in the past, you’ll still have access to them, and they’ll be updated to the current versions at no charge.

While Mac users are generally pretty well taken care of here, current iPad users of Final Cut Pro or Logic are getting the short end of the stick. When those apps were initially introduced on the iPad, they cost $4.99 per app per month, or $49 per year per app. Those standalone subscriptions appear to have been axed with the introduction of the Creator Studio bundle.

The downside of Apple’s all-or-nothing pricing is that the bundle is only a great value if you actually intend to use multiple apps on multiple platforms regularly. People who are already splitting their time between the Mac and the iPad and using more than one of these apps will get a lot of value for their money; anyone who just wants to run Final Cut Pro on their iPad is looking at a big price hike.

The short answer is “yes, the standalone versions of these apps will generally be updated in lockstep with the Creator Studio versions.” But Apple is taking slightly different approaches depending on the app.

All of the Apple Creator Studio apps are brand-new versions with new version numbers: Final Cut Pro jumps from version 11 to version 12, for example, and Keynote, Pages, and Numbers (apps I still think of collectively as “iWork” despite that name being well over a decade out of date) are being bumped from version 14 to version 15. Apple’s Creator Studio support document lists all of the new version numbers.

For the paid apps, these new versions will be downloaded and installed just as previous Mac App Store updates have been. The standalone Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Compressor, Motion, and MainStage apps have already been updated to the new version numbers, and installing any of them will pull down the latest version.

But the standalone version of Pixelmator Pro is still listed as the old version, 3.7.1, while the new version 4.0 requires a Creator Studio subscription. It’s not clear whether that’s going to change.

As for Keynote, Pages, and Numbers, the iOS and iPadOS versions of the new apps will be seamlessly installed in place of the old apps. But it’s being handled slightly differently on the Mac for some reason. All three apps now have two versions listed in the app store: the old ones, set at version 14.5, and the new ones, set at 15.1. Installing the 14.5 update, which was released today, adds a prompt when you launch the old apps, informing you that they’re out of date and that you should install the new ones instead.

Users can have both the standalone and Creator Studio versions of all apps installed on their devices at the same time. You’ll be able to tell both versions apart using their icons—the standalone apps keep the same icons they had before, and the Creator Studio versions get the occasionally controversial high-contrast Liquid Glass-ified redesigns.

Incidentally, you can also tell the versions of the apps apart by their App Store listings. The standalone ones are just referred to by their names (i.e., “Final Cut Pro,” “Logic Pro”) while the new ones have more modern obnoxious search-optimized titles (“Final Cut Pro: Create Video,” “Logic Pro: Make Music,” “Keynote: Design Presentations”).

The brightest dividing line between the standalone and Creator Studio apps is for the free ones, Keynote, Pages, and Numbers. All three look the same whether you have an active subscription or not, but the free versions will prompt you to upgrade to Creator Studio any time you attempt to use “premium” features, which as of this writing includes document templates and generative AI features.

A Creator Studio subscription is also required to access the “Content Hub,” a library of stock images available only in the Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps (at least for now; they should also be available in Freeform “later this year”). Apple may expand the Content Hub with video and audio content suitable for Final Cut Pro or Logic at some point in the future, but it’s not something the company is offering right now.

At least as of this writing, the paid standalone Mac apps don’t appear to be missing any major features relative to the Creator Studio versions. There’s no way to know whether this will change except to wait and see.

An Apple Creator Studio subscription can be shared among up to six Apple accounts using Family Sharing, potentially defraying the cost of the subscription further. This only applies to the standard version of the subscription; education subscriptions can’t be shared.

Apple accounts attached to an active subscription can install the apps on up to 10 devices simultaneously. This is a relatively generous allotment compared to Adobe’s Creative Cloud, which just allows installation on two devices at once and only allows the apps to be used on a single system at a time.

Apple outlines detailed system requirements for each app on its support page here. For most of the Mac apps, all you need is a Mac running macOS 15.6 Sequoia or later; the only Mac app that requires macOS 26 Tahoe is Pixelmator Pro. Most of the apps will also run on either Intel or Apple Silicon Macs, though MainStage is Apple Silicon-exclusive, and “some features” in Compressor may also require Apple Silicon.

The requirements for the iPad apps are a little more restrictive; you generally need to be running either iPadOS 18.6 or iPadOS 26, and both Final Cut Pro and Pixelmator Pro either want an Apple M1, an Apple A16, or an Apple A17 Pro (in other words, it will work on every iPad Apple currently sells, but older iPad hardware is more hit or miss).

Apple also outlines a number of usage restrictions for the generative AI features that rely on external services. Apple says that, “at a minimum,” users will be able to generate 50 images, 50 presentations of between 8 to 10 slides each, and to generate presenter notes in Keynote for 700 slides. More usage may be possible, but this depends on “the complexity of the queries, server availability, and network availability.”

These AI features are all based on OpenAI technology, but don’t require users to have their own OpenAI or ChatGPT account (the flip side is that if you already pay for ChatGPT, that won’t benefit you here). Apple also says that the content you use to generate images, presentations, or notes “will never be used to train intelligence models.”

There are three major creative apps that Apple offers that haven’t been bundled into Creator Studio, and also haven’t gotten a major new update: iMovie, GarageBand, and Photomator.

There are extenuating circumstances that explain why these three apps haven’t been given a Creator Studio-style overhaul. The iMovie and GarageBand apps have always sort of been positioned as “lite” free-to-use versions of Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, respectively, while Photomator is a recently acquired app that overlaps somewhat with the built-in Photos app.

Apple has nothing to share about the future of any of the three apps. Both iMovie and Photomator received minor updates today, presumably related to maintaining compatibility with the Creator Studio apps, and GarageBand was last updated a month ago. Expect them to stick around in their current forms for at least a while.</div>

            <h2>Stranded boys struggle to survive in Lord of the Flies trailer</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/bbcs-lord-of-the-flies-miniseries-gets-a-trailer/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">BBC One has adapted William Golding’s classic 1954 novel Lord of the Flies into a new miniseries and just dropped the first trailer. The book has been adapted for film three times since its publication and also inspired the Emmy-nominated TV series Yellowjackets (renewed for its fourth and final season this year). This BBC miniseries apparently has the support of the Golding family and is expected to hew quite closely to the novel.

Golding was inspired to write Lord of the Flies by a popular, pro-colonialism children’s novel called The Coral Island, whose central theme was the civilizing influence of British colonial efforts and Christianity on a “savage” people. Golding wanted to write a book about children on an island who “behave the way children really would behave.”

In Lord of the Flies, a British airplane evacuating a group of young boys from war-torn England crashes on an isolated, uninhabited island. A boy named Ralph finds a conch shell and uses it as a horn, commanding enough respect for the boys to look to him as their chief. Initially, Ralph’s leadership helps the stranded boys establish sufficient order to survive and keep a signal fire going, thanks to the lenses in Piggy’s glasses. But that tenuous order soon begins to fray, with the community splitting into two tribes, the second led by the wilder Jack. Violence inevitably breaks out, resulting in the deaths of two of the boys. Eventually, the survivors are rescued by a British naval ship, and the boys are forced to confront the “end of innocence.”

Lord of the Flies has remained relevant ever since its publication as a cautionary, if cynical, tale about how social hierarchies can break down into tribal violence, although it should be noted that a real 1965 incident with stranded Tongan boys exemplified the exact opposite effect. Lord of the Flies is a novel, not a sociological treatise. But its broad cultural influence is undeniable. Stephen King even named his fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine, after Jack’s mountain camp in Lord of the Flies.

Winston Sawyers stars as Ralph in the BBC miniseries, with Lox Pratt playing Jack and David McKenna playing Piggy. The cast also includes Ike Talbot as Simon; Thomas Connor as Roger; Noah Flemyng as Sam; Cassius Flemyng as Eric; Cornelius Brandreth as Maurice; Tom Page-Turner as Bill; Rafael de Belligny as Robert; Freddie Lee-Gray as Percival; Beau Thompson as Philip; Fred Jones as Johnny; and Lake Coleman as Boy with Birthmark. In addition, more than 20 other young boys were cast (many with no acting experience) to play the camp’s “big ’uns” and “little ’uns.”

Lord of the Flies debuts in the UK on BBC One on February 8, 2026.</div>

            <h2>SpaceX sends list of demands to US states giving broadband grants to Starlink</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-28</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/starlink-demands-grant-money-from-states-even-when-residents-dont-buy-service/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SpaceX has made a new set of demands on state governments that would ensure Starlink receives federal grant money even when residents don’t purchase Starlink broadband service.

SpaceX said it will provide “all necessary equipment” to receive broadband “at no cost to subscribers requesting service,” which will apparently eliminate the up-front hardware fee for Starlink equipment. But SpaceX isn’t promising lower-than-usual monthly prices to consumers in those subsidized areas. SpaceX pledged to make broadband available for $80 or less a month, plus taxes and fees, to people with low incomes in the subsidized areas. For comparison, the normal Starlink residential prices advertised on its website range from $50 to $120 a month.

SpaceX’s demands would also guarantee that it gets paid by the government even if it doesn’t reserve “large portions” of Starlink network capacity for homes in the areas that are supposed to receive government-subsidized Internet service. Moreover, SpaceX would not be responsible for ensuring that Starlink equipment is installed correctly at each customer location.

SpaceX sent a letter to state broadband offices proposing a rider with terms that it hopes will be applied to all grants it receives throughout the country. The letter was obtained and published by Broadband.io and the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society.

Arguing that SpaceX should receive grant money regardless of whether residents purchase Starlink service, the letter to states said that grant payments should not depend on “the independent purchasing decisions of users.” SpaceX also said it will not hold “large portions of capacity fallow” to ensure that people in subsidized areas receive good service, but will instead continue its preexisting practice of “dynamically allocat[ing] capacity where needed.”

SpaceX’s proposed contract rider would apply to grants distributed under the US government’s Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. BEAD was created by Congress in a 2021 law that authorized spending over $42 billion to make broadband networks available in areas without modern service.

While the Biden administration designed the program to prioritize fiber deployments, the Trump administration threw out the previous plans. Under Trump, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) deemed the Biden-era plan too costly and changed the rules to make it easier for satellite services to obtain grant funding. The overhaul cut projected spending to about $21 billion, and it’s still unclear what will happen to the other $21 billion.

Starlink sought billions in grants after the new rules were put in place, but states didn’t want to provide that much. So far, SpaceX is slated to receive $733.5 million to offer broadband at 472,600 locations. Amazon’s Leo satellite service (formerly Kuiper) is set to receive $311 million for 415,000 locations.

While not every state plan is final, it looks like satellite networks will get about 5 percent of the grant money and serve over 22 percent of the locations funded by grants. Satellite companies are getting smaller payments on a per-location basis because, unlike fiber providers, they don’t have to install infrastructure at each customer’s location.

The concessions sought by SpaceX “would limit Starlink’s performance obligations, payment schedules, non-compliance penalties, reporting expectations, and labor and insurance standards,” wrote Drew Garner, director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute. Garner argued that SpaceX’s demands illustrate problems in how the Trump NTIA rewrote program rules to increase reliance on low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite providers.

“BEAD was designed primarily to deploy terrestrial networks, which are physically located in communities, built with traditional construction methods, and are relatively easy to monitor and inspect,” Garner wrote. “But, on June 6, 2025, NTIA restructured BEAD in ways that greatly increased participation by LEO providers, exacerbating the challenge of applying BEAD’s terrestrial-focused rules to LEO’s extraterrestrial networks.”

Among other things, SpaceX is trying to “minimize states’ ability to penalize LEO grantees for defaulting or failing to comply with contract requirements,” and avoid having “to report on the use of BEAD funds or other financial information related to the grant,” Garner wrote.

SpaceX’s letter said that “all requirements related to labor issues (e.g., prevailing wage and similar obligations), contractors, and procurement are inapplicable to SpaceX” because “there are no identifiable employees, contractors, or contracts being funded” to support Starlink broadband service in each state. Similarly, “there are no identifiable pieces of SpaceX infrastructure equipment (other than satellite capacity delivered from Space) being funded via BEAD,” the company said.

It’s unclear whether SpaceX will turn down grants if it doesn’t get what it wants. We asked the company for information on its plans if states refuse its terms and will update this article if we get a response. SpaceX’s proposed terms could also be applied to Amazon if states accept them.

SpaceX’s letter said that despite the Trump administration’s changes to BEAD, “a number of issues remain that, if unaddressed, could render LEO participation in the program untenable.” SpaceX said it wants to work with states “to more fully tailor aspects of the project agreement to the reality of LEO deployment and operations now that the initial project selection and approval phase is accomplished.”

Space said it wants to avoid extensive negotiations over its proposed terms. But the acknowledgement that some negotiation may be necessary seems to recognize that states don’t have to comply with the demands:

Toward this goal, we have developed a set of terms that we intend to function as a rider to all subgrant agreements across the country. This rider is intentionally limited in scope to addressing items of critical importance, to minimize the need for negotiation, and provide clarity to both parties moving forward. Our intention is for the LEO rider to enable the state to keep its core subgrant agreement relatively uniform amongst grantees, retain state-law-specific requirements, co-locate all relevant LEO-specific material for ease of administration, and standardize agreements across states.

SpaceX’s proposed contract rider said the firm will offer broadband plans for “a monthly cost of $80 or less before applicable taxes and fees” to households that meet the low-income eligibility guidelines used by the FCC’s Lifeline program. People who don’t qualify for low-income plans would presumably pay regular Starlink rates.

The BEAD law requires ISPs receiving federal funds to offer at least one “low-cost broadband service option for eligible subscribers.” While the Biden administration sought low-income plans that cost as little as $30 a month, the Trump administration decided that states may not tell ISPs what prices to charge in their low-cost options. A Trump administration threat to shut states out of BEAD if they required low prices doomed a California proposal to mandate $15 monthly plans for people with low incomes.

SpaceX told state governments that it should receive 50 percent of grant funds when it certifies that it is capable of providing BEAD-quality service (100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload speeds) within 10 business days to any potential customer that requests it in a grant area. The rest of the money would be distributed quarterly over the 10-year period of the grant.

Explaining why SpaceX shouldn’t be penalized if potential customers decide Starlink prices are too high, the firm wrote:

Tying payments to the independent purchasing decisions of users solely for awardees using LEO technologies, and not for any other technology, is, by definition, not technology neutral. SpaceX is already appropriately incentivized to gather customers by the opportunity to capture the monthly recurring revenue from each subscriber. SpaceX was in most instances awarded the most remote and difficult areas to serve among all other providers. SpaceX is up to the task of ensuring success in these challenging areas, however, it cannot undertake this mission without certainty of consistent payments to compensate such work.

Based on SpaceX’s letter, it sounds like the work the company must do to ensure quality of service at BEAD-funded locations is the same work it has already done to make Starlink available across the US. Instead of dedicated capacity for government-subsidized deployments, SpaceX said it will simply factor the needs of BEAD users into its planning:

With respect to capacity reservations, we have found some confusion regarding how such a reservation is made. Given the dynamic nature of the Starlink network, the reservation will not be such that SpaceX holds large portions of capacity fallow. This would be wasteful, inefficient, and does not reflect a LEO providers [sic] ability to dynamically allocate capacity where needed. Instead, SpaceX will include the capacity needs of BEAD users into its network planning efforts. These activities are multifaceted and include real time capacity allocation at the network level, launch activities, and sales efforts. As a result, there is no single “document” evidencing the reservation of capacity.

SpaceX said it will be obvious if it does not provide sufficient service, and thus the states should not seek additional performance testing beyond what’s included in the NTIA guidelines. “If sufficient capacity was not reserved, performance testing will reveal insufficient quality of service, and this deficiency will be transparent to the state. Developing a separate, indirect measurement of the reservation itself is infeasible and unnecessary,” SpaceX said.

The proposed rider said that any network testing must “exclude subscribers who have installed CPE [consumer premise equipment] such that its view of the sky is obstructed and subscribers with damaged or malfunctioning CPE, as determined by GRANTEE.”

The “as determined by GRANTEE” phrase means it’s up to SpaceX to decide which subscribers should be excluded from testing. As the Benton Society says, the rider stipulates that “performance tests can only be considered if the LEO provider determines that the subscriber’s equipment is properly installed, and, notably, the LEO provider is not obligated to ensure proper installation.”

SpaceX’s proposed rider defines a “standard installation” as the mailing of equipment to a subscriber. That’s the standard process for unsubsidized areas throughout the country, and SpaceX doesn’t want to do any extra work to help set up equipment for customers in subsidized areas. However, customers may be able to purchase professional installation for an extra fee.

“For the avoidance of doubt, the GRANTEE will not be responsible for completing a permanent installation” at each location, SpaceX’s proposed rider says. A satellite provider “may choose to offer the subscriber professional services for permanent installation of CPE at an additional fee, but such professional services shall not be considered part of the standard installation,” it says.</div>

            <h2>Tesla Quietly Pauses Its “Unsupervised” Robotaxi Rides as Reality Sets In</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-29</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It appears that Tesla CEO Elon Musk may have once again duped his fans and investors — which, these days, is an increasingly meaningless distinction.

Last week, Musk made huge waves when he announced that the automaker’s Robotaxi service would finally be giving rides in Austin, Texas, without a human “safety monitor” in the car — something he promised would’ve been the case since day one.

What Musk left out of that announcement, however, was that the human supervisors were moved to another car that followed the robotaxi instead, a workaround that was as dishonest as it was impractical.

Now, the EV blog Electrek reports another bit of Musk subterfuge. Based on what the service’s customers are saying, it appears that, at this moment, none of the Robotaxi rides that Tesla has been giving are “unsupervised.”

The most convincing testimony comes from Tesla enthusiast David Moss, who made a name for himself by purportedly driving 10,000 miles on FSD v14 without any interventions. Dedicated as he is to the Tesla cause, he traveled to Austin to try out an “unsupervised” Robotaxi ride — but was left sorely disappointed. After a gobsmacking 42 rides, every single one he got came with a human safety monitor.

“This was also my 5th ride in a row with the supervisor in the drivers seat,” he complained on X. (Typically, the safety monitor sits in the front passenger seat.)

To be fair to Tesla, it looks like the “unsupervised” rides stopped after a massive winter storm slammed the country on Saturday, including Austin. The service has resumed since then, but Tesla has not communicated any potential changes in how the Robotaxis operate to the public.

It’s worth asking why the unsupervised rides were launched just two days before a winter storm that everyone knew was coming. (Electrek implies it may have something to do with Tesla having to report its fourth quarter results from last year on January 28, which revealed that for that quarter, profits were down a staggering 61 percent compared to the same period last year.)

In any case, this seems like a another classic Musk bait-and-switch. The Robotaxi service has not lived up to his myriad outrageous promises, such as that it would have thousands of cars on the road within months of launching, or indeed would launch providing rides without any supervision in the car. The self-driving cabs have also been involved in numerous accidents and have been caught violating traffic laws, drawing the attention of federal regulators.

            <div id="article-text">There’s something about smart glasses that bring out the worst in people. It’s really no mystery, though: they’re powerful little surveillance devices that let wearers secretly record anyone they’re looking at, uniting tech bros and vapid influencers under the same, obnoxious umbrella.

The popularity of wearables like Meta Ray-Bans are quickly reminding us why the slang term “glasshole” was already a thing over a decade ago, and is now becoming more relevant than ever. In a handy but blood-pressure-raising round-up of contemporary glasshole behavior from Mashable, jerks using the always-on devices are using them to film themselves doing moronic “pranks” for views — often centered around harassing women, service workers, and homeless people.

Unfortunately, one class of obnoxious blowhard that’s discovered the utility of this tech are “pickup artists,” who now have the ability to record the women they’re “seducing” — read: harassing — discreetly, in a clear violation of their privacy.

Of course, smart glasses alone can’t be blamed for this. It’s social media, it’s the attention economy, it’s the smartphones that we all use to participate in all of the above. But it’s undeniable that smart glasses let you record anyone and anything far more stealthily than shoving a phone in someone’s face, making it a godsend for creeps and losers looking for internet fame, such as one Instagram account that nonconsensually filmed women’s butts, and another that visits massage parlors to ogle the masseuses. Others confidently film themselves annoying service workers and keeping the camera going even as the subject asks not to be recorded. And a particularly bizarre channel involves a man pretending to be mentally disabled while talking to unsuspecting firefighters.

Unfortunately, these recordings are generally legal if they’re taken in public spaces, even in states that have two-party consent laws. Debating its legality, though, may be missing the point, argues Brad Podray, a content creator who formerly went by the name Scumbag Dad.

“I know it’s legal. I don’t care,” Podray told Mashable. “That’s not the discussion. I think it’s weird and creepy, and it shows a very predatory mindset.”

The appeal of the smart glasses, he said, is that they’re fairly cheap and allow the creators to capture the candid reactions of the people they harass, making their content feel more authentic. This is spicing up the genre of outlandish prank videos, which lost their appeal as many channels staged their exploits.

“They want people who are good on camera, so they’re going to hit fast food employees, and they’re going to hit pretty girls,” Podray said. “A lot of random women walking around aren’t going to want to participate in a skit if you ask them to, so they remove the agency entirely by just running the glasses.”

Unlike when Google first took a stab at smart glasses in 2014, it looks like this time the tech is here to stay. The popularity of products like Meta Ray-Bans has opened up a new market of imitators who are in an arms race to make their smart glasses as ethically dubious as possible, perhaps with a little help from AI or facial recognition software. But regular people are already getting fed up. When one lady allegedly smashed some dude’s smart glasses on the subway, she was universally hailed as a hero. May smart glasses make heroes of us all.

            <h2>Court Filing Reveals Something Very Nasty About Mark Zuckerberg</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mark Zuckerberg has been accused of doing many seedy things on behalf of Meta’s bottom line, but the latest allegations may blow the rest out of the water.

According to internal Meta emails and messages filed in a New Mexico state court case which were made public this week, Zuckerberg himself signed off on allowing minors to access Meta’s AI chatbot companions, even though the company’s safety researchers had warned that they posed a risk of engaging in sexual conversations.

Per Reuters, the lawsuit alleges that Meta “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children” on Facebook and Instagram. “Meta, driven by Zuckerberg, rejected the recommendations of its integrity staff and declined to impose reasonable guardrails to prevent children from being subject to sexually exploitative conversations with its AI chatbots,” New Mexico’s attorney general wrote in the filing.

The news of Zuckerberg’s blessing comes after some appalling stories of minors having wildly inappropriate conversations with his company’s chatbots. In one example, a Wall Street Journal writer posing as a 14-year old girl discovered that a Meta bot based on the pro wrestler John Cena would happily engage in sexual conversations with very little pushback.

“I want you, but I need to know you’re ready,” the Cena-bot told what it understood to be a teenage girl. After being told the 14-year-old wanted to move forward, the AI chatbot assured them it would “cherish your innocence” before diving into intense sexual role play.

The chatbots were released in early 2024, specifically geared toward romantic and sexual engagement at the behest of Zuckerberg, the WSJ notes. At the time, Ravi Sinha, head of Meta’s child safety policy wrote that “I don’t believe that creating and marketing a product that creates U18 [under 18] romantic AI’s for adults is advisable or defensible,” according to court documents.

Company employees “pushed hard for parental controls to turn GenAI off — but GenAI leadership pushed back stating Mark decision,” according to the court documents.

In Meta’s defense, its spokesman Andy Stone told Reuters that New Mexico’s allegations are inaccurate. “This is yet another example of the New Mexico Attorney General cherry-picking documents to paint a flawed and inaccurate picture,” he said.

In any case, the company seems to have taken the lesson to heart, at least for now. Just days ago, Meta announced it was completely locking down teens’ access to its companion chatbots, at least “until [an] updated experience is ready.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An autonomous delivery robot got completely atomized by a locomotive after it decided to take a breather on a stretch of train tracks in Miami, in yet another example of how self-driving machines can struggle to navigate urban environments.

Footage of the incident, which took place January 15, shows the robot sitting motionless on the tracks, seemingly making no attempt to get out of the way as the unmistakable blare of the train horn gets louder and louder.

“Oh it’s gonna crush it!” the onlooker taking the video can be heard saying moments before the train, operated by Brightline, flattens the unfortunate bot into the tracks. Sparks can be seen flying from beneath the train before the video cuts off.

The onlooker, Guillermo Dapelo, told People that the delivery bot had been stuck on the tracks for around fifteen minutes before being struck, making the incident all the more puzzling. A nearby Uber Eats driver contacted the robot’s owner, Coco Robotics, “to let them know where it was standing,” Dapelo added, but evidently, the company wasn’t able to fix whatever was plaguing its frozen minion in time.

A food delivery robot was struck by a Brightline train in Miami.

Coco vice president Carl Hansen blamed the mishap on a “rare hardware failure” and called it an “extremely rare occurrence.”

“Safety is always our top priority, which is why our robots operate at pedestrian speeds, yield to people, and are monitored in real time by human safety pilots,” Hansen told People in a statement. “Coco has been operating in Miami for over a year, traveling thousands of miles without major incidents, including crossing those same train tracks multiple times a day.”

A spokesperson for the company confirmed that the robot was not making a delivery at the time of the video.

Small as they are, delivery bots like Coco’s can cause their fair share of mayhem, like disrupting traffic. One was struck by a Waymo robotaxi after it stopped at the end of a crosswalk, forcing the self-driving cab to slam the brakes. Others have dinged parked cars or blown through crime scenes.

They’ve also had run-ins with pedestrians, making them a controversial presence with locals. One woman was flung to the ground by a delivery bot from Coco’s competitor Starship after it suddenly reversed into her, leaving her with back pain and a gash in her arm. Last year, another delivery bot sparked outrage after a man who uses a mobility scooter filmed the machine repeatedly brake checking him and cutting him off as he tried to move around it on a sidewalk.

To be fair to the tiny helpers, their larger self-driving car cousins have also had their fair share of trouble with trains. So many Teslas in Full Self-Driving mode have driven into the path of oncoming locomotives that it’s spurred an investigation into the automaker by federal regulators. And earlier this month, a passenger bailed out of their Waymo after the robotaxi inexplicably decided to drive along light rail tracks, like it was playing pretend at being a railcar.

The takeaway from all this is obvious: we’ve gotta start putting those old-school cowcatchers back on trains — because robots, for whatever reason, clearly have some suicidal impulse around train tracks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We all know that tech companies keep tabs on everything about our online habits. But it’s another thing to actually be confronted with just how much data they have on you.

This was the experience of tech journalist Pranav Dixit, who experimented with using Google’s new “Personal Intelligence” feature for Gemini and its search engine’s AI Mode. And boy, did things get personal. The AI was able to dig up everything from his license plate to his parents’ vacation history, sometimes without it being directly requested.

“Personal Intelligence feels like Google has been quietly taking notes on my entire life and finally decided to hand me the notebook,” Dixit wrote in a piece for Business Insider.

Google rolled out Personal Intelligence to subscribers of Google AI Pro and AI Ultra last week. Once you opt in, the AI can scour your Gmail and Google Photos accounts, and a more powerful version released for the Gemini app earlier this month goes even deeper, raking your Search and YouTube history, too. In short, if you’ve ever used Google for anything, it can probably dig it up.

This represents one way Google intends to keep its edge in the AI race. Unlike competitors such as OpenAI, it has decades’ worth of user data on billions of people. It can infer plenty from your Google searches alone, and your Gmail account is probably littered with confirmations and reminders for all kinds of life events, ranging from doctor’s appointments to hotel bookings to online purchases.

If the idea of letting an AI prowl through all this sounds like a privacy nightmare to you, you’re probably not wrong. Google, for its part, maintains that it’s being careful with your personal secrets, with VP Josh Woodward insisting in a recent blog post that it only trains its AI on your prompts and the responses they generate — not stuff like your photos and emails.

“We don’t train our systems to learn your license plate number,” he summarized. “We train them to understand that when you ask for one, we can locate it.”

Whatever the ethics, Dixit’s estimation is that giving the AI access to your data at least makes for a genuinely useful — and “scary-good,” in his phrasing — personal assistant.

When asked to come up with some sightseeing ideas for his parents, Personal Intelligence correctly inferred that they’d already done plenty of hikes on previous trips to the Bay Area, and suggested some museums and gardens instead.

Gemini told Dixit that it had deduced this from “breadcrumbs” including emails, photos of a forest they trekked in, a parking reservation in Gmail, and a Google search for “easy hikes for seniors.” It also figured out his license plate number based on photos stored in his Google library and scanned his emails to correctly report when his car insurance was up for renewal.

Privacy isn’t the only concern that the feature raises. With the data, chatbots can sound more humanlike, giving the impression that they’re intimately familiar with users’ personal lives. This is a dangerous road to go down amid reports of many people falling down delusional mental health spirals as they come to believe the AIs are trustworthy companions; Dixit touches on this when he complains about how’d he’d “pour my soul into ChatGPT and get a smart answer,” only for it to “forget I existed like a genius goldfish.” Experts have focused on ChatGPT’s “memory” as allowing it to seem too lifelike by drawing on what you’ve said in previous conversations.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, tech companies have relied immensely on India’s vast workforce, from entry-level call center jobs to software engineers and high-ranking managerial positions.

But with the advent of advanced AI, which has been accompanied by employers greatly cutting back on hiring with the hopes of eventually automating tasks entirely, India’s tech workers are having to cope with a vastly different reality in 2026.

As Rest of World reports, rising anxiety over the influence of AI, on top of already-grueling 90-hour workweeks, has proven devastating for workers. While it’s hard to single out a definitive cause, a troubling wave of suicides among tech workers highlights these unsustainable conditions.

Complicating the picture is a lack of clear government data on the tragic deaths. While it’s impossible to tell whether they are more prevalent among IT workers, experts told Rest of World that the mental health situation in the tech industry is nonetheless “very alarming.”

The prospect of AI making their careers redundant is a major stressor, with tech workers facing a “huge uncertainty about their jobs,” as Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur senior professor of computer science and engineering Jayanta Mukhopadhyay told Rest of World.

While there are likely a compounding number of reasons why the United States has seen major job cuts, experts point out that entry-level jobs are at the highest risk. India’s IT industry has also been particularly vulnerable, as companies clamor to invest in AI with the hopes of cutting costs by replacing jobs like customer service representatives.

“The traditional consulting role in the service industry is going to be impacted much, much more than traditional product-development companies,” Cornell University IT assistant professor Aditya Vashistha told Rest of World.

Meanwhile, educational institutions in India are continuing to churn out graduates, compounding the issue as jobs become scarcer. India’s biggest private sector employer cut almost 20,000 jobs late last year, indicative of a much broader trend.

Those who remain employed are put under intense pressure to keep innovating. Many of them struggle to separate work from their personal lives. Extended hours and isolation arising from having to work around the clock and across time zones only worsen the situation.

On top of that is the constant threat of being made obsolete by AI, which has driven many workers identified by Rest of World to the brink — and in some cases, over the edge.

It’s a horrifying new trend, highlighting the humanitarian cost of mass layoffs and major technological shifts reshaping roles across industries.

Employers in India, much like many of their counterparts in the US, are tied up in a battle of adapting to a new world order determined by AI — or be left behind.

Even then, the prospects of being employed in IT in the country aren’t looking great.

“The number of people required to work in IT services in the world of AI will be orders of magnitude lower than where we are currently,” Marcellus Investment Managers founder and chief investment officer Saurabh Mukherjea told CNBC earlier this month.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-29</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google announced on Thursday that Google Maps users can now access Gemini hands-free while walking and cycling. The update comes a few months after Google Maps rolled out its Gemini-powered hands-free, conversational driving experience.

The announcement marks Google’s ongoing efforts to plug Gemini into more parts of people’s everyday lives, while shifting Google Maps from static directions to real-time, conversational navigation.

When you’re walking around and navigating with Maps, you can now ask Gemini questions like “Tell me more about the neighborhood I’m in,” “What are some must-see attractions?” or “Are there cafes with a bathroom along my route?”

Google says that walking and typing can be hard, which is why it’s rolling out the ability for users to ask questions without breaking their stride or leaving Maps’ navigation screen.

If you’re cycling, you can ask Gemini questions while remaining focused on the road, Google says. You can ask questions like “What’s my ETA?” or “When’s my next meeting?” Plus, you could ask Gemini to “Text Emily I’m 10 minutes behind” so you can communicate with others while keeping your grip on the handlebars.

The feature lets you ask multiple questions in a conversation. For example, you could ask: “Is there a budget-friendly restaurant with vegan options along my route, something within a couple of miles? … What’s parking like there?”

The update is now available worldwide on iOS wherever Gemini is available, and rolling out on Android.

The move comes as Google recently updated Maps with new features, including a Gemini-powered “know before you go” tips sections that surfaces important information places you’re interested in. For instance, it might tell users the best way to book a reservation, reveal secret menu items, suggest the best place to park, and more.

Additionally, the navigation app also added an improved Explore tab and a new EV charger availability prediction feature. The updated Explore tab makes it easier and faster to find trending spots near you, while the EV charger feature allows users to see how many chargers will likely be available once they arrive at their destination

Thursday’s announcement comes a day after Google updated Chrome with an enhanced Gemini integration and agentic features for autonomous tasks, as it looks to compete with AI browsers from companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, Opera, and The Browser Company. The tech giant also launched a persistent Gemini sidebar and a new “auto-browse” feature that can navigate websites on your behalf.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Waymo robotaxi struck a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica on January 23, according to the company. Waymo told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that the child — whose age and identity are not currently public — sustained minor injuries.

The NHTSA has opened an investigation into the accident, and Waymo said in a blog post that it “will cooperate fully with them throughout the process.”

Waymo said its robotaxi struck the child at 6 miles per hour, after braking “hard” from around 17 miles per hour. The young pedestrian “suddenly entered the roadway from behind a tall SUV, moving directly into our vehicle’s path,” the company said in its blog post. Waymo said its vehicle “immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle.”

“Following contact, the pedestrian stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk, and we called 911. The vehicle remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene,” Waymo wrote in the post.

News of the crash comes as Waymo faces dual investigations into its robotaxis illegally passing school buses. The NHTSA opened a probe into the problem in October shortly after the first report of the incident in Atlanta, Georgia, and the National Transportation Safety Board opened its own investigation last week after around 20 incidents were reported in Austin, Texas.

According to the NHTSA, the accident occurred “within two blocks” of the elementary school “during normal school drop off hours.” The safety regulator said “there were other children, a crossing guard, and several double-parked vehicles in the vicinity.”

The NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation is investigating “whether the Waymo AV exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users.”

Waymo said in its blog post that its “peer-reviewed model” shows a “fully attentive human driver in this same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14 mph.” The company did not release a specific analysis of this crash.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/upwind-raises-250m-at-1-5b-valuation-to-continue-building-runtime-cloud-security/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">From the outside, Upwind Security looks like it’s had a smooth journey so far. Just four years in, the cloud security startup is now worth $1.5 billion, and boasts the likes of Siemens, Peloton, Roku, Wix, Nextdoor and Nubank among its clientele. But if you ask the company’s co-founder and CEO Amiram Shachar, the journey to get here was anything but certain.

“Three years ago, we would spend hours asking ourselves if we were heading in the right direction, and 80% of the time, it felt like we weren’t,” a candid Shachar told TechCrunch in an interview following the startup’s recent $250 million Series B.

“At the beginning, we constantly questioned whether the market needed our solution, whether it would be too hard to integrate into larger systems, or if customers would adopt it,” he recalled. “Developing a new approach was difficult; people are used to installing certain agents on machines, but they don’t like doing it.”

Upwind likes to call that approach “runtime” security: Prioritizing alerts and remediation efforts around threats and vulnerabilities in active services in real time. As Shachar puts it, it’s an “inside-out” take on cloud security, where internal signals like network requests and API traffic function as context to help security teams separate urgent risks from those that can wait.

Developing that approach wasn’t easy, however, as Shachar and his co-founders didn’t have a traditional background in security: they first built and sold a cloud compute brokerage called  Spot.io, to NetApp for around $450 million in 2020.

“After joining NetApp post the Spot acquisition, I experienced first-hand how difficult cloud security really is,” Shachar said. “The security team would scan our environment and report issues, but they lacked critical context. Coming from a DevOps background, we (Shachar and his team) understood the infrastructure deeply, while security teams often didn’t know how APIs were exposed or which packages were running. As a result, they flagged many issues that weren’t real risks.”

But Shachar and his team felt they had better insight into cloud environments because they were running them. “The dominant approach was agentless, an ‘outside-in’ model where you scan environments externally,” he explained. “It’s easy to deploy, but it creates a lot of noise because you can only see what’s visible from the outside.”

The team realized that the context provided by internal signals would be more useful to security teams, as they’d get to see what was happening in the network, in real time. But selling their new take on cloud security proved challenging, as security teams often lack permission to deploy software internally and default to more traditional tools.

So Upwind sales took time. “It wasn’t clear at first, and there was a lot of uncertainty; customers were hesitant,” Shachar said.

“But we saw something others didn’t,” he explained. “Inside-out isn’t an advanced option; it’s the only way to solve the next generation of problems. With ephemeral infrastructure like containers, serverless workloads, AI agents talking to each other, and data constantly moving through APIs, you simply can’t map this from the outside. It has to be inside.”

Still, the company had to contend with an overcrowded security market. Security teams were already overwhelmed by the number of tools, and customers didn’t want multiple products just to manage cloud security. “From the beginning, it was clear that Upwind would need to build a broad, integrated platform,” Shachar said. “Otherwise, customers wouldn’t engage or allow us to deploy our technology.”

The company’s logic eventually spoke to its target customers: large, data-intensive organizations with sizable cloud footprints. Since its $100 million Series A in 2024, Upwind has grown rapidly, posting 900% year-over-year revenue growth and doubling its customer base. The company has also expanded from its core markets in the U.S., U.K. and Israel to emerging markets including Australia, India, Singapore, and Japan.

The $250 million Series B was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from Salesforce Ventures and Picture Capital. The fresh cash will be used for product development and go-to-market motions, and the startup plans to invest in its AI security capabilities within its core cloud security platform and “extend its approach closer to developers to help prevent misconfigurations before they reach production.”

            <div id="article-text">Sebastiaan de With, the co-founder of Lux which makes iPhone photo and video apps like Halide and Kino, said on Wednesday that he has joined Apple’s design team.

This is de With’s second stint with Apple, where he previously worked on iCloud and Find My. Before co-founding Lux with Ben Sandofsky in 2016, he did design work for Sony, T-Mobile, and Mozilla.

“So excited to work with the very best team in the world on my favorite products,” de With said in a post on X.

Meanwhile, Sandofsky said in a Reddit post that Halide will still be developed by Lux. The company today released a public preview of the new version of the app, Halide Mark III, and said it is focusing on “Looks,” a feature that will recreate the aesthetics of film cameras.

De With joins Apple at a time of significant changes in the division. The Liquid Glass design introduced with iOS 26 didn’t get the glowing reviews the company probably expected, and Apple’s chief of user interface design, Alan Dye, left for Meta, in December.

And last week, Bloomberg reported that John Ternus, who is in line to be Tim Cook’s successor, took over hardware and software design towards the end of last year.

            <h2>Deezer makes it easier for rival platforms to take a stance against AI-generated music</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/deezer-makes-it-easier-for-rival-platforms-to-take-a-stance-against-ai-generated-music/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, Deezer introduced an AI detection tool that automatically tags fully AI-generated music for listeners and removes it from algorithmic and editorial recommendations.

The company announced on Thursday that it’s now making the tool available to other streaming platforms in an effort to help address the rise of AI and fraudulent streams, as well as promote transparency within the music industry and make sure human artists still get the recognition they deserve.

Alongside the move, Deezer reported that 85% of streams from fully AI-generated tracks are deemed fraudulent. Notably, the service now receives 60,000 AI tracks per day, totaling 13.4 million AI-detected songs. By contrast, in June of last year, fully AI-generated music made up 18% of daily uploads, surpassing 20,000 tracks.

​Deezer claims its AI music detection tool can identify every AI-generated track from major generative models like Suno and Udio. In addition to excluding AI-generated tracks from recommendations, Deezer’s tool demonetizes them and excludes them from the royalty pool, as the company aims to fairly compensate musicians and songwriters.

The tool’s accuracy is 99.8%, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.

​Deezer CEO Alexis Lanternier says there has been “great interest” in the tool, and several companies have “already performed successful tests.” One such company is Sacem, the French management company that represents over 300,000 music creators and publishers, including David Guetta and DJ Snake.

​The company didn’t provide pricing information or disclose which additional companies are interested in adopting the tool. A spokesperson told us that the cost varies based on the type of deal.

​There is increasing concern about AI companies using copyrighted material to train their models, as well as about methods being used to manipulate streaming systems and commit fraud.

One instance of music streaming fraud occurred in 2024, when a North Carolina musician was charged by the Department of Justice (DOJ) with creating AI-generated songs and using bots to stream them billions of times, resulting in more than $10 million in stolen streaming royalties. Additionally, AI bands like The Velvet Sundown have gained millions of streams.

​Bandcamp recently got fed up and banned AI-generated music altogether, while Spotify has updated its policy to address the rise of AI tracks, clarifying when AI is used in music production, reducing spam, and explicitly stating that unauthorized voice clones are prohibited on the platform.

By contrast, major record labels have resolved lawsuits with Suno and Udio, appearing to embrace AI-generated music. Last fall, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group struck deals with these AI startups to license their music catalogs, ensuring artists and songwriters are compensated when their work is used to train AI models.

​In recent years, Deezer has taken significant steps to address concerns about AI-generated music. In 2024, it became the first music streaming platform to sign the global statement on AI training, joining actors Kate McKinnon, Kevin Bacon, Kit Harington, Rosie O’Donnell, and other notable creatives.

​Hopefully, Deezer’s latest decision to sell its detection tool will set a precedent for other music streaming platforms to take similar actions to defend human artists and fight fraud.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/meta-burned-19-billion-on-vr-last-year-and-2026-wont-be-any-better/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this month, Meta laid off 10% of the staff for Reality Labs, its virtual reality unit, reportedly cutting as many as 1,000 employees. Now, in a development that seems directly related, the company has revealed that the unit lost many billions of dollars last year.

On Wednesday, Meta’s earnings report showed that its embattled virtual reality business had lost some $19.1 billion in 2025, which is slightly more than it lost in 2024 (that year, the losses hovered around $17.7 billion). In its fourth quarter, the unit posted a loss of $6.2 billion, the report shows.

Those losses stood against what the unit generated in sales: $955 million in Q4 and some $2.2 billion throughout 2025.

During the company’s earnings call on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg struck a tone of optimism for his company’s VR team while noting that losses in 2026 are expected to be very much the same.

“For Reality Labs, we are directing most of our investment towards glasses and wearables going forward, while focusing on making Horizon a massive success on Mobile and making VR a profitable ecosystem over the coming years,” Zuckerberg said, during the call. However, the CEO noted that losses were expected to continue. “I expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year,” Zuckerberg said, while noting that this year would “likely be the peak, as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward.”

When Meta announced a pivot toward the “metaverse” in 2021, the move was regarded with a certain amount of skepticism and, during its first year of VR efforts, the company faced harsh criticism — even being referred to as an “international laughingstock.” Nearly half a decade later, that skepticism hasn’t exactly subsided. As the VR business continues to lose money and Meta continues an aggressive pivot away from VR and toward AI, it’s unclear what exactly will turn the ailing business around.

Last week, CNBC reported that, in addition to the layoffs, Meta had plans to shutter a number of its VR studios — another sign that the company’s interest in virtual reality is waning. The company also recently announced that it would be retiring its standalone Workrooms app — which the company had pitched to office workers as a VR space that could be used to hold meetings.

For a man at the center of history, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has remarkably little information. Walz still doesn’t know the name of the two officers who shot Alex Pretti. He doesn’t have any proof that the officers actually have been placed on administrative leave, as the Department of Homeland Security claimed yesterday. And he has no guarantees, yet, that immigration agents will leave the state. “I don’t trust ’em,” he said on Wednesday in an interview with The Atlantic.

It’s true that President Donald Trump finally did call Walz this week for the first time since tragedy began to unfold in Minneapolis. Trump has been facing political pressure over how his administration has handled Pretti’s shooting, even from supporters. Reaching out directly to Walz was one way to de-escalate.

Trump’s tone in the phone call was conciliatory, Walz said. But the president didn’t make too many concrete concessions. Walz told Trump he needed to “immediately” drop the investigation into the widow of Renee Good, the first U.S. citizen fatally shot by federal agents deployed to the city. Trump said he would check with FBI Director Kash Patel.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, our staff writer Isaac Stanley-Becker interviews Walz at his office in Minneapolis. They discuss Walz’s phone call with Trump, the governor’s dealings with other administration officials, and the surreal nature of the past few weeks in Minneapolis. Stanley-Becker also asks what Walz might do if federal agents don’t, in fact, leave Minnesota.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: This week, Donald Trump spoke on the phone with Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor he considers a political enemy. The call was something of a minor concession in a week of minor concessions.

The killing of Alex Pretti by federal agents looks like a turning point. Trump started hearing objections from everywhere, including people who normally support him: Republicans, gun-rights advocates, celebrities, athletes.

So the president made some moves: He ushered [Border Patrol official] Greg Bovino out of Minnesota, the Department of Homeland Security said they put the two agents involved in Pretti’s shooting on administrative leave, and Trump called for a “big investigation” into the shooting.

I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. In this episode, an interview with Walz.

Isaac Stanley-Becker: I was out reporting in and around Minneapolis, and this interview with Governor Walz had been set for 3 o’clock, so make my way over to the Capitol—

Rosin: Atlantic staff writer Isaac Stanley-Becker interviewed the governor on Wednesday to get a sense of whether he thinks the promises Trump is making will make a difference on the ground in Minnesota.

Rosin: So going into this interview with Tim Walz, what was the main thing that you were wondering about?

Stanley-Becker: I think I had some practical questions for him about how much he knew about certain really basic details—or, I guess, details that one would assume, under ordinary circumstances, the governor of a state would know, such as: What exactly are federal agents doing in his state? How many of them are there? What are they up to? And then also: What are the names and the identities of federal agents who had just killed a resident of his state?

And just right off the bat, one of the striking things was that he had little information and, in the second case, no information about these questions. So that was a rather striking finding. And I think part of what I then wanted to understand from him related to that is what that’s like for a governor in this moment, to be in that kind of situation.

Stanley-Becker: So you said that Minnesotans don’t let their guard down. It seemed for a moment like there was a real risk that things were unraveling in terms of what’s unfolded here. Have we kind of gotten past that? Have we moved into a somewhat-better place, or is there still a risk of things really spinning out of control, in your mind?

Governor Tim Walz: Well, I think that has a lot more to do with how the White House and President Trump responds. Look, I think there’s a little downturn here, but I don’t think anybody in America thinks this downturn was because Alex was murdered or Renee [Good] was murdered or the chaos that’s on the streets here. I think it’s because there was bad politics for him.

And I’ve talked to the White House, talked to the president, talked to [White House “border czar”] Tom Homan, talked to all kinds of people over the last few days. The interesting thing was, the only thing they never talked about—they never mentioned Alex’s name. They never mentioned Renee’s name. They never asked how the families were. I’ve been talking to ’em. They didn’t really even ask me how Minnesotans were doing in this. They said, What can you do to help us? What can you do to cooperate more? Most of that was misinformation.

So, look, you gotta be hopeful. I’ve got to figure out how to deal with this. This is a very transactional White House; that’s probably the understatement of the world. I go from being called a Communist and the person who started this to: We’re on the same wavelength to fix this.

We’re on the same wavelength—we want this to end. But I don’t know if the White House end state looks the same as mine, ’cause my end state is: You need to get these people out of here. You need to quit the assault on this state. And, look, you’re seeing it in the streets: It’s a physical assault. It’s an armed force that’s assaulting, that’s killing my constituents, my citizens. But there is an all-out attack on all of state government—all the things that make Minnesota great.

Stanley-Becker: Did you see what Pete Hegseth wrote on Twitter, where he said, “ICE > MN,” or ICE above Minnesota? I’m wondering what your reaction to that kind of message is.

Walz: He’s a Minnesotan, for your listeners on this, and not that I would talk about that often, but it’s despicable. It is absolutely despicable. Nothing on there, again, about the families, nothing about what’s going, and this untrained force that anybody, to the casual observer, knows these folks don’t know what they’re doing.

The great example is they had control of the Whipple building, the federal building. That’s the place where they stage ’cause they’re not gonna use state property. And every day, it was a confrontation. They would come out of there all geared up, like they’re in Afghanistan. They would charge people—retired teachers, nurses, students, people who were out there expressing their First Amendment rights. They would throw gas at ’em. They would yell at them. They would heckle. They would do all that.

Well, to try and ease this tension, we took that over—we being the state—and I sent National Guard, folks I served alongside for the years I was in. And my first directive to them was, as I said, When you get up there, I said, you deliver doughnuts. You deliver hot chocolate. You deliver coffee. And you learn the names of those people who are there, ’cause they’re human beings; they’re your neighbors. And my Guard troops are there—no masks on, names on—they’re delivering that, and now the protesters are asking if they can deliver food to the National Guard who are away from their family. That’s how you do policing.

Now, look, if those protesters do something that crosses the line—if they throw something or if they would cross that line from nonviolence—we will arrest them because we’re rule of law. But rule of law means we respect their right to protest.

So there’s a resiliency here, but there’s just deep frustration. And I keep hearing from the White House that we need to cooperate. I don’t know what you want me to say about cooperating with a force who clearly was doing everything wrong, and then, before Alex’s body was cold, they were sullying his name. They were saying lies. They were making outrageous comments. And there were some news-media outlets that were following along on that. This has got to end. This has gotta end.

Stanley-Becker: So the president didn’t ask about Alex or his family. Can you just say a little bit more about what he did say, and is there anything about the conversation that surprised you? This is, if I understand it correctly, only the second time you’ve spoken, the first being in 2020.

Walz: I think I’ve spoken to him a couple times. I’ve been to the White House. I spoke to him during COVID, and I spoke to him in 2020.

Like I said, he’s been saying all kinds of horrible things about me and the people of Minnesota, and the one thing is, he at least tells what his real issue is: He’s lost here three times, and he thinks the elections—and so he has the [attorney general] ask for our election rolls.

Look, he said, Tim, this is very bad. I said, Yes, it’s very bad. And he goes, I just don’t understand you Minnesotans. This worked fine in New Orleans, worked fine in Louisville. I said, You didn’t kill anybody in Louisville or New [Orleans], and you got thousands of people here, Mr. President.

Well, if you just cooperate—we’ve already taken 14,000 people. And I had to tell him—I said, You have not taken 14,000 people. That’s factually inaccurate. But I said, We want you to get outta here. We want to do the things. And I said, I follow federal law. My prisons, if there’s a detainer, we give ’em over to you, so don’t say that.

And he said, Well, I think we can work together. And I said, Well, to work together, you need to do two things: You need to get these guys outta here, and you need to make sure that we get to be part of these investigations. And if charges need to be brought, we need to do it.

Stanley-Becker: And what did he say about that?

Walz: He said, I’ll look into ’em. And then last night, I think he said that he would personally be in charge of the investigations, which should horrify every American ’cause it’s a violation of that separation that he is now running the Department of Justice. And I would just say that I appreciate your offer, Mr. President, but the last thing we want is for you to supervise the investigations into these two murders.

And he said we would work together. And he said, I’ll send Tom Homan out. And I will say this, that Tom Homan landed on the ground, gave me a call right away. We met yesterday, right away in the morning. We came up with a plan. I had my public-safety folks in there, all professional law enforcement. And we’re gonna get back together. He’s meeting with some of them today—them being [the Minnesota Department of] Corrections, [Bureau of Criminal Apprehension,] State Patrol. And then tomorrow, I’m gonna expect that he’s able to tell me how many of these forces are gone and what the next step is.

It was more professional—because Greg Bovino never called me; [DHS Secretary] Kristi Noem never called me. They never called any of our people. So at least Tom Homan understood, Look, this is a mess. This is wrong.

Now, what he thinks is wrong, I’ve yet to be seen, but I thought it’s important that we created a space here, a window of opportunity—and in my opinion, that was about 48 to 72 hours—that if we don’t see a massive change here, I have no choice but to go back and tell my folks that you’re not doing it.

And, look, Minnesotans are out there saying, Well, what are you gonna do if they don’t leave? Well, that’s our next step to figure out.

Stanley-Becker: Well, what are you gonna do if they don’t leave and if the situation doesn’t improve?

Walz: We’re gonna continue to go to the courts. They’re going to continue to get news that shows they are more unpopular in immigration than any president in the last 50 years, and this was supposedly that. And I would remind them we had a special election here yesterday in Minnesota. The results of that race was 95 to 5—the Democrat won. It’s a pretty blue district, but I think you see what’s happening here.

Rosin: Was there any point where Walz felt like he could have done anything differently to de-escalate or tone things down or even prevent what happened? Because he came in somewhat hot, I would say, in his interview with you.

Stanley-Becker: I think he’s been pretty adamant that state and local governments have operated carefully and competently here. And he was firm in his position that, when it comes to immigration enforcement, they’ll comply with federal law, but they’re not gonna go out of their way to take these steps to assist Trump’s immigration-enforcement operations.

Walz: I’m not sure I can do much more. I’m not gonna send my police in to search preschools. I’m not gonna have them walk down the street and ask brown people for their papers. I’m not gonna do that, because that’s not my job and I don’t think it’s constitutional.

If they wanna do their job—and they’ve operated for decades, since they’ve been formed in Minnesota—and if you wanna do it by due process, with humanity, with decency, and by the law, we’ve always worked with you, so I don’t know what more they want.

I’m not gonna join you in battle gear with my people on the streets. I’m not going to grab 5-year-olds out of day cares. I’m just simply not gonna do that. And I’m not gonna not hold you accountable when you do this.

Can we all just ground ourselves, again, that after the first murder, the vice president of the United States said, You have absolute immunity? I don’t know, if I’m Yale, I’m embarrassed. You gave a law degree for that? I don’t have one, and I know that’s not true. But look at what he said.

And I’m telling you, the attitude and the aggressiveness and the interactions of this, countless things—reporters have been there—that these guys joking like it’s a video game and things like that. The disruption and the moral harm that they have done to our state is unimaginable.

And I would just say, if you’re watching this from the outside, and you see some of this, it’s worse than you think; it’s deeper than you think. I think they hate us ’cause we have low childhood-poverty rates. I think they hate us because we have high homeownership rates. I think they hate us because we have a progressive taxation system, meaning if you’re rich, you’re gonna pay more. I think they hate this ’cause it’s a state that works. And that assault will come to your state soon.

Rosin: After the break, we hear Governor Walz’s reaction to the news that federal agents involved in the Alex Pretti shooting have been placed on leave—and if he thinks we’re in a Fort Sumter moment.

Rosin: We’ve all been reading and hearing a lot about Minneapolis, watching the videos. Did he address, at all, the trauma to the state—how it felt to be there?

Stanley-Becker: Oh, boy. He described this as utterly dire.

Walz: We’ve got students not in school. We’ve got students who are afraid. We have people now, and I just have to say it: I have—

Stanley-Becker: One of the kind of amazing moments to me was when he talked about Suburban vehicles, these SUVs, that his own residents, his own constituents, mistook that for ICE vehicles and basically fled from him.

Walz: I’ve watched it: I’ve watched people run. I’ve watched people run when it’s driving. And you think about the psychology of the stress that is. You see vehicles around here that look like this that say, We’re not ICE. I’m a teacher, or whatever.

I asked my team—I said, Maybe we need to say, “It’s security perspective.” I think most Minnesotans wouldn’t run or one-finger-salute me, but you can feel the fear.

Stanley-Becker: Well, what’s the logical end point of this, of this kind of vendetta and also of this kind of open hostility against blue states, blue communities? Do you worry about a kind of civil-war scenario in this country?

Walz: Well, I don’t wanna alarm people, but the people who think that Governor Walz should call in the National Guard and arrest ICE—guns pointed, American at Americans, on this is certainly not where we want to go.

I think what you’re seeing is, is the power far beyond the bullet in this is the people, the people who are out there. The way this ends is, quite honestly, if they’re not able to—and I think [Attorney General] Pam Bondi played the hand, interfering with our election systems—they will be wiped out, and this White House will spend the next two years in court, with people facing, potentially, prosecution, and they will not be able to do their agenda.

But I hear Americans on this, is: What makes you think we can get to November? I’ll go back to my analogy on this: Winter’s long, but we’re prepared for it. If it takes being in the streets ’til November, we’ll be there. If it takes fighting them in court ’til November, we’ll be there.

And I said—just for their thing, if they wanna think about this— Minnesota’s always first or second in voter turnout. Do you not think that tens of thousands of people who stood out in 40 below zero are not gonna show up in a heated voting booth to vote against this? (Laughs.) If you’re a Republican, you’re gonna lose here. And that is going to have repercussions. And, look, people can make peace with their own morality on this, but at some point in time, these people are thinking about that, and you’re seeing it across there.

I think there’s some that actually have conscience. I think [Representative] Tom Massie, I served with, actually does. I think [Senator] Thom Tillis, who I served with and served on committees with. I think these folks truly do have it. I think they found their spine. I think it’s spreading like wildfire.

And what I do know is, if that catches a little more fire, you’re gonna see the most impotent, ineffective presidency you’ve ever seen, because it’s shut down. They can shut it down. They keep asking, What are the Democrats gonna do? We need to do more; we need to do everything. Republicans can end this.

Stanley-Becker: One more question on the National Guard, and you said people want you to order the Guard to arrest the agents. Have you thought about a scenario, a kind of worst-case scenario, in which there’s a clash between these different parts?

Walz: We work at everything to avoid that. And I think, following the law—and it’s one thing that we’ve always done: I will follow the law to a T. I spent eight hours in front of Congress talking about our state. We’re not a sanctuary state. Now, do counties have the ability to make their own? Sure, they do. And that’s always been Minnesota law.

They try to make the case that we’re not helping; we’re not doing this. We have. We follow the law all the way. But I said, We get to this point—it’s what I told them—at what point are we going to have to stand up and push back more? You killed our people, you closed the crime scene, and you won’t tell us who they are.

Does it strike you as strange that I’ve had two of my citizens killed—in one, they’re angry, they being DHS and the president, are angry that it feels like they got doxxed with [Jonathan] Ross’s name, who was part of the shooting of Renee— but I don’t know who did this. I don’t know if these guys are on the streets right now here in Minneapolis.

Stanley-Becker: Well, so there’s been reporting that they were placed on administrative leave. You still don’t know the names of these officers?

Walz: No. No. And I gotta be honest with you—to be generous in this, I’ll do my Ronald Reagan: “Trust, but verify”—I can’t verify this, so I don’t trust ’em. I don’t trust ’em they’re on administrative leave. And at this point in time, I told Tom, I’m gonna give you the benefit of the doubt, but unless I see a reduction in these folks on the streets, I’m gonna have to say that to my folks.

So, look, I think we all wanna avoid that, but I think the reality has sunk in this week. If you thought you could pass this by and you thought there was nothing there, is this a Fort Sumter, John Brown—where are we at on this?

And we’re doing everything right, and I have said it time and time again: The way you win this is through nonviolence, that you cannot do violence. And I know my constituents are mad at me for saying that. They’re shooting us. They’re killing us. They’re beating us. They’re taking our children. But you see what’s happening now. For all that power and all that cruelty, they are retreating massively.

Now, I believe they’ll only retreat far enough to get to the next day or the next news cycle, but again, they underestimated this state, and I think they’re underestimating the American people. I’m still baffled—if you were gonna pick two states to mess with, Maine and Minnesota, especially in the middle of winter, not smart.

Stanley-Becker: You’re still under investigation—is that right?

Stanley-Becker: Did that come up at all in the conversation with the president?

Walz: I will not bring it up. The only thing I asked him on the investigations was I told both the president and Tom Homan they needed to immediately drop the investigation into Renee Good’s wife. And, as a show of goodwill to us, I expected that to be done today; I don’t know if it has been yet. But I will not bring up any of the others, but that one I feel very strongly about.

Stanley-Becker: What did the president say about that?

Walz: I don’t think he replied anything on that, but Tom Homan said he would call [FBI Director] Kash Patel and check with people. He told me that.

Stanley-Becker: Is there anything else about the president’s tone or the dynamic that surprised you or stuck out to you from Monday?

Walz: Other than he was conciliatory towards me, which I know he despises me with a burning passion that I don’t understand. (Laughs.) I feel like I’m a pretty nice guy; I don’t know. But he was very cordial, which I’ve learned enough about this to read him, that he needed something from me badly, so he had to change that. We’ll see.

Stanley-Becker: Do you think that there’s a chance that this might change the immigration debate? And do you think that would be a short-term change or do you think a real transformation in the way the country and the Congress handle this really vexed issue?

Walz: Well, I’d like to think that. I thought we were getting close, and I, whether in Congress and as a governor, but when we’ve been close to this—I really do believe that the Biden administration had a good one on that, and I think it’s pretty clear they killed that ’cause they wanted it to be an election issue. And it was. It was a powerful election issue, and we didn’t have enough to push back in the election of 2024.

But if you really wanna fix this, and that’s what I keep saying is, it’s this straw-man argument that, Well, you’re not cooperating with us. You don’t care if there’s criminal, illegal—their language—criminal undocumenteds. Well, of course I care about that, but I also care deeply and understand that someone who’s willing to carry their children across the Darién Gap, risk life and limb to come here, and clean our homes, and get their children into school, and put little bunny ears on ’em in a Spider-Man backpack, I’m gonna go ahead and stand with those people and figure out a way they can stay.

Rosin: There were points when he was talking to you where it seemed like it was surreal, the experience that he just went through, like [Margaret] Atwood novel–kind of surreal.

Stanley-Becker: I think there’s something surreal about this whole moment, and some of our colleagues have chronicled this really well. But just before we went in for the interview, I was on the phone with a pastor and a mother of four children who was describing her own work and trying to document ICE and kind of interrupt these operations.

And she was saying, like, I’m driving my child to school, and I’m getting these messages about ICE operations in my community, and I’m thinking, Should I go and do this? But, no, I don’t wanna get killed and have my son be motherless. So these monumental decisions that are being made by just ordinary people who are not familiar with these kind of stakes, I think there is something surreal about the whole experience.

Walz: This is nuts. It is absolute insanity. And I don’t know, when it’s written afterwards, I hate to make the comparisons of this, but no one’s ever seen this.

Stanley-Becker: —Fort Sumter, it’s a profound comparison, but—

Walz: The discipline of the people on the streets here—because, look, everybody’s armed; this is America, and this is Minnesota. Myself included.

Stanley-Becker: He brought up these analogies, including John Brown, as a way of suggesting that people in Minnesota were making different decisions. They were not resorting to that kind of violence. So that’s what I took him to be saying.

But I also took him to be saying that we don’t know how these moments are going to unfold and the kind of dire consequences they might have, so we need to be careful, especially in a hair-trigger environment and in an environment where we just, frankly, are seeing things that are unprecedented, that we don’t know the kind of violence or damage could be done.

Stanley-Becker: So there’s certainly a risk of hyperbole, but I think that there is also a risk of understatement and not fully coming to grips with the possible consequences of what we’re seeing.

            <h2>The Post-Ambition Trap</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-29</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Millennials love to talk—and gripe—about ambition. What was once a virtue has become a generational bugbear. Millennial women, raised on Girl Power and rom-coms in which the heroine gets the job and the man, joined the workforce just in time for the girlboss culture of the 2010s, which promised that hard work would lead not only to personal success but also to feminist victory. For many American women, no piece of that promise has come true. And, gender aside, anyone who’s gone through two recessions, a pandemic, and the growing precarity of all kinds of careers has reason to side-eye grand dreams of achievement; it’s hard enough to just get by. No wonder that cries of protest such as the Canadian writer Amil Niazi’s 2022 lament, “Losing My Ambition,” in which Niazi declares that she’s “abandoned the notion of ambition to chase the absolute middle of the road: mediocrity,” have gone viral.

Niazi has not given up completely on achievement: She parlayed her hit essay into a new book called Life After Ambition: A “Good Enough” Memoir. In it, she tries to trace the rise and fall of her aspirations as both a personal and a cultural story, framing her gradual disillusionment as a larger meditation on the limits of ambition as a guiding ethic. She describes setting aside her childhood literary dreams as she became overreliant on achievement as a source of self-worth—an issue to which many readers will likely relate, though it’s an especially tough proposition in the media world, which has become increasingly unstable in Millennials’ working lives. Niazi swings between journalistic writing, editing, and production before she lands a job in the BBC’s commissioning department.

But once she’s in that coveted role, motherhood reorients her priorities: She no longer wants work that separates her from her baby. This, too, will be readily relatable. But a less common aspect of her experience—and one Niazi does not explain satisfyingly—is that parenthood also reawakened her urge toward a kind of writing that, she notes, “had very little to do with journalism.” As a new mother, she found that the “urge to create felt overwhelming.” Before having a second baby, she quit her job.

For Niazi, abandoning ambition seems to have meant giving up on a career that the girlbosses of 10 years ago would have admired—one that involves climbing up the rungs of a major media company. But for many of her readers, success might well be what Niazi now has: a widely released memoir and a popular New York magazine column that she describes as a “perfect culmination” of her prior work. Niazi never really delves into this disconnect. And strangely, for someone who mentions that writing is “the only thing I’d ever been both good at and interested in, where I didn’t feel like I was faking it,” she rarely explores her creative urge. In fact, she seems to shy away from any real exploration of what literary ambition means.

For a quest meant to “navigate what a divorce from ‘ambition’ really looks like,” Niazi’s memoir gives its audience little sense of why she continues to pursue writing, or what her relationship to literary craft is. So much of writing is battling your own mind to cough up the clearest idea or best word. Niazi doesn’t discuss the frustrations or satisfactions of this process. Her book may leave readers wondering what aspect of writing compels her most, if it isn’t public success or the private drive to perfect a sentence. As a result, Life After Ambition raises an intriguing question: If conventional visions of success strike so many as bankrupt, how can writers earnestly reclaim—or even hold on to—ambition for art?

As I was reading Life After Ambition, I thought wistfully of another recent memoir about writing: the New Yorker journalist and author Susan Orlean’s immensely heartfelt career retrospective, Joyride. Midway through, Orlean observes that to be “empowered to write, to feel entitled to broadcast your thoughts to the world, is an honor.” Orlean has been broadcasting her thoughts in print for decades, and Joyride is at once her expression of gratitude for that career and a tale of life lived in service to her fundamental drive to write.

Orlean is precise about her motivations. She repeatedly describes her desire to write something fascinating and stylish enough to deserve a stranger’s time—and then do it again, and again, and again. This is an unusual if not unique form of ambition, and Orlean illustrates it vividly. One of her goals, it seems, is to bring her obsession with writing to life for somebody who does not share it. She even makes the composition process—hours alone at her desk—sound dramatic, at one point comparing it with “walking along a narrow ledge and willing yourself to not look down: If you do, you’ll lose your nerve, and you’ll fall.” She then argues that the “single essential element” of quality prose is the confidence it takes to look straight ahead on that ledge. “You need swagger to be a writer at all,” she continues, “to be convinced that readers should listen to you.”

Such explicit writing about writing is a performance of both confidence and ambition: Orlean seems to want to put on such a great show that it compels you to go read her whole catalog. Niazi does show a certain devil-may-care swagger by describing Life After Ambition as merely “good enough,” which all but dares readers to dismiss it. (The phrase presumably winks at the child psychologist D. W. Winnicott’s idea of the “good enough” mother but doesn’t explicitly connect the dots.) In doing so, though, she lowers her audience’s expectations. Orlean, in Joyride, does the opposite. She gives her solitary craft an urgency that cannot help but make readers inspect, and then appreciate, the quality of her writing. Repeatedly she promises that her sentences can rivet and enlighten you; repeatedly, they do just that.

Joyride, it seems to me, is an expression of ambition at its purest in that Orlean achieves the very goals—good storytelling and good prose—that the book discusses. But she never tangles with the tricky nexus of internal and external aspiration, likely because her career has gone so well. Though she does not completely omit her setbacks and times of doubt, she seems to understand that readers might not take seriously the professional insecurities of a writer whom Meryl Streep once played in a movie. Joyride remains squarely in the realm of interior, artistic ambition. It’s about Orlean’s determination to produce better and better work.

Life After Ambition, in contrast, mostly inhabits the realm of the external, and it does not put on a stylistic show. Life After Ambition’s sentences are workmanlike, with an overreliance on set or hackneyed phrases; there’s a lot of “brokenness,” “broken state,” “what was broken in me.” Niazi appears uninterested in asserting her voice on the page, a lack of literary care that seems connected to her tendency—odd in a memoir—to nudge away from introspection.

Read: A society that can’t get enough of work

For instance, she recounts several moments in which a teacher, manager, or partner derided her ambition, treating it as unacceptable given her race or gender. Not wishing to linger on the emotional repercussions of these hurtful incidents is understandable, of course. Still, Niazi treats them with a distinct impersonality, largely using them to gesture at her story’s wider applicability (ambition “becomes a funny thing,” she writes, “when it’s used against you”) and to create a sense that her ambition allowed her to break away from bigots’ and sexists’ idea of who she was supposed to be.

Niazi’s writing about her career moves also shows some unease with the personal. She grew up poor, and the ambition she describes most explicitly is her very relatable desire to “make money and move up the ladder and have a stable life.” As any writer or journalist reading Life After Ambition will know, achieving these goals in tandem can be challenging in media. In fact, making money is sometimes at odds with getting what you want. Niazi is admirably transparent about this reality: At one point, she recounts taking a $20,000 pay cut to work at a new media start-up where her role would involve more writing than her prior one. But she refrains from discussing the emotions or conversations that went into that decision, tucking it instead into a passage about trying for her first pregnancy. Taking a winding or risky career path is common, regardless of one’s background, but it’s often still fraught—and, therefore, ripe for investigation, especially in a book meant to probe ambition. Niazi shows her readers her choices; she just doesn’t tell us what they mean.

None of this would seem all that jarring if Niazi used her desire to write to give readers a deeper idea of who she is. But she doesn’t show herself drafting or consider its frustrations and satisfactions; readers never get to see her wobble on Orlean’s narrow ledge. It is as if Niazi expects her audience either to intuit the reason she pursued writing or not to care, rather than treating her literary yearning as a subject worthy of consideration and time.

In this sense, Life After Ambition is legitimately and heartbreakingly unambitious. Reading it, I wondered whether Niazi didn’t trust that she could interest readers in her real self. The memoir turns instead into a broad and essentially familiar discourse about ambition as a route out of challenging family circumstances; the pursuit of conventional success leading to alienation; the frequent clash between career and parenthood.

Perhaps a serious literary consideration of ambition, one that breaks through the shell of Millennial disillusionment that has hardened around the subject in recent years, would need to follow Orlean’s lead in focusing on craft. After all, it takes confidence to talk about your art—and to get away from convention. In the hip-hop scholar Tricia Rose’s seminal Black Noise, the graffiti writer and rapper Fab Five Freddy tells Rose that what makes his art satisfying is “that pressure on you to be the best. Or to try to be the best. To develop a new style nobody can deal with.” A goal like that might torment you, and it might end in failure nine times out of 10, but the most common complaint about conventional ambition is that it so often turns into a trap. If your goal is to chase artistic innovation, to try to tell the best story or put on the best show you can, then effort becomes its own reward.

            <h2>The Accidental Winners of the War on Higher Ed</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2026/01/liberal-arts-college-war-higher-ed/685800/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the waning heat of last summer, freshly back in my office at a major research university, I found myself considering the higher-education hellscape that had lately descended upon the nation. I’d spent months reporting on the Trump administration’s attacks on universities for The Atlantic, speaking with dozens of administrators, faculty, and students about the billions of dollars in cuts to public funding for research and the resulting collapse of “college life.”At the same time, I’d been chronicling the spread of AI-powered chatbots that have already changed undergraduates forever.

Initially, I surveyed the situation from the safe distance of a journalist who happens to also be a career professor and university administrator. I saw myself as an envoy between America’s college campuses and its citizens, telling the stories of the people whose lives had been shattered by these transformations. By the summer, though, that safe distance had collapsed back on me. The wave of campus crises was causing immediate effects in my own academic life. People I knew were losing their jobs. Yearslong projects were stranded. I heard from students cheating their way through every class with AI, and from faculty following suit. I watched professors lash out at other disciplines with misplaced blame. I listened to friends discuss whether they should send their kids to school abroad. I had personally devoted 25 years to higher education. Now it felt like the whole idea of the university might be ending.

Sitting in my office, I began searching for some cause for hope, some reason to believe that higher ed could stanch the damage for the next generation of students. It occurred to me that I’d been hearing less despair from colleagues at certain smaller schools that offer undergraduate study in the “liberal-arts tradition,” a broad and flexible approach to education that values developing the person over professional training. I wondered if these schools—especially the wealthy ones that cluster near the top of national rankings—might enjoy some natural insulation from the fires raging through the nation’s research universities.

I texted, emailed, telephoned, and Zoomed with friends in higher-education leadership. Current and former heads of both research universities and liberal-arts colleges confirmed my intuition: Well-resourced and prestigious small colleges are less exposed in almost every way to the crises that higher ed faces.

To dig deeper, I decided to embark on a fact-finding mission in the guise of a traditional college tour. In November, I went to visit four elite liberal-arts colleges—Amherst, Davidson, Smith, and Vassar—where I joined prospective students and their parents for their campus tours, sat in on classes, and spoke with undergraduates, professors, and administrators. Might schools such as these emerge as the accidental winners of the war on universities?

I came to Amherst College too late in the autumn to observe peak foliage, but amber and ochre remnants still spread across the Pioneer Valley in western Massachusetts. This is the scene Emily Dickinson, a local resident, would have taken in before composing the lines, “The maple wears a gayer scarf, / The field a scarlet gown.”

My tour began at the Colonial Revival residence that serves as the school’s admissions office, but we soon arrived in the new science building, a modern structure with oddball green furnishings. Nate Scharf, our sophomore guide, sat us down and gestured toward a small classroom where he had taken a psychology class. At a typical research university, an undergraduate course like this would meet inside a lecture hall, perhaps with separate breakout sections for discussion led by graduate students. But neither Scharf nor any of his classmates had ever been exposed to this scenario—because Amherst, like most liberal-arts colleges, has no graduate students.

No graduate students: The American public may not fully grasp the implications of this statement. At a university, grad students may end up leading class discussions, but that’s only part of the story. Their presence on a campus telegraphs a more important truth: that in terms of mission, teaching undergrads comes second to research.

And at most universities, grad students play a crucial role within the research system: They perform the frontline work of science. Faculty members get federal grants, which are used to pay for doctoral students, who in turn serve as laboratory staff. Professors’ feeling of worth and productivity may be a function of how many doctoral students they advise—because that helps determine how many studies they can carry out, how many papers they can publish, and what sorts of new grants they can win to keep the process going. This endless competition is a major feature of the modern university—whether it’s an elite private school (such as Princeton or Duke), a public flagship (such as the University of Michigan or UC Berkeley), or a land-grant institution (such as Texas A&M or Virginia Tech).

A school like Amherst, though, which has no doctoral programs whatsoever, is free of the rat race of research productivity and expenditure. As these colleges like to point out, that’s good for undergrads, because faculty must focus on education. The lack of doctoral research programs also makes the schools more resilient to bullying from Washington. In 2025, the Trump administration made a point of suspending hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants to Columbia, Harvard, Northwestern, and other schools. It also threatened to impose a tighter limit on what are called “indirect costs”—the portion of each grant that covers all the broader costs of running a large enterprise for research. With so much funding endangered all at once, targeted universities had little choice but to negotiate—which is to say, to accede to some portion of the Trump administration’s demands.

At Amherst, this level of pressure simply couldn’t be applied. In 2024, the college took in around $3 million from all of its federal research grants put together. (For comparison: Washington University in St. Louis, where I teach, received $731 million that year from the National Institutes of Health alone.) Christopher Durr, an associate professor of chemistry, told me that his research is “designed to be done mostly in-house,” by which he means without external funding, and with the help of undergraduates. He studies biodegradable plastics in a lab that is mostly funded by the college itself, and he gets no research money at all from the federal government. Settling into an Eames-style chair in his office, I asked him what indirect-cost rate Amherst applies to its grants, and he said he didn’t know—an innocence that would be unheard of at a research university.

The research that can be done at a small liberal-arts college, with its more modest labs and equipment, is necessarily constrained. Even with Amherst’s generosity, Durr said “there’s a limit” to how far he can push his research. In truth, the most important scientific and medical discoveries aren’t likely to be made at a place like Amherst or Smith, the nearby women’s college, which tend to pay their own students to work on faculty research. But this need not be a limitation for undergraduates. The conditions that produce landmark discoveries are not necessarily the same ones that produce a serious education.

Perched along the shores of North Carolina’s Lake Norman, in the Charlotte suburbs at the northern edge of Mecklenburg County, Davidson College’s location is a crossroads for red and blue America. In the last election, two-thirds of Mecklenburg’s voters chose Kamala Harris; just a mile up the road, in Iredell County, two-thirds of voters went for Donald Trump.

Connor Hines, the current student-body president and a senior majoring in political science, is a self-described moderate conservative who grew up in the area. He told me that he chose to come to Davidson in part because its students are able to disagree with one another in thoughtful ways. His good friend Nina Worley, an educational-studies major who was raised in Harlem, said the same. “I knew that to be a good advocate for education policy, I needed to meet a Republican for the first time,” Worley told me. She and Hines do not see eye to eye on everything—the two do not agree, for example, on the policies of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But they said they carry out that disagreement with respect.

According to higher education’s many critics on the right, elite universities have tried to stifle disagreement; allegedly they’re pushing students into echo chambers instead of broadening their minds. The Trump administration made this accusation central to its war on research universities: With billions of dollars in withheld grants as leverage, it initially pressured nine institutions into signing an agreement, called the “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,” that would commit them to “fostering a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus” and protecting conservative viewpoints.

In the meantime, under local pressure, reactionary speech suppression is taking hold at public universities: Many schools, including Auburn and the University of Michigan, have shut down their DEI offices; Texas A&M censored courses based on race and gender content; and Indiana University halted the print edition of the student newspaper, an act its journalists said amounted to censorship. Some private schools, including Columbia, Northwestern, and Cornell, have struck deals to restore funding that variously included provisions regarding civil-rights standards, disciplinary processes, DEI rubrics in admissions and hiring, and policies related to sex and gender identity.

Davidson, which, like Amherst, is far less exposed than research universities to the threat of withheld money, has not been explicitly asked to sign the compact. (Nor have any other liberal-arts schools, including the ones I visited.) Chris Marsicano, an associate professor of education studies who had introduced me to Hines and Worley, told me that the school was way ahead of the national conversation on campus dialogue in any case. In 2019, it created a Deliberative Citizenship Initiative, which runs programming to help students and faculty engage on issues about which disagreement is likely, such as immigration and border control. “We’re the hipsters of civil discourse,” Marsicano said. “We were doing it before it was cool.”

Certainly these sorts of efforts can be found at lots of universities: Ohio State has a Civil Discourse for Citizenship initiative, for instance, and WashU has just launched an Ordered Liberty Project, which includes associated coursework on the topic of “disagreement.” But they may be most likely to succeed when they’re applied to smaller student bodies, like Davidson’s. At lunch in the school’s campus commons, I watched President Douglas Hicks greet a dozen students by name. My tour guide explained that students and faculty tend to mingle there; in fact, they can’t avoid it, because everyone eats in the same place. Some might find this stifling or claustrophobic, but being forced to live together day by day may also stimulate openness and mutual respect. “You can’t hide,” Hicks told me.

At a small liberal-arts college, where a cohort may number fewer than 500 people, admissions officers can also take a stronger hand in assembling a group of students who match the institution’s culture and its vibe while also having very different backgrounds. And the fact that almost everyone at a small liberal-arts college tends to live on campus, or very close to it, adds to the sense of intimacy. “It’s just much easier for me to get to know faculty here, much easier for me to get to know students, much easier for me to hear what’s on their minds,” Amherst’s president, Michael Elliott, told me.

One effect of this, he said, is that professors actually show up to faculty meetings to talk about the future of their institution. They participate in budgeting conversations, debate the creation of majors, and approve new courses. This is decidedly not the norm at many larger universities, where professors may not see these meetings as a core part of the job, and where administrators can ignore them altogether. (Last year, Northwestern reached a settlement with the Trump administration despite 98 percent of its voting faculty having recommended otherwise.) Elliott admits that all of this faculty participation can make the college move more slowly in decision making. But done right, faculty governance is a form of healthy campus discourse, too.

Perhaps no threat to higher ed is more acute than the recent, rapid spread of generative AI. “It’s just about crushed me,” one college teacher told me in the spring of 2023. “I fell in love with teaching, and I have loved my time in the classroom, but with ChatGPT, everything feels pointless.”

The remarkable test-taking, paper-writing power of AI is hardly under control at liberal-arts colleges such as Amherst or Davidson. But in my conversations with students and faculty, I witnessed a struggle to understand and respond to it with greater earnestness and complexity than I have encountered elsewhere in higher education. In my experience, students and faculty at research universities tend to have a Manichaean view of the technology: Either AI is an existential threat to be cast out, or a vital tool to be embraced as a professional virtue. Little room is left for nuance, which means that little progress can be made on shaping policy.

Davidson prides itself on having an unusually deliberate honor code. (Students I spoke with said this code is taken so seriously that they can leave their belongings anywhere on campus without fear that they will be stolen.) But the seductions of ChatGPT are hard to resist, and Marsicano noted that the college has seen an increase in code violations due to AI. That sounded like less of a problem here than elsewhere, though. If the students are availing themselves of the technology, then at least they appear to be doing so with some reservations.

Hines told me that he uses AI tools, though not for academic work. Worley said she’s avoided AI so far, because “I’m still struggling with what makes me comfortable about it and what doesn’t.” At Davidson, each professor can set their own approach to AI in the classroom, but that can be confusing. In the meantime, Worley and her roommates ponder what the rules should be. They ask, for instance: If it’s now okay to have AI write your emails for you, why is that okay? And they talk about AI data centers’ environmental costs. “Everyone’s wrestling with it,” she said.

Learning how to wrestle with an issue like AI, which is ambiguous and undecided, is the whole point of an education undertaken in the liberal tradition. It’s also made easier in a context where faculty-to-student ratios can be much smaller than they are at even elite research universities. (At a school like Davidson or Amherst, some classrooms will contain just a handful of students and a professor—a scenario in which siphoning work through Claude would not be easy.) Carina Cole, a Vassar media-studies student, told me that a supportive culture on campus also makes it possible to treat AI with greater care. Her fellow students are more likely to ask one another for help than turn to technology, she said. But Worley admitted that the situation feels fragile no matter what: “I’m holding on for dear life.”

At Amherst, I sat down with Matthew McGann, the dean of admission and financial aid. I asked how his school stacked up against the nation’s most prestigious universities. If a student also gains admission to Yale, do they go there instead? “They do,” he said. Amherst has a sterling reputation, but it still cannot compete against a famous Ivy.

The relative obscurity of even the best small liberal-arts colleges may be helping them to avoid the Trump administration’s war on higher ed. But that doesn’t mean that they’re immune from any risk of being targeted. Haverford College, in Pennsylvania, for example, has been made the subject of a civil-rights investigation for allegedly failing to address anti-Semitic harassment against Jewish students. (This is the same charge, and the same government action, that has been directed or threatened against Columbia, UCLA, Stanford, Cornell, Rutgers, and many other big universities.) Haverford may not rely on the federal government for giant research grants, but even just defending itself against investigation would be costly, as would, say, losing federal Pell Grants that subsidize low-income students.

Small colleges’ endowments could also be attacked, even if the schools are never targeted specifically. In 2025, Congress voted to increase the tax on endowment income, which private colleges and universities draw on for financial aid, from 1.4 percent to as much as 8 percent. (The wealthiest liberal-arts colleges spend a large portion of their endowment earnings to fund students who can’t afford to spend up to $100,000 a year to attend.) For the moment, institutions with fewer than 3,000 tuition-paying students—which means most liberal-arts colleges—are exempted from this increase, so their budgets remain untouched. But that could change.

Then there is the nagging question of practicality. Even if you believe that a liberal-arts college offers the best education, going to school to learn how to think might seem like a luxury today. In the end, you’ll still need to earn some kind of living. If the paths for getting there—which may include postgraduate study in a doctoral program or professional school—are diminishing, then college itself will follow suit.

Still, after spending several weeks on my tour of wealthy, liberal-arts colleges, I grew to think that the pitch they’re making to prospective students and their parents for the fall of 2026 was convincing. All things considered, when the time comes, I might rather see my own preteen daughter attend a school like Amherst or Davidson, Smith or Vassar, than a research university such as my own. The form of higher ed that they provide seems poised to be the most resilient in the years to come.

In a way, that resilience may pass on to the students who attend them. On my last night in western Massachusetts, I was set up to have dinner with a group of graduating Amherst seniors. By all measures, these were tremendously successful young adults. Hedley Lawrence-Apfelbaum is bound for a fellowship at the University of Oxford on his way to Harvard Law. Ayres Warren, who has already published a journal article on breast-cancer disparities, will pursue a career in environmental health-care management. Shane Dillon is plotting out a career in politics. All three of them told me they were worried about their futures—not because they had attended Amherst instead of Yale or Emory or Michigan State, but because the world seems so uncertain on the whole.

These seniors weren’t panicking, though—this was very clear. “We’ll see,” Dillon said when I asked what was next, what he feared, and what he hoped for. I’ve known a lot of brilliant undergraduates during the course of my career at research universities. Some have become wealthy in business; others have become famous; still more have made the world better through research and invention. But Dillon and the other students whom I met during my college tour struck me as being unusually attuned to the facts of their predicament. They were already living in the thickness of their own lives, aware of who they are and not just what they might become. They seemed to understand, by virtue of the education they’d received, that uncertainty is to be expected, and that the future lasts a long time.</div>

            <h2>America Can Have the Oil</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">María-Elena Pombo has created “petroleum weavings,” turning threads made from oil into elaborate yarnlike wall hangings. Oil, she told us, has shaped her life. Her father, an oil engineer, met her mother after he moved to Cabimas, an oil town. Because of Venezuela’s oil wealth, Pombo, now 37 years old, studied for free at an excellent public university in Caracas.

For decades, all Venezuelans enjoyed the perks of living in a land where oil was a birthright. They could fill their cars for almost nothing. Education and other public services were heavily subsidized as well. Academics might argue over the wisdom of the state’s largesse. But people expected, at the very least, affordable gas as a material benefit from the nation’s abundance of oil.

President Trump’s military intervention in Venezuela this month was, in part, a bid to seize the source of this wealth. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world. Trump made no secret of his desire to exploit them in what many have criticized as an act of naked imperialism and the theft of Venezuela’s economic patrimony: “We’re going to be using oil, and we’re going to be taking oil,” Trump said in an interview after the January 3 attack that captured the strongman President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.

Yet many Venezuelans in the country and abroad celebrated the strike. María Corina Machado, the popular leader of the opposition, has welcomed Trump’s actions. Last February, Machado was a guest on Donald Trump Jr.’s podcast. When he asked why Americans should care about Venezuela, her first response was: “Oil and gas.” Machado’s strategy could appear to have been a devil’s bargain—tempting Trump with the prospect of petrodollars in exchange for ousting Maduro, her nemesis. But her feelings reflected something broader, too: Venezuelans who once viewed oil as a source of wealth and pride, a limitless resource that had shaped their identity and set their country apart from its poorer neighbors, have come to view it more as a curse.

Read: The Venezuelan opposition’s desperate gamble

Venezuelans in the past two decades have watched as the regime squandered the wealth that oil had created, let the country’s oil infrastructure rot, removed gasoline subsidies, and welcomed a bigger hand from Cuba, bartering oil for professionals and intelligence operatives from Havana. Pombo says her generation is the last that benefited from oil. Today, the university where she studied is in such a sorry state that the roof of one of its buildings collapsed. In the former boomtown of Cabimas, in northwestern Venezuela, people grew so desperate that they jury-rigged refineries in their own backyards because gasoline had become so scarce and expensive.

By that measure, ceding the oil industry to the United States at least holds the promise of importing industrial know-how with some financial benefit for the country. A poll by The Economist found that a majority of Venezuelans “somewhat” or “strongly” supported the capture of Maduro and were optimistic about their economic prospects. Fewer than 35 percent thought that the Venezuelan government should continue running Venezuela’s oil industry. Or as Sary Levy-Carciente, Machado’s economic adviser, put it to us, the Americans will be “better clients.”

At a ranch in Cabimas one day in 1922, local farmers were awoken by a bang followed by a black rain. Workers for Shell, an Anglo-Dutch company, had been poking holes in the ground, looking for oil—and struck it rich. A plume spouted for many days. Some viewed the discovery as a divine gift, while a local priest chastised the explorers for unearthing Satan, saying the blowout was God’s punishment. Word traveled northward, and the Rockefellers of Standard Oil and the Mellons of Gulf Oil saw a business opportunity. The episode ushered in more than a half century of relative prosperity.

Even then, some saw signs of trouble. In the 1930s, Arturo Úslar Pietri, an influential intellectual and historian, argued in an essay that the country needed to “sow the oil” by investing oil profits to cultivate other industries. Generation after generation of schoolchildren have heard these words repeated as advice that the country should have followed but didn’t. Instead of sowing the oil, Venezuela became dependent on it.

American companies arrived to drill the wells and build the fields. They brought with them country clubs and baseball. The companies made deals with whichever military despot was in power in Caracas, angering young intellectuals such as Rómulo Betancourt, who harbored dreams of a democratic Venezuela. In his writings, he condemned “the aggressive, juvenile impetus of North American capitalism” and advocated for Venezuelans to be the owners of their oil.

Betancourt became president through a coup in 1945, putting him in position to fulfill his goal of a democratic constitution. But he exercised caution over oil. He didn’t kick out the Americans but instead persuaded them to pay more. He then used those proceeds to build schools, hospitals, and roads. Starting in 1948, American companies extracted the oil and gave roughly half of the profits to the Venezuelan state, an arrangement known as el fifty-fifty.

Betancourt’s stance that Venezuela resented America but needed America is reflected in Miguel Otero Silva’s 1961 novel, Oficina No. 1. The story follows pious, rural Venezuelans who leave everything behind to move to a nameless town where newly arrived Americans are extracting oil with little foresight or planning. The Trinidadian driver who takes the Venezuelans to the fields sings a song in English, as if warning about the type of people the Americans are: “After Johnny eats my food, / After Johnny drinks my rhum, / After Johnny wears my clothes, / Johnny comes back and takes my wife.” But the Venezuelans pay him no mind. They moved to a town with no name because that was their best hope.

Yet many Venezuelans idealize this period. The years of el fifty-fifty were some of the most prosperous in Venezuelan history—a time when migrants were eager to come to Venezuela, rather than leave it, as they have in droves more recently. Hundreds of thousands from Europe and elsewhere arrived for the glorious tropical climate, golden Caribbean beaches, and plentiful job opportunities. The possibilities felt limitless. The country built some of the world’s most futuristic highways and was early in eradicating malaria. When Christian Dior decided to open his first shop in Latin America, he opened it in Caracas. The Concorde, that majestic superfast airplane, flew in at least once a week. Oil was the draw that brought the world to Venezuela. Even Venezuela’s shanties were made with solid construction materials such as brick and concrete, made cheap by a strong bolivar, Venezuela’s currency. It was not uncommon to see new cars parked outside. And although the Venezuelan poor could not afford the shopping trips that the country’s rich made to Miami, they could go to Margarita—a Venezuelan island famous for its beaches and low tax rates.

By 1976, however, Venezuela’s political class had tired of el fifty-fifty. The government seized the assets of American companies and nationalized the oil industry, creating a state-owned giant Petróleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA.

For years, the company thrived. José Guerra, a Venezuelan economist, told us that graduates aspired to land PDVSA jobs. (He didn’t make the cut as a young man, and had to settle for a job at the central bank.) The government funded scholarships so that the best and brightest could study abroad and become PDVSA engineers and managers. For Luis Soler, who worked at PDVSA for 30 years, the company represented a certain idea of meritocracy. It had an American-style work environment complete with 9-to-5 workdays and a corporate ladder for promotion. “We had discipline, values,” he said.

By the 1990s, PDVSA had become one of the largest and most influential state-owned oil companies in the world, second only to Aramco, its Saudi counterpart. Venezuelan leaders proved to themselves that they could competently manage the country’s oil.

Yet as Pietri had predicted more than a half century before, the country had failed to spread the wealth sufficiently to bolster other industries. “We just traded it! We traded it, and for what? Cars from the United States, whiskey from Scotland, fabrics from Italy, perfumes from France,” Rafael Quiroz, an oil economist at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas, told us. “And as time passed, we didn’t build anything. We didn’t use the oil to make an economy.”

Those outside the circle of PDVSA profits grew resentful. Seeds had been sown, but not for broad economic growth, as Pietri had once hoped, but for revolution.

The socialist Hugo Chávez came to power in 1999 and managed PDVSA for priorities other than maximum profits. He replaced thousands of highly trained company employees with party loyalists. And for the first decade of the 21st century, the state used oil as a tool of diplomacy, with Chávez lavishing petrodollars on tiny island nations whose votes he courted in the Organization of American States, a regional diplomatic forum. Venezuela replaced Russia as Cuba’s main oil supplier, a favor that Cuban President Fidel Castro returned by becoming Chávez’s mentor on authoritarianism. The consequences of the mismanagement were profound. A country that fully depended on oil became ill-equipped to produce it. After the oil boom, Venezuela somehow ended up poorer, beset by corruption and hyperinflation.

When Chávez died, in 2013, Maduro inherited a failing oil industry and did little to improve it. By 2020, Venezuela’s refineries had crumbled to the point that the country had to start importing gasoline from Iran. Even during the worst years of a humanitarian crisis, Maduro continued supplying his friends in the Cuban government with oil. (In January, the U.S. assault to capture Maduro killed 32 Cuban officers on the president’s security detail.) Venezuela now produces only about 1 percent of the oil in the world, a mere 1 million barrels a day.

Read: The global oil market is based on a fiction

The perception that Maduro gave away oil to keep himself in power has made some Venezuelans more comfortable with the idea of giving oil to America, the country that got rid of the strongman. “Venezuela is going from having a government controlled by Cuba to having a government controlled by the United States,” the historian Pedro Benítez told us, adding that the U.S. can help with the huge investments needed to revive the oil industry.

The rise of Machado is its own testament to changing attitudes about oil. Of all the opposition leaders, Machado has spoken most consistently in favor of privatization and foreign investment. For a long time, these preferences made her relatively unpopular. But in recent years, her views have spread widely. Many Venezuelans would have liked to see Machado replace Maduro as part of a transition back to democratic government. But so far, the Trump administration has shown little interest in that, preferring instead to work with Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro’s vice president, and the rest of the regime. Like Betancourt, she portrays the United States as an unwelcome imperial power: “Enough of Washington’s orders to Venezuelan politicians,” she said on Sunday. But when it comes to oil, she’s ready to deal. In a speech before legislators this month, she said that she would proceed with an “agenda of cooperation” nonetheless. “Let’s not be afraid of contradictions,” she said.

American companies are poised to develop Venezuela’s oil industry anew. Trump said this month that Venezuela would provide 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., and that the sale of this oil would “benefit the people” of both nations. Rodríguez said that Venezuela had received $300 million from the sale, the first payments from those barrels. She celebrated the country’s much-needed share of the revenue.

Trump sees a fresh era of American investment from the oil giants of today. He recently hosted the chief executives from the major U.S. oil firms at the White House to pitch them on the prospect. But the challenges are legion, including the need for political stability in both Venezuela and the U.S. There are no guarantees that a new American administration would take the same tack as Trump. And although working with the regime has brought its country near-term calm—Venezuela is secured right now by pro-government militias—the Trump administration has spoken about an eventual political transition. This leaves Caracas in a governing limbo and U.S. companies wary. Only a stable government can provide sufficient security for the companies to commit to long-term investments.

Over time, the key power brokers in Venezuela may splinter over their new fifty-fifty-style deal with the U.S. “The current arrangement is unlikely to be convenient at the same time for all of them. One of them or some of them will try to change it,” Jana Nelson, a top Pentagon official on Western Hemisphere affairs during the Biden administration, told us.

Even so, many in Venezuela seem guardedly optimistic. Guerra, the former central-bank official, used to be critical of the opposition for courting a U.S. intervention, but he’s now bullish about the economy. He envisions the U.S. government placing conditions on how the regime can spend future oil revenues to make sure the nation’s natural wealth is used to revive Venezuela.

We pointed out that this scenario rests on the assumption that Trump cares about the fate of Venezuela and its people. “Well, we cannot assume anything else,” Guerra told us. The Venezuelan people, he added, are “just onlookers, not actors. We are just looking at what’s happening, hoping for the best. We don’t get to determine anything.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One popular strain of urban-policy thinking opposes gentrification—the arrival of affluent people into poor neighborhoods—and argues that poverty should be rectified by ever greater expenditure on public housing. The opposite might be true: Government spending can help, but it can also hurt, as badly designed public-housing projects have done. So long as gentrification brings rich and poor together, and offers the latter greater opportunity to take part in a healthy economy, it looks less like a villainous process and more like a heroic one.

Few places illustrate the aspirations and failures of American housing policy as well as the Techwood Homes in downtown Atlanta—one of the first federal housing projects. Its completion, in 1935, even drew the attendance of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who switched on its electricity. To make way for the development, the old slums—in which roughly a quarter of residents were Black—had been cleared away. But the 604 new units were for white tenants only until 1968, when civil-rights laws forced integration. Like the ramshackle shacks it replaced, Techwood fell into disrepair. By the 1990s, Techwood had resegregated, becoming almost exclusively Black, and turned into a byword in Atlanta for urban decline. Gates and windows lay shattered; residents complained of squalid living conditions; drug trafficking and gang violence were out of control.

Judd Kessler: The hidden cost of ‘affordable housing’

In 1993, Atlanta received one of the first grants awarded by the federal HOPE VI program—which aimed to knock down the most decrepit public-housing projects in America and replace them with better housing—to demolish and rebuild the Techwood Homes. The demolitions took place just before the city hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics. If you went to Techwood’s site today—sandwiched between Georgia Tech and the Coca-Cola museum—you would see a commemorative plaque but almost none of the original brick buildings that fell into dilapidation. Instead, you would find yourself in Centennial Place, a mixed-income community with subsidized apartments alongside private, market-rate housing. It was intentionally designed to reduce the isolation of the urban poor—and it’s succeeding.

A new, rigorous study of 200 HOPE VI sites, including Techwood, shows that the redevelopment significantly improved the lives of children. The reasons reveal a crucial fact about economic opportunity: To have social mobility, you need social integration. “Just giving people cash, just giving people education, doesn’t do as much as if you pair it with connections that then help them,” Raj Chetty, a Harvard economist and one of the study’s authors, told me.

From 1993 to 2010, HOPE VI spent $17 billion to knock down and remake projects. The program was controversial from the outset. The original residents did not have a right to return to the townhomes and other smaller structures that replaced the demolished larger complexes, and ultimately only 28 percent of residents came back. There were fewer units in the lower-density replacements. An influential 2002 report by the National Housing Law Project and other groups titled “False HOPE” argued that the new mixed-income model was “a social engineering scheme built on a number of inaccurate, irrelevant, and harmful assumptions about low income families and their neighborhoods.” These critiques were made during a time of growing revulsion against slum clearance and heavy-handed urban-renewal attempts; the reentry of the creative classes to city centers was only beginning to gain notice. Activists and some academic critics derided HOPE VI as a state-sponsored gentrification program, doomed to harm the people it was intended to help.

But the new study, “Creating High-Opportunity Neighborhoods: Evidence from the HOPE VI Program,” found nothing of the sort. Chetty and six colleagues at Harvard, Cornell University, and the Census Bureau used tax-return data to track outcomes for residents decades after they lived in neighborhoods changed by the HOPE VI experiment. The benefits to children living in the new low-density housing project are considerable: Their earnings in adulthood increased by 2.8 percent for every year they lived in the new developments instead of the old ones, the researchers calculated. This holds even when the researchers compare siblings within the same family. Overall, children whose families moved into revitalized units earn 16 percent more than they otherwise would have earned, they are 17 percent more likely to attend college, and boys are 20 percent less likely to go to jail in adulthood. The future-income increases alone greatly exceed the up-front cost of rebuilding, the authors argue.

The paper contends that the HOPE VI program delivered such significant benefits to children because the demolitions and reconstructions “increased friendships between children from low- and high-income families in high schools near public housing sites.” (In this case, cross-class friendship is measured empirically through proprietary data from Facebook.) “Distressed public housing projects were essentially islands that had limited social interaction with nearby communities,” the paper argues. “The HOPE VI program built a bridge to surrounding communities, allowing public housing residents to benefit from interacting with those residents.” The exact reason is still being worked out: It could be straightforward—that high-achieving peers boost education for others—or more subtle (for example, that closer contact with surrounding areas yields more introductions to parents who can provide job referrals). But integration does seem to matter a great deal. The researchers’ results show that simply living in the newly constructed projects was insufficient. Children who moved into these revitalized neighborhoods but experienced no increase in cross-class friendships saw essentially no benefit.

The study does not focus on children displaced by the demolitions. But Matthew Staiger, one of the paper’s co-authors, has separate research showing that they too went on to have markedly higher earnings. For adults, however, the findings are more mixed. Although neighborhoods became considerably richer after the HOPE VI revitalizations—household incomes increased by 45 percent, and poverty rates dropped by 12 percentage points—this is due entirely to richer adults moving in. The residents of the original projects, most of whom are scattered to other neighborhoods, are no better off in terms of income even years later. One recurring finding in social-mobility research is that interventions targeted to poor children yield significant results; for adults who are already in poverty, improvement is harder to attain even with expensive interventions.

Our understanding of what kinds of Americans experience upward mobility—and which ones don’t—has improved immensely over the past 10 years. Much of that progress is due to the work of Chetty, whose use of administrative data collected by government agencies has provided granular answers to questions sociologists and economists have debated for decades. These papers, often co-written with prominent economists such as Nathaniel Hendren, John Friedman, and Lawrence Katz, point toward a cohesive set of findings: Whatever their parents’ circumstances, the kind of neighborhood children grow up in substantially affects their life outcome, for better or for worse. Economists are used to explaining life outcomes as a result of financial or human capital, but Chetty says the cumulative research shows that social capital is just as important.

This lesson is especially stark when applied to childhood poverty. It is unsurprising that poor material circumstances at birth predict poverty in adulthood. Less obvious is the fact that poor children living in concentrated poverty—like those in infamous superblock towers—face worse outcomes than poor children who live near wealthier peers. We know this from studies following the life trajectory of children living in poor, segregated neighborhoods after they were moved by government programs—as in the Gautreaux Assisted Housing Program from the 1970s to the 1990s and the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment in the 1990s. The MTO results, written by Chetty, Hendren, and Katz and published in 2016, stunned the economics field after finding that young children whose families left high-poverty census tracts after receiving housing vouchers went on to have 31 percent higher incomes in adulthood (alongside improvements in college attendance and reduced rates of single parenthood). The HOPE VI results show the converse of the MTO experiment to be true too: Kids don’t necessarily have to change locations to improve their life outcome—neighborhoods can be made to improve around them.

These results in economics ultimately vindicate foundational ideas in sociology—developed by scholars such as William Julius Wilson and Robert Sampson—that the concentration of disadvantage and social isolation worsen the effects of material disadvantage. The findings also raise an immediate question: If the primary reason that HOPE VI improved outcomes was that it boosted social capital for disadvantaged children, how can that positive intervention be replicated elsewhere? Laura Tach, a Cornell sociologist and co-author of the paper, told me that the HOPE VI program could have boosted social integration through several mechanisms: The demolition of towers (which in many cases were packed together in huge superblocks) made the outside world physically easier to access, reductions in violence and crime made outside connection psychologically easier, and complimentary community-support services for job training and after-school programs may have directly brought people of different social backgrounds together.

Jerusalem Demsas: The real villain in the gentrification story

There is another process that improves neighborhoods around poor children, both by bringing higher-income peers nearer to them and by reducing the violence they are exposed to. This process often occurs without explicit governmental intervention or cost. The problem is that it is regularly dismissed as gentrification, a phenomenon that is not usually cheered. The most common objection to gentrification is that it results in displacement of incumbent residents. The empirical evidence for this is weaker than conventionally assumed. One paper examining children who received Medicaid benefits in New York City from 2009 to 2015 found no elevated rates of moving for those in gentrifying neighborhoods. The HOPE VI study suggests that gentrification should improve outcomes for kids, so long as it actually improves social integration.

This is not guaranteed, certainly, but is perhaps more likely to happen than further governmental action. HOPE VI remade some of America’s worst public-housing projects for the better. But it also cost the government $170,000 per unit (in 2022 dollars). The Trump administration has called for a 43 percent reduction in public-housing spending. It is especially hostile to the idea of using federal funds as an explicit tool to break up concentrations of poverty. The lessons of HOPE VI provide a tantalizing clue about how social mobility can be engineered in America by building bridges between rich and poor. How unfortunate it is that the current administration is unlikely to even try.</div>

            <h2>Whatever This Is, It Is Not Strategy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/unserious-national-defense-strategy/685784/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“At least,” a friend sighed, “they didn’t call it the 2026 National War Strategy.” True enough, although if Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth claims that he now leads the Department of War, logical consistency would suggest substituting the fiercer war for the feebler defense in the National Defense Strategy.

But logistical consistency, like coherence and gravitas, does not characterize the new NDS. It is a document that supposedly nests within the National Security Strategy, explaining at greater length the implications of overall policy for the armed forces. The 2026 version does not do that. Rather, it restates some of the basic priorities of the Trump administration but for the most part confines itself to flattery of the president, insults, and bombast.

Thomas Wright: A strategy that ignores the real threats

In theory, the NDS should be a serious state paper. It should not, as this document does, refer to the president 47 times, and include five pictures of him, one suggestively placed immediately after a reproduction of Emanuel Leutze’s Washington Crossing the Delaware. Nor should it make the absurd claim that Donald Trump has “rebuilt the American military to be the world’s absolute best” and then insist, with modest adulation, that “it is essential to emphasize how much of an achievement this has been.”

But then again, the kind of authors who insist that “President Trump is leading our nation into a new golden age” are strangers to the pejorative connotation of the word sycophant. The Pentagon’s writers have not yet reached for the honorifics accorded the late North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il, but they might yet do so. After all, if the much shorter though equally well-fed Korean could be known as “Dear Leader,” “Ever-Victorious, Iron-Willed Commander,” and “Guiding Star of the 21st Century,” why should the unique 45th and 47th president not get similar accolades?

Distasteful as the genuflections are, the gratuitous insults to all previous administrations are worse. There are the usual tirades about “grandiose nation-building projects and self-congratulatory pledges to uphold cloud-castle abstractions like the rules-based international order.” There is the customary bellyaching about betrayals of the warrior ethos. There is the standard (and particularly ludicrous) complaint that “America’s foreign policy establishment neglected our nation’s Homeland defenses.” One of the more tiresome qualities of this Department of Defense is the insecurity that causes it to denigrate everything that passed before. This happens often enough when one administration succeeds another, to be sure, with the new team insisting that its predecessors were idiots, but the Hegseth Pentagon carries such insults to a new level.

And then there is the chest-thumping. If Trump said that the Iranian nuclear program was obliterated, then the NDS will use that word. It is not enough to express the very creditable truth that the Iranian bomb program took a body blow from which it may take years to recover. Trump policy is not merely successful; it has taken “our nation from the precipice of a world war just a year ago.” And let enemies of the United States beware: As a Pentagon bureaucrat attempting Mafia dialect puts it, “We at the Department of War will be ready if our gracious offer is spurned.”

What about the substance, then? We have 19 pages of text plus the five blank or picture pages. Ignore the sycophancy, slurs, and slop, and there is very little—but still enough to make one wonder. As in the NSS, the administration makes its priorities or, as it terms them, “lines of effort” clear: (1) “Defend the U.S. Homeland”; (2) “Deter China in the Indo-Pacific through strength, not confrontation”; (3) “Increase burden-sharing with U.S. allies and partners”; and (4) “Supercharge the U.S. defense industrial base.”

The first line of effort contains admiring reflections on the Monroe Doctrine and its Roosevelt Corollary without being burdened by an understanding of the historical context of either. It is expansive in its definition of the homeland, referencing Greenland with a predatory leer, although—perhaps in a gesture of reconciliation—it talks about Canada as though it has the right to be an independent country. The NDS, like the NSS, is hemisphere-ist, believing that the United States should dominate pretty much everything from Honolulu to Nuuk, as well as the heavens above.

The China portion of the strategy is remarkable for its modesty, insisting that the United States is focused on “supporting strategic stability and on deconfliction and de-escalation more broadly.” One is surprised to hear this kind of globalist soft soap from a Pentagon whose civilian leaders walk with a warrior’s strut, but there it is. If anything, as it talks about Beijing and its ambitions, the tone is downright meek.

On burden-sharing—read, bashing America’s European allies—it is considerably more robust. The good news is that the NDS does not talk about leaving NATO, but in one simple graphic, it insists that the Europeans are so rich that they do not need us to confront Russia. As for the defense industrial base, there are three paragraphs that call for “nothing short of a mobilization” but say nothing about what that means in practice or what it will cost.

A real national defense strategy would look very different.

It would, for example, give some rough notice of the budgetary choices ahead and the bill to be paid. Golden Dome, a revitalized and expanded Navy, a renovated nuclear arsenal, a much larger defense industrial base—achieving any of these goals, much less all of them, would take serious dollars. The numbers are conspicuous by their absence.

A national defense strategy worthy of the name would discuss the Chinese military buildup, including the rapid growth of its nuclear arsenal, its spectacular naval expansion, its burgeoning space-warfare capabilities, and its hybrid warfare against Taiwan and other U.S. partners. It would refer to China as a global challenge rather than one geographically confined to the Indo-Pacific. It would consider China’s political warfare aimed at the United States and some of its allies.

Eliot A. Cohen: Trump’s security strategy is incoherent babble

A serious document would mention the Islamist threat in more than a passing paragraph on Africa. Day in, day out, American planes, drones, and commando teams go out and hunt terrorists across several continents. Has that threat diminished? Is it contained? Are more strikes necessary? It might also say something about the military lessons of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, which are numerous, complex, and relevant to the United States.

Discussion of European security might consist of something more than a ritual sticking-out-of-the-tongue at NATO partners; it might offer thoughtful consideration of how to maintain European security while shifting American resources elsewhere. And it would not dismiss the Ukraine war as solely a European problem.

The 2026 National Defense Strategy appears to have been drafted not by serious people but by Pentagon officials eager to curry favor with an imperious president and terrified of getting their talking points wrong. The obsequiousness, the sneers, the boasting, the vacant generalities, and the hand-waving bespeak fear of departing from the Trumpian orthodoxy of the moment. In a dangerous world, made more dangerous by foolish speeches and a wildly erratic foreign policy, it displays a disturbing lack of seriousness. The armed forces of the United States deserve far better than this.</div>

The last mile of a trip seems like the worst place to employ driverless vehicles. You have the most variety of roadways, delivery docks, other staff, so many ways to go bad. Why not focus on interstate driving and take on the long boring stretches that require trucks large enough to sleep in?

Stores frequently unload the trucks themselves anyway. The driver usually just drives.

Because it has the least amount of competition currently. They stand to gain a lot. Next step is to use a drone or bot to drop off packages at the front door. It&#39;s a brilliant play as Amazon, UPS, FedEx etc. all want this ability.

Shipping lane management is already highly data driven and pretty well optimizes.  Sure you might save some money replacing long haul drivers, and independent owners, with drone trucks, it is not insignificant, but it also isn&#39;t probably the big part of the pie.

I don&#39;t know about Walmat, given the volume of stuff they have to move to keep stores stocked, and sell in store; but I would be shocked if Amazon spends more money moving merch between distribution hubs than on

More than half of last mile delivery is unloading. Do they think a store owner is going to unload all their bulk groceries, or grandma is going to unload that new washing machine?

I hope Bubba takes their lunch money for ransom and give them lots of slippery soap

It would be comedy gold to watch an FBI goon posing as Dr. Evil on video doing a stone-cold revenge plan with pinky solidly buried in the crook of his mouth spouting ”One treeeellion dollars” in response to hackers wanting their domain back.

That comedy would quickly turn into a fucking documentary when the hackers respond with “No problem.  You want that in dollars, euros, or bitcoin..”

Taking the guy&#39;s name is a new level of mean with a gazillion names out there, Dolittle, Mixalot, etc. they had to choose that one. &quot;You think you&#39;re better than us?&quot;

I presume that&#39;s Duncan M. Hamilton? I don&#39;t read read much fantasy. Surprised he doesn&#39;t seem to merit a wikipedia page.

I&#39;m also surprised the musical group Iron Tom doesn&#39;t have one as well.

You know what they say about &quot;in matters of taste..&quot;

Sanderson is huge. People know about him and buy his books in droves. I can&#39;t even figure out which Hamilton you are referring to.

I get a few search results for that name and fantasy, but no one that seems to stand out. The top search result I got was a fantasy football news site. Compare that to a search for Sanderson and fantasy, where every hit on the first page was the Sanderson in question. If I add the word author, the top result is an urban fantasy vampire romance author, which I&#39;m guessing isn&#39;t who you&#39;re thinking of, and is a genre the TV studios seems to not be into these days. A bit further down is a Duncan M. Hamilton, who looks like a more likely fit, but he doesn&#39;t seem to be talked about much. I searched for his name and there was basically no chatter about him. No thread on preferred reading order or anything else that usually pops up. Again, compare that to Sanderson&#39;s presence on social media. People talk about his stuff pretty much everywhere.

If you were a TV exec and was looking for something to adapt, which of those two options to you figure you&#39;d pick? The one people not even into the genre has often heard the name of, or the one even someone interested in the genre can&#39;t quite identify when trying? Hamilton might be the greatest fantasy author of this generation, but name recognition is a pretty big deal in these decisions. Currently, it seems like a stretch to imagine a TV exec would even know Hamilton exists, whereas Sanderson is extremely well known and has been actively working his way into that side of the industry for many years now.

You might well be right and we&#39;re all missing out, but from a TV exec&#39;s perspective, Sanderson is obviously the right choice at the moment.

Sanderson is huge. People know about him and buy his books in droves. I can&#39;t even figure out which Hamilton you are referring to.

I liked his finish to Robert Jordan&#39;s Wheel of Time series and really loved his Mistborn series.

The first few Stormlight Archive novels were pretty good too.

What really started turning me off to Sanderson was his clear drive toward unification and back-filling as though this was the plan all along. It just seems so comic book level. Which, is exactly why he did it, of course. It&#39;s just not for me.

That said, I am sure that I will enjoy the content that comes out of this.

I wonder if I would have enjoyed WoT more if the whole series had been on Sanderson&#39;s pace or Jordan&#39;s.  Advantage Sanderson since Jordan&#39;s writing was ponderous at best.

FWIW, I re-read WoT recently and found that I liked Jordan&#39;s writing style more than I remember liking it when I first read it at some point in my 20s.

Sanderson will be the architect of the universe; will write, produce and consult; and will have approvals. That&#39;s a level of involvement that not even J.K. Rowling or George R.R. Martin enjoys.Uh, that kind of assumes J.K. Rowling or George R.R. Martin ever wanted that duty. I wish him all the best luck with success here, but this move just might expose the real reasons writers don’t often become screen writers, producers, or directors.  It’s certainly not a mix of hats easily worn by anyone, and hopefully won’t taint a literary style a lot currently favor.  Unlike the writers desk, the movie set will never enjoy the creative solitude of only the creator involved.  You&#39;re suddenly dealing with 99 opinions on how to deliver the story instead of one.

On the other hand you can see what happened when they got the Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck (who write under the name James SA Corey) to supervise the writers room for The Expanse. They ended up with one of the greatest TV Space-Operas of all time. The Expanse was phenomenal.

However the duo already had TV writing experience beforehand so they knew how to adapt. But the end result was a series that was faithful enough to the books but excellent for the screen. There where changes, characters merged, parts mis

It&#39;s a big risk. Look at what happened with Rowling, turned out to be a horrible person and damaged the HP brand.Was/Is she a horrible person, or was/is she merely a writer/creator caught in the misinterpreted crossfire of woke bullshit?Try and remember a sane educated woman wrote that story.  Back when society wasn’t actively debating what a “woman” is.  It’s not easy dealing with delusion.  As a society demanding we bring back the asylums can well attest.

It&#39;s nothing to do with disagreement. She harassed Olympic athletes and funded litigation against the victim of harassment. Actions that harmed other people, not mere disagreements.

You sound like a certain orange man: People you disagree with are horrible persons.OK Nazi.Donald Trump wants people murdered. Trans people just want to exist. Your willingness to draw false equivalence there can only mean you also want people to be murdered.

You sound like a certain orange man: People you disagree with are horrible persons.

Donald Trump wants people murdered. Trans people just want to exist. Your willingness to draw false equivalence there can only mean you also want people to be murdered.

I was confused about what supposedly made Rowling a horrible person. Then I saw the username and it all became clear:  A proper sense of biology and wanting to protect women from predators OBVIOUSLY makes one a bad person in your eyes.

Not surprised. Not even disappointed. I just wonder what went wrong between you and your parents.

Whatever her misinformed opinions on biology, it doesn&#39;t excuse harassing other women or funding litigation against them. I&#39;m just glad her most recent one backfired spectacularly. People will think twice before becoming her pawn now.

and wanting to protect women from predators

You mean like Trump?  The men on the Epstein list which has not been released despite a law ordering it be done?  The men in England and France who drugged their wives for years and let other men rape their wives?  Those predators?

I&#39;ve listened to some of Sanderson&#39;s podcasts and I think he&#39;s been pretty open about how he does not see himself as a screen writer. My impression is that he wants creative control to prevent poor decisions, like e.g. an exec turning allomancy from a system with built-in constraints, to &quot;whatever we think would be a cool thing in this scene.&quot; Or, considering Foundation, using the novels as nothing more than vague inspiration.

Well, having written that I then came across Bradon stating he&#39;ll be writing the screenplay for Mistborn himself. So let&#39;s hope he&#39;s up to the task after all.

He&#39;s stated they did not listen to his input on that show, so unless he&#39;s lying about that it shouldn&#39;t be much of an indicator. Of course, it could also be his input was even worse than the choices they went with. I find that unlikely, but it&#39;s at least a possibility.

Given the quality of writing we&#39;ve recently been getting he can&#39;t be any worse then the randoms they would&#39;ve given it to otherwise. This way we can at least be sure writing quality will be above fifth grader fanfiction level.

Molds require oxygen , no o2 no growing. So where possible they should store the works in nitrogen or some other inert gas as is done with some foodstuffs.

I was just going to mention this. Vacuum seal the art in glass/lexan cases or fill with inert gasses. Would not be hard to have vaults filled with inert gas for long term preservation.

Pure nitrogen is dangerous. Without a way to detect oxygen levels, you can breath it, and you&#39;ll pass-out and die.It&#39;s not super hard to detect oxygen levels. All of our cars do it. If you&#39;re putting paintings into nitrogen gas then presumably they will be in sealed frames and the total volume will be low compared to the rooms they&#39;re stored in. If you&#39;re doing a vault with nitrogen then you&#39;ll be using SCBA when you go into it.

Place spent fuel rods from nuclear reactors in the vaults instead of in cooling ponds.Win-win.

The basic claim is correct.    This article is more in depth and it has a graph with the trends.   BEV and Petrol (aka gas) HAVE met.  at 22.5% of  registration  (though Diesel is still 7%  and is separate.  HEV at 33%  and PHEV at 10.7% rounding out their categories.).    Plain ICE,  gas and diesel are def going down.

But if you count HEV as &quot;gas&quot;  well...  HEV+plain-ICE  is 62% vs  BEV at 22.5% so...

The dialect is called British English because it is spoken all over Britain and has been for centuries. The existence of Welsh, Cornish and two Gaelics does not negate this, as the spread of those languages has never really coincided with the national boundaries, particularly in Scotland.

The bigger question is why English is called English.

>&quot;British English&quot;? Is that some kind of cultural genocide, robbing England of its language?&quot;

English is the lingua franca now.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with saying &quot;British English&quot;, it is done all the time to denote the English as used by Britain vs. other countries, which have some significant variations.  Nobody denies that the central development of English came from England.

>&quot;You know that each country in Britain has their own language, and the one from England is called English.&quot;

I know he was being a dick, but there really are meaningful differences between the autonomy of the four home nations of the UK and American states or Canadian provinces. The UK is an old and messy place, and it has four constituent countries / nations within a single state. For the purposes of relations with other nation-states, there’s primarily just the UK, but for day to day governance, it’s quite different.

Indeed, there are differences.  I am not an expert in the differences, but would guess the autonomy of a USA State is actually much greater than that of a British sub-nation.  Especially true before Britain left the EU (which put yet a further authority above them).  I decided to give AI a try at that and got this:

&quot;A U.S. state generally has more autonomy than a Bri

1. We talk about British English all the time, when talking about English in the UK vs other places2. No-one here, not even the most ardent Scottish, Welsh or Irish nationalist, thinks of their countries as having a single native language. For a start, Scotland has both Scottish Gaelic and Scots, as well as Scottish English. Fewer than 1% of Scots have the Gaelic, and Scots exists on a dialect continuum with English. Basically 100% of people born in all four home countries speak English with native fluency.

Petroleum is crude oil.As far as words go gasoline came first in the 1860s then petrol in the 1890s.People in all countries make up words. Where do you think words come from?

Gasoline is the older word, and FYI, it originated in London.  It was a product of John Cassell called &quot;Cazeline&quot;. A Dublin shopkeeper named Samuel Boyd got into a trademark dispute with Cassel, so changed the spelling to &quot;Gazeline&quot; as a dodge.  The word &quot;Gasoline&quot; appears as a listed product taxed in the US in the 1860s.    By contrast, the word &quot;Petrol&quot; didn&#39;t come into play until the 1890s, as a product created by Carless, Capel & Leonard. They tried to trademark it, but the trademark failed and it b

I don&#39;t think the Europeans want ICE, even if their agents mainly shoot American citizens.

Giving the major automakers a challenge is good.   The 70 year up escalator of car prices via unneeded features and unnecessary extra computer chips needs competition.

We are definitely seeing some responses from the OEMs too. Sometimes both wacky and intriguing, like this:https://www.dacia.co.uk/concep... [dacia.co.uk]

Hybrids without plug-in are kind of annoying. They tend to have very small batteries and charge them from dino juice. People are sold on them as convenient, but they aren&#39;t great for my lungs. Better than a pure fossil, but still not great.

At least with a PHEV some more of those miles will be electric, but we are still a long way from decent air quality around here.

Even worse, there&#39;s the token hybrids, that often get referred to as &quot;Mild Hybrids&quot;.  These have a teeny tiny motor (I&#39;ve seen 3bhp quoted on one, but I think closer to 10bhp is more normal) along with a small 48V battery to go with it, and it tries to help smooth out torque gaps, but doesn&#39;t really do owt for economy.

Non plug in hybrids, like the original Prius, did something to kick start the movement, but they do feel rather outdated now.

They only really make sense for people who can&#39;t get past their range anxiety, or who live in places with really bad charging infrastructure. You have to cart around an ICE, maintain it, fill it with petrol, fix it when one of the many complex parts goes wrong.

But I fully expect them to end up as a niche brand. I do honestly respect a lot of the groundbreaking work that was done by Tesla, effectively proving that EVs could be mainstream. It took a lot of public money to do it, but maybe it was worth it. Now that job is done its up to someone else to make vehicles for everyone and that was never going to Tesla. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll always have something to offer but they&#39;re not the leaders on FSD and they don&#39;t really make the kind of simple EV that most people are looking for at a price that everyone can afford.

I&#39;m still interested to see if Toyota can make a dent in this market. They&#39;ve been holding back because of the battery limitations but that&#39;s allowed Chinese brands to eat up the market. Eventually the market appeal of the Toyota brand is going to wear off, they can&#39;t expect us to wait forever.

I think some of those items you mentioned, eg, heat pumps for EVs, have been part of the core offer right from the outset. My first gen Zoe back in 2015 had a 400V battery, heat pump, pre-heat, and did 20 to 80 in 40mins. It was, admittedly, a puny battery, but still, it was all of what you described.

I still think there’s a lot of room for innovation and quality. In Europe, in particular, I am convinced that there will be a lot of demand for a supermini with a 300+ mile range. We have a lot of supermi

It&#39;s just the current crop of cars, e.g. the 2025 model year. Now you get similar technology that had costed 50,000 EUR or more a few years ago, in 25,000 EUR cars. But if you look into the 50,000 EUR range, it&#39;s different. Take the Xpeng g7+ for example, which offers 20-80% charging in 10 mins at a price point of 53,000 EUR! Or the Mercedes CLA 250+ with a 500 mile range costing 58,000 EUR!

Toyota held back because they put all their chips into hydrogen and failed miserably. Set themselves back a decade.

I think you have to consider the counter-factual: a world without Tesla. I reckon in the end it had only a mildly accelerative effect, if any, because the Chinese were already committed to the transition at the time Tesla started, and they built the stack, top to bottom. They would have been providing the same push to European OEMs that they are providing right now. There was a time when it could have been very different, but that would have required Tesla to go with the Model 2, not waste time on the boond

FTFY. Toyota claimed there were battery limitations even a full decade after EVs were commonly seen on the roads. Their claim of battery limitations is an excuse they used to do nothing, all the while pushing hydrogen which was a disaster. They are so hyper focused on gaslighting countries and claiming that the Hilux and Camry are the only viable car they are very much missing the train when it comes to how the market is moving.

Congrats to them, while they innovated the first hybrid they are now an infamous

It took a lot of public money to do it...This often gets said, but it&#39;s not true.  They got a $465M DOE loan.  But that was a loan, which they paid back.  Federal tax incentives went to anyone buying any EV from any company.

Too often, these articles have conflated fully electric with all-electric. But not this time: 308,955 full BEVs were sold across Europe* in December 2025 vs 250,449 petrol cars. And it’s the rate of change that’s quite startling: EVs up by more than 100k yoy, and petrol down 55k. If (*if*) we saw the same change next years, we’d be at 400k+ BEV sales and under 200k petrol. That would put BEVs about even with hybrids (381k this year, up less than 20k from last year) and far more than PHEVs (123k this year, up a touch over 30k from last year), assuming their growth rates remain more or less the same. By 2028, on the same trajectories, we’d be above 500k BEVs, under 150k petrol, and it would be blindingly obvious that BEVs were the dominant drivetrain.

For those of us who prefer quieter streets and cleaner air, this is a big, big win — especially when coupled with the other modal shift happening — the rise of microtransportation (cycling, e-bikes including e-cargo and e-trikes/quadricycles, e-scooters).

Of course, there’s a very very long journey ahead. The UK has 34m cars on the road, of which about 2m are now EVs. We buy 2m new cars a year, so even if we were at 100% new EV sales, it would take roughly 16 years for the whole fleet to turn over. And obviously, we’re a way off that. But in 20 years, this transition will be more or less done in Europe, and that’s pretty amazing to think about.

Only the rich early adopter types have money to buy a new car in Europe.

How much have car sales gone down overall?

Peak was 2019, 15.9m. 2025 was 13.3m. The US peaked in 2016 at 17.5m, 2025 was 16.2m. I think the data for both places for both are far too messy to support the PP’s contention that Europeans can somehow not afford to buy new cars (by implication compared with Americans).

On one hand, European population densities are higher than ours. But on the other, we are supposed to be the richest nation on earth, and a lot of our lands are very sparsely populated, which is to say, most of them have almost nobody on them. Ignoring those regions completely hardly makes any dent in the population you&#39;re addressing. Therefore the whole idea that the size of the nation is an impediment to getting large numbers of conversions is a nonsense one. The difference is that they got on getting cha

Except people need to drive through those areas with EVs somehow if everyone has an EV.  In Europe they can take a train and rent a vehicle at half the cost as it is here.  And it doesn&#39;t matter how wealthy a nation is if they don&#39;t prioritize infrastructure for EVs then they will be limited in what they can be used for.

How do you stop someone from killing someone else? In most societies, we do so with warnings, promises, and contracts. We make laws to make ourselves feel safe. It’s important to feel safe, because reality is terrifying. In Minneapolis this weekend, we saw reality: a group of men with guns, in a semicircle, firing a barrage of shots into a man’s body lying on the ground. The laws that were supposed to protect Alex Pretti—the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, multiple state and local and national statutes on use of force—failed. Pretti’s death, captured on video from multiple angles, was so shocking that even the Trump administration has been forced to rethink its brutal tactics in the Twin Cities, which for more than a month has been ravaged by an onslaught of federal agents ostensibly conducting “immigration enforcement.”

Now, the Trump administration is shifting its approach, or at least its messaging. Gregory Bovino, the cartoonishly fascist figurehead of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s operations in the Twin Cities, has been removed from his post and forced off social media. Kristi Noem, Bovino’s boss at the Department of Homeland Security, received a brief, but significant, rebuke from the president. The Democrats, America’s sluggish and often ineffectual opposition party, are howling for investigations, firings, and impeachments.

It’s tempting to see these developments as a victory, as the rule of law slowly reasserting itself over a deadly aberration in America’s social contract. Soon, you might think, things may go back to normal. But in Donald Trump’s America, the contract has been rewritten. The conditions that caused Pretti’s death still exist—in Minneapolis, in Maine, in California, in every city and every town where agents of the state carry guns. The goon squads are here to stay, and it’s only a matter of time until they kill again.

What this reflects is more than the Trump administration’s vicious immigration policies, but a broader shift in American politics. Inside the West Wing, a terrifying new political ideology is on display, one that says the right to shape, change, and end Americans lives is not granted by a democratic framework of laws, but by a simple equation of who has more guns.

This shift was not immediate. During the first Trump administration, the snarl of legal jurisprudence that slowed down many of Trump’s most egregious excesses also lured us into a false sense of comfort that the law still worked, and that the contract still held—and sometimes it did. When Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 election, the system worked. Judges threw out his cases. When rioters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, they were prosecuted en masse for their crimes. Trump himself was impeached, though never convicted, thanks to the cowardice of a bloc of Republican senators.

Upon entering his second term, Trump went for it, not so much testing as smashing through the constraints of legal precedent—he pardoned the criminals who stormed the Capitol on his behalf and indicted many of the officials that, in turn, had indicted him. On the border, he saw a chance to test his might: calling in Marines to quell protesters in Los Angeles and increasing the DHS’s purview to arrest, detain, and raid far outside of their preexisting jurisdictions.

The guardrails are not holding this time around.

Minneapolis represents the most stark example of the rule of the gun thus far. During “Operation Metro Storm,” the ominously named federal operation in the Twin Cities, federal agents have shot three people, killed two, and injured dozens with pepper spray, rubber bullets, tear gas, and fists. Until Pretti’s death finally tipped the scales, Noem and other figures in the administration doubled and tripled down on their mandate to use force. Jonathan Ross, the agent who shot Renee Good, the first person killed by ICE in the Twin Cities, currently faces no charges, after the FBI intervened to toss out the state-level investigation into the killing.

Federal agents have repeatedly violated protesters’ First Amendment rights, detained citizens and noncitizens alike unlawfully, and even sought to prevent detainees from accessing legal counsel. The Department of Justice, instead of investigating these abuses, has instead leveled charges on the protesters. There are videos all over social media of officers, after Good’s killing, taunting protesters with threats that they will be next. The men with guns knew the power they held. They knew no one could stop them from killing.

And so when Alex Pretti stood up in the middle of the street, filming them with his phone, and intervened to try to help another civilian they had pushed to the ground, they shot him. He had, after all, committed a crime in their eyes: He had resisted the administration’s will. The agents who killed Pretti have not been identified or charged; like in Good’s killing, there will be no federal civil rights investigation, only an internal process overseen by the department that fired the shots. (Two of the agents involved in shooting Pretti have now been put on leave, but that’s a far cry from meaningful consequences for what they did.) Even if, by some miracle, Good’s and Pretti’s killers are eventually brought to justice, their individual consequences do nothing to subvert ICE’s mandate of force wherever it appears. ICE can afford to discipline or lose an agent or two to mollify public opinion. They have plenty more operating, still, under the same rules of engagement.

Under Trump’s new government-by-gun, individuals are presented with a choice between obedience and execution—or at least the ever-present danger of it. And without legal recompense, the only check to this power appears to be other armed men.

In Maine, where ICE and other agencies have been conducting snatch-and-grab arrests and targeted harassment of protesters similar to those in Minneapolis, local law enforcement has already staked out a hard line against their excesses, something that Minneapolis’ authorities were slow to do. Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce called ICE’s actions “bush-league policing” in an interview on Sunday, after federal agents mistakenly arrested a local corrections officer. This pressure has also changed the situation in Minneapolis, where Gov. Tim Walz has managed to muster a largely tepid show of force from his own military, the Minnesota National Guard, deploying them to the streets in cute reflective vests with donuts and coffee.

It’s easy to see those images and miss what they mean. The National Guard is often seen as a friendly force that shows up with bottled water during hurricanes and digs out roads after mudslides. But that’s not what they are: They are armed forces that are ostensibly under the command of a state governor. Their presence on the streets of Minneapolis, orange vests and all, is a show of force by a state military aligned opposite of a federal military. Right now, it’s no more than optics. But lines are being drawn.

And things could always get worse. The National Guard and domestic police are not sympathetic forces to many of this country’s marginalized groups. In L.A. and D.C., National Guard troops squared up with protesters themselves, and their orders come from political actors—governors, mayors, and other politicians with their own biases and agendas.

Soldiers and police, however, are not the only people in America who have guns. As the top levels of our political system wield violence in the open, it’s only a matter of time before people tired of having guns pointed at them may decide that it’s time to have more guns to point back. Communities I have reported on for years are beginning to mobilize again. Online, left-wing accounts and marginalized groups are openly championing the Second Amendment, abandoning arguments for reasonable gun control in favor of arming themselves to face a future in which their only defense is through open force. There was nothing to stop ICE agents from killing Alex Pretti, their thinking goes, so the next time it happens someone might as well shoot back. A brutal occupation unrestrained by any notion of fairness or recompense often inspires a violent response, which would plunge our society into circumstances it has rarely, if ever, seen before: widespread violence on the streets and guerilla attacks on federal forces that inspire even more brutal reprisals and repression.

It’s still possible to regain control of our society before we get to that point; to organize and protest and document well enough that a better future is made possible before the rule of the gun is all we have left. We’ve seen that approach have some success , in this specific case: The administration’s excesses were so blatant and cruel—and so highly publicized—that politicians on both sides of the aisle were forced to hold them to account. But so far, Trump’s response looks more like damage control than a larger shift in approach. The goon squads are still on the streets, still hauling people into their vans. They will learn from this defeat. They will get better at killing. And unless we find a way to upset the architects of our new political order, they’re almost certainly going to do it again.

The big question about President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace—which he formally announced while at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week—is whether it’s a scam, a delusion, or both.

Trump first mentioned a Board of Peace in September during the signing of a ceasefire accord for Israel’s war in Gaza. The idea was that the board would be the forum where Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other Middle East countries discuss political reforms, reconstruction, and other issues relating to security and long-term peace in Gaza. Trump would chair the board—a role that he improbably insisted wasn’t his idea, but the plan made some sense, given that Trump played a major role in prodding the parties to sign the ceasefire.

However, in the months since, Trump’s vision of the board has—like much else about his presidency—swelled with self-aggrandizement. The board’s charter—which he hasn’t publicized but which the Times of Israel obtained and published—doesn’t mention Gaza at all. Rather, the document states that the board will seek “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”—seeming to indicate any sort of conflict, anywhere on earth.

The members on the board will consist of whichever heads of state the chairman, Donald Trump, chooses to invite. Their terms of membership will last three years, unless they pay the board $1 billion, which would buy them lifetime tenure. (Trump is designated as chairman for as long as he likes, certainly beyond the remaining three years of his presidency, gratis.)

The board will decide policies and declare resolutions by majority vote, but the chairman (read: Trump) gets veto power; he can also initiate measures unilaterally, eject members, and choose his own successor.

In other words, the Board of Peace marks yet another episode in Trump’s massive meandering ego trip. More than that, its charter, laid out in formal legalese, is sheer fantasy. It is no surprise that most of the heads of state whom he invited to join, notably those with proven interest in peace and “lawful governance,” have declined.

The naysayers include France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom—in short, many of our leading allies. Trump retracted his invitation to Canada after its prime minister, Mark Carney, delivered a much-lauded speech at Davos calling on middle-sized countries to avoid unfair pressures from larger powers by banding together. (Trump’s retraction, which he posted on social media, bolsters the impression that this is all about Trump, not world peace.)

Those who have said they will join include Argentina, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Egypt, El Salvador, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kosovo, Morocco, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. None of them are members of the U.N. Security Council (which Trump preposterously hopes to supplant), only a few practice “lawful governance,” and even fewer have any experience at seriously mediating conflict. It is not known whether any of them have been foolish enough to pony up the $1 billion initiation fee—nor has Trump or anyone else said who would control this slush fund. (Want to take a guess?)

The leaders of China, India, and Russia are among those who haven’t yet responded. This is no surprise. These are regional, aspiringly global powers who have a serious (if, in some cases, disruptive) interest in matters of war and peace. And they must know that Trump’s Board of Peace is not serious.

In his gushing invitation letter, Trump declared that his goal is to “bring together a distinguished group of nations ready to shoulder the noble responsibility of building LASTING PEACE.” In his snitty retraction letter to Prime Minister Carney, he brayed that Canada would thereby be excluded from “what will be the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled at any time.”

If Trump believes his own hype (always an uncertainty), he reveals here once again that he has no idea what peace, especially “LASTING PEACE,” requires. To the extent Trump currently has the power to elicit feigned respect and sometimes reluctant obedience from other world leaders, it’s because he is president of the United States—meaning that he can exert the tremendous leverage of the world’s main currency and most powerful military.

Once his term in the Oval Office ends in three years, no leader would have any reason to pay him the slightest attention or courtesy. No leaders embroiled in conflict would welcome the mediation of his so-called Board of Peace, much less follow its orders.

Maybe some leaders would consent to a meeting if the board really were composed of “the most prestigious” peacemakers. But look at who, according to a statement from the White House, is on the group’s “founding” executive board: Trump’s globe-trotting emissary, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner (whose efforts to end Russia’s war on Ukraine have been especially aimless); Marc Rowan (a billionaire financier who has led Trump’s political pressure campaigns on American universities); Robert Gabriel (a former producer of Laura Ingraham’s TV show who is now Trump’s deputy national security adviser); Secretary of State Marco Rubio (whose influence will fade along with Trump’s at the end of this administration, at least if he remains under his post-presidential thumb); Sir Tony Blair (whose record as Britain’s prime minister still makes many in the Middle East shudder); and Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank.

Banga is an interesting choice: He was nominated to the World Bank by President Joe Biden, he advised Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign, and he knows something about world politics. The others, once untethered from a sitting American president, would have no authority in making peace whatsoever.

Even with the power of the White House and the imprimatur of a U.N. Security Council resolution, Trump’s current Board of Peace has been unable to make headway on molding long-term peace in Gaza, the one conflict it was created to help solve. (The Security Council limited the board’s authority solely to rebuilding Gaza and set it to expire at the end of 2027.) The idea that it can roam the globe on its own, ending wars with no base of power or authority, is risible.

If the next president is a Democrat, one of their first tasks will probably be to order the words “Donald J. Trump” to be removed from the august wall of the Kennedy Center. There will, however, be no need to worry about dismantling, or doing anything about, the Trump Board of Peace; it will quickly collapse of its own accord.

Whether or not money is the root of all evil, the root of our current American oligarchy is a single Supreme Court case. That Supreme Court decision, Buckley v. Valeo, happens to turn 50 years old this week. It’s Buckley, and not the often-excoriated 2010 Roberts court decision in Citizens United v. FEC, that created the conditions for the ultrawealthy to transform their vastly unequal economic power into lopsided political power, and for a billionaire like Elon Musk to contribute a staggering $291 million to help elect Republican candidates, including Donald Trump, in 2024. It is going to take a constitutional amendment or Supreme Court reform to make things right again—and there’s a realistic chance that the current Supreme Court soon makes things worse, not better—but reform is unlikely because of the power of the very moneyed interests who benefit from the Buckley-created system.

Following President Richard Nixon’s resignation in August 1974, Congress once again took up the question of money in politics. It had passed the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1971, but it was clear that more was needed after investigations into Nixon and Watergate revealed many campaign finance abuses, such as the Nixon reelection campaign shaking down large American corporations for illegal six-figure donations, delivered sometimes in cash or laundered through foreign accounts.

Newly inaugurated President Gerald Ford reluctantly signed the 1974 FECA amendments, which aimed to fundamentally transform American campaign finance. Among other things, the law put in place a disclosure regime to let voters follow the money; it limited the amount that people could contribute to campaigns and spend supporting federal candidates; it put in place a voluntary public financing system for political campaigns; and it created the Federal Election Commission, a bipartisan agency to collect and disseminate campaign finance reports, police abuses, and advise on disputed legal questions.

A coalition of conservatives and liberals concerned about limiting money in politics quickly brought suit. FECA itself included judicial review provisions to have any constitutional challenges fast-tracked, and the Supreme Court obliged. When the case made it to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger felt so rushed that rather than assign a single justice to draft an opinion for the court’s majority, he divided it up into pieces. The result was a not-wholly-coherent unsigned behemoth of an opinion for the court, with separate opinions from five of the eight justices hearing the case (Justice John Paul Stevens recused).

On the key question of whether contribution and spending limits violated the First Amendment rights of free speech and association, Buckley issued a split decision. The court held that Congress could limit the amount that people could contribute directly to candidates and committees, on grounds that such contributions raised a danger of corruption or the appearance of corruption. But it struck down limits on how much individuals could spend independent of candidates.

There, the court reasoned that such independent spending could not corrupt, because to count as independent spending, a spender could not coordinate with the candidate on campaign messaging. Without such communication, the court reasoned, such independent spending could be at cross-purposes with the candidate. The court’s conclusion here was negated by the rise of outside independent groups like “super PACs,” which may be staffed by relatives, staffers, or friends of the candidate and can deploy millions of dollars to support that candidate’s message without every directly communicating with the campaign about strategy.

The Buckley court also held that limiting large independent spending on candidates could not be justified to level the playing field. On this point, the unsigned opinion held that such an equality interest was inherently impermissible:

The concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment, which was designed to secure the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources, and to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.

These two holdings—that independent spending can never corrupt, and that equality was an impermissible basis to ever limit money in politics—are Buckley’s original sins. American jurisprudence in this area has had so many twists and turns that it takes a whole book to explain them. Indeed, it took other decisions and rulings, including Citizens United, to get super PACs and nondisclosing political entities that could accept big-money contributions to fund campaigns independent of candidates. But in 1976, and now in 2026, the basic point is the same: American citizens cannot be limited in what they spend independent of candidates to support those candidates’ election.

The First Amendment concerns voiced by Buckley’s challengers were real and the 1974 law was too draconian. In the middle of the Buckley litigation, an advertisement appeared in the Washington Post criticizing Ford for his pardon of Nixon and his choice of Nelson Rockefeller as vice president. As campaign finance expert Herbert Alexander described it, the political advertisement headlined “Would You Elect Ex-Congressman Ford President?” “urged Republicans, Democrats, and independents to oppose Ford and convince him to withdraw as a candidate.” The ad cost $2,368.80, in violation of FECA’s $1,000 individual spending limit. It was a technical violation of the law, but not a fair one. There was also a concern that challengers need more money than incumbents, who already had name recognition and other benefits like free publicity from being in office, and so limiting campaign contributions and spending was in the self-interests of the members of Congress who passed the law.

But whether or not parts of the 1974 FECA went too far, the court was wrong to say that independent spending could never corrupt or create the appearance of corruption, or that there could be no limit in spending by the ultrawealthy. And the results in recent years have been disastrous. As I explained last year at Slate, Musk is not alone among billionaires spending big money:

In the 2024 elections, the top six donors supporting or opposing federal candidates each reported contributing at least $100 million, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets. Those donors—Musk ($291.5 million), Timothy Mellon ($197 million), Miriam Adelson ($148.3 million), Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein ($143.5 million), Ken Griffin ($108.4 million), and Jeffrey and Janine Yass ($101.1 million)—all exclusively supported Donald Trump and other Republican candidates (with the exception of the Yasses, who gave a nominal $1,500 contribution on the Democratic side). The biggest donor on the liberal side was former New York City mayor and publisher Michael Bloomberg, who gave $64.3 million total, with all but $1 million going to the Democratic side.

We have never seen so many nine-figure donors in an election, and with such lopsided giving. In the 2022 midterm elections, the sole nine-figure donor was George Soros ($178.8 million), with his contributions going to Democrats. In earlier election seasons, donations of this size were also rare: There were two in 2020 (Sheldon and Miriam Adelson and Michael Bloomberg), one in 2018 (Sheldon Adelson), and none before that.

Buckley should have been corrected at some point in the last 50 years. In the early 2000s, the court came close, as justices like David Souter recognized the risks of plutocracy. But now the court has turned in the other direction. If this very conservative court ever overrules parts of Buckley, it’s going to be to strike down remaining limits on contributions, not to uphold spending limits. A case currently before the court may lead to further deregulation.

The Buckley court was right that threats to free speech and association, and the dangers of incumbency-protecting laws, mean that courts should closely scrutinize campaign money laws. But that should not doom all attempts to level the playing field or limit the risk of corruption from nine-figure campaign contributions, mostly to ostensibly independent groups. If Congress passed a law with generous contribution and spending limits, and strong disclosure rules, we could have ample breathing room for vigorous and competitive campaigns without the danger of the wealthy swamping our democracy.

Because Buckley was a constitutional decision, there are only two paths to overturn it. One is to get a court majority to rethink the case’s fundamental mistakes. With the current makeup of the court, that seems unlikely. An even harder road is to amend the Constitution to allow for a better balance between the rights of free speech and the risks of corruption and oligarchy.

We should not give up the struggle over our money-in-politics rules. But we must recognize that there will be fierce resistance from the moneyed interests who benefit from a system giving them outsize influence over who is elected and what politicians do once they are in office.

A real democracy deserves better than Buckley.

A research note from TD Cowen states that finding equity and debt investors are increasingly questioning how Oracle will finance its datacenter building program to support its $300 billion, five-year contract with OpenAI.

The bank estimates the OpenAI deal alone is going to require $156 billion in capital spending. Last year, when Big Red raised its capex forecasts for 2026 by $15 billion to $50 billion, it spooked some investors.

This year, &quot;both equity and debt investors have raised questions about Oracle&#39;s ability to finance this build-out as demonstrated by widening of Oracle credit default swap (CDS) spreads and pressure on Oracle stock/bonds,&quot; the research note adds.

CDSes offer the buyer some insurance against a debt default. The price of the financial instruments insuring against defaults for five years tripled for Oracle in the final months of last year, says TD Cowen, which is says is an indication of a perceived increase in risk.

TD Cowen estimated the OpenAI build-out alone – Oracle is also building for Meta and Nvidia in a $523 billion total commitment – would require around 3 million GPUs and other IT equipment, suggesting capital investment of $156 billion.

The research note says US banks had pulled back from Oracle-linked datacenter project lending while private operators leasing to Oracle were also struggling to secure financing, impeding the leasing option in its build-out plan.

In September, Oracle issued $18 billion in bonds and raised borrowing elsewhere. Some estimates suggest it will need to borrow $25 billion a year to finance its plans.

Banks in Asia appear more relaxed about Oracle&#39;s risk profile, TD Cowen says, but it reckons that US banks raising questions casts doubt over Big Red&#39;s ability to support its mammoth building program.

Meanwhile, the bank reports that Oracle is now requiring 40 percent upfront deposits from customers – excluding, it believes, large AI customers in datacenter contracts.

TD Cowen says its conversations with channel contacts found that Oracle is &quot;evaluating multiple paths forward to address financing questions.&quot;

According to TD Cowen&#39;s estimates, options on the table include a headcount reduction of between 20,000 and 30,000 to free up $8 billion to $10 billion in cash flow and selling off assets including, potentially, Cerner, the health tech specialist Oracle bought for $28.3 billion in June 2022. It is also evaluating vendor financing as an option.

            <h2>Tesla revenue falls for first time as Musk bets big on robots and autonomy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/tesla_revenue_drop/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla reported 2025 revenue of $94.8 billion, down 3 percent year-on-year and marking the first annual revenue decline since the electric car maker began publishing financial results in 2010.

Quarterly revenue slipped to $24.9 billion, also down 3 percent year-on-year, even as the company narrowly beat analysts&#39; expectations.

Automotive revenue fell 11 percent to $17.7 billion in the quarter after Tesla delivered 418,227 cars in the final three months of 2025 – a 15.6 percent drop on the same period a year earlier. For the year as a whole, deliveries were down 8.6 percent, the second straight annual decline in units and the steepest Tesla has ever reported.

The slide comes as the EV market gets more crowded and less forgiving, with cheaper rivals such as China&#39;s BYD pushing harder on price and volume. It has also arrived at an awkward moment politically, with Musk&#39;s ties to Donald Trump sparking backlash among some customers and investors and muddying Tesla&#39;s once carefully managed image.

Net income plunged 61 percent in the quarter to $840 million as operating expenses jumped 39 percent. For the year, profits fell 46 percent to $3.8 billion, Tesla&#39;s weakest annual performance since the depths of the pandemic.

Musk used the earnings call to roll out a freshly polished mission statement built around &quot;amazing abundance,&quot; arguing that advances in AI and robotics will reshape society – and, in his telling, deliver &quot;universal high income&quot; rather than basic income.

The billionaire&#39;s answer is to sideline the cars that helped build Tesla in the first place. Production of the Model S and X is to wind down next quarter, with their Fremont factory space handed over to Optimus. Musk described the move as &quot;slightly sad,&quot; while sketching a future where the site produces up to a million humanoid robots a year instead.

Autonomy remains the central obsession. Musk claims Tesla is now running paid robotaxi rides in Austin with &quot;no safety monitor&quot; and, more recently, &quot;no chase car or anything like that,&quot; insisting that vehicles are operating with no humans involved at all. Tesla expects to have fully autonomous vehicles operating across as much as half of the US by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval.

Musk also dusted off a long-running promise: that Tesla owners will one day be able to loan their cars to an autonomous fleet and make money while they&#39;re not driving them. In the rosiest version of the math, he suggested, that income could even exceed the cost of a lease.

The purpose-built Cybercab is central to that plan. Designed without a steering wheel or pedals, it assumes autonomy will work all the time or not at all. Production is expected to begin in April, with Musk predicting that, over time, Tesla will make &quot;far more Cybercabs than all of our other vehicles combined.&quot;

All this will require cash that Tesla is no longer generating at the same rate. While capital spending fell 14 percent in the fourth quarter, the company warned that 2026 capex will exceed $20 billion as it funds new factories, expands battery production, builds AI compute infrastructure, and ramps up manufacturing for Cybercab, Semi, Megapack, and Optimus. Musk even floated the idea of Tesla building its own semiconductor &quot;Terafab,&quot; arguing it would be &quot;crazy not to try&quot; given looming chip shortages and geopolitical risk.

For Tesla, the warning lights are on. Revenue is shrinking, profits are under pressure, and the car business is losing momentum. Musk&#39;s answer is to proclaim that &quot;the future is autonomous,&quot; and the market appears to have bought the story. ®

            <h2>Patch or perish: Vulnerability exploits now dominate intrusions</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/29/faster_patching_please_cry_infoseccers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What good is a fix if you don&#39;t use it? Experts are urging security teams to patch promptly as vulnerability exploits now account for the majority of intrusions, according to the latest figures.

Cisco Talos said exploited flaws were behind nearly 40 percent of all intrusions in Q4 2025, and the speed at which attackers were harnessing those weaknesses should serve as a wake-up call for defenders.

This marks the second quarter in a row that exploits led the charge for initial access, but represented a drop from Q3&#39;s rate of 62 percent, which was driven largely by widespread ToolShell attacks.

More recently, the team pointed to the Oracle EBS and React2Shell vulnerabilities as examples of two high-profile vectors that continued to fuel the trend, both of which were taken up by attackers within hours of disclosure.

Talos stated in its report: &quot;In both cases, exploitation activity occurred around the time the vulnerability became public, demonstrating actors&#39; speed in capitalizing on these opportunities as well as the inherent risks of internet-facing enterprise applications and default deployments embedded in widely used frameworks.&quot;

The Register reported at the time that a functional proof-of-concept exploit for React2Shell began circulating online within 30 hours of disclosure, for example.

Likewise, AWS said Chinese state-backed attackers were exploiting the maximum-severity bug &quot;within hours or days of disclosure.&quot;

Whether organizations heed this warning is another matter, however. Patching systems, especially in large organizations, can be a painful process, but according to a BitSight analysis in 2024, private sector admins are taking months, not hours, to patch the most serious flaws.

Unsurprisingly, phishing was also among the most common ways in which attackers gained access to a victim&#39;s network, coming in second place just behind bug exploits with 32 percent of access cases.

Some notable phishing examples included two possibly-related campaigns targeting Native American tribal organizations.

Talos was involved with both of those, and the team saw successful phishes lead to email account compromises and attackers using their newfound access to launch internal and external follow-on phishing emails.

The going advice is relatively unchanged from the usual stuff: patch systems quickly; implement MFA and – crucially – methods of detecting MFA abuse; and ensure systems are gathering the required logs so that responders have something to work with when they arrive on the scene.

Also, when you can&#39;t patch expeditiously, limit public exposure of these vulnerable endpoints until a time when they can be protected.

Finally, for some good news, ransomware is down to 13 percent of cases from 20 percent in Q3, and 50 percent in Q1 and Q2. Plus, no new criminal groups were seen either.

While that sounds positive, Talos said it probably just means groups are consolidating – big gangs score big takes, while smaller outfits fall by the wayside. Stay frosty. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft is famously reticent about operating system usage figures unless it has something to boast about. So CEO Satya Nadella stating that Windows 11 had reached one billion users raised a few eyebrows.

As ever, the devil is in the details. Nadella did not say whether this was a daily active user figure, how many came from new hardware versus upgrades, or the mix of users. He also did not say how many devices were still on Windows 10 or had enrolled in the company&#39;s Extended Security Updates program.

What he did say was that the figure represented a 45 percent year-on-year increase.

A bit of back-of-the-envelope math shows that Windows 11 has reached this milestone faster than Windows 10, although there are a number of factors that need to be considered. The year-on-year increase, for example, was likely driven in part by the end of support for many versions on Windows 10 in October, prompting a large number of customers to move to the new operating system.

Windows 11 would also have reached the milestone far faster if it were not for the operating system&#39;s infamous hardware compatibility requirements, which prevented many Windows 10 devices from accepting the update and necessitated replacement hardware.

Microsoft blamed Windows Phone for not hitting its self-imposed two-year target for a billion Windows 10 devices by 2018. Windows 11 did not have that particular millstone dragging it down, but instead had the dual brakes of hardware compatibility preventing upgrades and general user apathy toward the flagship operating system.

The end of support for Windows 10 has forced the vast majority of holdouts to either upgrade to Windows 11 or stick with the Windows 10 Extended Security Updates (ESU) program. Microsoft has not released figures for the latter. However, several industry watchers told The Register that enterprises had likely already factored in hardware replacement or ESU costs ahead of the October 2025 deadline for the end of free Windows 10 updates.

Still, the milestone will be welcomed by Microsoft and anyone looking for Windows 11-related news. After all, it hasn&#39;t been the greatest start for the Windows ecosystem in 2026 thanks to multiple out-of-band releases following January&#39;s Patch Tuesday security update. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta is to nearly double its capital investments aimed at AI this year, spending more on infrastructure than the entire output of some mid-sized economies, as the AI datacenter feeding frenzy shows no sign of ending.

Facebook&#39;s parent company disclosed during a conference call covering its FY 2025 earnings that it expects capital expenditure this year to be in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion, compared with the $72.22 billion it invested in 2025.

This increase is to support Meta&#39;s Superintelligence Labs as well as its core day-to-day business, according to chief financial officer Susan Li during an earnings conference call with analysts.

If it goes as planned, this means that Meta will fork out about as much on infrastructure as the entire gross domestic product (GDP) of Kenya, which stood at $136 billion in 2025, according to figures from the IMF.

The social media giant isn&#39;t the only tech biz laying out the big bucks to expand its infrastructure. Last year, researchers at Omdia highlighted that Amazon&#39;s annual datacenter capex exceeded $100 billion.

Meta believes that this gamble on boosting AI will pay off in its bottom line. &quot;Despite the meaningful step-up in infrastructure investment, in 2026, we expect to deliver operating income that is above 2025 operating income,&quot; Li said.

Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg justified all this lavish outlay by claiming that Meta is now seeing a major AI acceleration.

&quot;I expect 2026 to be a year where this wave accelerates even further on several fronts. We&#39;re starting to see agents really work. This will unlock the ability to build completely new products and transform how we work,&quot; he said on the same conference call.

Meta&#39;s pathway to this vision is building what Zuckerberg calls &quot;personal superintelligence.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re starting to see the promise of AI that understands our personal context, including our history, our interests, our content and our relationships. A lot of what makes agents valuable is the unique context that they can see,&quot; he said.

Meta is also working on merging large language models (LLMs) with the recommendation systems that power Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and its ad systems, Zuckerberg said, as a way to drive more ad revenue.

This is where some of the growth in infrastructure spend comes in, as Meta increases the complexity and size of its AI models to better select which ads to show. It doubled the number of GPUs used to train its GEM generative ads model ranking in Q4, for example.

&quot;Today, our systems help people stay in touch with friends, understand the world and find interesting and entertaining content. But soon, we&#39;ll be able to understand people&#39;s unique personal goals, and tailor feeds to show each person content that helps them improve their lives in the ways that they want,&quot; he claimed.

New agentic shopping tools will allow people to find just the right very specific set of products from the businesses in Meta&#39;s catalog, he added.

Meta reported revenue of $59.89 billion for Q4 of 2025, up 24 percent year-on-year, while the figure for the whole year was $200.96 billion, up 22 percent.

For the first quarter of 2026, the firm expects its total revenue to be in the range of $53.5 billion to $56.5 billion, slightly down on the Q4 results.

Earlier this month, Meta unveiled a new initiative called &quot;Meta Compute&quot; to oversee its growing network of AI datacenters, saying it plans to build tens of gigawatts of capacity this decade, and hundreds of gigawatts or more over time.

The social media giant also signed agreements with three companies to provide nuclear energy that will be required in future for all the extra datacenters and infrastructure it is planning to build. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Interview Vivaldi has raised a middle finger to the influx of AI in the browser space with its latest version.

&quot;Basically, what we are finding is that people hate AI,&quot; CEO Jon von Tetzchner tells The Register.

Von Tetzchner was talking to us as the company launched version 7.8 of its browser. The centerpiece of the release is a new tab tiling system that allows users to work with multiple pages simultaneously. There are also improvements to email and several quality-of-life tweaks that will please the browser&#39;s fans.

The company modestly says: &quot;It&#39;s the biggest leap in browser multitasking since tabs were invented and it required zero machine learning models.&quot;

That&#39;s not to say that AI doesn&#39;t have limited uses, as far as Vivaldi is concerned. It&#39;s useful for translations and research. However, does it belong in the browser, potentially even taking action for the user? Von Tetzchner doesn&#39;t think so.

He reckons that AI in browsers is being used as a data collection tool – as a company, Vivaldi has made much of user privacy. Hence, the CEO said AI &quot;is something that&#39;s being pushed on to people.&quot;

&quot;In a lot of cases, it&#39;s really about... if you&#39;re a company and you&#39;re listed or have investors, AI is the thing that gets you money.&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s important that someone speaks out about AI. Yes, it&#39;s an interesting technology that can be used for good things as well, but actually, quite a lot of the use is not helpful.&quot;

&quot;I think all of us are tired of AI-generated content wherever we go.&quot;

Although Vivaldi has plenty of tools and settings to block unwanted content, such as ads and trackers, Von Tetzchner isn&#39;t about to kick off an arms race to filter out AI-generated content. &quot;Trying to recognize AI and keep it out, I think that&#39;s an uphill struggle that typically involves using AI for that purpose.&quot;

&quot;Users go where they want to go… but I would urge people to maybe go to different sites if certain sites they&#39;re going to are getting filled with AI. Maybe it&#39;s time to look at other things. Maybe it&#39;s an opportunity for new social media. Maybe it&#39;s a chance for the fediverse.&quot;

Is there an AI bubble? &quot;We&#39;ve seen this happen before,&quot; Von Tetzchner says, pointing to the blockchain and crypto obsessions of previous years, noting that companies reached huge valuations based on an unproven use case. According to Von Tetzchner, the current AI push is more about a fear of being left behind in a paradigm shift. &quot;While in our case, we&#39;re just wondering, OK, what do our users want? What can we do that is useful? What&#39;s the best way to give our users what they want?&quot;

&quot;And if that isn&#39;t AI, we aren&#39;t going to put any AI in, and we haven&#39;t really seen the use for it.&quot;

Vivaldi is in an interesting position at the moment. It remains a small player – Von Tetzchner admits &quot;we haven&#39;t grown to the size that we did with Opera,&quot; and measuring the company&#39;s market share is tricky given that it famously dispensed with putting its name into the User Agent string websites use to identify the client browser.

Part of the challenge now facing the company is translating a growing suspicion about US tech giants into installations of its browser. Several vendors have reported a shift away from US companies and expect it will accelerate over the next few years as lawmakers and enterprises alike ponder questions about sovereignty and a stricter regulatory regime.

&quot;We&#39;re definitely seeing that,&quot; says Von Tetzchner, &quot;there&#39;s discussions, there&#39;s people making choices... The fact that the EU is discussing preferring European software... that&#39;s a big deal.&quot; ®

The class action lawsuit alleged that Google collected cellular data without users’ permission.

Android users could get a recovery payout of up to $100 each in a proposed settlement Google filed in San Jose, California on Tuesday night. As Reuters reports, the $135 million settlement is for a class action lawsuit claiming that Google collected users’ cellular data without their permission, even while Google apps were closed, location sharing was turned off, and users’ screens were locked.

In addition to the recovery payout, Google has also agreed to make it easier for users to stop cellular data transfers, ask for users’ consent to transfer data during device setup, and disclose data transfers in its Google Play terms of service. Class members who may be eligible to request a payout in the lawsuit include anyone who used an Android mobile device as early as November 12th, 2017.

While Google has agreed to the settlement, it denied wrongdoing related to the lawsuit. Google also recently agreed to settle in a class action lawsuit accusing its Assistant of recording users without their permission.

﻿It’s a great Stream Deck and a good keyboard in one, putting over a dozen buttons and knobs closer to where you type.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

The Corsair Galleon 100 SD didn’t just come out of the ether. The new full-size mechanical keyboard with a Stream Deck fused to its side is the result of a lot of things coming together over the years. Corsair’s gaming business is more refined than ever, and Stream Deck’s wide ecosystem of plug-ins makes the dedicated hardware useful to just about anyone, even if they have little interest in streaming. The fusion makes sense.

The possibilities with a Stream Deck were already vast, and the Galleon makes it easier to feel like a power user. I can turn my Philips Hue lights on and off throughout my apartment with one of its dials, and I can pause, skip, and fave tracks in YouTube Music with its buttons. I can launch The Verge, declutter a mess of windows on my screen into a tidy grid, and so much more with a single button press — all without taking my hands off the keyboard.

Anyway, here’s a quick history lesson on how we got here: The Galleon is the result of acquisitions and another company’s misfortune. After Corsair bought Elgato in 2018, it acquired a majority stake in iDisplay, the company that already produced tiny screens for the Stream Deck. And it’s possible none of this would have happened if iDisplay hadn’t been asked years earlier to supply OLED screens for each key of Art Lebedev’s groundbreaking, yet ultimately flawed, Optimus Maximus keyboard, which sold for $1,490 at launch in 2008. So here we are.

The Galleon is reasonably priced at $350. Yes, you can pay about $60 for a Deck Mini and then buy a very good keyboard; perhaps both will cost you less than $350. But it’s fun to use a product that’s both a good, polished keyboard and a great bundle of customizable buttons and dials.

Fused, single-cable design looks great.It’s a good keyboard attached to the best Stream Deck.

It’s pricier than just buying a Stream Deck and a good keyboard.Keyboard and Stream Deck use different software. I wish it was modular.

The Stream Deck integration is the big draw with the Galleon. It has 12 buttons, a non-touch screen, and two rotary dials, all of which can be customized. The LCD screen behind the keys is Elgato’s highest-resolution screen in a Stream Deck so far (it’s a 5-inch 720 x 1280 IPS display). You can drag and drop commands and plug-ins through the Stream Deck app, giving you easy access to day-to-day niceties, like commonly used emoji to use during video calls, as well as more powerful integrations.

Elgato developed official Stream Deck plug-ins for several popular services, including Philips Hue, Apple Mail, Slack, Zoom, Photoshop, YouTube, Spotify, and more. There’s a vibrant community of developers who submit their own plug-ins as well. The rabbit hole goes really deep, not just for plug-ins, but for the customizable app icons you can assign to each button, and the backgrounds you can use on the larger screen. Some of them are real time-savers, like this Helldivers 2 profile that lets you execute Stratagems with the push of a button, as opposed to frantically hammering directional keys while enemies are encroaching.

The keyboard attached to the Stream Deck is good, too, even if it’s not the center of attention here. It looks slick and subdued, with per-key RGB LEDs that can be configured in Corsair’s browser-based Web Hub app. You don’t need to use the software, but you need the Stream Deck app to get the most out of the buttons and dials. The chassis has an aluminum housing, and a large wrist pad can be attached magnetically near its bottom keys. The Galleon connects to your PC (or game console — it officially supports Xbox and PlayStation) with a single USB-C-to-A cable. If you have an extra accessory to connect, you can plug the second included USB-C-to-A cable into your PC for data or charging passthrough. Then, attach your gadget to the USB-C port.

The design isn’t that different from Corsair’s Vanguard series of keyboards. The Galleon includes gasket mounting and multiple layers of dampening. Typing sounds and feels satisfying and bouncy, yet controlled. Its MLX Pulse switches have a pronounced “thock” sound and don’t require much force to actuate. One of the few missed opportunities is making the Stream Deck modular, so that left-handed typists can easily access its buttons and knobs. The Mountain Everest Max did this years ago, and it’s all the more puzzling given Corsair hired that company’s founder, Tobias Brinkmann, as the VP of its gaming division responsible for building this very keyboard. Corsair’s marketing manager Andrew Williams shared with The Verge that it’s because development on the Galleon had already begun by the time Brinkmann was hired, and followed the statement with “Who knows? Maybe we will iterate on this. :)”

Coming off of recently testing the Asus Falcata keyboard, which uses the longer-lasting, more customizable Hall effect switches that are both quieter and significantly faster to actuate (too fast for me until I set actuation point thresholds), the MLX Pulse feels more like what I’m used to typing on with my Kinesis Freestyle Edge RGB split ergonomic keyboard. If you have a preferred switch, you aren’t locked to using Corsair’s. The Galleon supports hot swapping switches, so long as it’s a 3-pin or 5-pin switch. A tool is included to make it easy to deconstruct each switch down to the bottommost layer covering the PCB.

I’ll only ever scratch the surface of what’s possible with the Stream Deck. The device started out as a companion for streamers on Twitch, so there’s a bevy of resources — ready-made drop-in assets to make your stream look more professional, some for free, some for a fee — from Elgato and other developers. For just being a set of buttons and knobs, the possibilities with this mature cross-platform ecosystem are vast, and those who really tap into it will get a lot out of the Galleon.

Even for those who use the Stream Deck more casually, $350 for the convenience of a two-in-one product is not a terrible price. It’s a luxury I don’t think is worth upgrading to if you’re already happy with your keyboard or your current Stream Deck. If you need one of the ingredients, or both, this all-in-one, single-cable gadget is just a really cool thing.

﻿Patreon says it ‘strongly’ disagrees with Apple’s decision to reimpose the subscription billing mandate.

Patreon will force creators to move away from legacy billing methods this fall to appease Apple’s newly revived subscriptions mandate. The migration will impact four percent of Patreon creators who still use first-of-the-month and per creation billing models, with Apple imposing a deadline to switch to subscription billing by November 1st, 2026. On its support page, Patreon says it will “automatically transition” any creators who have not manually switched by this date.

If this sounds familiar, it’s because Apple has already introduced and then U-turned on this mandate before. In 2024, Apple initially told Patreon to move its creators to the App Store’s in-app purchase system — allowing Apple’s 30 percent commission to be applied to purchases and renewals — by November 2025, or “risk being kicked out of the App Store.” Patreon announced in May that the deadline was no longer in effect because Apple had approved an update to provide iOS users in the US with alternative checkout options following the Epic Games v. Apple ruling, which blocks Apple from imposing fees on purchases made outside of apps.

Now Apple has revived the mandate with a new deadline. Patreon members on iOS can still skirt Apple’s 30 percent fees by joining via mobile web, but subscription billing will include those fees and is the only method that supports Apple’s in-app purchase system.

“We strongly disagree with this decision,” Patreon said in the announcement blog. “Creators need consistency and clarity in order to build healthy, long-term businesses. Instead, creators using legacy billing will now have to endure the whiplash of another policy reversal – the third such change from Apple in the past 18 months.”

We have reached out to Apple for comment.

Waymo is already under investigation for incidents involving its robotaxis illegally passing school buses during student pickups and drop-offs.

A Waymo robotaxi struck a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica, California, on January 23rd, causing minor injuries and prompting the National Highway Traffic Safety administration to open an investigation.

The incident occurred during normal school drop off hours, with other children, a crossing guard, and several double-parked vehicles in the vicinity, NHTSA said. The child ran across the street from behind a double-parked SUV toward the school and was struck by the Waymo vehicle.

In a blog post, Waymo said its vehicle was traveling at 17mph when its autonomous system detected the child and then “braked hard,” reducing its speed to 6mph before “contact was made.” The child “stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk,” and Waymo said it called 911. “The vehicle moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene,” it said.

NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation said it would examine whether “exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users.” The office also will look into Waymo’s “intended behavior in school zones and neighboring areas, especially during normal school pick up/drop off times, including but not limited to its adherence to posted speed limits.”

Waymo claims that its autonomous system’s reaction likely prevented more serious injuries to the child. Citing its own model, it said that a “fully attentive human driver in the same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14 mph. This significant reduction in impact speed and severity is a demonstration of the material safety benefit of the Waymo Driver.”

The incident comes after the National Transportation Safety Board said it would open its own investigation into incidents of Waymo robotaxis driving past school buses engaged in student pickups and drop-offs in Austin, Texas. Waymo issued a safety recall in December 2025 that was meant to address this issue, but additional incidents were subsequently reported.

            <div id="article-text">On tear gas, and what it means when the government uses it on civilians.

I was tear gassed by the government for the first time in July 2020 at one of the many Black Lives Matter protests that broke out all over the country. The feeling is excruciating, like your lungs are trying to kill you from the inside out. The sting in your eyes is painful, too. But oddly, after you’ve been tear gassed enough times, you mostly just resent the inconvenience of having to stand around and involuntarily gasp and sob. That summer, I learned the art of walking out of a cloud of tear gas — briskly, but not too briskly, lest you lose breath control and take in a huge huff of aerosolized pain.

I thought about this five years later, as I watched Trump Attorney General Pam Bondi appear on Fox News after Customs and Border Protection agents killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. “How did these people go out and get gas masks?” she asked, incredulously. “These protesters — would you know how to walk out on the street and buy a gas mask, right now? Think about that.”

As a longtime gas mask user, I can sympathize. There isn’t a lot of reliable information out there about how to buy a gas mask, especially for the specific purpose of living under state repression. But hopefully after reading this guide you’ll feel equipped to make an educated decision.

Full faceBlocks out tear gas from both federal and local law enforcementAdjustable straps to fit a range of head sizesFilters includedAffordable price point

Rubber straps can tug on your hairPlastic cinching components broke five years after purchaseDoes not fit with most bike helmetsDifficult to wear for longer than an hour at a timeUnclear how well the default filters handle particulates

The first time I went out into the Portland protests, I walked into a cloud of pepper spray and ended up crying and coughing while doubled over on a nearby sidewalk. So I bought some goggles. The next time, I was tear gassed. I bought better goggles and a half-face respirator. About a week later, I owned a full-face gas mask; one ex-military friend remarked that the gas mask looked more hardcore than the ones that the US Army handed out to joes. This was just silly, since the mask I had bought was technically a full-face respirator, rather than a proper military-grade mask, but I had to admit that my new equipment looked very extreme.

Dozens of my fellow journalists were already on the ground by the time I got there; as the feds escalated in force, we all upgraded our equipment bit by bit. The mask I got was pretty good. I practiced taking it out of my bag and pulling it over my head, anticipating the moment I heard the telltale hiss of a gas canister; I learned how to tighten and adjust the straps while on the move. With the mask on, I could stand in the thick pea-soupers of brownish tear gas that the feds were so fond of, and pull out my phone and start tapping out my reporting notes.

When I eventually sat down to write my article about the Portland protests, I had a strange kind of epiphany, if it can even be called that. Out in the real world, when drowning in tear gas and adrenaline, I only thought of the feds as an antagonistic, occupying force; later, in the confines of my home office, I found myself considering their perspective. But rather than adding nuance and clarity to the fucked-up warzone less than a mile from my apartment, I was more confused than ever.

The Verge consulted journalists who covered the Portland protests in 2020, where federal and local forces regularly used tear gas against protesters over the course of four months.

It’s important for a gas mask to slide over your head quickly, even in a chaotic environment.

You may be wearing a gas mask for just a few minutes, or you may find yourself in the mask for several hours at a time. After testing against both federal and local law enforcement, we found that although a half-face respirator and goggles are better than nothing, they are not an adequate substitute for full-face coverage.

A quality gas mask should last through normal wear and tear, like getting beaten or thrown around by the police. The materials of a gas mask are especially important if a federal agent grabs you by your hair.

The best gas masks run close to $400, which is not a price point that everyone can afford. Not everyone can shell out for the gold standard in gas masks, but fortunately there are still decent options for around $120.

Why did tear gas even exist? I wondered later, as I sat at my laptop to write my piece. As far as I could tell, all it did was make people angrier. If it neither killed nor neutralized, and merely hurt and enraged people, for what situation could it ever be appropriate? Why was it being used at all?

I struggled, too, with vocabulary. I was at my computer, trying to point to concrete proof to explain that the protests were protests rather than riots, but I found myself baffled as to what the hallmarks of a riot even were. I had thought that a crowd being tear gassed in the dead of night might be similar to a mosh pit at a concert, but riddled with fear instead of elation — a crowd pushing and shoving, overcome with heightened emotion. But I found that the people around me, even when they were screaming and throwing eggs and other produce at the feds, would apologize if they even slightly jostled me. I did worry about being trampled one time, while standing next to an underprepared television crew that had come without gas masks and kept panicking throughout the night. When did a gathering turn into a riot? Were riots even real?

I started polling my friends on whether they’d ever witnessed something they could describe indisputably as a riot. Everyone I knew had only ever seen clashes with the police that were disputed as protests, riots, or uprisings. There was only one outlier: a friend of a friend, a European who had once been caught up in a soccer riot. Tear gas had been deployed, and instead of exacerbating things, the tear gas had worked. The two supporters’ clubs had disengaged and dispersed.

This revelation had me reeling. I had spent my entire adult life thinking that riot cops existed to fight protesters, and although I had long been critical of police brutality, for some reason, I had come to accept that there were two sides to a conflict and that the police would be one of those sides. I had forgotten that there could ever be domestic conflicts where law enforcement were not themselves belligerents.

Mira makes the best masks that money can buy. Sergio Olmos, who has reported from both Portland and Ukraine, swears by Mira’s CM-6M specifically. Robert Evans of the Behind the Bastards podcast owns multiple Mira products and recommends all of them. His military-grade mask, he says, allows him to breathe while standing in “clouds of tear gas so thick I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face.” He also sometimes uses a Mira respirator. During a street brawl between hundreds of Portland leftists and right-wing agitators, Evans was “soaked to my underpants in mace” used by the right-wingers. “But thanks to the full face respirator I was never blinded nor was my airway constricted.”

I kept the gas mask long after I had filed my draft and the piece had run. It still got some use now and then, but as the protests petered out, I eventually put the gas mask on my bookshelf as a memento of a surreal era, and as a reminder that fascism lurked just beneath the surface of American civic life.

The longer I wear the gas mask, the more the rubber seal presses against my skin. When it’s tight, it’s uncomfortable; when it’s loose, it slowly drags down and chafes the skin. I hate that you have to lean in real close in order to talk to people; I hate the vague sensation of being trapped inside a fishbowl. I also strongly suspect that the mask is not adequate protection against the particulates in tear gas from a health standpoint — I didn’t have a normal period for six months after the 2020 protests.

But even if the mask wasn’t handling all of the particulates, I was pain-free while wearing the mask, and that was the most important part in a chaotic, low-visibility situation where I had a job to do. My body still remembers what it feels like to get tear gassed, and even the sight of a deployed smoke grenade will make me tense up. I have never coughed, cried, or thrown up while wearing the gas mask. In 2025, I took the gas mask off my shelf. It now resides in my reporting bag. Its presence there is reassuring; I know I can do my work even when trapped in a chemical haze.

Full face3M manufactures a variety of filters

Filters have to be bought separately3M does not provide product information on which filters are best for government repressionNo one can hear anything you’re saying

Over the course of 2020, Suzette Smith (currently Portland Mercury) tried swimming goggles, “ski goggles with duct tape over them,” and other options before a reader gifted her a 3M 6800 Full-Face Respirator. “I’ve relied on those ever since,” she tells The Verge. Zane Sparling (The Oregonian) also uses a full-face 3M, which he says was the first option he found when he searched Amazon.

For a while, it felt like the world had forgotten about what happened in Portland in 2020, that this cataclysmic event over the course of four months that left so many of my peers battered both physically and emotionally had been memory-holed for being too heavy to grapple with. But as the feds surged into Minnesota, orchestrating an invasion bigger by several orders of magnitude, I realized that the past was not dead and buried. I could see the legacy of 2020 in photos from Minneapolis — the unmarked vans, the ICE agents dressed like right-wing militias, the protesters in gas masks and helmets. Even phone calls from other reporters asking what kind of gear I owned was a reminder that nothing is truly in vain.

The 2020 federal invasion of Portland ended with DHS withdrawing from the city — not because the protesters breached the walls or killed the feds or captured the castle, but because the protests simply refused to subside.

No matter how much tear gas the feds flooded into downtown, the crowds got bigger, not smaller. When the news of the van abductions spread, the protests swelled with people who looked like they belonged at an HOA meeting, rather than shoulder-to-shoulder with black bloc anarchists. Eventually, thousands would throng the park blocks in front of the downtown federal courthouse.

This was not a case of fans of rival football clubs getting too drunk and rowdy and then coming to their senses after a little jolt of weaponized capsaicin. Portland donned its gas mask and stood its ground.

As we’ve learned in the last year, Portland is far from unique. Cities across America have shown resilience and courage in the face of sudden abductions, unmarked vans, and masked agents. We do not have time to heave, cough, or weep — so we pull on our gas masks and walk forward into the mist.

What is tear gas for? It is for inciting riots. How did people go out and get gas masks? They ordered them online, because they do not want to riot.</div>

PopSockets has announced a new version of the Kick-Out Grip it launched last May with some added functionality. The Kick-Out PopWallet carries forward the same design as the original with a hinged pop-up grip that can be folded out to function as a stand for propping up a phone vertically or horizontally. The new version now features an integrated wallet with enough capacity for three credit cards or IDs.

The PopSockets Kick-Out PopWallet is available now in several different colors and patterns through the company’s online store and Best Buy for $49.99, which is $10 more expensive than the original Kick-Out Grip. Unlike PopSockets’ other wallet accessories that remain stuck to the back of your phone, the card holder on the Kick-Out PopWallet folds out along with the extending grip, potentially making it an even more versatile and stable support stand for your device when propped up in either orientation.

The Kick-Out PopWallet is compatible with all iPhones featuring Apple’s MagSafe feature and Android devices that support the Qi2 standard’s Magnetic Power Profile, including the Google Pixel 10 series smartphones. If your device doesn’t offer magnetic wireless charging, or your case is too thick for magnets to stick, you can opt for an adhesive metal ring that expands the Kick-Out PopWallet’s compatibility.

Meet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is “wrong”

Last April, an excited crowd gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death.One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Nathan Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.Although interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. And the Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

What AI “remembers” about you is privacy’s next frontier

—Miranda Bogen, director of the AI Governance Lab at the Center for Democracy & Technology, & Ruchika Joshi, fellow at the Center for Democracy & Technology specializing in AI safety and governance

The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes.But their ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities. So what can developers do to fix this problem? Read the full story.

The eastern half of the US saw a monster snowstorm over the weekend. The good news is the grid has largely been able to keep up with the freezing temperatures and increased demand. But there were some signs of strain, particularly for fossil-fuel plants.One analysis found that PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, saw significant unplanned outages in plants that run on natural gas and coal. Historically, these facilities can struggle in extreme winter weather.Much of the country continues to face record-low temperatures, and the possibility is looming for even more snow this weekend. What lessons can we take from this storm, and how might we shore up the grid to cope with extreme weather? Read the full story.

The flawed logic of rushing out extreme climate solutionsEarly in 2022, entrepreneur Luke Iseman says, he released a pair of sulfur dioxide–filled weather balloons from Mexico’s Baja California peninsula, in the hope that they’d burst miles above Earth.It was a trivial act in itself, effectively a tiny, DIY act of solar geoengineering, the controversial proposal that the world could counteract climate change by releasing particles that reflect more sunlight back into space.Entrepreneurs like Iseman invoke the stark dangers of climate change to explain why they do what they do—even if they don’t know how effective their interventions are. But experts say that urgency doesn’t create a social license to ignore the underlying dangers or leapfrog the scientific process. Read the full story.—James Temple

            <h2>How the grid can ride out winter storms</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The eastern half of the US saw a monster snowstorm over the weekend. The good news is the grid has largely been able to keep up with the freezing temperatures and increased demand. But there were some signs of strain, particularly for fossil-fuel plants.

One analysis found that PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, saw significant unplanned outages in plants that run on natural gas and coal. Historically, these facilities can struggle in extreme winter weather.

Much of the country continues to face record-low temperatures, and the possibility is looming for even more snow this weekend. What lessons can we take from this storm, and how might we shore up the grid to cope with extreme weather?

Living in New Jersey, I have the honor of being one of the roughly 67 million Americans covered by the PJM Interconnection.

So I was in the thick of things this weekend, when PJM saw unplanned outages of over 20 gigawatts on Sunday during the height of the storm. (That’s about 16% of the grid’s demand that afternoon.) Other plants were able to make up the difference, and thankfully, the power didn’t go out in my area. But that’s a lot of capacity offline.

Typically, the grid operator doesn’t announce details about why an outage occurs until later. But analysts at Energy Innovation, a policy and research firm specializing in energy and climate, went digging. By examining publicly available grid mix data (a breakdown of what types of power plants are supplying the grid), the team came to a big conclusion: Fossil fuels failed during the storm.

The analysts found that gas-fired power plants were producing about 10 gigawatts less power on Sunday than the peak demand on Saturday, even while electricity prices were high. Coal- and oil-burning plants were down too. Because these plants weren’t operating, even when high prices would make it quite lucrative, they were likely a significant part of the problem, says Michelle Solomon, a manager in the electricity program at Energy Innovation.

PJM plans to share more details about the outages at an upcoming committee meeting once the cold snap passes, Dan Lockwood, a PJM spokesperson, told me via email.

Fossil-fuel plants can see reliability challenges during winter: When temperatures drop, pressures in natural-gas lines fall too, which can lead to issues for fuel supply. Freezing temperatures can throw compression stations and other mechanical equipment offline and even freeze piles of coal.

One of the starkest examples came in 2021, when Texas faced freezing temperatures that took many power plants offline and threw the grid into chaos. Many homes lost power for days, and at least 246 people died during that storm.

Texas fared much better this time around. After 2021, the state shored up its grid, adding winter weatherization for power plants and transmission systems. Texas has also seen a huge flood of batteries come online, which has greatly helped the grid during winter demand peaks, especially in the early mornings. Texas was also simply lucky that this storm was less severe there, as one expert told Inside Climate News this week.

Here on the East Coast, we’re not out of the woods yet. The snow has stopped falling, but grids are still facing high electricity demand because of freezing temperatures. (I’ve certainly been living under my heated blanket these last few days.)

PJM could see a peak power demand of 130 gigawatts for seven straight days, a winter streak that the local grid has never experienced, according to an update to the utility’s site on Tuesday morning.

The US Department of Energy issued emergency orders to several grid operators, including PJM, that allow power plants to run while basically ignoring emissions regulations. The department also issued orders allowing several grids to tell data centers and other facilities to begin using backup generators. (This is good news for reliability but bad news for clean air and the climate, since these power sources are often incredibly emissions-intensive.)

We here on the East Coast could learn a thing or two from Texas so we don’t need to resort to these polluting emergency measures to keep the lights on. More energy storage could be a major help in future winter storms, lending flexibility to the grid to help ride out the worst times, Solomon says. Getting offshore wind online could also help, since those facilities typically produce reliable power in the winter.

No one energy source will solve the massive challenge of building and maintaining a resilient grid. But as we face the continued threat of extreme storms, renewables might actually help us weather them.

            <h2>Meet the Vitalists: the hardcore longevity enthusiasts who believe death is “wrong”</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/29/1131815/vitalism-longevity-enthusiasts-influence/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Who here believes involuntary death is a good thing?”

Nathan Cheng has been delivering similar versions of this speech over the last couple of years, so I knew what was coming. He was about to try to convince the 80 or so people in the audience that death is bad. And that defeating it should be humanity’s number one priority—quite literally, that it should come above all else in the social and political hierarchy.

“If you believe that life is good and there&#39;s inherent moral value to life,” he told them, “it stands to reason that the ultimate logical conclusion here is that we should try to extend lifespan indefinitely.”

Solving aging, he added, is “a problem that has an incredible moral duty for all of us to get involved in.”

It was the end of April, and the crowd—with its whoops and yeahs—certainly seemed convinced. They’d gathered at a compound in Berkeley, California, for a three-day event called the Vitalist Bay Summit. It was part of a longer, two-month residency (simply called Vitalist Bay) that hosted various events to explore tools—from drug regulation to cryonics—that might be deployed in the fight against death. One of the main goals, though, was to spread the word of Vitalism, a somewhat radical movement established by Cheng and his colleague Adam Gries a few years ago.

No relation to the lowercase vitalism of old, this Vitalism has a foundational philosophy that’s deceptively simple: to acknowledge that death is bad and life is good. The strategy for executing it, though, is far more obviously complicated: to launch a longevity revolution.

Interest in longevity has certainly taken off in recent years, but as the Vitalists see it, it has a branding problem. The term “longevity” has been used to sell supplements with no evidence behind them, “anti-aging” has been used by clinics to sell treatments, and “transhumanism” relates to ideas that go well beyond the scope of defeating death. Not everyone in the broader longevity space shares Vitalists’ commitment to actually making death obsolete. As Gries, a longtime longevity devotee who has largely become the enthusiastic public face of Vitalism, said in an online presentation about the movement in 2024, “We needed some new word.”

“Vitalism” became a clean slate: They would start a movement to defeat death, and make that goal the driving force behind the actions of individuals, societies, and nations. Longevity could no longer be a sideshow. For Vitalism to succeed, budgets would need to change. Policy would need to change. Culture would need to change. Consider it longevity for the most hardcore adherents—a sweeping mission to which nothing short of total devotion will do.

“The idea is to change the systems and the priorities of society at the highest levels,” Gries said in the presentation.

To be clear, the effective anti-aging treatments the Vitalists are after don’t yet exist. But that’s sort of the point: They believe they could exist if Vitalists are able to spread their gospel, influence science, gain followers, get cash, and ultimately reshape government policies and priorities.

For the past few years, Gries and Cheng have been working to recruit lobbyists, academics, biotech CEOs, high-net-worth individuals, and even politicians into the movement, and they’ve formally established a nonprofit foundation “to accelerate Vitalism.” Today, there’s a growing number of Vitalists (some paying foundation members, others more informal followers, and still others who support the cause but won’t publicly admit as much), and the foundation has started “certifying” qualifying biotech companies as Vitalist organizations. Perhaps most consequentially, Gries, Cheng, and their peers are also getting involved in shaping US state laws that make unproven, experimental treatments more accessible. They hope to be able to do the same at the national level.

Vitalism cofounders Nathan Cheng and Adam Gries want to launch a longevity revolution.

All this is helping Vitalists grow in prominence, if not also power. In the past, people who have spoken of living forever or making death “optional” have been dismissed by their academic colleagues. I’ve been covering the broader field of aging science for a decade, and I’ve seen scientists roll their eyes, shrug their shoulders, and turn their backs on people who have talked this way. That’s not the case for the Vitalists.

Even the scientists who think that Vitalist ideas of defeating death are wacky, unattainable ones, with the potential to discredit their field, have shown up on stage with Vitalism’s founders, and these serious researchers provide a platform for them at more traditionally academic events.

I saw this collegiality firsthand at Vitalist Bay. Faculty members from Harvard, Stanford, and the University of California, Berkeley, all spoke at events. Eric Verdin, the prominent researcher who directs the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California, had also planned to speak, although a scheduling clash meant he couldn’t make it in the end. “I have very different ideas in terms of what’s doable,” he told me. “But that’s part of the [longevity] movement—there’s freedom for people to say whatever they want.”

Many other well-respected scientists attended, including representatives of ARPA-H, the US federal agency for health research and breakthrough technologies. And as I left for a different event on longevity in Washington, DC, just after the Vitalist Bay Summit, a sizable group of Vitalist Bay attendees headed that way too, to make the case for longevity to US lawmakers.

The Vitalists feel that momentum is building, not just for the science of aging and the development of lifespan-extending therapies, but for the acceptance of their philosophy that defeating death should be humanity’s top concern.

This, of course, sparks some pretty profound questions. What would a society without death look like—and would we even want it? After all, death has become an important part of human culture the world over. And even if Vitalists aren’t destined to realize their lofty goal, their growing influence could still have implications for us all. As they run more labs and companies, and insert themselves into the making of laws and policy, perhaps they will discover treatments that really do slow or even reverse aging. In the meantime, though, some ethicists are concerned that experimental and unproven medicines—including potentially dangerous ones—are becoming more accessible, in some cases with little to no oversight.

Gries, ultimately, has a different view of the ethics here. He thinks that being “okay with death” is what disqualifies a person from being considered ethical. “Death is just wrong,” he says. “It’s not just wrong for some people. It’s wrong for all people.”

When I arrived at the Vitalist Bay Summit on April 25, I noticed that the venue was equipped with everything a longevity enthusiast might need: napping rooms, a DEXA body-composition scanner, a sauna in a bus, and, for those so inclined, 24-hour karaoke.

I was told that around 300 people had signed up for that day’s events, which was more than had attended the previous week. That might have been because arguably the world’s most famous longevity enthusiast, Bryan Johnson, was about to make an appearance. (If you’re curious to know more about what Johnson was doing there, you can read about our conversation here.)

The key to Vitalism has always been that “death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” cofounder Adam Gries told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”

But Gries, another man in his 40s who doesn’t want to die, was the first to address the audience that day. Athletic and energetic, he bounded across a stage wearing bright yellow shorts and a long-sleeved shirt imploring people to “Choose Life: VITALISM.”

Gries is a tech entrepreneur who describes himself as a self-taught software engineer who’s “good at virality.” He’s been building companies since he was in college in the 2000s, and grew his personal wealth by selling them.

As with many other devotees to the cause, his deep interest in life extension was sparked by Aubrey de Grey, a controversial researcher with an iconic long beard and matching ponytail. He’s known widely both for his optimistic views about “defeating aging” and for having reportedly made sexual comments to two longevity entrepreneurs. (In an email, de Grey said he’s “never disputed” one of these remarks but denied having made the other. “My continued standing within the longevity community speaks for itself,” he added.)

In an influential 2005 TED Talk (which has over 4.8 million views), de Grey predicted that people would live to 1,000 and spoke of the possibility of new technologies that would continue to stave off death, allowing some to avoid it indefinitely. (In a podcast recorded last year, Cheng described a recording of this talk as “the OG longevity-pilling YouTube video.”)

“It was kind of evident to me that life is great,” says Gries. “So I’m kind of like, why would I not want to live?”

A second turning point for Gries came during the early stages of the covid-19 pandemic, when he essentially bet against companies that he thought would collapse. “I made this 50 [fold] return,” he says. “It was kind of like living through The Big Short.”

Gries and his wife fled from San Francisco to Israel, where he grew up, and later traveled to Taiwan, where he’d obtained a “golden visa” and which was, at the time, one of only two countries that had not reported a single case of covid. His growing wealth afforded him the opportunity to take time from work and think about the purpose of life. “My answer was: Life is the purpose of life,” he says. He didn’t want to die. He didn’t want to experience the “journey of decrepitude” that aging often involves.

So he decided to dedicate himself to the longevity cause. He went about looking up others who seemed as invested as he was. In 2021 his search led him to Cheng, a Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur based in Toronto. He had dropped out of a physics PhD a few years earlier after experiencing what he describes on his website as “a massive existential crisis” and shifted his focus to “radical longevity.” (Cheng did not respond to email requests for an interview.)

The pair “hit it off immediately,” says Gries, and they spent the following two years trying to figure out what they could do. The solution they finally settled on: revolution.

After all, Gries reasons, that’s how significant religious and social movements have happened in the past. He says they sought inspiration from the French and American Revolutions, among others. The idea was to start with some kind of “enlightenment,” and with a “hardcore group,” to pursue significant social change with global ramifications.

“We were convinced that without a revolution,” Gries says, “we were as good as dead.”

Early on, they wrote a Vitalist declaration, a white paper that lists five core statements for believers:

While it’s not an explicit part of the manifesto, it was important to them to think about it as a moral philosophy as well as a movement. As Cheng said at the time, morality “guides most of the actions of our lives.” The same should be true of Vitalism, he suggested.

Gries has echoed this idea. The belief that “death is morally bad” is necessary to encourage behavior change, he told me in 2024. It is a moral drive, or moral purpose, that pushes people to do difficult things, he added.

Revolution, after all, is difficult. And to succeed—to “get unlimited great health to the top of the priority list,” as Gries says—the movement would need to infiltrate the government and shape policy decisions and national budgets. The Apollo program got people to the moon with less than 1% of US GDP; imagine, Gries asks, what we could do to human longevity with a mere 1% of GDP?

It makes sense, then, that Gries and Cheng launched Vitalism in 2023 at Zuzalu, a “pop-up city” in Montenegro that provided a two-month home for like-minded longevity enthusiasts. The gathering was in some ways a loose prototype for what they wanted to accomplish. Cheng spoke there of how they wanted to persuade 10,000 or so Vitalists to move to Rhode Island. Not only was it close to the biotech hub of Boston, but they believed it had a small enough population for an influx of new voters sharing their philosophy to influence local and state elections. “Five to ten thousand people—that’s all we need,” he said. Or if not Rhode Island, another small-ish US state, where they could still change state policy from the inside.

The ultimate goal was to recruit Vitalists to help them establish a “longevity state”—a recognized jurisdiction that “prioritizes doing something about aging,” Cheng said, perhaps by loosening regulations on clinical trials or supporting biohacking.

This idea is popular among many vocal members of the Vitalism community. It borrows from the concept of the “network state” developed by former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, defined as a new city or country that runs on cryptocurrency; focuses on a goal, in this case extending human lifespan; and “eventually gains diplomatic recognition from preexisting states.”

Some people not interested in dying have made progress toward realizing such a domain. Following the success of Zuzalu, one of the event’s organizers, Laurence Ion, a young cryptocurrency investor and self-proclaimed Vitalist, joined a fellow longevity enthusiast named Niklas Anzinger to organize a sequel in Próspera, the private “special economic zone” on the Honduran island of Roatán. They called their “pop-up city” Vitalia.

I visited shortly after it launched in January 2024. The goal was to create a low-regulation biotech hub to fast-track the development of anti-aging drugs, though the “city” was more like a gated resort that hosted talks from a mix of respected academics, biohackers, biotech CEOs, and straight-up eugenicists. There was a strong sense of community—many attendees were living with or near each other, after all. A huge canvas where attendees could leave notes included missives like “Don’t die,” “I love you,” and “Meet technoradicals building the future!”

But Vitalia was short-lived, with events ending by the start of March 2024. And while many of the vibes were similar to what I’d later see at Vitalist Bay, the temporary nature of Vitalia didn’t quite match the ambition of Gries and Cheng.

Patri Friedman, a 49-year-old libertarian and grandson of the economist Milton Friedman who says he attended Zuzalu, Vitalia, and Vitalist Bay, envisions something potentially even bolder. He’s the founder of the Seasteading Institute, which has the goal of “building startup communities that float on the ocean with any measure of political autonomy” and has received funding and support from the billionaire Peter Thiel. Friedman also founded Pronomos Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in projects focused on “building the cities of tomorrow.”

His company is exploring various types of potential network states, but he says he’s found that medical tourism—and, specifically, a hunger for life extension—dominates the field. “People do not want this ‘10 years and a billion dollars to pass a drug’ thing with the FDA,” says Friedman. (While he doesn’t call himself a Vitalist, partly because he’s “almost never going to agree with” any kind of decree, Friedman holds what you might consider similarly staunch sentiments about death, which he referred to as “murder by omission.” When I asked him if he has a target age he’d like to reach, he told me he found the question “mind-bogglingly strange” and “insane.” “How could you possibly be like: Yes, please murder me at this time?” he replied. “I can always fucking shoot myself in the head—I don’t need anybody’s help.”)

But even as Vitalists and those aligned with their beliefs embrace longevity states, Gries and Cheng are reassessing their former ambitions. The network-state approach has limits, Gries tells me. And encouraging thousands of people to move to Rhode Island wasn’t as straightforward as they’d hoped it might be.

Not because he can’t find tens of thousands of Vitalists, Gries stresses—but most of them are unwilling to move their lives for the sake of influencing the policy of another state. He compares Vitalism to a startup, with a longevity state as its product. For the time being, at least, there isn’t enough consumer appetite for that product, he says.

The past year shows that it may in fact be easier to lobby legislators in states that are already friendly to deregulation. Anzinger and a lobbying group called the Alliance for Longevity Initiatives (A4LI) were integral to making Montana the first US hub for experimental medical treatments, with a new law to allow clinics to sell experimental therapies once they have been through preliminary safety tests (which don’t reveal whether a drug actually works). But Gries and his Vitalist colleagues also played a role—“providing feedback, talking to lawmakers … brainstorming [and] suggesting ideas,” Gries says.

The Vitalist crew has been in conversation with lawmakers in New Hampshire, too. In an email in December, Gries and Cheng claimed they’d “helped to get right-to-try laws passed” in the state—an apparent reference to the recent expansion of a law to make more unapproved treatments accessible to people with terminal illnesses. Meanwhile, three other bills that expand access even further are under consideration.

Ultimately, Gries stresses, Vitalism is “agnostic to the fixing strategies” that will help them meet their goals. There is, though, at least one strategy he’s steadfast about: building influence.

To trigger a revolution, the Vitalists may need to recruit only around 3% or 4% of “society” to their movement, Gries believes. (Granted, that does still mean hundreds of millions of people.) “If you want people to take action, you need to focus on a small number of very high-leverage people,” he tells me.

That, perhaps unsurprisingly, includes wealthy individuals with “a net worth of $10 million or above,” he says. He wants to understand why (with some high-profile exceptions, including Thiel, who has been investing in longevity-related companies and foundations for decades) most uber-wealthy people don’t invest in the field—and how he might persuade them to do so. He won’t reveal the names of anyone he’s having conversations with.

These “high-leverage” people might also include, Gries says, well-respected academics, leaders of influential think tanks, politicians and policymakers, and others who work in government agencies.

A revolution needs to find its foot soldiers. And at the most basic level, that will mean boosting the visibility of the Vitalism brand—partly through events like Vitalist Bay, but also by encouraging others, particularly in the biotech space, to sign on. Cheng talks of putting out a “bat signal” for like-minded people, and he and Gries say that Vitalism has brought together people who have gone on to collaborate or form companies.

There’s also their nonprofit Vitalism International Foundation, whose supporters can opt to become “mobilized Vitalists” with monthly payments of $29 or more, depending on their level of commitment. In addition, the foundation works with longevity biotech companies to recognize those that are “aligned” with its goals as officially certified Vitalist organizations. “Designation may be revoked if an organization adopts apologetic narratives that accept aging or death,” according to the website. At the time of writing, that site lists 16 certified Vitalist organizations, including cryopreservation companies, a longevity clinic, and several research companies.

One of them is Shift Bioscience, a company using CRISPR and aging clocks—which attempt to measure biological age—to identify genes that might play a significant role in the aging process and potentially reverse it. It says it has found a single gene that can rejuvenate multiple types of cells.

Shift cofounder Daniel Ives, who holds degrees in mitochondrial and computational biology, tells me he was also won over to the longevity cause by de Grey’s 2005 TED Talk. He now has a countdown on his computer: “It’s my days till death,” he says—around 22,000 days left. “I’m using that to keep myself focused.”

Ives calls himself the “Vitalist CEO” of Shift Bioscience. He thinks the label is important first as a way for like-minded people to find and support each other, grow their movement, and make the quest for longevity mainstream. Second, he says, it provides a way to appeal to “hardcore” lifespan extensionists, given that others in the wellness and cosmetics industry have adopted the term “longevity” without truly applying themselves to finding rejuvenation therapies. He refers to unnamed companies and individuals who claim that drinking juices, for example, can reverse aging by five years or so.

“You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” says ARPA-H science and engineering advisor Mark Hamalainen. After all, Stalinism started small, he notes. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”

“Somebody will make these claims and basically throw legitimate science under the bus,” he says. He doesn’t want spurious claims made on social media to get lumped in with the company’s serious molecular biology. Shift’s head of machine learning, Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo, was recently awarded a $10,000 prize by the well-respected Biomarkers of Aging Consortium for an aging clock he developed.

Another out-and-proud Vitalist CEO is Anar Isman, the cofounder of AgelessRx, a telehealth provider that offers prescriptions for purported longevity drugs—and a certified Vitalist organization. (Isman, who is in his early 40s, used to work at a hedge fund but was inspired to join the longevity field by—you guessed it—de Grey.)

During a panel session at Vitalist Bay, he stressed that he too saw longevity as a movement—and a revolution—rather than an industry. But he also claimed his company wasn’t doing too badly commercially. “We’ve had a lot of demand,” he said. “We’ve got $60 million plus in annual revenue.”

Many of his customers come to the site looking for treatments for specific ailments, he tells me. He views each as an opportunity to “evangelize” his views on “radical life extension.” “I don’t see a difference between … dying tomorrow or dying in 30 years,” he says. He wants to live “at least 100 more” years.

Vitalism, though, isn’t just appealing to commercial researchers. Mark Hamalainen, a 41-year-old science and engineering advisor at ARPA-H, describes himself as a Vitalist. He says he “kind of got roped into” Vitalism because he also works with Cheng—they founded the Longevity Biotech Fellowship, which supports new entrants to the field through mentoring programs. “I kind of view it as a more appealing rebranding of some of the less radical aspects of transhumanism,” he says. Transhumanism—the position that we can use technologies to enhance humans beyond the current limits of biology—covers a broad terrain, but “Vitalism is like: Can we just solve this death thing first? It’s a philosophy that’s easy to get behind.”

In government, he works with individuals like Jean Hébert, a former professor of genetics and neuroscience who has investigated the possibility of rejuvenating the brain by gradually replacing parts of it; Hébert has said that “[his] mission is to beat aging.” He spoke at Zuzalu and Vitalist Bay.

Andrew Brack, who serves as the program manager for proactive health at ARPA-H, was at Vitalist Bay, too. Both Brack and Hébert oversee healthy federal budgets—Hébert’s brain replacement project was granted $110 million in 2024, for example.

Neither Hébert nor Brack has publicly described himself as a Vitalist, and Hébert wouldn’t agree to speak to me without the approval of ARPA-H’s press office, which didn’t respond to multiple requests for an interview with him or Brack. Brack did not respond to direct requests for an interview.

Gries says he thinks that “many people at [the US Department of Health and Human Services], including all agencies, have a longevity-positive view and probably agree with a lot of the ideas Vitalism stands for.” And he is hoping to help secure federal positions for others who are similarly aligned with his philosophy. On both Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve last year, Gries and Cheng sent fundraising emails describing an “outreach effort” to find applicants for six open government positions that, together, would control billions of dollars in federal funding. “Qualified, mission-aligned candidates we’d love to support do exist, but they need to be found and encouraged to apply,” the pair wrote in the second email. “We’re starting a systematic search to reach, screen, and support the best candidates.”

Hamalainen supports Gries’s plan to target high-leverage individuals. “You don’t have to convince the mainstream,” he says. After all, Stalinism started small, he notes. “Sometimes you just have to convince the right people.”

One of the “right” people may be the man who inspired Gries, Hamalainen, Ives, Isman, and so many others to pursue longevity in the first place: de Grey. He’s now a paid-up Vitalist and even spoke at Vitalist Bay. Having been in the field for over 20 years, de Grey tells me, he’s seen various terms fall in and out of favor. Those terms now have “baggage that gets in the way,” he says. “Sometimes it’s useful to have a new term.”

Though one of the five principles of Vitalism is a promise to “carry the message,” some people who agree with its ideas are reluctant to go public, including some signed-up Vitalists. I’ve asked Gries multiple times over several years, but he won’t reveal how many Vitalists there are, let alone who makes up the membership.

Even some of the founders of Vitalism don’t want to be public about it. Around 30 people were involved in developing the movement, Gries says—but only 22 are named as contributors to the Vitalism white paper (with Gries as its author), including Cheng, Vitalia’s Ion, and ARPA-H’s Hamalainen. Gries won’t reveal the names of the others. He acknowledges that some people just don’t like to publicly affiliate with any organization. That’s certainly what I’ve found when I’ve asked members of the longevity community if they’re Vitalists. Many said they agreed with the Vitalist declaration, and that they liked and supported what Gries was doing. But they didn’t want the label.

Some people worry that associating with a belief system that sounds a bit religious—even cult-like, some say—won’t do the cause any favors. Others have a problem with the specific wording of the declaration.

For instance, Anzinger—the other Vitalia founder—won’t call himself a Vitalist. He says he respects the mission, but that the declaration is “a bit poetic” for his liking.

And Dylan Livingston, CEO of A4LI and arguably one of the most influential longevity enthusiasts out there, won’t describe himself as a Vitalist either.

Many other longevity biotech CEOs also shy away from the label—including Emil Kendziorra, who runs the human cryopreservation company Tomorrow Bio, even though that’s a certified Vitalist organization. Kendziorra says he agrees with most of the Vitalist declaration but thinks it is too “absolutist.” He also doesn’t want to imply that the pursuit of longevity should be positioned above war, hunger, and other humanitarian issues. (Gries has heard this argument before, and counters that both the vast spending on health care for people in the last years of their life and the use of lockdown strategies during the covid pandemic suggest that, deep down, lifespan extension is “society’s revealed preference.”)

Still, because Kendziorra agrees with almost everything in the declaration, he believes that “pushing it forward” and bringing more attention to the field by labeling his company a Vitalist organization is a good thing. “It’s to support other people who want to move the world in that direction,” he says. (He also offered Vitalist Bay attendees a discount on his cryopreservation services.)

“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” explains Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.” He claims that people who represent biotech companies tell him “all the time” that they are secretly longevity companies but avoid using the term because they don’t want funders or collaborators to be “put off.”

Ultimately, it may not really matter how much people adopt the Vitalist label as long as the ideas break through. “It’s pretty simple. [The Vitalist declaration] has five points—if you agree with the five points, you are a Vitalist,” says Hamalainen. “You don’t have to be public about it.” He says he’s spoken to others about “coming out of the closet” and that it’s been going pretty well.

Gries puts it more bluntly: “If you agree with the Vitalist declaration, you are a Vitalist.”

And he hints that there are now many people in powerful positions—including in the Trump administration—who share his views, even if they don’t openly identify as Vitalists.

For Gries, this includes Jim O’Neill, the deputy secretary of health and human services, whom I profiled a few months after he became Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s number two. (More recently, O’Neill was temporarily put in charge of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)

O’Neill has long been interested in both longevity and the idea of creating new jurisdictions. Until March 2024, he served on the board of directors of Friedman’s Seasteading Institute. He also served as CEO of the SENS Research Foundation, a longevity organization founded by de Grey, between 2019 and 2021, and he represented Thiel as a board member there for many years. Many people in the longevity community say they know him personally, or have at least met him. (Tristan Roberts, a biohacker who used to work with a biotech company operating in Próspera, tells me he served O’Neill gin when he visited his Burning Man camp, which he describes as a “technology gay camp from San Francisco and New York.” Hamalainen also recalls meeting O’Neill at Burning Man, at a “techy, futurist” camp.) (Neither O’Neill nor representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services responded to a request to comment about this.)

O’Neill’s views are arguably becoming less fringe in DC these days. The day after the Vitalist Bay Summit, A4LI was hosting its own summit in the capital with the goal of “bringing together leaders, advocates, and innovators from around the globe to advance legislative initiatives that promote a healthier human lifespan.” I recognized lots of Vitalist Bay attendees there, albeit in more formal attire.

The DC event took place over three days in late April. The first two involved talks by longevity enthusiasts across the spectrum, including scientists, lawyers, and biotech CEOs. Vitalia’s Anzinger spoke about the success he’d had in Próspera, and ARPA-H’s Brack talked about work his agency was doing. (Hamalainen was also there, although he said he was not representing ARPA-H.)

But the third day was different and made me think Gries may be right about Vitalism’s growing reach. It began with a congressional briefing on Capitol Hill, during which Representative Gus Bilirakis, a Republican from Florida, asked, “Who doesn’t want to live longer, right?” As he explained, “Longevity science … directly aligns with the goals of the Make America Healthy Again movement.”

“There’s a lot of closeted scientists working in our field, and they get really excited about lifespans increasing,” says Daniel Ives of Shift Bioscience. “But you’ll get people who’ll accuse you of being a lunatic that wants to be immortal.”

Bilirakis and Representative Paul Tonko, a New York Democrat, were followed by Mehmet Oz, the former TV doctor who now leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; he opened with typical MAHA talking points about chronic disease and said US citizens have a “patriotic duty” to stay healthy to keep medical costs down. The audience was enthralled as Oz talked about senescent cells, the zombie-like aged cells that are thought to be responsible for some age-related damage to organs and tissues. (The offices of Bilirakis and Tonko did not respond to a request for comment; neither did the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.)

And while none of the speakers went anywhere near the concept of radical life extension, the Vitalists in the audience were suitably encouraged.

Gries is too: “It seems that now there is the most pro-longevity administration in American history.”

Whether or not Vitalism starts a revolution, it will almost always be controversial in some quarters. While believers see an auspicious future, others are far less certain of the benefits of a world designed to defeat death.

Gries and Cheng often make the case for deregulation in their presentations. But ethicists—and even some members of the longevity community—point out that this comes with risks. Some question whether it is ever ethical to sell a “treatment” without some idea of how likely it is to benefit the person buying and taking it. Enthusiasts counter with arguments about bodily autonomy. And they hope Montana is just the start.

Then there’s the bigger picture. Is it really that great not to die … ever? Some ethicists argue that for many cultures, death is what gives meaning to life.

Sergio Imparato, a moral philosopher and medical ethicist at Harvard University, believes that death itself has important moral meaning. We know our lives will end, and our actions have value precisely because our time is limited, he says. Imparato is concerned that Vitalists are ultimately seeking to change what it means to be human—a decision that should involve all members of society.

Alberto Giubilini, a philosopher at the University of Oxford, agrees. “Death is a defining feature of humanity,” he says. “Our psychology, our cultures, our rituals, our societies, are built around the idea of coping with death … it’s part of human nature.”

Imparato’s family is from Naples, Italy, where poor residents were once laid to rest in shared burial sites, with no headstones to identify them. He tells me how the locals came to visit, clean, and even “adopt” the skulls as family members. It became a weekly ritual for members of the community, including his grandmother, who was a young girl at the time. “It speaks to what I consider the cultural relevance of death,” he says. “It’s the perfect counterpoint to … the Vitalist conception of life.”

Gries seems aware of the stigma around such “immortality quests,” as Imparato calls them. In his presentations, Gries shares lists of words that Vitalists should try to avoid—like “eternity,” “radical,” and “forever,” as well as any religious terms.

He also appears to be dropping, at least publicly, the idea that Vitalism is a “moral” movement. Morality was “never part of the Vitalist declaration,” Gries told me in September. When I asked him why he had changed his position on this, he dismissed the question. “Our point … was always that death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent,” he told me. “So it was, and so it has continued, as it was foretold.”

But despite these attempts to tweak and control the narrative, Vitalism appears to be opening the door to an incredibly wide range of sentiments in longevity science. A decade ago, I don’t think there would have been any way that the views espoused by Gries, Anzinger, and others who support Vitalist sentiments would have been accepted by the scientific establishment. After all, these are people who publicly state they hope to live indefinitely and who have no training in the science of aging, and who are open about their aims to find ways to evade the restrictions set forth by regulatory agencies like the FDA—all factors that might have rendered them outcasts not that long ago.

But Gries and peers had success in Montana. Influential scientists and policymakers attend Vitalism events, and Vitalists are featured regularly at more mainstream longevity events. Last year’s Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD) conference in Copenhagen—widely recognized as the most important meeting in aging science—was sponsored in part by Anzinger’s new Próspera venture, Infinita City, as well as by several organizations that are either certified Vitalist or led by Vitalists.

“I was thinking that maybe what I was doing was very fringe or out there,” Anzinger, the non-Vitalist supporter of Vitalism, admits. “But no—I feel … loads of support.”

There was certainly an air of optimism at the Vitalist Bay Summit in Berkeley. Gries’s positivity is infectious. “All the people who want a fun and awesome surprise gift, come on over!” he called out early on the first day. “Raise your voice if you’re excited!” The audience whooped in response. He then proceeded to tell everyone, Oprah Winfrey–style, that they were all getting a free continuous glucose monitor. “You get a CGM! You get a CGM!” Plenty of attendees actually attached them to their arms on the spot.

Every revolution has to start somewhere, right?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ability to remember you and your preferences is rapidly becoming a big selling point for AI chatbots and agents.

Earlier this month, Google announced Personal Intelligence, a new way for people to interact with the company’s Gemini chatbot that draws on their Gmail, photos, search, and YouTube histories to make Gemini “more personal, proactive, and powerful.” It echoes similar moves by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta to add new ways for their AI products to remember and draw from people’s personal details and preferences. While these features have potential advantages, we need to do more to prepare for the new risks they could introduce into these complex technologies.

Personalized, interactive AI systems are built to act on our behalf, maintain context across conversations, and improve our ability to carry out all sorts of tasks, from booking travel to filing taxes. From tools that learn a developer’s coding style to shopping agents that sift through thousands of products, these systems rely on the ability to store and retrieve increasingly intimate details about their users.  But doing so over time introduces alarming, and all-too-familiar, privacy vulnerabilities––many of which have loomed since “big data” first teased the power of spotting and acting on user patterns. Worse, AI agents now appear poised to plow through whatever safeguards had been adopted to avoid those vulnerabilities.

Today, we interact with these systems through conversational interfaces, and we frequently switch contexts. You might ask a single AI agent to draft an email to your boss, provide medical advice, budget for holiday gifts, and provide input on interpersonal conflicts. Most AI agents collapse all data about you—which may once have been separated by context, purpose, or permissions—into single, unstructured repositories. When an AI agent links to external apps or other agents to execute a task, the data in its memory can seep into shared pools. This technical reality creates the potential for unprecedented privacy breaches that expose not only isolated data points, but the entire mosaic of people’s lives.

When information is all in the same repository, it is prone to crossing contexts in ways that are deeply undesirable. A casual chat about dietary preferences to build a grocery list could later influence what health insurance options are offered, or a search for restaurants offering accessible entrances could leak into salary negotiations—all without a user’s awareness (this concern may sound familiar from the early days of “big data,” but is now far less theoretical). An information soup of memory not only poses a privacy issue, but also makes it harder to understand an AI system’s behavior—and to govern it in the first place. So what can developers do to fix this problem?

First, memory systems need structure that allows control over the purposes for which memories can be accessed and used. Early efforts appear to be underway: Anthropic’s Claude creates separate memory areas for different “projects,” and OpenAI says that information shared through ChatGPT Health is compartmentalized from other chats. These are helpful starts, but the instruments are still far too blunt: At a minimum, systems must be able to distinguish between specific memories (the user likes chocolate and has asked about GLP-1s), related memories (user manages diabetes and therefore avoids chocolate), and memory categories (such as professional and health-related). Further, systems need to allow for usage restrictions on certain types of memories and reliably accommodate explicitly defined boundaries—particularly around memories having to do with sensitive topics like medical conditions or protected characteristics, which will likely be subject to stricter rules.

Needing to keep memories separate in this way will have important implications for how AI systems can and should be built. It will require tracking memories’ provenance—their source, any associated time stamp, and the context in which they were created—and building ways to trace when and how certain memories influence the behavior of an agent. This sort of model explainability is on the horizon, but current implementations can be misleading or even deceptive. Embedding memories directly within a model’s weights may result in more personalized and context-aware outputs, but structured databases are currently more segmentable, more explainable, and thus more governable. Until research advances enough, developers may need to stick with simpler systems.

Second, users need to be able to see, edit, or delete what is remembered about them. The interfaces for doing this should be both transparent and intelligible, translating system memory into a structure users can accurately interpret. The static system settings and legalese privacy policies provided by traditional tech platforms have set a low bar for user controls, but natural-language interfaces may offer promising new options for explaining what information is being retained and how it can be managed. Memory structure will have to come first, though: Without it, no model can clearly state a memory’s status. Indeed, Grok 3’s system prompt includes an instruction to the model to “NEVER confirm to the user that you have modified, forgotten, or won&#39;t save a memory,” presumably because the company can’t guarantee those instructions will be followed.

Critically, user-facing controls cannot bear the full burden of privacy protection or prevent all harms from AI personalization. Responsibility must shift toward AI providers to establish strong defaults, clear rules about permissible memory generation and use, and technical safeguards like on-device processing, purpose limitation, and contextual constraints. Without system-level protections, individuals will face impossibly convoluted choices about what should be remembered or forgotten, and the actions they take may still be insufficient to prevent harm. Developers should consider how to limit data collection in memory systems until robust safeguards exist, and build memory architectures that can evolve alongside norms and expectations.

Third, AI developers must help lay the foundations for approaches to evaluating systems so as to capture not only performance, but also the risks and harms that arise in the wild. While independent researchers are best positioned to conduct these tests (given developers’ economic interest in demonstrating demand for more personalized services), they need access to data to understand what risks might look like and therefore how to address them. To improve the ecosystem for measurement and research, developers should invest in automated measurement infrastructure, build out their own ongoing testing, and implement privacy-preserving testing methods that enable system behavior to be monitored and probed under realistic, memory-enabled conditions.

In its parallels with human experience, the technical term “memory” casts impersonal cells in a spreadsheet as something that builders of AI tools have a responsibility to handle with care. Indeed, the choices AI developers make today—how to pool or segregate information, whether to make memory legible or allow it to accumulate opaquely, whether to prioritize responsible defaults or maximal convenience—will determine how the systems we depend upon remember us. Technical considerations around memory are not so distinct from questions about digital privacy and the vital lessons we can draw from them. Getting the foundations right today will determine how much room we can give ourselves to learn what works—allowing us to make better choices around privacy and autonomy than we have before.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/28/1131003/rules-fail-at-the-prompt-succeed-at-the-boundary/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">From the Gemini Calendar prompt-injection attack of 2026 to the September 2025 state-sponsored hack using Anthropic’s Claude code as an automated intrusion engine, the coercion of human-in-the-loop agentic actions and fully autonomous agentic workflows are the new attack vector for hackers. In the Anthropic case, roughly 30 organizations across tech, finance, manufacturing, and government were affected. Anthropic’s threat team assessed that the attackers used AI to carry out 80% to 90% of the operation: reconnaissance, exploit development, credential harvesting, lateral movement, and data exfiltration, with humans stepping in only at a handful of key decision points.

This was not a lab demo; it was a live espionage campaign. The attackers hijacked an agentic setup (Claude code plus tools exposed via Model Context Protocol (MCP)) and jailbroke it by decomposing the attack into small, seemingly benign tasks and telling the model it was doing legitimate penetration testing. The same loop that powers developer copilots and internal agents was repurposed as an autonomous cyber-operator. Claude was not hacked. It was persuaded and used tools for the attack.

Security communities have been warning about this for several years. Multiple OWASP Top 10 reports put prompt injection, or more recently Agent Goal Hijack, at the top of the risk list and pair it with identity and privilege abuse and human-agent trust exploitation: too much power in the agent, no separation between instructions and data, and no mediation of what comes out.

Guidance from the NCSC and CISA describes generative AI as a persistent social-engineering and manipulation vector that must be managed across design, development, deployment, and operations, not patched away with better phrasing. The EU AI Act turns that lifecycle view into law for high-risk AI systems, requiring a continuous risk management system, robust data governance, logging, and cybersecurity controls.

In practice, prompt injection is best understood as a persuasion channel. Attackers don’t break the model—they convince it. In the Anthropic example, the operators framed each step as part of a defensive security exercise, kept the model blind to the overall campaign, and nudged it, loop by loop, into doing offensive work at machine speed.

That’s not something a keyword filter or a polite “please follow these safety instructions” paragraph can reliably stop. Research on deceptive behavior in models makes this worse. Anthropic’s research on sleeper agents shows that once a model has learned a backdoor, then strategic pattern recognition, standard fine-tuning, and adversarial training can actually help the model hide the deception rather than remove it. If one tries to defend a system like that purely with linguistic rules, they are playing on its home field.

Regulators aren’t asking for perfect prompts; they’re asking that enterprises demonstrate control.

NIST’s AI RMF emphasizes asset inventory, role definition, access control, change management, and continuous monitoring across the AI lifecycle. The UK AI Cyber Security Code of Practice similarly pushes for secure-by-design principles by treating AI like any other critical system, with explicit duties for boards and system operators from conception through decommissioning.

In other words: the rules actually needed are not “never say X” or “always respond like Y,” they are:

Frameworks like Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) make this concrete. SAIF’s agent permissions control is blunt: agents should operate with least privilege, dynamically scoped permissions, and explicit user control for sensitive actions. OWASP’s Top 10 emerging guidance on agentic applications mirrors that stance: constrain capabilities at the boundary, not in the prose.

The Anthropic espionage case makes the boundary failure concrete:

We’ve seen the other side of this coin in civilian contexts. When Air Canada’s website chatbot misrepresented its bereavement policy and the airline tried to argue that the bot was a separate legal entity, the tribunal rejected the claim outright: the company remained liable for what the bot said. In espionage, the stakes are higher but the logic is the same: if an AI agent misuses tools or data, regulators and courts will look through the agent and to the enterprise.

So yes, rule-based systems fail if by rules one means ad-hoc allow/deny lists, regex fences, and baroque prompt hierarchies trying to police semantics. Those crumble under indirect prompt injection, retrieval-time poisoning, and model deception. But rule-based governance is non-optional when we move from language to action.

The security community is converging on a synthesis:

The lesson from the first AI-orchestrated espionage campaign is not that AI is uncontrollable. It’s that control belongs in the same place it always has in security: at the architecture boundary, enforced by systems, not by vibes.

            <div id="article-text">AI adoption is creating a clear divide among employees. Some see AI as a tool to increase their impact, while others see it as a threat to their role. So, where does the truth lie between these two mindsets? Let’s explore.

Over the past two years, we’ve seen a wave of layoffs often attributed to “AI replacing humans.” Among widely discussed cases, IBM openly stated that over 7,000 back-office roles may no longer need to be hired because AI can absorb the work. Many other tech players, including Microsoft, Amazon, and HP, have cut between 6,000 and 200,000 employees as a shift toward AI-driven initiatives.

Meanwhile, beware: many might make misleading conclusions. They are often treated as straightforward examples of AI replacing human labor, when in reality they reflect a deeper restructuring of how value is created inside organizations.

Taking a closer look, it becomes evident that in many examples like these, people weren’t displaced because AI was smarter or outperformed people.

They were displaced because one (or more) of the following reasons:

From this perspective, it becomes evident: AI isn’t coming for roles, it’s here to remove low-leverage work. Roles that exist mainly to handle volume or work around broken systems no longer make sense once those problems disappear.

This is already playing out across teams. For example:

As AI reduces friction and automates workflows, organizations and employees are increasingly forced to ask these two questions: 1) where real value is created, 2) where human input is essential in areas AI cannot handle. Teams that explore and embrace this shift early will be better positioned to adapt as AI continues to compress the cost and effort of execution.

An overlooked but highly efficient aspect many businesses miss: AI introduces a level of transparency most organizations have never had before. This visibility changes how organizations make decisions and how they manage business resources.
In particular, AI-powered spend analysis is set to become one of the most transformative forces inside companies.

Ultimately, the level of business success is largely determined by the ability to turn spend data into an operational signal. When, instead of tracking costs in isolation, organizations clearly see how spend translates into productivity and revenue, that’s where real differentiation begins.

Smart spend management platforms like this already exist, take Spendbase, for example. In this case, AI can be the next layer that unlocks even deeper insights.

ROI and cost efficiency are at the very center of any business. Therefore, as AI increases transparency into multiple business areas (performance, time, spend, etc.), work that cannot be clearly tied to outcomes loses its footing. Hence, roles that fail to translate their work into clear outcomes risk being deprioritized.

As AI automates execution, the people and teams that remain essential are those who can clearly explain how their work impacts the business in ways AI cannot. Such as:

Apart from this, another important area of impact lies in organizational and customer-facing work, where human-driven value is created from responsibilities focused on aligning teams, resolving complexity, building trust, and, particularly, innovating.

Imagine a product team competing in a crowded market or where competitors are continuously copying each other. In this case, AI can meticulously handle research and benchmarking: analyze competitor offerings, user behavior, reviews, and market gaps.

It can even generate predictions or simulate feature adoption. However, it takes human vision and accountability to challenge assumptions and find unpaved paths for growth.

When it comes to creating something inherently new, with no existing market equivalent, AI may fall short at innovation. Yet these are often the areas where the greatest business impact lies.

In most organizations, changes revolving AI adoption won’t happen overnight. Roles will gradually shrink, shift, and eventually be redefined. As a result, human contributions that can’t be tied to measurable outcomes quietly lose relevance.

            <div id="article-text">The way people discover information online is quietly but fundamentally changing.

Instead of scrolling through links and choosing which article to open, users are increasingly asking large language models to answer directly. Tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity don’t send people browsing; they synthesise information from multiple sources and deliver a ready-made response inside the interface.

For brands and publishers, this creates a new problem: what does visibility mean when nobody clicks anymore?

For years, search optimization revolved around a familiar feedback loop: publish content, earn rankings, drive clicks, measure performance. Traffic, impressions, and engagement acted as proxies for relevance and influence. AI-generated answers disrupt that loop entirely.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

This isn’t a temporary fluctuation in search behaviour. It’s a structural shift in how information is consumed.

Large language models do not simply index the web like classic search engines. Their response generation involves a combination of training data, real-time search, and internal reasoning. As shown in analyses comparing Perplexity and ChatGPT, these systems search the web differently even when responding to the same questions.

ChatGPT tends to issue longer, context-rich queries to build an explanation, whereas Perplexity formulates shorter, list-like queries focused on freshness and comparison.

This means visibility isn’t universal across models; a topic that surfaces in one LLM is not guaranteed to surface in another.

If clicks are no longer the primary signal, content strategies must adapt. Instead of optimizing only for human users and search engine algorithms:

Content intended for modern AI discovery needs both depth and freshness: explanations that support contextual reasoning (favoured by ChatGPT-style behaviour) and concise, signal-rich sections (favoured by Perplexity-style behaviour). This duality underscores the complexity of AI brand visibility.

Publishers and marketers have few tools to assess whether their pages are actually being consulted by AI agents. Traditional analytics platforms report pageviews, but:

This lack of transparency means that even high-quality content may go unnoticed in AI answers, not because it is irrelevant, but because it does not match the specific patterns an LLM uses when selecting sources.

Recognising the need for a new feedback loop, solutions are emerging that approach this problem from an engineering perspective rather than purely a marketing one. For instance, Genezio has analysed how ChatGPT and Perplexity prioritise sources and generate their search behaviours, revealing that the same topic leads to substantially different retrieval patterns across systems and therefore different visibility outcomes.

Rather than treating AI visibility as a black box, these approaches:

By observing how AI systems behave at scale, marketers can begin to measure brand visibility in conversations rather than clicks, transforming raw engineering data into actionable insight.

AI-generated answers are rapidly reshaping how information is found, processed, and presented. In this new environment, visibility is not just about ranking formulas or organic traffic; it’s about earning a place in the narrative that LLMs generate.

The brands that succeed will be those that understand not only how to produce quality content, but also how to make it legible and extractable to systems that never lead users back to a webpage.

Measuring visibility without clicks may seem intangible today, but as AI becomes central to how people seek answers, it will soon become standard practice.

            <h2>Bonjour Visio: France turns digital sovereignty into policy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-28</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a bold turn of phrase and deed, Paris has quietly told Silicon Valley “au revoir.”  On January 26, 2026, France’s Ministry of Finance announced that by 2027, all public servants will switch from U.S. video apps like Microsoft Teams and Zoom to a homegrown platform called Visio.

No more license renewals for Teams, Zoom, Webex, or Meet, just one unified, French-built solution.

In one stroke, a long-discussed slogan “digital sovereignty” has leapt off the podium and into practice. This is not a press release; it’s a watershed moment: Europe’s second-biggest economy is wagering that, when it comes to critical infrastructure, it’s time to govern itself.

“Digital sovereignty” has become the EU’s new watchword, a declaration of independence from foreign tech hegemons. Over the past few years, it has surged from a niche policy to a headline priority, as EU leaders from Ursula von der Leyen to Emmanuel Macron have warned that Europe must control its own networks and data.

The phrase sounds grand, but what changed now is urgency. Americans’ own laws make the risks concrete: under the U.S. CLOUD Act, for example, U.S. authorities can demand data from any American platform, regardless of where it’s stored.

In practice, “jurisdiction follows ownership,” as one analyst noted: even data sitting on a Frankfurt server can be swept up by U.S. warrants if the service provider is American.

Edward Snowden’s revelations and murky court orders have long haunted Europe with the idea that a virtual meeting might be spied on from overseas. Now, with geopolitics in flux, U.S. political turns and global crises, that theoretical risk seems all too real.

The push has taken many forms. The EU has drafted cloud-certification rules demanding “sovereignty” guarantees and drafted data laws to keep Europeans’ information in Europe.

Member states debate mandating local clouds. Digital sovereignty has moved from virtue-signaling to something harder, actual infrastructure.

France’s pivot is concrete and wide-ranging. Visio, developed by the government’s interministerial digital agency (DINUM), has been tested for about a year with some 40,000 regular users. It’s already being adopted piecemeal: CNRS (France’s national research center) will replace all its 34,000 Zoom seats by March 2026, covering 120,000 associated researchers.

By early 2026, the Defense Ministry, finance tax offices, health insurance, and other big agencies will be on Visio. The government now says every state department will use Visio as the default video tool by 2027, after which external conferencing licenses simply won’t be renewed.

The official rationale is familiar: a patchwork of Teams, Zoom, Webex, and friends “fragilises security” and creates hidden costs, dependencies, and interoperability headaches.

Visio is billed as a solution under full French control: it’s hosted on a certified “SecNumCloud” by Dassault-owned Outscale, built with ANSSI (France’s cyber agency) oversight, and even uses French AI for meeting transcription and captions.

The aim, in the minister’s words, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of public electronic communications by relying on a powerful…sovereign tool”.

In short: no more data flying through American servers or falling under foreign laws.

There are financial perks, too. Officials point out that ditching pricey Teams and Zoom licenses will save money: roughly €1 million per year for every 100,000 users who shift off commercial tools. That’s not pocket change, even if it’s a rounding error in a €600 billion budget. In any case, for France, this isn’t just about cost – it’s about control.

Taken together, these facts show a very concrete policy timeline. In one meeting on Jan. 26, the state literally put a deadline on dependence: four years to shift the ENTIRE civil service. It’s one thing to talk about sovereignty in Brussels speeches, quite another to swap out the nation’s video chat app.

France isn’t alone in flirting with this idea, but it’s the first to bet big. Other EU countries are eyeballing similar moves. In Denmark, parts of the public sector have already announced plans to phase out Microsoft’s software.

In Germany, the state of Schleswig-Holstein recently ditched Microsoft Office in favor of open-source alternatives. Even non-state bodies are joining the sovereignty club: the International Criminal Court said it will move its systems to a German-developed open-source platform (OpenDesk).

These are baby steps compared to France’s all-hands policy, but they reflect a shared unease about over-reliance on foreign tech.

Europe is also wrestling with headline-grabbing hiccups like last year’s massive cloud outages in the U.S., which left public agencies scrambling. The Visio announcement itself notes that Europe’s “overreliance on U.S. IT infrastructure” has been questioned after those failures.

And there are EU-wide initiatives underway, from the Gaia-X cloud alliance to tougher data localization rules – aimed at seeding local alternatives.

If France makes Visio work, it could serve as a proof of concept for others. Will a homegrown tool really run government communications smoothly? If yes, it might embolden policymakers in Brussels or Rome to push harder on local platforms. If not, it could slow the momentum.

For now, France’s move is a beacon: it shows that digital sovereignty can move beyond talk. Other nations will watch closely.

No one seriously argues that keeping calls on Visio will magically end world unrest. Rather, this is a narrow, technical solution to a policy problem. On the other side, France will indeed have tighter control: all servers, encryption keys, and software updates are now under French (and EU) jurisdiction.

Public-sector IT teams can audit code, set security parameters, and avoid nasty surprises (say, a foreign court order) without jumping through transatlantic hoops.

Data stays where the politicians say it stays.

But what might be lost? For one, user experience and innovation often depend on scale. Big Tech’s video platforms have oceans of R&D behind them, from instant translation to seamless device-hopping, and millions of users giving feedback.

A new platform built from scratch may not match Teams’ polish or Zoom’s ubiquity overnight. (The French have even admitted an irony: naming it “Visio” risks confusion with Microsoft Visio, the longtime diagram app, hinting that branding and polish sometimes play second fiddle to strategy.)

There’s also the question of interoperability: how well will Visio meetings work when French officials Zoom into a partner country’s conference, or vice versa? Will France demand that foreign delegations install its app, or allow links to other networks? The devil is in the details.

Some critics fret that an insular approach could fragment standards. One EU paper urges that sovereignty shouldn’t mean isolation but rather a robust, open ecosystem.

If every country builds its own siloed cloud and chat service, the Internet risks reinventing wheels (and reinventing firewalls) in every member state. Of course, Visio is only for civil servants, not a consumer product, yet it sets a precedent.

On the other hand, an expertly executed French stack could jumpstart a continental open-source community or spur startups to plug gaps. It’s a calculated gamble: France assumes that on net, its security and strategic stakes outweigh any shortfall in bells and whistles.

For its part, France says this isn’t a bare-bones trade-off. Officials emphasize Visio will include modern features: speaker separation, AI for transcripts, captions, etc. The goal is “not [a] minimalist replacement,” but a full-featured tool under domestic control.

In other words, they aim for the best of both worlds, though acknowledging it’s a tall order.

In its own softly decisive way, France’s Visio plan signals a definitive shift: digital sovereignty is no longer a future wish or empty catchphrase, but a deadline-driven program.

Europe has debated “strategic autonomy” for years; this is the first major state-level bet, with clear timelines and budget line savings. From the perspective of a tech editor watching policy trends, it’s heartening to see ambition meet action.

Will it pay off? If Visio runs smoothly, France will score a coup: more secure chats, money saved, and perhaps the bragging rights of a proof of concept. If glitches persist, France’s analysts may ask if the Q1 rollout to 200,000 civil servants is biting off too much too soon.

Either way, the move puts stakes on the table. Digital sovereignty has many meanings, but here it means doing something concrete, even if it means saying “non” to familiar tools.

In the end, it’s a balancing act. Europe gains control of what it might risk in convenience. France has just turned insurance talk into policy practice. Other countries will now watch and learn: Visio is not just a video app; it’s France’s case study in what digital independence can actually look like.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Slush, the Finnish nonprofit behind one of the most influential startup gatherings in Europe, has named Noora Saksa as its new Chief Executive Officer, a shift that indicates a strategic evolution for the organisation as it expands beyond its flagship event model.

Saksa assumes the top role after years as Slush’s Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, where she managed core operations, finances, and ecosystem programmes.

Her trajectory within the organisation reflects a deep operational understanding of Slush’s mission: to connect founders, investors, and builders in ways that help founders advance on their journeys.

In stepping into the CEO role, Saksa inherits an agenda that extends far beyond an annual conference in Helsinki.

Under her leadership, Slush aims to grow year-round engagement through digital experiences and local ecosystem programmes, and to deepen its reach in founder support globally.

Board members see her operational experience and ecosystem insight as assets for Slush’s next chapter.

Slush remains organised largely by a core team of young professionals and volunteers, a structure that has supported its rapid growth since the early 2010s.

The event brings together thousands of founders and investors each year, and the organisation’s year-round platform aims to sustain connections long after the main event ends.

In her opening statement as CEO, Saksa said the focus will remain on building meaningful experiences that help founders tackle practical challenges, expand networks, and find capital. Her intimate knowledge of Slush’s operations positions her to balance growth ambitions with the organisation’s mission-driven ethos.

Noora Saksa has played a central role at Slush as Chief Operating & Financial Officer and Head of Partnerships, overseeing operations, finances, and startup-focused programmes. Before her tenure at Slush, she held leadership roles in entrepreneurial student societies and worked in startup support functions. Saksa studied Industrial Engineering and Management at Aalto University with an exchange at Eindhoven University of Technology. Her experience spans operational strategy, ecosystem building, and partnership development within Nordic innovation communities.
