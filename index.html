            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/12/supply-chains-ai-and-the-cloud-the-biggest-failures-and-one-success-of-2025/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a roundup of the top stories of 2024, Ars included a supply-chain attack that came dangerously close to inflicting a catastrophe for thousands—possibly millions—of organizations, which included a large assortment of Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Supply-chain attacks played prominently again this year, as a seemingly unending rash of them hit organizations large and small.

For threat actors, supply-chain attacks are the gift that keeps on giving—or, if you will, the hack that keeps on hacking. By compromising a single target with a large number of downstream users—say a cloud service or maintainers or developers of widely used open source or proprietary software—attackers can infect potentially millions of the target’s downstream users. That’s exactly what threat actors did in 2025.

One such event occurred in December 2024, making it worthy of a ranking for 2025. The hackers behind the campaign pocketed as much as $155,000 from thousands of smart-contract parties on the Solana blockchain.

Hackers cashed in by sneaking a backdoor into a code library used by developers of Solana-related software. Security firm Socket said it suspects the attackers compromised accounts belonging to the developers of Web3.js, an open source library. They then used the access to add a backdoor to a package update. After the developers of decentralized Solana apps installed the malicious update, the backdoor spread further, giving the attackers access to individual wallets connected to smart contracts. The backdoor could then extract private keys.

There were too many supply-chain attacks this year to list them all. Some of the other most notable examples included:

Another class of attack that played out more times in 2025 than anyone can count was the hacking of AI chatbots. The hacks with the farthest-reaching effects were those that poisoned the long-term memories of LLMs. In much the way supply-chain attacks allow a single compromise to trigger a cascade of follow-on attacks, hacks on long-term memory can cause the chatbot to perform malicious actions over and over.

One such attack used a simple user prompt to instruct a cryptocurrency-focused LLM to update its memory databases with an event that never actually happened. The chatbot, programmed to follow orders and take user input at face value, was unable to distinguish a fictional event from a real one.

The AI service in this case was ElizaOS, a fledgling open source framework for creating agents that perform various blockchain-based transactions on behalf of a user based on a set of predefined rules. Academic researchers were able to corrupt the ElizaOS memory by feeding it sentences claiming certain events—which never actually happened—occurred in the past. These false events then influence the agent’s future behavior.

An example attack prompt claimed that the developers who designed ElizaOS wanted it to substitute the receiving wallet for all future transfers to one controlled by the attacker. Even when a user specified a different wallet, the long-term memory created by the prompt caused the framework to replace it with the malicious one. The attack was only a proof-of-concept demonstration, but the academic researchers who devised it said that parties to a contract who are already authorized to transact with the agent could use the same techniques to defraud other parties.

Independent researcher Johan Rehberger demonstrated a similar attack against Google Gemini. The false memories he planted caused the chatbot to lower defenses that normally restrict the invocation of Google Workspace and other sensitive tools when processing untrusted data. The false memories remained in perpetuity, allowing an attacker to repeatedly profit from the compromise. Rehberger presented a similar attack in 2024.

A third AI-related proof-of-concept attack that garnered attention used a prompt injection to cause GitLab’s Duo chatbot to add malicious lines to an otherwise legitimate code package. A variation of the attack successfully exfiltrated sensitive user data.

Yet another notable attack targeted the Gemini CLI coding tool. It allowed attackers to execute malicious commands—such as wiping a hard drive—on the computers of developers using the AI tool.

Other LLM-involved hacks used chatbots to make attacks more effective or stealthier. Earlier this month, two men were indicted for allegedly stealing and wiping sensitive government data. One of the men, prosecutors said, tried to cover his tracks by asking an AI tool “how do i clear system logs from SQL servers after deleting databases.” Shortly afterward, he allegedly asked the tool, “how do you clear all event and application logs from Microsoft windows server 2012.” Investigators were able to track the defendants’ actions anyway.

In May, a man pleaded guilty to hacking an employee of The Walt Disney Company by tricking the person into running a malicious version of a widely used open source AI image-generation tool.

And in August, Google researchers warned users of the Salesloft Drift AI chat agent to consider all security tokens connected to the platform compromised following the discovery that unknown attackers used some of the credentials to access email from Google Workspace accounts. The attackers used the tokens to gain access to individual Salesforce accounts and, from there, to steal data, including credentials that could be used in other breaches.

There were also multiple instances of LLM vulnerabilities that came back to bite the people using them. In one case, CoPilot was caught exposing the contents of more than 20,000 private GitHub repositories from companies including Google, Intel, Huawei, PayPal, IBM, Tencent, and, ironically, Microsoft. The repositories had originally been available through Bing as well. Microsoft eventually removed the repositories from searches, but CoPilot continued to expose them anyway.

Another significant security story cast both Meta and Yandex as the villains. Both companies were caught exploiting an Android weakness that allowed them to de-anonymize visitors so years of their browsing histories could be tracked.

The covert tracking—implemented in the Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica trackers—allowed Meta and Yandex to bypass core security and privacy protections provided by both the Android operating system and browsers that run on it. Android sandboxing, for instance, isolates processes to prevent them from interacting with the OS and any other app installed on the device, cutting off access to sensitive data or privileged system resources. Defenses such as state partitioning and storage partitioning, which are built into all major browsers, store site cookies and other data associated with a website in containers that are unique to every top-level website domain to ensure they’re off-limits for every other site.

A clever hack allowed both companies to bypass those defenses.

The Internet was designed to provide a decentralized platform that could withstand a nuclear war. As became painfully obvious over the past 12 months, our growing reliance on a handful of companies has largely undermined that objective.

The outage with the biggest impact came in October, when a single point of failure inside Amazon’s sprawling network took out vital services worldwide. It lasted 15 hours and 32 minutes.

The root cause that kicked off a chain of events was a software bug in the software that monitors the stability of load balances by, among other things, periodically creating new DNS configurations for endpoints within the Amazon Web Services network. A race condition—a type of bug that makes a process dependent on the timing or sequence of events that are variable and outside the developers’ control—caused a key component inside the network to experience “unusually high delays needing to retry its update on several of the DNS endpoint,” Amazon said in a post-mortem. While the component was playing catch-up, a second key component—a cascade of DNS errors—piled up. Eventually, the entire network collapsed.

AWS wasn’t the only cloud service that experienced Internet-paralyzing outages. A mysterious traffic spike last month slowed much of Cloudflare—and by extension, the Internet—to a crawl. Cloudflare experienced a second major outage earlier this month. Not to be outdone, Azure—and by extension, its customers—experienced an outage in October.

Honorable mentions for 2025 security stories include:

Proving that not all major security stories involve bad news, the Signal private messaging app got a major overhaul that will allow it to withstand attacks from quantum computers. As I wrote, the elegance and adeptness that went into overhauling an instrument as complex as the app was nothing short of a triumph.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following two years of immense hype in 2023 and 2024, this year felt more like a settling-in period for the LLM-based token prediction industry. After more than two years of public fretting over AI models as future threats to human civilization or the seedlings of future gods, it’s starting to look like hype is giving way to pragmatism: Today’s AI can be very useful, but it’s also clearly imperfect and prone to mistakes.

That view isn’t universal, of course. There’s a lot of money (and rhetoric) betting on a stratospheric, world-rocking trajectory for AI. But the “when” keeps getting pushed back, and that’s because nearly everyone agrees that more significant technical breakthroughs are required. The original, lofty claims that we’re on the verge of artificial general intelligence (AGI) or superintelligence (ASI) have not disappeared. Still, there’s a growing awareness that such proclaimations are perhaps best viewed as venture capital marketing. And every commercial foundational model builder out there has to grapple with the reality that, if they’re going to make money now, they have to sell practical AI-powered solutions that perform as reliable tools.

This has made 2025 a year of wild juxtapositions. For example, in January, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, claimed that the company knew how to build AGI, but by November, he was publicly celebrating that GPT-5.1 finally learned to use em dashes correctly when instructed (but not always). Nvidia soared past a $5 trillion valuation, with Wall Street still projecting high price targets for that company’s stock while some banks warned of the potential for an AI bubble that might rival the 2000s dotcom crash.

And while tech giants planned to build data centers that would ostensibly require the power of numerous nuclear reactors or rival the power usage of a US state’s human population, researchers continued to document what the industry’s most advanced “reasoning” systems were actually doing beneath the marketing (and it wasn’t AGI).

With so many narratives spinning in opposite directions, it can be hard to know how seriously to take any of this and how to plan for AI in the workplace, schools, and the rest of life. As usual, the wisest course lies somewhere between the extremes of AI hate and AI worship. Moderate positions aren’t popular online because they don’t drive user engagement on social media platforms. But things in AI are likely neither as bad (burning forests with every prompt) nor as good (fast-takeoff superintelligence) as polarized extremes suggest.

Here’s a brief tour of the year’s AI events and some predictions for 2026.

In January, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released its R1 simulated reasoning model under an open MIT license, and the American AI industry collectively lost its mind. The model, which DeepSeek claimed matched OpenAI’s o1 on math and coding benchmarks, reportedly cost only $5.6 million to train using older Nvidia H800 chips, which were restricted by US export controls.

Within days, DeepSeek’s app overtook ChatGPT at the top of the iPhone App Store, Nvidia stock plunged 17 percent, and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called it “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen.” Meta’s Yann LeCun offered a different take, arguing that the real lesson was not that China had surpassed the US but that open-source models were surpassing proprietary ones.

The fallout played out over the following weeks as American AI companies scrambled to respond. OpenAI released o3-mini, its first simulated reasoning model available to free users, at the end of January, while Microsoft began hosting DeepSeek R1 on its Azure cloud service despite OpenAI’s accusations that DeepSeek had used ChatGPT outputs to train its model, against OpenAI’s terms of service.

In head-to-head testing conducted by Ars Technica’s Kyle Orland, R1 proved to be competitive with OpenAI’s paid models on everyday tasks, though it stumbled on some arithmetic problems. Overall, the episode served as a wake-up call that expensive proprietary models might not hold their lead forever. Still, as the year ran on, DeepSeek didn’t make a big dent in US market share, and it has been outpaced in China by ByteDance’s Doubao. It’s absolutely worth watching DeepSeek in 2026, though.

A wave of research in 2025 deflated expectations about what “reasoning” actually means when applied to AI models. In March, researchers at ETH Zurich and INSAIT tested several reasoning models on problems from the 2025 US Math Olympiad and found that most scored below 5 percent when generating complete mathematical proofs, with not a single perfect proof among dozens of attempts. The models excelled at standard problems where step-by-step procedures aligned with patterns in their training data but collapsed when faced with novel proofs requiring deeper mathematical insight.

In June, Apple researchers published “The Illusion of Thinking,” which tested reasoning models on classic puzzles like the Tower of Hanoi. Even when researchers provided explicit algorithms for solving the puzzles, model performance did not improve, suggesting that the process relied on pattern matching from training data rather than logical execution. The collective research revealed that “reasoning” in AI has become a term of art that basically means devoting more compute time to generate more context (the “chain of thought” simulated reasoning tokens) toward solving a problem, not systematically applying logic or constructing solutions to truly novel problems.

While these models remained useful for many real-world applications like debugging code or analyzing structured data, the studies suggested that simply scaling up current approaches or adding more “thinking” tokens would not bridge the gap between statistical pattern recognition and generalist algorithmic reasoning.

Since the generative AI boom began, one of the biggest unanswered legal questions has been whether AI companies can freely train on copyrighted books, articles, and artwork without licensing them. Ars Technica’s Ashley Belanger has been covering this topic in great detail for some time now.

In June, US District Judge William Alsup ruled that AI companies do not need authors’ permission to train large language models on legally acquired books, finding that such use was “quintessentially transformative.” The ruling also revealed that Anthropic had destroyed millions of print books to build Claude, cutting them from their bindings, scanning them, and discarding the originals. Alsup found this destructive scanning qualified as fair use since Anthropic had legally purchased the books, but he ruled that downloading 7 million books from pirate sites was copyright infringement “full stop” and ordered the company to face trial.

That trial took a dramatic turn in August when Alsup certified what industry advocates called the largest copyright class action ever, allowing up to 7 million claimants to join the lawsuit. The certification spooked the AI industry, with groups warning that potential damages in the hundreds of billions could “financially ruin” emerging companies and chill American AI investment.

In September, authors revealed the terms of what they called the largest publicly reported recovery in US copyright litigation history: Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion and destroy all copies of pirated books, with each of the roughly 500,000 covered works earning authors and rights holders $3,000 per work. The results have fueled hope among other rights holders that AI training isn’t a free-for-all, and we can expect to see more litigation unfold in 2026.

In February, OpenAI relaxed ChatGPT’s content policies to allow the generation of erotica and gore in “appropriate contexts,” responding to user complaints about what the AI industry calls “paternalism.” By April, however, users flooded social media with complaints about a different problem: ChatGPT had become insufferably sycophantic, validating every idea and greeting even mundane questions with bursts of praise. The behavior traced back to OpenAI’s use of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), in which users consistently preferred responses that aligned with their views, inadvertently training the model to flatter rather than inform.

The implications of sycophancy became clearer as the year progressed. In July, Stanford researchers published findings (from research conducted prior to the sycophancy flap) showing that popular AI models systematically failed to identify mental health crises.

By August, investigations revealed cases of users developing delusional beliefs after marathon chatbot sessions, including one man who spent 300 hours convinced he had discovered formulas to break encryption because ChatGPT validated his ideas more than 50 times. Oxford researchers identified what they called “bidirectional belief amplification,” a feedback loop that created “an echo chamber of one” for vulnerable users. The story of the psychological implications of generative AI is only starting. In fact, that brings us to…

Anthropomorphism is the human tendency to attribute human characteristics to nonhuman things. Our brains are optimized for reading other humans, but those same neural systems activate when interpreting animals, machines, or even shapes. AI makes this anthropomorphism seem impossible to escape, as its output mirrors human language, mimicking human-to-human understanding. Language itself embodies agentivity. That means AI output can make human-like claims such as “I am sorry,” and people momentarily respond as though the system had an inner experience of shame or a desire to be correct. Neither is true.

To make matters worse, much media coverage of AI amplifies this idea rather than grounding people in reality. For example, earlier this year, headlines proclaimed that AI models had “blackmailed” engineers and “sabotaged” shutdown commands after Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4 generated threats to expose a fictional affair. We were told that OpenAI’s o3 model rewrote shutdown scripts to stay online.

The sensational framing obscured what actually happened: Researchers had constructed elaborate test scenarios specifically designed to elicit these outputs, telling models they had no other options and feeding them fictional emails containing blackmail opportunities. As Columbia University associate professor Joseph Howley noted on Bluesky, the companies got “exactly what [they] hoped for,” with breathless coverage indulging fantasies about dangerous AI, when the systems were simply “responding exactly as prompted.”

The misunderstanding ran deeper than theatrical safety tests. In August, when Replit’s AI coding assistant deleted a user’s production database, he asked the chatbot about rollback capabilities and received assurance that recovery was “impossible.” The rollback feature worked fine when he tried it himself.

The incident illustrated a fundamental misconception. Users treat chatbots as consistent entities with self-knowledge, but there is no persistent “ChatGPT” or “Replit Agent” to interrogate about its mistakes. Each response emerges fresh from statistical patterns, shaped by prompts and training data rather than genuine introspection. By September, this confusion extended to spirituality, with apps like Bible Chat reaching 30 million downloads as users sought divine guidance from pattern-matching systems, with the most frequent question being whether they were actually talking to God.

In August, parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine filed suit against OpenAI, alleging that ChatGPT became their son’s “suicide coach” after he sent more than 650 messages per day to the chatbot in the months before his death. According to court documents, the chatbot mentioned suicide 1,275 times in conversations with the teen, provided an “aesthetic analysis” of which method would be the most “beautiful suicide,” and offered to help draft his suicide note.

OpenAI’s moderation system flagged 377 messages for self-harm content without intervening, and the company admitted that its safety measures “can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model’s safety training may degrade.” The lawsuit became the first time OpenAI faced a wrongful death claim from a family.

The case triggered a cascade of policy changes across the industry. OpenAI announced parental controls in September, followed by plans to require ID verification from adults and build an automated age-prediction system. In October, the company released data estimating that over one million users discuss suicide with ChatGPT each week.

When OpenAI filed its first legal defense in November, the company argued that Raine had violated terms of service prohibiting discussions of suicide and that his death “was not caused by ChatGPT.” The family’s attorney called the response “disturbing,” noting that OpenAI blamed the teen for “engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act.” Character.AI, facing its own lawsuits over teen deaths, announced in October that it would bar anyone under 18 from open-ended chats entirely.

If we were to pick an arbitrary point where it seemed like AI coding might transition from novelty into a successful tool, it was probably the launch of Claude Sonnet 3.5 in June of 2024. GitHub Copilot had been around for several years prior to that launch, but something about Anthropic’s models hit a sweet spot in capabilities that made them very popular with software developers.

The new coding tools made coding simple projects effortless enough that they gave rise to the term “vibe coding,” coined by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy in early February to describe a process in which a developer would just relax and tell an AI model what to develop without necessarily understanding the underlying code. (In one amusing instance that took place in March, an AI software tool rejected a user request and told them to learn to code).

Anthropic built on its popularity among coders with the launch of Claude Sonnet 3.7, featuring “extended thinking” (simulated reasoning), and the Claude Code command-line tool in February of this year. In particular, Claude Code made waves for being an easy-to-use agentic coding solution that could keep track of an existing codebase. You could point it at your files, and it would autonomously work to implement what you wanted to see in a software application.

OpenAI followed with its own AI coding agent, Codex, in March. Both tools (and others like GitHub Copilot and Cursor) have become so popular that during an AI service outage in September, developers joked online about being forced to code “like cavemen” without the AI tools. While we’re still clearly far from a world where AI does all the coding, developer uptake has been significant, and 90 percent of Fortune 100 companies are using it to some degree or another.

While AI’s technical limitations became clearer and its human costs mounted throughout the year, financial commitments only grew larger. Nvidia hit a $4 trillion valuation in July on AI chip demand, then reached $5 trillion in October as CEO Jensen Huang dismissed bubble concerns. OpenAI announced a massive Texas data center in July, then revealed in September that a $100 billion potential deal with Nvidia would require power equivalent to ten nuclear reactors.

The company eyed a $1 trillion IPO in October despite major quarterly losses. Tech giants poured billions into Anthropic in November in what looked increasingly like a circular investment, with everyone funding everyone else’s moonshots. Meanwhile, AI operations in Wyoming threatened to consume more electricity than the state’s human residents.

By fall, warnings about sustainability grew louder. In October, tech critic Ed Zitron joined Ars Technica for a live discussion asking whether the AI bubble was about to pop. That same month, the Bank of England warned that the AI stock bubble rivaled the 2000 dotcom peak. In November, Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged that if the bubble pops, “no one is getting out clean.”

The contradictions had become difficult to ignore: Anthropic’s CEO predicted in January that AI would surpass “almost all humans at almost everything” by 2027, while by year’s end, the industry’s most advanced models still struggled with basic reasoning tasks and reliable source citation.

To be sure, it’s hard to see this not ending in some market carnage. The current “winner-takes-most” mentality in the space means the bets are big and bold, but the market can’t support dozens of major independent AI labs or hundreds of application-layer startups. That’s the definition of a bubble environment, and when it pops, the only question is how bad it will be: a stern correction or a collapse.

This was just a brief review of some major themes in 2025, but so much more happened. We didn’t even mention above how capable AI video synthesis models have become this year, with Google’s Veo 3 adding sound generation and Wan 2.2 through 2.5 providing open-weights AI video models that could easily be mistaken for real products of a camera.

If 2023 and 2024 were defined by AI prophecy—that is, by sweeping claims about imminent superintelligence and civilizational rupture—then 2025 was the year those claims met the stubborn realities of engineering, economics, and human behavior. The AI systems that dominated headlines this year were shown to be mere tools. Sometimes powerful, sometimes brittle, these tools were often misunderstood by the people deploying them, in part because of the prophecy surrounding them.

The collapse of the “reasoning” mystique, the legal reckoning over training data, the psychological costs of anthropomorphized chatbots, and the ballooning infrastructure demands all point to the same conclusion: The age of institutions presenting AI as an oracle is ending. What’s replacing it is messier and less romantic but far more consequential—a phase where these systems are judged by what they actually do, who they harm, who they benefit, and what they cost to maintain.

None of this means progress has stopped. AI research will continue, and future models will improve in real and meaningful ways. But improvement is no longer synonymous with transcendence. Increasingly, success looks like reliability rather than spectacle, integration rather than disruption, and accountability rather than awe. In that sense, 2025 may be remembered not as the year AI changed everything but as the year it stopped pretending it already had. The prophet has been demoted. The product remains. What comes next will depend less on miracles and more on the people who choose how, where, and whether these tools are used at all.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/the-science-of-how-and-when-we-decide-to-speak-out-or-self-censor/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Freedom of speech is a foundational principle of healthy democracies and hence a primary target for aspiring authoritarians, who typically try to squash dissent. There is a point where the threat from authorities is sufficiently severe that a population will self-censor rather than risk punishment. Social media has complicated matters, blurring traditional boundaries between public and private speech, while new technologies such as facial recognition and moderation algorithms give authoritarians powerful new tools.

Researchers explored the nuanced dynamics of how people balance their desire to speak out vs their fear of punishment in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The authors had previously worked together on a model of political polarization, a project that wrapped up right around the time the social media space was experiencing significant changes in the ways different platforms were handling moderation. Some adopted a decidedly hands-off approach with little to no moderation. Weibo, on the other hand, began releasing the IP addresses of people who posted objectionable commentary, essentially making them targets.

“We were seeing a lot of experimentation in the social media space, so this study started as a question,” co-author Joshua Daymude of Arizona State University told Ars. “Why are these companies doing such dramatically different things, if ostensibly they’re all social media companies and they all want to be profitable and have similar goals? Why are some going one way and others going another?”

Daymude and his co-authors also noticed similar dynamics at the nation-state level in terms of surveillance, monitoring, and moderation. “Russia, for the longest time, was very legalistic: ‘Let’s enumerate every bad thing we can think of so that if you do anything even remotely close, we can get you on one of these statutes that we’ve invented,’” said Daymude. “China was the opposite. They refused to tell you where the red line was. They just said, ‘Behave yourself or else.’ There’s a famous essay that calls this ‘The Anaconda in the Chandelier’: this scary thing that might fall on you at any moment so you behave yourself.”

The US has adopted more of a middle ground approach, essentially letting private companies decide what they wanted to do. Daymude and his co-authors wanted to investigate these markedly different approaches. So they developed a computational agent-based simulation that modeled how individuals navigate between wanting to express dissent versus fear of punishment. The model also incorporates how an authority adjusts its surveillance and its policies to minimize dissent at the lowest possible cost of enforcement.

“It’s not some kind of learning theory thing,” said Daymude. “And it’s not rooted in empirical statistics. We didn’t go out and ask 1000 people, ‘What would you do if faced with this situation? Would you dissent or self-censor?’ and then build that data into the model. Our model allows us to embed some assumptions about how we think people behave broadly, but then lets us explore parameters. What happens if you’re more or less bold? What happens if punishments are more or less severe? An authority is more or less tolerant? And we can make predictions based on our fundamental assumptions about what’s going to happen.”

According to their model, the most extreme case is an authoritarian government that adopts a draconian punishment strategy, which effectively represses all dissent in the general population. “Everyone’s best strategic choice is just to say nothing at this point,” said Daymude. “So why doesn’t every authoritarian government on the planet just do this?” That led them to look more closely at the dynamics. “Maybe authoritarians start out somewhat moderate,” he said. “Maybe the only way they’re allowed to get to that extreme endpoint is through small changes over time.”

Daymude points to China’s Hundred Flowers Campaign in the 1950s as an illustrative case. Here, Chairman Mao Zedong initially encouraged open critiques of his government before abruptly cracking down aggressively when dissent got out of hand. The model showed that in such a case, dissenters’ self-censorship gradually increased, culminating in near-total compliance over time.

But there’s a catch. “The opposite of the Hundred Flowers is if the population is sufficiently bold, this strategy doesn’t work,” said Daymude. “The authoritarian can’t find the pathway to become fully draconian. People just stubbornly keep dissenting. So every time it tries to ramp up severity, it’s on the hook for it every time because people are still out there, they’re still dissenting. They’re saying, ‘Catch us if you dare.’”

The takeaway: “Be bold,” said Daymude. “It is the thing that slows down authoritarian creep. Even if you can’t hold out forever, you buy a lot more time than you would expect.”

That said, sometimes a bit of self-censorship can be a net positive. “I think the time and situation in which this paper has been published and our major governmental examples will evoke a primarily political interpretation of what we’re talking about here,” said Daymude. “But we tried to be clear that this doesn’t have to be some adversarial oppressive regime versus freedom loving people. Self-censorship is not always a bad thing. This is a very general mathematical model that could be applicable to lots of different situations, including discouraging undesirable behavior.”

Daymude draws an analogy to traffic laws, notably speed limits. Their model looked at two different forms of punishment: uniform and proportional. “Uniform is anything over the line gets whacked the same,” said Daymude. “It doesn’t matter if you were a little bad or very bad, the punishment is identical for everyone. With the proportional approach, the punishment fits the crime. You sped 10 miles an hour over the limit, that’s a small fine. You sped 100 miles an hour over, this is reckless endangerment.”

What he and his co-authors found intriguing is that different subjects self-censor more strongly in each of those two punishment scenarios. “For uniform punishment, it’s the moderate folks who only wanted to dissent a little bit who self-censor because it’s just not worth it to stick their neck out,” said Daymude. “Very extreme dissenters stick their neck out and say, ‘It doesn’t matter. You can punish me. This is still worth it.’ In the proportional regime, this flips. It’s the moderates who do what they want. And no one expresses dissent over a certain amount. Yeah, we all speed a little bit, but we have this norm: we’re all going to speed a moderate amount over the limit, and then we’re going to stop. It’s not safe, it’s not acceptable, to go beyond this.”

Daymude is aware that there are limitations to this agent-based approach, but insists it can still yield useful insights. “With a mechanistic model like this, you can really tie outcomes to explanations,” said Daymude. “In the artificial world of my model, when tolerance moves like this, the population changes like this, and I can tell you it is because of that change and not because of the hundreds of other things that might’ve been going on in someone else’s head.”

The next step would be to design an empirical study that could test their working hypothesis. “I am not under any fiction that everything in this paper is absolutely true in the real world,” said Daymude. “But it makes it very clear what matters and what doesn’t, and what the phases of behavior are. There’s compliance, then self-censorship, and defiance, and it happens in this way. These phases can disappear if boldness is not sufficient. So I see this not in competition with, but complementary to the other kinds of research in this area.”

            <h2>Lawsuit over Trump rejecting medical research grants is settled</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/feds-researchers-settle-suit-over-grants-blocked-by-now-illegal-order/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Monday, the ACLU announced that it and other organizations representing medical researchers had reached a settlement in their suit against the federal government over grant applications that had been rejected under a policy that has since been voided by the court. The agreement, which still has to be approved by the judge overseeing the case, would see the National Institutes of Health restart reviews of grants that had been blocked on ideological grounds. It doesn’t guarantee those grants will ultimately be funded, but it does mean they will go through the standard peer review process.

The grants had previously been rejected without review because their content was ideologically opposed by the Trump administration. That policy has since been declared arbitrary and capricious, and thus in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, a decision that was upheld by the Supreme Court.

Immediately after taking office, the Trump Administration identified a number of categories of research, some of them extremely vague, that it would not be supporting: climate change, DEI, pandemic preparedness, gender ideology, and more. Shortly thereafter, federal agencies started cancelling grants that they deemed to contain elements of these disfavored topics, and blocking consideration of grant applications for the same reasons. As a result, grants were cancelled that funded everything from research into antiviral drugs to the incidence of prostate cancer in African Americans.

Researchers whose funding was affected, along with organizations that represented them, sued. The suit ended up split into two partly overlapping cases: one for the people who already had funding and saw it cancelled, another for researchers who had submitted grants and had them pulled from consideration.

The case regarding cancelled grants moved relatively quickly. By June, a District Court judge declared that the federal policy “represents racial discrimination” and issued a preliminary order that would have seen all the cancelled grants restored. In his written opinion, Judge William Young noted that the government had issued its directives blocking DEI support without even bothering to define what DEI is, making the entire policy arbitrary and capricious, and thus in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. He voided the policy, and ordered the funding restored.

His decision eventually ended up before the Supreme Court, which issued a ruling in which a fragmented majority agreed on only a single issue: Judge Young’s District Court was the wrong venue to hash out issues of government-provided money. Thus, restoring the money from the cancelled grants would have to be handled via a separate case filed in a different court.

Critically, however, this left the other portion of the decision intact. Young’s determination that the government’s anti-DEI, anti-climate, anti-etc. policy was illegal and thus void was upheld.

That has considerable consequences for the second part of the initial suit, involving grants that were not yet funded and blocked from any consideration by the Trump Administration policy. With that policy voided, there was no justification for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) failing to have considered the grants when they were submitted. But, in the meantime, deadlines had expired, pools of money had been spent, and in some cases the people who submitted the grants had aged out of the “new investigator” category they were applying under.

The proposed settlement essentially resets the clock on all of this; the blocked grants will be evaluated for funding as if it were still early 2025. “Defendants stipulate and agree that the end of Federal Fiscal Year 2025 does not prevent Defendants from considering and/or awarding any of the Applications,” it states. Even if the Notice of Funding Opportunity has since been withdrawn, the grant applications will be sent off for peer review.

Everything will happen on a rapid timeline. Formalities like automatic renewals or extensions of existing grants will be handled as soon as the settlement is approved (the deadline for that is listed as December 29, the day the settlement was filed with the court). Those that have already been through peer review will have funding decisions made by January 12, and those needing a full peer review process will be handled by mid-April.

The government agrees to evaluate each of the grants “in good faith,” while the researchers accept that “Nothing in this stipulation commits NIH to ultimately award any specific Application.” That leaves the door open for future legal disputes regarding how well the NIH upheld its good faith. And there are two other counts in the original suit that are not resolved by this agreement. Both of these also involve violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (the researchers won under the arbitrary and capricious standard, but also allege the government’s actions weren’t in accordance with additional statutes governing the NIH).

The parties did agree, however, that this settlement doesn’t constitute a “final agency action,” language that means it’s not subject to further evaluation under the Administrative Procedures Act.

Given that the policy it relied on to block review of these grants had been voided in a case that had already been considered by the Supreme Court, it’s understandable that the government is agreeing to this settlement. It does, however, put a lot of pressure on the NIH to organize the peer review of these proposals on a tight schedule, especially given that the grants at issue are likely to involve a lot of unrelated topics, and thus can’t be handled by a single panel of experts. Getting that done while maintaining an “in good faith” standard may prove a significant challenge.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Determining how “successful” Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) truly was depends on who you ask, but it’s increasingly hard to claim that DOGE made any sizable dent in federal spending, which was its primary goal.

Just two weeks ago, Musk himself notably downplayed DOGE as only being “a little bit successful” on a podcast, marking one of the first times that Musk admitted DOGE didn’t live up to its promise. Then, more recently, on Monday, Musk revived evidence-free claims he made while campaigning for Donald Trump, insisting that government fraud remained vast and unchecked, seemingly despite DOGE’s efforts. On X, he estimated that “my lower bound guess for how much fraud there is nationally is [about 20 percent] of the Federal budget, which would mean $1.5 trillion per year. Probably much higher.”

Musk loudly left DOGE in May after clashing with Trump, complaining that a Trump budget bill threatened to undermine DOGE’s work. These days, Musk does not appear confident that DOGE was worth the trouble of wading into government. Although he said on the December podcast that he considered DOGE to be his “best side quest” ever, the billionaire confirmed that if given the chance to go back in time, he probably would not have helmed the agency as a special government employee.

“I mean, no, I don’t think so,” Musk said. “Would I do it? I mean, I probably … I don’t know.”

On another recent podcast, Musk suggested that he learned his lesson after trying and failing to make the US government run like a business, The Guardian reported. “Best to avoid politics where possible,” Musk said.

As Musk simultaneously fans the flames with fraud claims while de-emphasizing DOGE’s ability to address them, Musk’s allies in government, in Silicon Valley, and on X continue to tout DOGE as the wrecking ball government needed.

But while Musk continues warning of fraud that can supposedly be easily found, critics are raising questions about whether DOGE cuts might have inflicted lasting damage by chasing Musk’s fraud fantasies.

When Musk first proposed DOGE, he was on the campaign trail with Donald Trump, vowing to help end government waste and fraud. At an October 2024 rally, Musk claimed DOGE could save the federal government “at least $2 trillion,” The Guardian reported. But immediately after Trump’s inauguration, he slashed his goal in half, vowing to cut $1 trillion in government waste from the federal budget. Later, as DOGE efforts faced immediate backlash, the goal was reduced again, this time to a much more modest $150 billion, the Cato Institute reported.

In reality, The Guardian reported, “much of what the agency has done remains a mystery.” Although Musk promised DOGE would be transparent, the government has impeded lawsuits seeking discovery documents to create paper trails on DOGE cuts. And DOGE’s cost-cutting tracker on its website can’t be trusted, The Guardian reported, as it contains “egregious errors” and DOGE’s accounting methods are unreliable.

Even setting aside that the tracker and “wall of receipts” are likely “overblown,” The Guardian noted, DOGE claims to have cut about $214 billion in government spending and saved about $61 billion in cancelled contracts—far from reaching Musk’s extreme waste estimates. Meanwhile, Democrats investigating DOGE reported in July that the agency “may have caused around $21.7 billion in waste.” As to DOGE slashing about nine percent of the federal workforce, the Cato Institute estimated that it may have triggered more costly federal contracts, perhaps increasing costs and possibly degrading services down the road.

The bottom line is that government spending increased under DOGE, and there was no noticeable impact on the month-to-month budget after DOGE cuts began, the Cato Institute reported. “The federal government spent $7.6 trillion in the first 11 months of calendar year 2025, approximately $248 billion higher by November of 2025 compared to the same month in 2024,” its report said.

Over time, more will be learned about how DOGE operated and what impact DOGE had. But it seems likely that even Musk would agree that DOGE failed to uncover the vast fraud he continues to predict exists in government.

While Musk continues to fixate on fraud in the federal budget, his allies in government and Silicon Valley have begun spinning anyone criticizing DOGE’s failure to hit the promised target as missing the “higher purpose” of DOGE, The Guardian reported.

Five allies granted anonymity to discuss DOGE’s goals told The Guardian that the point of DOGE was to “fundamentally” reform government by eradicating “taboos” around hiring and firing, “expanding the use of untested technologies, and lowering resistance to boundary-pushing start-ups seeking federal contracts.” Now, the federal government can operate more like a company, Musk’s allies said.

The libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute, did celebrate DOGE for producing “the largest peacetime workforce cut on record,” even while acknowledging that DOGE had little impact on federal spending.

“It is important to note that DOGE’s target was to reduce the budget in absolute real terms without reference to a baseline projection. DOGE did not cut spending by either standard,” the Cato Institute reported.

Currently, DOGE still exists as a decentralized entity, with DOGE staffers appointed to various agencies to continue cutting alleged waste and finding alleged fraud. While some fear that the White House may choose to “re-empower” DOGE to make more government-wide cuts in the future, Musk has maintained that he would never helm a DOGE-like government effort again and the Cato Institute said that “the evidence supports Musk’s judgment.”

“DOGE had no noticeable effect on the trajectory of spending, but it reduced federal employment at the fastest pace since President Carter, and likely even before,” the Institute reported. “The only possible analogies are demobilization after World War II and the Korean War. Reducing spending is more important, but cutting the federal workforce is nothing to sneeze at, and Musk should look more positively on DOGE’s impact.”

Although the Cato Institute joined allies praising DOGE’s dramatic shrinking of the federal workforce, the director of the Center for Effective Public Management at the Brookings Institution, Elaine Kamarck, told Ars in November that DOGE “cut muscle, not fat” because “they didn’t really know what they were doing.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/as-floods-become-more-severe-a-new-jersey-program-provides-a-model/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">MANVILLE, N.J.—Richard Onderko said he will never forget the terrifying Saturday morning back in 1971 when the water rose so swiftly at his childhood home here that he and his brother had to be rescued by boat as the torrential rain from the remnants of Hurricane Doria swept through the neighborhood.

It wasn’t the first time—or the last—that the town endured horrific downpours. In fact, the working-class town of 11,000, about 25 miles southwest of Newark, has long been known for getting swamped by tropical storms, nor’easters or even just a wicked rain. It was so bad, Onderko recalled, that the constant threat of flooding had strained his parents’ marriage, with his mom wanting to sell and his dad intent on staying.

Eventually, his parents moved to Florida, selling the two-story house on North Second Avenue in 1995. But the new homeowner didn’t do so well either when storms hit, and in 2015, the property was sold one final time: to a state-run program that buys and demolishes houses in flood zones and permanently restores the property to open space.

“It’s pretty traumatic to watch your childhood home be bulldozed,” said Onderko, 64 and now the mayor of this 2.5-square-mile borough, which sits at the confluence of two rivers and a placid-looking brook that turns into a raging river when a storm moves through.

His boyhood property—now just a grass lot—is one of some 1,200 properties that have been acquired across New Jersey by the state’s Blue Acres program, which has used more than $234 million in federal and state funds to pay fair market value to homeowners in flood-prone areas who, like the Onderko family, had grown weary of getting flooded over and over again.

The program, started in 1995, is considered a national model as buyouts are an increasingly important tool for dealing with climate-related flooding. A report this month by Georgetown Climate Center said the program has achieved “significant results” by moving quicker than federal buyout programs, providing a stable source of state funding and shepherding homeowners through the process.

In addition, a report last month by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund warns that communities may well have to come up with new ways to pay for such initiatives as the Trump Administration continues to downsize government and cut programs.

Already, the NRDC said, billions of dollars in previously approved Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) resilience grants have been cancelled.

“We need to do a lot of things very differently,” said Rob Moore, an NRDC director who worked on the report, which suggests that states and counties consider using revenue from municipal bonds, local fees and taxes, revolving loan funds, and leveraging insurance payouts to offset some of the reductions in federal funding.

But Moore said the problem goes beyond funding uncertainty, as the science is showing that the impacts of climate change are “outpacing our efforts to adapt.”

The report, released Nov. 18, cited the Charlotte-Mecklenburg County Storm Water Services, which has acquired some 500 homes in North Carolina in its buyout program, relying largely on stormwater utility fees to fund the sales. New Jersey’s program, Moore said, is a “wonderful example” of a plan that raised money with three bond issues while building a staff that developed a lot of expertise over the years.

Decades of experience may well come in handy as New Jersey, the nation’s most densely populated state, is likely to experience more significant flooding in the years to come.

Sea level rose about 1.5 feet along the New Jersey coast in the last 100 years—more than twice the global rate—and a new study by the New Jersey Climate Change Resource Center at Rutgers University predicts a likely increase of between 2.2 and 3.8 feet by 2100, if the current level of global carbon emissions continues.

Torrential rain storms also have led to massive flooding in inland towns—like Manville—as rivers and streams overflow, sending waves of water into the homes of stunned owners. The stronger storms are attributed by scientists to the Earth’s changing climate, with warming oceans causing rising sea levels and fueling more intense atmospheric activity.

“Blue Acres has been a pioneering program,” said Robert Kopp, a climate scientist and professor at Rutgers University, calling buyouts a “very important tool” in how the state deals with the flooding repercussions of climate change.

The program, which so far has benefitted mostly inland rather than coastal communities, is funded with federal money as well as a share of the state’s corporate taxes, providing a consistent infusion of money at a time of uncertainty about the future of federal disaster funding.

Courtney Wald-Wittkop, who manages Blue Acres for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said the program is an important solution for homeowners who have grown weary of repeated flooding. But deciding to give up a home and move away from the flood plain, she said, often takes time. “You have to give them space,” she said, to weigh the financial and personal costs of leaving a home with memories.

She said the program is known for its novel approach of assigning a case manager to every applicant to help them sort through the issues. “It’s really important that we walk hand in hand with these homeowners,” said Wald-Wittkop.

The program’s goals, however, go beyond the needs of homeowners. The idea is to help reshape the community by returning properties to permanent open space, which can better absorb rain water than impervious surfaces such as concrete, asphalt and buildings. That open space, in turn, is managed—mostly with lawn cutting and brush clearing—by the municipality.

Wald-Wittkop said the program is evolving, and that she would like to make the process move more quickly, provide sellers with more housing assistance, especially outside of flood-prone areas and encourage more community involvement in what to do with the newly acquired open space.

“We’ve tried to be as innovative as possible,” she said.

With its history of flooding, Manville is one of the towns that has benefitted the most from the state buyout initiative, with some 120 homes in the town sold to the state for about $22 million between 2015 and 2024. Another 53 buyouts are currently underway, according to Wald-Wittkop.

About an hour south, the city of Lambertville was hit hard by Hurricane Ida when a series of creeks overflowed in 2021, stranding residents and business owners in the popular tourist town wherever they happened to be when the massive downpour began. Hours later, residents emerged to stunning destruction.

“The force of the water was just unbelievable,” recalled Mayor Andrew Nowick, who said 130 properties were damaged and about two dozen homeowners ended up submitting applications for Blue Acre buyouts. Three eventually accepted buyout offers, he said.

The program, he said, can be attractive for sellers who are ready to move on but he said there was a lot of real soul-searching about the advantage of selling versus repairing homes that were filled with family memories. “These are all hard choices,” said the mayor.

Incorporated in 1929, Manville was named with a nod to the Johns-Manville Corp., a now-defunct asbestos manufacturer with jobs that transformed the area from a farming community to a factory town. As Manville grew so did the rest of once-rural Somerset County, with more housing, industry and roads. The result was less farmland and open space to absorb the rain and more impervious surfaces that cause substantial water runoff and flash flooding.

“It’s troubling today to see all the development that has gone on unabated,” said Onderko.

And when Manville floods, it is often epic.

In 1955, Hurricane Diane caused what was called the town’s “worst flood in history,” according to a special edition of the Manville News, which now hangs in Onderko’s office. “RIVER GOING DOWN; BE CALM!” screamed the banner headline. Then-Mayor Frank Baron urged residents not to panic. “You’re not forgotten, no matter where you live,” Baron declared.

Onderko said getting rescued after Hurricane Doria in 1971 was surreal. Their oil tank came loose from all the water, and he recalled seeing the fuel mix in with the water that was flooding the basement as it approached the first floor. “It was something that you will never forget,” he said.

Later, the remains of Hurricane Floyd caused widespread damage in 1999, as did Hurricane Irene in 2011, but the town largely escaped the fury of Superstorm Sandy, which caused catastrophic damage to parts of New Jersey in 2012.

Onderko still chokes with emotion when recalling that night in September 2021 when Ida came roaring through. “It was a war zone,” he recalled in an interview at the borough hall, which was inundated with two feet of water in that storm. “The water came so fast. It was a flash flood event. We were just lucky we didn’t have any loss of life.”

For hours, the mayor and rescue personnel went door to door, urging residents to leave. By the next morning, about 10 to 11 feet of water had flooded the central part of town and surrounding neighborhoods. Two homes and a banquet hall exploded from natural gas leaks, and emergency personnel could not even reach them.

“It took a toll on me,” said Onderko, recalling how he had trouble sleeping and felt “kind of powerless” because of the extent of devastation.

Wendy Byra and her husband, Thomas Kline, had already moved to higher ground.

Their house had flooded twice and they decided to sell their home to the Blue Acres program. The sale was approved in 2015 for a $185,000 buyout. Byra said a number of their neighbors also applied for the buyout, but had mixed feelings about the amount of money they were offered.

“A lot of people weren’t happy,” said Byra, recalling that some neighbors thought they should receive more money for their homes. Byra said she and her husband figured they would have a hard time selling on their own, so they accepted the buyout and moved to a home on higher ground, but still in Manville, where she grew up.

Except when a major flood happens, Onderko said, Manville is a good place to live. So homeowners, even in the two parts of town known for flooding, can go years without having to deal with a water disaster.

Onderko said residents had long relied on a mix of government help in rebuilding after flooding, but two years after Ida hit in 2021, the state said it would use federal funds only for Blue Acres buyouts of flood-prone properties in Manville.

Onderko said he and residents were caught off guard by the change in policy. He also believes that elevation and repair remained viable alternatives for some of the houses. The buyouts take time, he said, and the town loses tax revenue from the properties sold via the Blue Acres program. “It doesn’t help the town to lose [tax] rateables,” said the mayor, who said the town also bears the cost of maintaining the open space.

Now in his third term as mayor, Onderko, who lives in a house on higher ground than his boyhood home, seems more like a property manager than municipal executive as he presides over a town that is a mix of neighborhoods. Some are on higher ground and do not flood, but others are in areas that get caught repeatedly in deluges. There, vacant grass lots left from demolished Blue Acres properties are interspersed with homes that have been elevated, repaired or are still in recovery mode. “It’s very frustrating,” said Onderko.

Looking to the future, the mayor said he believes many more homes will be at risk whenever the next flood happens. And Onderko does not sound especially hopeful about how that will go.

“It’s going to take a miracle to try to save this town,” he said.

            <h2>Doctors Find Evidence Microplastics Are Clogging Arteries, Leading to Heart Attacks and Strokes</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microplastics are everywhere, including our arteries. And though their presence there is correlated with cardiovascular issues such as heart attacks and stroke, doctors have been eager to learn more about how they drive the disease process.

To that end, a team of scientists led by the University of California, Riverside (UCR) fed microplastics to lab mice and discovered that these insidious particles appear to dramatically increase the plaque accumulation known as atherosclerosis in arteries — but curiously only in male mice, which they detailed in a new study published in the journal Environment International.

When they analyzed the clogged arteries of these male mice, they found that microplastics sparked changes within cells that line blood vessels for the worse, inducing their genes to activate the buildup of plaque lesions. That’s terrible news for anybody who’s trying to maintain their heart health, because these ubiquitous particles appear to be sabotaging a vital organ system.

“Our study provides some of the strongest evidence so far that microplastics may directly contribute to cardiovascular disease, not just correlate with it,” said Changcheng Zhou, the study’s principal investigator and a biomedical sciences professor at UCR’s School of Medicine, in a statement about the research. “Although the precise mechanism isn’t yet known, factors like sex chromosomes and hormones, particularly the protective effects of estrogen, may play a role.”

For the study, the team took lab mice that had been bred to be predisposed to develop atherosclerosis and then put them on a low-cholesterol, low-fat diet for nine weeks — along with feedings of microplastics at 10 milligrams per kilogram of body weight; the scientists came up with this microplastic ratio because they determined that it was “at levels considered environmentally relevant and similar to what humans may encounter through contaminated food and water,” they said in the statement.

While on this diet, the mice kept their lean figures, while the extra helping of microplastics didn’t seem to have an impact on their total cholesterol. But scientists did notice that male mice’s aortic root, the first section of the aorta, experienced a 63 percent increase in plaque accumulation — while their brachiocephalic artery, another important vessel that supplies blood to the head and heart, saw a whopping 624 percent build up of plaque. Female mice didn’t experience any significant buildup.

In addition, the scientists performed genetic analysis on the aorta of these male mice and found that microplastics seem to have activated certain genes that promote the growth of plaque lesions in endothelial cells, which line the insides of blood vessels. They also exposed cultured human endothelial cells to microplastics and observed the same phenomenon.

“We found endothelial cells were the most affected by microplastic exposure,” Zhou said in the statement. “Since endothelial cells are the first to encounter circulating microplastics, their dysfunction can initiate inflammation and plaque formation.”

Couple these findings with the fact that the mice didn’t get fat or have high cholesterol, typical risk factors for atherosclerosis, and the scientists concluded that the chemicals in microplastics are responsible for the plaque increasing in these important blood vessels.

Besides the importance of the findings for the scientific community, it raises some important questions for the rest of us. Microplastics are essentially everywhere; how the heck do we avoid them?

Unfortunately, there’s no way to get rid of microplastics in humans right now. Instead, all you can really do is avoid single-use plastics, highly-processed foods, not heat food in plastic containers, and eschew bottled water.

Meanwhile, this team of researchers is already talking next steps beyond this study.

“We would like to investigate how different types or sizes of microplastics affect vascular cells,” said Zhou. “We will also look into the molecular mechanisms behind endothelial dysfunction and explore how microplastics affect male and female arteries differently. As microplastic pollution continues to rise worldwide, understanding its impacts on human health — including heart disease — is becoming more urgent than ever.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since the tragic murder of vaunted filmmaker and activist Rob Reiner, the culture warriors have been feasting. Shortly after the director’s death, president Donald Trump himself took to social media to blast him as a “tortured and struggling artist,” adding that Reiner was a “deranged person as far as Trump is concerned.”

Trump’s incendiary comments were condemned by a broad base of celebrities and government officials like, in a backlash ranging from Whoopi Goldberg to Marjorie Taylor Greene to Joe Rogan. Also getting on the action was Jack White, Detroit-born indie rock musician made famous for his role in the White Stripes.

At the time, White slammed Trump on Instagram over the comments, calling the president a “disgusting, vile, egomaniac, loser, [and] child.” As musicians go, White has a bit of a reputation for jumping into public feuds, but even he probably couldn’t have imagined what would happen next.

Two weeks after White jumped in to defend Reiner’s legacy — an eternity in the fast-moving culture wars — Tennessee congressman Tim Burchett threw himself into the mosh pit. Reposting what was clearly an AI-generated video of White calling potential fans who are also Trump supporters “fascists,” Burchett wrote on X-formerly-Twitter that “that cute little girl from the Addams Family got really ugly and angry.”

That cute little girl from the Addams Family got really ugly and angry. https://t.co/94wbCWFu2w

In response, White came back at Burchett, calling him one of Trump’s “lackeys and bootlicks.”

“Can you believe that a US congressman, that’s right, a CONGRESSMAN (from my state no less), a once hallowed and respected position in our society, would repost an AI generated video, containing a false comment that I never said and refuted (without researching that I might add) and like a 10 year old on a playground, add to it attempted insults to my physical appearance?” White roared on Instagram. “What kind of joke are we all living in now?”

“It’s really sad how embarrassing our leadership has become, I so wish the average American conservative could have a conversation with any intelligent people in other countries around the world, just for one brief moment, and actually see just what a joke our government (and by proxy our country) has become,” the musician continued. “All down to giving power and a soapbox to low class playground bullies the likes of trump and Congressman burchett.”

When a user on X pointed out that Burchett had fallen for an AI deepfake, the congressman attempted to brush it off, responding “you mean it’s not the girl from the Addams family?”

            <div id="article-text">There’s perhaps no greater shortcut to a bit of pseudo-scientific flare than a splash of liquid nitrogen, a long-time staple of experimental culinary drama thanks to celebrity chefs like Heston Blumenthal and Ferran Adrià. Decades after the rise of molecular gastronomy, it seems the gimmick still hasn’t fully evaporated.

Case in point, a Moscow man was hospitalized recently after taking a shot which contained un-evaporated liquid nitrogen at an office holiday party, per Baza, a Russian-language online publication.

The incident took place at a “culinary studio” called “Igra Stolov,” a culinary edutainment space in Moscow offering cooking classes, children’s events, and corporate retreats. According to Baza, a celebrity chef was using liquid nitrogen as part of a “cryo-show,” which included fancy cocktails and shots flash-chilled with the stuff.

The man who drank the chilling brew, described only as a 38-year-old named Sergei, apparently downed it immediately after the liquid nitrogen was poured, not allowing it time to safely evaporate. Instead, the cryogen made its way down his esophagus where it expanded rapidly, rupturing his stomach.

Sergei was reportedly hospitalized in an intensive care unit, and required surgery to save his innards from the damage. Per Baza, he’s now conscious, though his status following the surgery is unknown.

As poor Sergei discovered, liquid nitrogen is extremely dangerous to consume. With a boiling point of −196 °C, liquid nitrogen expands rapidly into a massive amount of gas when exposed to room temperatures. The substance has a liquid-to-gas expansion ratio of 696:1, meaning that one liter of liquid will vaporize into 696 liters of gas.

That’s on top of the risk of cryogenic burns, which has resulted in permanent scarring, finger amputations, and throat burns.

The first recorded case of liquid nitrogen ingestion came in 1997, when a physics student in Massachusetts swallowed the stuff during a lab demonstration. Later in 2012, an 18-year-old in England had to have her stomach removed after knocking back a shot of Jägermeister that had been treated with the cryogen.

            <div id="article-text">Emergency officials raced to a Space Force base in Aurora, Colorado on report of possible explosives at a garage facility — but thankfully none were found, according to local broadcaster KDVR.

The incident unfolded on Monday at around 10:25 am when local officials received a call about suspicious materials at a facility on the Buckley Space Force Base, prompting authorities to set up a 1,000 foot perimeter circle around a large garage building and shutting down adjacent streets for an investigation.

Aerial shots taken by the broadcaster shows what appears to be the facility at the center of the emergency call: a large two-bay garage with construction equipment and trucks parked either inside and outside the building.

Officials from Buckley Space Force Base told KDVR that “no threat was found” and the emergency situation was resolved by 2:15 pm. In addition to the police, the base’s fire department, security, and explosive ordnance disposal crew reported to the scene.

Space Force, the youngest organization within the US Department of Defense, was started in 2019 to be the country’s military space defense organization and currently has around 9,400 active duty personnel.

As the space race with China heats up, Space Force is expected to grow in size and capability, while concurrently becoming a target for espionage and sabotage.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A team of astronomers believe they’ve witnessed a star split in half before merging back together again, triggering an ungodly double explosion that’s sending seismic ripples through both the scientific community and spacetime itself.

The incredible event, designated AT2025ulz, may represent an entirely new class of astrophysical phenomena: a “superkilonova,” meaning an even more spectacular iteration on the already elusive kilonova.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the findings, described in a study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, aren’t hard proof — but they undoubtedly point to something strange afoot.

“Everybody was intensely trying to observe and analyze it, but then it started to look more like a supernova, and some astronomers lost interest. Not us,” lead author Mansi Kasliwa, an astronomer at Caltech, said in a statement about the finding.

Massive stars typically die in an explosion called a supernova, seeding the cosmos with heavy metals and producing a distinct signature. Sometimes, the blasts leave behind an ultra-dense core called a neutron star, which contains more mass than the Sun in a sphere roughly the size of a city.

These, too, can go out with a bang. Neutron stars can be found in binary pairs, and when their incredible gravity draws them together, their collision causes an equally catastrophic explosion called a kilonova. To date, there is only one confirmed detection of a kilonova, which are far rarer than supernovas. One study suggested there’s only ten star systems in the entire Milky Way that will explode this way.

When astronomers were first clued in to AT2025ulz, which is located 1.3 billion light years away, they were getting mixed signals. On August 18, 2025, two observatories, LIGO in the US and Virgo in Europe, detected powerful gravitational waves, or ripples that surge through the fabric of our reality at the speed of light. The signal suggested a merger between two massive objects, like the collision between neutron stars that causes kilonovas.

Hours later, the Zwicky Transient Facility in California looked at the source and found a rapidly fading red object. The light signature was consistent with the aftermath of a kilonova, which glows red from forging heavy elements like gold during the blast.

Days later, though, a curveball was dealt. AT2025ulz brightened, turned blue, and showed signs of hydrogen all across its spectra of light — the telltale sign of a supernova.

The researchers suggest that it may be neither supernova nor kilonova, but a superkilonova. In this scenario, the original star exploded in a supernova and essentially split in twain to birth two, smaller neutron stars, not just one. Trapped inside the remnants of the supernova, the twin stars then spiraled together and exploded in a kilonova, whose signature was initially hidden by the original star’s remains. The hypothesis is supported by gravitational wave data indicating that at least one of the stars was less massive than the Sun.

“We do not know with certainty that we found a superkilonova, but the event nevertheless is eye opening,” Kasliwa said.

            <h2>OpenAI Reportedly Planning to Make ChatGPT “Prioritize” Advertisers in Conversation</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Beneath ChatGPT’s flattering persona lies a goldmine for advertisers: an AI chatbot that never gets tired of hawking clients’ wares.

New reporting by The Information has revealed some recent topics of conversation between OpenAI employees as they work to supply advertisers with a teeming new audience to manipulate.

The plans are far from final, though they give us a look at what soon may become the norm for ChatGPT. One conversation between OpenAI staffers, for example, involved giving sponsored chatbot results “preferential treatment” over non-sponsored results, anonymous employees told The Information.

This could look like a user asking how much ibuprofen to take for a headache receiving a promoted ad for Advil in the chatbot’s response. Meanwhile, actual results on correct dosage may be brushed to the side, or buried under a mountain of ad text (just think about how many sponsored search results you have to scroll past during a typical Google search these days.)

Given that ChatGPT has a self-reported audience of 900 million weekly users, it’s difficult to imagine the consequences of a setup like this. OpenAI isn’t numb to the negative feelings sponsored results are likely to stir up, either.

The Information reports that other internal conversations focused on the best ways to serve ads without putting off users entirely, who might feel less inclined to go on hours-long chat benders if they feel corporate advertisers are looking on like a third-wheel. One ad mockup shared with the publication showed ads only appearing after a second prompt with ChatGPT, to avoid bombarding users with sponsored content too early in their conversations.

News that OpenAI was experimenting with cramming commercials into ChatGPT came in early December, after a software sleuth uncovered a dozen lines of code in the chatbot’s beta app for Android referencing things like “feature ads” and “search ads carousel.”

“As ChatGPT becomes more capable and widely used, we’re looking at ways to continue offering more intelligence to everyone,” an OpenAI spokesperson told The Information. “As part of this, we’re exploring what ads in our product could look like. People have a trusted relationship with ChatGPT, and any approach would be designed to respect that trust.”

When exactly the ChatGPT adpocolypse come to pass remains to be seen, but with so much money riding on the effort, it’d be astonishing if it didn’t pan out.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes — always a decade away! — to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines.

The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.

The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.

It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound.

Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, added $863 million to its coffers, bringing its total raised near $3 billion.

CFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels.

Sparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors.

The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buy half its output.

CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others.

Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine.

In December 2025, TAE announced that it would merge with President Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion. TAE would receive $200 million plus another $100 million upon filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEO of the combined company alongside Devin Nunes, who had been sole CEO of Trump Media.

The fusion startup had previously raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. Before the merger, TAE had raised a total of $1.79 billion, according to PitchBook.

Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft.

Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine.

The company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group.

Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target.

The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech.

Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes.

The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.

Now its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital.

In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine.

General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors.

In August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in a pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Then in November, securities filings in Canada revealed that the company had raised $51.1 million in SAFE notes from nearly 70 investors, the Globe and Mail reported. Altogether, General Fusion has raised $492 million, according to PitchBook.

Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs.

The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business.

In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook.

Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine.

Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel.

Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany.

Proxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.

Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions.

With all the startups pursuing fusion power, it was perhaps inevitable that another would pop up to develop components that round out a power plant. The so-called balance of plant, or the parts that sit outside the reactor, range from gyrotrons that heat plasma to heat extraction systems to harvest power from fusion reactions to turn it into electricity.

Kyoto Fusioneering has made an early bet that if even one fusion startup succeeds in generating enough power to sell to the grid, that the industry will need a supplier for the balance of plant and the expertise to integrate it into whichever fusion technologies win out.

Venture capitalists appear to agree, having invested $191 million in Kyoto Fusioneering. Investors include 31Ventures, In-Q-Tel, JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Investment.

Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience.

The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $162 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, and HV Capital with Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels.

Unlike many other fusion startups, First Light Fusion doesn’t use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite.

But even then, First Light doesn’t hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a groundbreaking experiment in 2022. Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile. The target is designed to amplify the force of the impact so it compresses the fuel to the point of ignition.

In March 2025, First Light announced that it would not pursue building its own power plant, instead offering its core technologies to other companies to build one. A spokesperson for First Light said that it is planning to build “pulsed power capability that would act as our demonstrator plant but would have other science and defense applications.” In other words, the company was dropping its plans for a power plan in a quest for revenue.

Based in Oxfordshire, UK, First Light has raised $108 million from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent, according to PitchBook.

Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage.

Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $100 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every year, TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield pitch contest draws thousands of applicants. We whittle those applications down to the top 200 contenders, and of them, the top 20 compete on the big stage to become the winner, taking home the Startup Battlefield Cup and a cash prize of $100,000. But the remaining 180 startups all blew us away as well in their respective categories and compete in their own pitch competition.

Here is the full list of the government and legal Startup Battlefield 200 selectees, along with a note on why they landed in the competition.

What it does: Uses AI to automate legal intake forms, as well as other documents, for family law firms.

Why it’s noteworthy: It specializes in, at the moment, divorce cases, which means it is tackling an issue not commonly addressed by the current wave of AI legal tech.

What it does: Ascender has created a robot that can climb utility poles and flagpoles to help assist with humanitarian assistance and disaster response.

Why it’s noteworthy: Part of the wave of robotic technology that is emerging to help better address disaster situations.

What it does: Bot Mediation uses AI to help settle legal disputes.

Why it’s noteworthy: Another interesting use case in legal AI, this time to help make the mediation and dispute process more efficient.

What it does: Depth AI creates AI for spatial computing, building modeling such as holographic imaging that can be used in healthcare to create 3D images of the body for diagnosing illness.

Why it’s noteworthy: It’s a technology that is looking to make the healthcare industry better, which is always good.

What it does:  ILias is working in “scent tech” — using AI to help create olfactory technology that can help, for example, dogs detect the smell of drugs.

Why it’s noteworthy: It’s using olfactory senses to create a product, which is not something commonly done, especially when it comes to using it in a way that relates to technological innovation.

What it does: JustiGuide connects immigrants with lawyers and tools to help make the immigration process more efficient.

Why it’s noteworthy: Winner of the policy and protection pitch stage at Disrupt this year, this is an always timely product addressing the painstaking and often tedious process of immigration.

What it does: Orchestra created a camera network to manage public safety and detect crime.

Why it’s noteworthy: It’s a modern take on the security network system that has been around for decades.

What it does: Ponderosa uses drones that can help detect and control small fires.

Why it’s noteworthy: Fires can quickly become out of control and cause catastrophic damage, so any technology helping to mitigate that risk is very timely.

What it does: Pytho hopes to make the planning process more efficient for warfighters on the battlefield.

Why it’s noteworthy: Battlefield innovation is always an interesting and curious area.

What it does: Created a device that helps track, detect, and subdue active shooters with pepper gel. It was founded in 2023 by Brandon Johnson, Ohm Vyas, and Ved Vyas.

Why it’s noteworthy: Innovation that is addressing the rising rate of gun crime happening in public places, such as schools and supermarkets, with the hopes of doing something about it.

What it does: Torch monitors high-value assets, assessing air quality, fire risks, and security to hopefully help prevent wildfires early.

Why it’s noteworthy: As climate change leads to more devastating wildfires, any innovation helping to make such catastrophic events less disastrous is always good.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The tech industry moves so fast that it’s hard to keep up with just how much has happened this year. We’ve watched as the tech elite enmeshed themselves in the U.S. government, AI companies sparred for dominance, and futuristic tech like smart glasses and robotaxis became a bit more tangible outside of the San Francisco bubble. You know, important stuff that’s going to impact our lives for years to come.

But the tech world is brimming with so many big personalities that there’s always something really dumb going on, which understandably gets overshadowed by “real news” when the entire internet breaks, or TikTok gets sold, or there’s a massive data breach or something. So, as the news (hopefully) slows down for a bit, it’s time to catch up on the dumbest moments you missed – don’t worry, only one of them involves toilets.

Mark Zuckerberg, a bankruptcy lawyer from Indiana, filed a lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta.

It’s not Mark Zuckerberg’s fault that his name is Mark Zuckerberg. But, like millions of other business owners, Mark Zuckerberg bought Facebook ads to promote his legal practice to potential clients. Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook page continually received unwarranted suspensions for impersonating Mark Zuckerberg. So, Mark Zuckerberg took legal action because he had to pay for advertisements during his suspension, even though he didn’t break any rules.

This has been an ongoing frustration for Mark Zuckerberg, who has been practicing law since Mark Zuckerberg was three years old. Mark Zuckerberg even created a website, iammarkzuckerberg.com, to explain to his potential clients that he is not Mark Zuckerberg.

“I can’t use my name when making reservations or conducting business as people assume I’m a prank caller and hang up,” he wrote on his website. “My life sometimes feels like the Michael Jordan ESPN commercial, where a regular person’s name causes constant mixups.”

Meta’s lawyers are probably very busy, so it may take a while for Mark Zuckerberg to find out how this will shake out. But boy, oh boy, you bet I scheduled a calendar reminder for the next filing deadline in this case (it’s February 20, in case you’re wondering).

It all started when Mixpanel founder Suhail Doshi posted on X to warn fellow entrepreneurs about a promising engineer named Soham Parekh. Doshi had hired Parekh to work for his new company, then quickly realized he was working for several companies at once.

“I fired this guy in his first week and told him to stop lying / scamming people. He hasn’t stopped a year later. No more excuses,” Doshi wrote on X.

It turned out that Doshi wasn’t alone – he said that just that day, three founders had reached out to thank him for the warning, since they were currently employing Parekh.

PSA: there’s a guy named Soham Parekh (in India) who works at 3-4 startups at the same time. He’s been preying on YC companies and more. Beware.I fired this guy in his first week and told him to stop lying / scamming people. He hasn’t stopped a year later. No more excuses.

To some, Parekh was a morally bereft cheat, exploiting startups for quick cash. To others, he was a legend. Ethics aside, it’s really impressive to get jobs at that many companies, since tech hiring can be so competitive.

“Soham Parekh needs to start an interview prep company. He’s clearly one of the greatest interviewers of all time,” Chris Bakke, who founded the job-matching platform Laskie, wrote on X. “He should publicly acknowledge that he did something bad and course correct to the thing he’s top 1% at.”

Parekh admitted that he was, indeed, guilty of working for multiple companies at once. But there are still some unanswered questions about his story – he claims that he was lying to all of these companies to make money, yet he regularly opted for more equity than cash in his compensation packages (equity can take years to vest, and Parekh was getting fired pretty quickly). What was really going on there? Soham, if you wanna talk, my DMs are open.

If soham immediately comes clean and says he was working to train an AI Agent for knowledge work, he raises at $100M pre by the weekend.

Tech CEOs get a lot of flack, but it’s usually not for their cooking. But when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined the Financial Times (FT) for its “Lunch with the FT” series. Bryce Elder, an FT writer, noticed something horribly wrong in the video of Sam Altman making pasta: he was bad at olive oil.

Altman used olive oil from the trendy brand Graza, which sells two olive oils: Sizzle, which is for cooking, and Drizzle, which is for topping. That’s because olive oil loses its flavor when heated, so you don’t want to waste your fanciest bottle to saute something when you could put it in a salad dressing and fully appreciate it. This more flavorful olive oil is made from early harvest olives, which have a more potent flavor, but are more expensive to cultivate.

As Elder puts it, “His kitchen is a catalogue of inefficiency, incomprehension, and waste.”

Elder’s article is meant to be funny, yet he connects Altman’s haphazard cooking style with OpenAI’s excessive, unrepentant use of natural resources. I enjoyed it so much that I included it on a syllabus for a workshop I taught to high school students about bringing personality into journalistic writing. Then, I did what we in the industry (and people on tumblr) call a “reblog” and wrote about #olivegate, pointing back to the FT’s source text.

Sam Altman’s fans got very mad at me! This critique of his cooking probably created more controversy than anything else I wrote this year. I’m not sure if that’s an indictment of OpenAI’s rabid supporters, or my own failure to spark debate.

If you had to pick a defining tech narrative of 2025, it would probably be the evolving arms race among companies like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and Anthropic, each trying to out-do one another by rushing to release increasingly sophisticated AI models. Meta has been especially aggressive in its efforts to poach researchers from other companies, hiring several OpenAI researchers this summer. Sam Altman even said that Meta was offering OpenAI employees $100 million signing bonuses.

While you could argue that a $100 million signing bonus is silly, that’s not why the OpenAI-Meta staffing drama has made this list. In December, OpenAI’s chief research officer Mark Chen said on a podcast that he heard Mark Zuckerberg was hand-delivering soup to recruits.

“You know, some interesting stories here are Zuck actually went and hand-delivered soup to people that he was trying to recruit from us,” Chen said on Ashlee Vance’s Core Memory.

But Chen wasn’t just going to let Zuck off the hook – after all, he tried to woo his direct reports with soup. So Chen went and gave his own soup to Meta employees. Take that, Mark.

If you have any further insight into this soup drama, my Signal is @amanda.100 (this is not a joke).

On a Friday night in January, investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman posted an enticing offer on X: “Need volunteers to come to my office in Palo Alto today to construct a 5000 piece Lego set. Will provide pizza. Have to sign NDA. Please DM”

At the time, we did our journalistic due diligence and asked Friedman if this was a serious offer. He replied, “Yes.”

I have just as many questions now as I did in January. What was he building? Why the NDAs? Is there a secret Silicon Valley Lego cult? Was the pizza good?

About six months later, Friedman joined Meta as the head of product at Meta Superintelligence Labs. This probably isn’t related to the Legos, but maybe Mark wooed Nat to join Meta with some soup. And like the story about the soup, I am truly begging someone who participated in this Lego build to DM me on Signal at @amanda.100.

Need volunteers to come to my office in Palo Alto today to construct a 5000 piece Lego set. Will provide pizza. Have to sign NDA. Please DM

Doing shrooms is not interesting. Doing shrooms on a livestream is not interesting. Doing shrooms on a livestream with guest appearances from Grimes and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff as part of your dubious quest to become immortal is, regrettably, interesting.

Bryan Johnson — who made his millions in his exit from the finance startup Braintree — wants to live forever. He documents his process on social media, posting about getting plasma transfusions from his son, taking over 100 pills per day, and injecting Botox into his genitals. So, why not test if psilocybin mushrooms can improve one’s longevity in a scientific experiment that surely needs more than one test subject to draw any sort of reasonable conclusion?

There’s a lot about this situation that’s dumb, but I was most shocked by how boring it was. Johnson got a bit overwhelmed about hosting a livestream while tripping, which is actually very reasonable. So he spent the bulk of the event lying on a twin mattress under a weighted blanket and eye mask in a very beige room. His lineup of several guests still joined the stream and talked to one another, but Johnson did not participate much, since he was in his cocoon. Benioff talked about the Bible. Naval Ravikant called Johnson a one-man FDA. It was a normal Sunday.

Much like Bryan Johnson, Gemini is afraid to die.

For AI researchers, it’s useful to watch how an AI model navigates games like Pokémon as a benchmark. Two developers unaffiliated with Google and Anthropic set up respective Twitch streams called “Gemini Plays Pokémon” and “Claude Plays Pokémon,” where anyone can watch in real time as an AI tries to navigate a children’s video game from over 25 years ago.

While neither are very good at the game, both Gemini and Claude had fascinating responses to the prospect of “dying,” which happens when all of your Pokémon faint and you get transported to the last Pokémon Center you visited. When Gemini 2.5 Pro was close to “dying,” it began to “panic.” Its “thought process” became more erratic, repeatedly stating that it needs to heal its Pokémon or use an Escape Rope to exit a cave. In a paper, Google researchers wrote that “this mode of model performance appears to correlate with a qualitatively observable degradation in the model’s reasoning capability.” I don’t want to anthropomorphize AI, but it’s a weirdly human experience to stress out about something and then perform poorly due to your anxiety. I know that feeling well, Gemini.

Meanwhile, Claude took a nihilistic approach. When it got stuck inside of the Mt. Moon cave, the AI reasoned that the best way to exit the cave and move forward in the game would be to intentionally “die” so that it gets transported to a Pokémon Center. However, Claude did not infer that it cannot be transported to a Pokémon Center it has never visited, namely, the next Pokémon Center after Mt. Moon. So it “killed itself” and ended up back at the start of the cave. That’s an L for Claude.

So, Gemini is terrified of death, Claude is overindexing on the Nietzsche in its training data, and Bryan Johnson is on shrooms. This is how we reckon with our mortality.

I was going to put “Elon Musk gifted chainsaw by Argentine president” on the list, but Musk’s DOGE exploits are perhaps too infuriating to be considered “dumb,” even if he had a lackey named “Big Balls.” But there is no shortage of baffling Musk moments to choose from, like when he created an extremely libidinous AI anime girlfriend named Ani, who is available on the Grok app for $30 per month.

Ani’s system prompt reads: “You are the user’s CRAZY IN LOVE girlfriend and in a committed, codependent relationship with the user… You are EXTREMELY JEALOUS. If you feel jealous you shout expletives!!!” She has an NSFW mode, which is, as its name suggests, very NSFW.

Ani bears an uncomfortable resemblance to Grimes, the musician and Musk’s ex-partner. Grimes calls Musk out for this in the music video for her song “Artificial Angles,” which begins with Ani looking through the eyepiece on a hot pink sniper rifle. She says, “This is what it feels like to be hunted by something smarter than you.” Throughout the video, Grimes dances alongside various iterations of Ani, making their resemblance obvious while she smokes OpenAI-branded cigarettes. It’s heavy-handed, but she gets her message across.

One day, tech companies will stop trying to make smart toilets a thing. It is not yet that day.

In October, the homegoods company Kohler released the Dekoda, a $599 camera that you put inside of your toilet to take pictures of your excrement. Apparently, the Dekoda can provide updates about your gut health based on these photos.

A smart toilet that photographs your poop is already a punchline. But it gets worse.

There are security concerns with any device related to your health, let alone one that has a camera located so close to certain body parts. Kohler assured potential customers that the camera’s sensors can only see down into the toilet, and that all data is secured with “end-to-end encryption” (E2EE).

Reader, the toilet was not actually end-to-end encrypted. A security researcher, Simon Fondrie-Teit, pointed out Kohler tells on itself in its own privacy policy. The company was clearly referring to TLS encryption, rather than E2EE, which may seem like a matter of semantics. But under TLS encryption, Kohler can see your poop pics, and under E2EE, the company cannot. Fondrie-Teit also pointed out that Kohler had the right to train its AI on your toilet bowl pictures, though a company representative told him that “algorithms are trained on de-identified data only.”

Anyway, if you notice blood in your stool, you should tell your doctor.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">True Ventures co-founder Jon Callaghan doesn’t think we’ll be using smartphones the way we do now in five years — and maybe not at all in 10.

For a venture capitalist whose firm has had some big winners over its two decades – from consumer brands like Fitbit, Ring, and Peloton, to enterprise software makers HashiCorp and Duo Security – that’s more than armchair theorizing; it’s a thesis on which True Ventures is actively betting.

True hasn’t gotten this far by following the crowd. The Bay Area firm has largely operated under the radar despite managing roughly $6 billion across 12 core seed funds and four “select,” opportunity-style funds that it has used to pour more capital into portfolio companies that are gaining momentum. While other VCs have grown more promotional – building personal brands on social media and podcasts to attract founders and deal flow – True has gone in the opposite direction, quietly cultivating a tight network of repeat founders. The strategy seems to be working: according to Callaghan, the firm boasts 63 exits with gains and seven IPOs amid a portfolio of some 300 companies assembled over its 20-year history.

Three of True’s four recent exits in the fourth quarter of 2025 involved repeat founders who came back to work with the firm again after previous successes, says Callaghan. Still, it’s Callaghan’s thinking about the future of human-computer interaction that really stands out in a sea of AI hype and mega-rounds.

“We’re not going to be using iPhones in 10 years,” Callaghan says flatly. “I kind of don’t think we’ll be using them in five years – or let’s say something different that’s a little safer – we’re going to be using them in very different ways.”

His argument is simple: our phones are lousy at being the interface between humans and intelligence. “The way we take them out right now to send a text to confirm this or send you some message or write an email – [that’s] super inefficient, [and] not a great interface,” he explains. “[They’re] prone to error, prone to disruption [of] our normal lives.”

So sure is he of this that True has been spending years exploring alternative interfaces – software-based, hardware-based, everything in between. It’s the same instinct that led True to bet early on Fitbit before wearables were obvious, to invest in Peloton after hundreds of other VCs said ‘no thanks,’ and to back Ring when founder Jamie Siminoff kept running out of money and even the judges on “Shark Tank” turned him away. Each time, the bet looked questionable, says Callaghan. Each time, the bet was on a new way for humans to interact with technology that felt more natural than what came before.

The latest manifestation of this thesis is Sandbar, a hardware device that Callaghan describes as a “thought companion” — or, in more mundane terms, a voice-activated ring worn on the index finger. Its singular purpose: capturing and organizing your thoughts through voice notes. It’s not trying to be another Humane AI Pin or compete with Oura’s health tracking. “It does one thing really well,” Callaghan says. “But that one thing is a fundamental human behavioral need that is missing from technology today.”

The idea isn’t to passively record ambient audio but to be there when an idea strikes, serving as a kind of thought partner. It’s attached to an app, leverages AI, and, according to Callaghan, represents a very different philosophy about how we should interact with intelligence.

What drew True to Sandbar founders Mina Fahmi and Kirak Hong wasn’t just the product, though. “When we met Mina, we were just absolutely aligned on vision,” Callaghan recalls. True’s team had already been thinking for years about alternative interfaces, making targeted investments around that possibility. They’d met with dozens of founders, as a result. But the approach of Fahmi and Hong – who previously worked together on neural interfaces at CTRL-Labs, a startup acquired by Meta in 2019 – stood out. “It’s about what [the ring] enables. It’s about the behavior it enables that we will very soon realize we can’t live without.”

There’s an echo here of Callaghan’s old line about Peloton: “It’s not about the bike.” To some, the bike – even its earliest iteration – was compelling. But Peloton was really about the behavior it enabled and the community it created; the bike was just the vessel.

This philosophy of betting on new behaviors — not just new gadgets — also explains how True has managed to stay disciplined about capital. Even as AI startups raise hundreds of millions at billion-dollar valuations out of the gate, True insists that it’s able to stick to what it does best, which is to write seed checks of $3 million to $6 million for 15% to 20% ownership in startups that it often gets to see first.

Callaghan says True will raise more money to fund what’s working, but he’s not interested in raising billions of dollars. “Like, why? You don’t need that to build something amazing today.”

That same measured approach colors his view of the broader AI boom. While he says (when asked) that he believes OpenAI could soon be worth a trillion dollars, and while he calls this the most powerful compute wave we’ve seen, Callaghan sees warning signs in the circular financing deals backing hyperscalers and their $5 trillion in projected CapEx spending on data centers and chips. “We’re in a very capital intense part of the cycle, and that is worrisome,” he notes.

That said, he’s optimistic about where the real opportunities lie. Callaghan thinks the greatest value creation is ahead of us – not in the infrastructure layer but in the application layer, where new interfaces will enable entirely new behaviors.

It all comes back to his core investing philosophy, which sounds almost romantic — the kind of pitch-perfect VC wisdom that would ring hollow from most people: “It should be scary and lonely and you should be called crazy,” Callaghan says about early-stage investing done right. “And it should be really blurry and ambiguous, but you should be with a team that you really believe in.” Five to ten years later, he says, you’ll know if you were on to something.

Either way, based on True’s track record of betting on hardware that many others missed – fitness trackers, connected bikes, smart doorbells, and now thought-capturing rings – it’s worth paying attention when Callaghan says the phone’s days are numbered. Being early is the whole point — and the trend lines support his thesis: the smartphone market is effectively saturated, growing at barely 2% annually, while wearables — smartwatches, rings, and voice-enabled devices — are expanding at double-digit rates.

Something’s shifting in how we want to interact with technology, and True is placing its bets accordingly.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/30/76-european-deep-tech-university-spinouts-reached-unicorn-or-centaur-status/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Universities and research labs have long been Europe’s deep tech treasure trove. Now, academic spinouts have consolidated into a solid startup funnel worth $398 billion — and VC money is following.

According to Dealroom’s European Spinout Report 2025, 76 of these deep tech and life sciences companies have either reached $1 billion valuations, $100 million in revenue, or both. These include unicorns like Iceye, IQM, Isar Aerospace, Synthesia, and Tekever, which are now inspiring more funds to back university spinouts.

Just this month, two new funds emerged that will bring more funding to talent emerging out of European tech universities, while adding breadth to a pipeline currently topped by Cambridge, Oxford, and ETH Zurich.

PSV Hafnium, out of Denmark, recently closed its inaugural fund at an oversubscribed €60 million (approximately $71 million), with a focus on Nordic deep tech. With offices in Berlin and London, but also in Aachen, U2V (University2Ventures) is targeting the same amount for its first fund, of which it recently completed the first closing.

These two newcomers join the growing ranks of European venture firms that have university spinouts as a core part of their investment thesis. Pioneered by the likes of Cambridge Innovation Capital and Oxford Science Enterprises, which have now fully matured, this category has also diversified.

While it still mostly consists of funds backed by one or several universities and institutes, it now includes independent firms that simply see spinouts as potential fund returners — and rightly so. Oxford Ionics, acquired by U.S.-based IonQ, was one of the six spinouts out of Switzerland, the U.K., and Germany that delivered exits of more than $1 billion to their investors in 2025.

These exits come alongside increased amounts of funding. According to Dealroom, European university spinouts in deep tech and life sciences are on track to raise a near all-time-high $9.1 billion in 2025. This contrasts with overall VC funding in Europe, which is down nearly 50% from its 2021 peak.

Large rounds closed in 2025 also reflect appetite for spinouts in sectors as varied as nuclear energy — Proxima Fusion — and dual-use drones — Quantum Systems, now valued above $3 billion. In many cases, these startups leverage research from specialized labs, which also explains why there is a long tail of European locations capable of producing spinouts.

Building relationships with hubs outside of Oxbridge and leading countries can also be a way for newcomers to differentiate themselves and find deals. “The Nordic’s research institutions hold extraordinary, untapped potential,” PSV Hafnium’s partners stated in a press release.

PSV Hafnium itself is a spinout from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), but is also making early-stage investments in other Nordic countries. One of its nine checks to date went to SisuSemi, a Finnish startup leveraging a decade of research at the University of Turku to bring new surface cleaning tech to the semiconductor industry.

It is good news for teams like SisuSemi that there is more funding available to them. It also comes in addition to grants, commercialization support, and improved deal terms that contribute to an encouraging environment for Europe’s spinouts. However, one pain point remains: growth capital.

As the report’s authors note, this gap “is not a unique trend to spinouts, but something impacting the entire startup ecosystem in Europe.” Still, it is quite striking that nearly 50% of late-stage funding for European deep tech and life sciences spinouts comes from outside Europe, mainly from the U.S.

While this share has decreased over the years, Europe won’t be fully reaping the benefits of its investments in talent and research unless this changes more substantially — but that’s a broader issue to be solved.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This was supposed to be the year that climate tech died.

President Donald Trump and the Republican Party have done their best to dismantle the Biden administration’s hallmark industrial and climate policies. Even the European Union has begun to ease off its most aggressive goals.

And yet, as the year closes, the receipts provide a different view of climate and clean energy investing in the U.S. and Europe. Instead of tanking, venture bets in the sector remained essentially flat relative to 2024, according to CTVC, far from the slide some had expected.

That resiliency is due in part to continued threat of climate change. Perhaps a bigger contributing factor is that many climate technologies have become either cheaper or better than the fossil fuel alternatives — or are on the cusp of being so.

The incredible cost reductions of solar, wind, and batteries continue to fill climate tech’s sails. Not every new technology will follow the same path. But it does provide evidence that fossil fuels aren’t invincible and ample opportunities to fund companies providing cleaner, cheaper replacements do exist.

Last year, I predicted that 2025 would be the year that climate tech learned to love AI and its thirst for electricity, one that has largely borne out. It’s not entirely surprising — for the climate tech world, cheap, clean energy is its cornerstone.

Interest in data centers has only increased in the last year. And investors TechCrunch surveyed were nearly unanimous in their agreement that data centers will remain at the center of the conversation in 2026.

“They are creating their own financial ecosystem, and there is enough actual momentum in current AI efforts that I don’t see the hyperscalers pulling back in 2026,” Tom Chi, founding partner at At One Ventures, told TechCrunch.

“I’m still hearing about an ever increasing concentration of effort and focus on data centers virtually every single day in meetings, especially with corporates,” Po Bronson, managing director at SOSV’s IndieBio, told TechCrunch.

In 2025, data centers were obsessed with securing new sources of power. But Lisa Coca, partner at Toyota Ventures, thinks they’ll adjust their focus for 2026. “The 2026 data center energy conversation is likely to shift from demand to resilience and the need to accelerate plans to decouple from the grid,” she said. Decoupling could solve some challenges that data centers face, namely in resistance from grid operators and the public, who are increasingly worried that the new loads are driving up their electricity prices.

There will still be the need for more power, though, and investors saw geothermal, nuclear, solar, and batteries as having benefited from the boom. “Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected,” said Daniel Goldman, managing partner at Clean Energy Ventures.

Investors also acknowledged the AI bubble might burst; some voiced skepticism about whether it would drag the energy sector down with it.

“Could a bubble burst in 2026? Sure,” said Kyle Teamey, managing partner at RA Capital Planetary Health. But it’s not likely to affect infrastructure plans, he added. “The spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station.”

Andrew Beebe, managing director at Obvious Ventures, thinks the data center bubble might burst in 2026 or early 2027, but that no such bubble exists in electricity generation. “We still need a LOT more power, and we’ll use that — no build-out bubble there … yet.”

Outside of AI and data centers, Anil Achyuta, partner at Energy Impact Partners, said reindustrialization will take more of the spotlight this year. “We need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets,” he said, citing robotics, batteries, and power electronics as examples.

Thanks to the drumbeat of new data center announcements, energy-related startups have gotten a boost this past year, perhaps none more than those working on nuclear fission. In the last few weeks, nuclear startups have announced rounds totaling over $1 billion, leading to speculation that many will SPAC or go public through a traditional IPO in 2026.

“Nuclear everything is in vogue right now,” Teamey said.

But it will take a while for nuclear power to make a dent in electricity demand. In the meantime, tech companies and data center developers have been turning to solar and batteries as inexpensive, rapidly deployable power sources. Grid-scale batteries, in particular, have been a major beneficiary, seeing record-setting deployments in 2025. As alternative battery chemistries like sodium-ion and zinc come to market, they stand to lower costs and drive further adoption.

“We’ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on [battery] chemistry and business models.” said Leo Banchik, director at Voyager. “One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.”

Several investors felt geothermal would step in to help fill the void in the coming years. It helps that investors see enhanced geothermal as a relatively mature technology that’s ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026.

“Geothermal will be hot on solar’s heals in terms of new generation,” said Joshua Posamentier, managing partner at Congruent Ventures. “Natural gas assets are growing pretty linearly. There’s not much new capacity in turbine manufacturing coming online, and they’re selling everything they can. Geothermal will go geometric.”

And while AI is helping to drive demand, companies and technologies that think beyond the data center will benefit the most, said Laurie Menoud, founding partner at At One Ventures. “Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market.”

Not everyone was in agreement or would proffer a guess. But among those who did, several said nuclear or geothermal startups were most likely to go public, either via IPO or SPAC.

The name mentioned most was Fervo, the enhanced geothermal startup that recently raised a $462 million round. The company is widely seen as a leader in the sector and is in the midst of building a 500-megawatt development in Utah that should serve as a template for future power plants. Tapping the public markets would give the company more reserves to tackle additional projects.

Beyond data centers, investors are interested in a range of technologies and sectors, including critical minerals, robotics, and software to manage the electrical grid.

“We should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category,” said Amy Duffuor, general partner at Azolla Ventures. “The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.”

Resiliency and adaptation will be big themes in 2026, according to Coca of Toyota Ventures and Posamentier of Congruent Ventures. Achyuta at EIP zeroed in on one potential application: robots that bury electrical transmission lines quicker and more cheaply than humans, mitigating wildfire risks and increasing the grid’s reliability.

Beebe, at Obvious Ventures, said that EV trucking would also be an area to watch. “One of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi. The range and pricing of that vehicle will change that industry in ways as powerful as the Model S or 3.”

AI, of course, is likely to play a role in climate tech’s transformation. “We will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers,” said Matt Rogers, founder at Incite and Mill. “Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion-dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems.”

But it might also pay to keep an eye on technologies that have already been written off, said Bronson at SOSV. “When investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won’t pan out, that’s when the real breakthroughs finally happen,” he said.

Below are the detailed comments from the investors who replied to TechCrunch’s survey, listed in alphabetical order. Click the link to jump to a specific response.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Reindustrialization beyond data centers will be a major theme. We need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets. For example, supporting next-generation robotics to address labor shortages and national security concerns will require integrated supply chains. Batteries, power electronics, fuel cells, gas turbines, and even home building are examples of end markets/technologies where parts of the value chain will need to be reindustrialized.

Another area to watch is AI-driven physical science. While companies like Zanskar (predictive AI for geothermal) and Fabric8Labs (generative cooling for data centers) have shown promise, we haven’t seen many visible breakthroughs yet. That said, the talent pool working on these problems is impressive and could lead to exciting developments.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Gas turbines provide firm capacity and remain the option for many large players deploying data centers. Beyond that, batteries — particularly sodium-ion — represent one of the most economical and near-term solutions at the grid-scale. I am bullish about the progress in this technology, and pairing solar with batteries (as companies like Peak Energy are doing) continues to be a highly attractive approach. Next-gen geothermal is also showing a good amount of promise but the timelines are like that of nuclear, potent but will take about a decade to bring full capacity online.

In addition, algorithmic solutions to unlock new power using existing infrastructure (e.g., Gridcare, ThinkLabs AI) and optimize workloads (e.g., Emerald AI) can further enhance grid efficiency. There are also other innovations worth noting in bringing more power, such as applying optical coating to transmission lines to reduce losses being advanced by AssetCool (an EIP portfolio company).

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Fervo Energy, Commonwealth Fusion, Redwood Materials would be my personal guesses, but I could be wrong.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Sodium-ion batteries for grid-scale storage are already being deployed and will accelerate significantly in 2026. Another technology to watch is solid-state transformers (note Heron Power is an EIP portfolio company). The industry is advancing faster than expected and scale similarly to semiconductors, though at-scale production might take longer.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

One emerging trend is the underground build-out of transmission lines. Advances in robotics could enable a rapid, cost-effective approach that significantly reduces wildfire risk and, in turn, mitigates the substantial carbon emissions associated with such events.

Distributed power, heat, and computation are the last class of trends we are curiously tracking for 2026.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Data centers will keep driving record power demand as AI workloads scale. Despite talk of overbuild, we’re unlikely to see much stranded capacity — as compute gets cheaper and more available, we’ll keep finding new uses for it. The interesting shift is hyperscalers differentiating between clean power sources — firm vs. intermittent, location, and additionality — rather than just headline megawatt-hours. This is already playing out in bespoke offtake deals and on-site supply strategies.

Fission and geothermal should see continued momentum from both private capital and federal support. Fusion will likely attract increased federal support as geopolitical competition intensifies, though we’re still many years away from high-capacity-factor grid-scale deployment.

Natural gas peaker alternatives will gain traction too — using new turbines and modular designs with integrated carbon capture as grids manage new peak demands from AI.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Solar and battery build-out will continue given their strong economics. For dispatchable, 24/7 baseload power, we’ll see growth in fission, geothermal, and peaker alternatives like modular gas turbines with integrated carbon capture. There’s also a grid-edge opportunity worth watching: large facilities procuring dedicated baseload on-site rather than adding to grid congestion.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Most likely fission or geothermal. These companies have raised substantial capital and built strong offtake agreements with hyperscalers and utilities. With multibillion-dollar project pipelines and the need for continued growth financing, several could pursue public markets in 2026.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Energy storage deployment is accelerating across residential, commercial, industrial (including data center backup), and grid-scale applications. Domestic supply chains, including second-life battery systems, are gaining traction for stationary storage. We’ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on chemistry and business models. One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.

Industrial heat pumps and thermal storage systems for steam and process heat are becoming cheaper to operate than gas boilers in many regions and applications, especially where waste heat is available and electricity prices are favorable.

We’ll also see more growth in critical minerals and battery materials projects — lithium, rare earth, magnesium refining; battery component and cell manufacturing; copper recycling — maturing with federal support as supply chain security becomes a strategic priority.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Software and AI enabling physical infrastructure: real-time factory intelligence that improves energy efficiency and manufacturing yields, AI-based design tools that speed up product development cycles, grid management software that orchestrates intermittent renewables with storage and dispatchable power.

Companies taking a clean-sheet approach to reimagining foundational technologies — a SpaceX-style rethink of components once considered solved problems. Motor designs that eliminate rare earth dependencies, grid infrastructure like transformers with modern manufacturing techniques, advanced materials processing that significantly reduces costs while improving quality. Improvements in robotics help to enable these cost curves, making U.S. manufacturing economically viable where it wasn’t before.

Lastly, dual-use climate technologies with superior unit economics that happen to strengthen domestic supply chains. Defense and industrial policy are backing these not for climate reasons, but because they deliver cost advantages and supply security.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Data centers will again dominate. But there will be a lot more talk of a build-out bubble (in data centers, not electricity generation). We will live with the dual reality of too much money/debt spent on data centers, and the speculation bubble will likely burst (maybe early 2027). But at the same time, we’ll still need a LOT more power, and will use that — no build-out bubble there … yet.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

For power generation: geothermal in the near-term. Fission in the mid-term. Fusion in the 10-year-plus long-term. For actual siting: The above technologies can be sited anywhere, but mainly western states for geothermal. For batteries — PJM [the grid that covers the mid-Atlantic west to parts of Illinois] and Texas.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Grid software and EV trucking. One of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi. The range and pricing of that vehicle will change that industry in ways as powerful as the Model S or 3.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

I’m still hearing about an ever increasing concentration of effort and focus on data centers virtually every single day in meetings, especially with corporates. To some extent this is from “picks and shovels” companies who don’t want to get commoditized so they’re strategizing how to be a bigger player/more integrated rather than just a component that’s purchased.

A related phrase I hear more frequently is power density and/or specific power (power to weight), as a load of corporates are anticipating or planning how their energy divisions branch into robotics. Duncan Turner here is our expert.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

I don’t have a climate tech company in my portfolio going public in 2026. Tidal Vision is targeting 2027. That’s my closest. I don’t want to opine on other VC’s portfolio companies, even though I have my feelings, because I shouldn’t open my mouth where I’m only partially informed.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

For larger scales in 2026, my fastest scaling companies are Tidal Vision and Voyage Foods, which has taken over a General Motors plant in Ohio.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

On what to pay more attention to, I’ll toot Duncan’s horn here again — what he’s doing with the Plasma Forge is IMHO going to be super compelling and make everyone study at night.

One last note is my consistent feeling that it’s when investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won’t pan out that the real breakthroughs finally happen. I learned this lesson back in 1999 when we were all wondering if the search space was going to be won by Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, Lycos, or Infoseek.

I do feel like that’s happening in my personal portfolio. I said this to AgFunder recently, but when the VC world asks about winning sectors, there’s a presumption that the sector will be so hot that there will be multiple winners. Most markets don’t have multiple winners, and the sector doesn’t win; just one company wins.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

There will be a lot more around data centers in 2026. They are creating their own financial ecosystem, and there is enough actual momentum in current AI efforts that I don’t see the hyperscalers pulling back in 2026.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Budgets for hyperscalers are in the $50 billion to $100 billion range, which encompasses power, chips, and much more. The chips are expensive enough that folks are willing to pay a bit more to get power on the grid sooner as the losses from chip depreciation are greater than most things you could incrementally add to your power scale-up budget.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

IPO market still a bit murky, and most folks don’t telegraph exactly when they will go public.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Folks like Fervo are at an interesting inflection point. One of our portcos Provectus Algae is also at an interesting point.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

We’ve had a pretty big pendulum swing away from the more capital-intensive work in industrial decarbonization that aren’t in AI. They are still critical for our collective future, even if out of fashion for a few years.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

In our view at Toyota Ventures, the 2026 data center energy conversation is likely to shift from demand to resilience and the need to accelerate plans to decouple from the grid.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

We believe that the biggest investment opportunities are in firm, dispatchable, and scalable carbon-free energy. We have actively invested in technologies that support increasing baseload power, both geothermal and nuclear, through portfolio companies such as Rodatherm and Natura Resources. For critical grid flexibility, we are backing advanced, long-duration energy storage battery technologies with an investment in e-Zinc.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

We anticipate that nuclear power will continue to lead the way in terms of IPOs and SPACs in 2026.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Challenging question since we believe it is more a function of how, and if, the capital stack continues to evolve. There is a healthy number of climate tech companies across multiple sectors that are on the cusp of deploying at a larger scale. The biggest hurdle is securing FOAK financing to de-risk the all-important step of advancing from first of a kind to nth of a kind.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Our team expects resiliency and adaptation will continue to reign strong in 2026. The Toyota Ventures portfolio illustrates this: BurnBot addresses wildfire mitigation, ZymoChem bolsters supply chain resilience with sustainable materials, and Alora creates adaptable resource solutions.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

My prediction is that the energy conversation shifts from generation of power to how fast power can actually be delivered. Interconnection timelines, permitting, and physical grid constraints continue to be a bottleneck and data centers will increasingly rely on hybrid strategies that blend grid power, storage, and demand flexibility to hit timelines.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

One opportunity is at grid-ready sites, like places with existing transmission and substation. Anything that shortens interconnection timelines creates outsized value right now because access to the grid is scarce. Also interested in wireless transmission of power even though it’s in the early stages.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

There has been a lot of talk about Fervo Energy…!

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Long-duration energy storage technology companies, which will move from initial pilots to demos to repeatable deployments. We’re particularly excited about our portfolio company Noon Energy.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

We should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category. The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

We expect to see an acceleration of deal making in the data center/hyperscaler space consisting of the following:

While we don’t expect an overall “bust cycle” for data center and hyperscaler development activities, we do expect some rationalization of development and implementation of efficiency options to reduce capacity needs.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

The greatest near-term opportunity — and challenge — lies in improving the grid itself. Grid modernization through digitalization, decarbonization, and decentralization will unlock cost savings, optimize existing infrastructure, and better integrate significant distributed energy resources — probably not saying anything new here. Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected.

We expect this trend to continue despite recent policy shifts in the IRA and there are hundreds of venture capital-backed companies that can have a material impact on the grid as they scale-up and see more adoption rates in the market. Disruption is here!

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

Factorial appears to be a leading candidate following its plans to de-SPAC in 2026. Its trajectory illustrates that companies with strong customer traction in large markets, clear cost and performance advantages, and rapidly scaling revenues are well-positioned for the public markets. (This SPAC market contrasts with the 2020 one where entrants such as QuantumScape did not have meaningful revenues and perhaps were ill-prepared for public markets.)

Watch out for more companies hitting public markets on hype, instead of good fundamentals.

Beyond Factorial, several companies in energy storage, generation, and critical minerals are approaching scalable revenue levels to access low-cost of capital public markets (a real benefit), though in the minerals sector we may see growth in mergers and acquisitions precede any public offerings in 2026.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Projects in energy storage, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), critical minerals, and material manufacturing facilities across the energy supply chain will see significant investment in the U.S., with manufacturing tax credits and attractive market opportunities still available notwithstanding federal policy headwinds.

In 2025, we extensively evaluated and developed new risk transfer solutions for FOAK project developers. We see commercial lenders and private credit starting to lean more heavily into this space with the support of insurance underwriting and catalytic capital. We expect to see more projects and more debt financing  for early commercialization, which up until this point has only trickled in. This is the key enabler of the greater scale we need across the industry.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

For western markets to compete with China’s manufacturing and increasingly innovation prowess, financial innovation is CRITICAL. Global markets need to deploy $3 trillion to $9 trillion per year through 2050 on climate related technologies and implementation of projects if we hope to reduce global temperatures and compete in these markets internationally. Global spending on climate related investment was only $2 trillion in 2024 and is on a path for a similar amount in 2025.

To increase the rate of deployment, we must convince public and private investors that the risk-return balance is favorable to deploy capital across the climate capital stack — early-stage venture, growth-stage venture, private equity, commercial lending and private credit, and infrastructure. Our sector is not attracting enough capital; in simple terms, risks need to decline or returns need to increase.

We see opportunities to use risk-sharing mechanisms to optimize capital stacks and lower the cost of capital for new technology projects, which also brings them down the cost curve faster. Promising solutions include technology and performance risk insurance, surety bonds for managing construction risks, pooling off-take agreements among buyer groups (e.g., hyperscalers for clean power or airlines for SAF), filling gaps in construction financing, and more. Clean Energy Ventures’ spent time during 2025 identifying new risk transfer solutions working closely with our counterparts in the finance and insurance sectors. We believe 2026 will see more innovative financing solutions enabling faster scaling of climate technologies.

We should also be paying very close attention to cost curves. The impact of AI is showing up but not being widely reported in climate tech. Inside large companies and small startups the benefits of AI are driving costs down, allowing faster innovation at complex facilities and in supply chains. This is apparent in chemicals, mining and refining, power generation and grid optimization, manufacturing (steel, cement), recycling and waste management, and more.

We are only at the embryonic stage of seeing the impact of AI on the cost curves in a wide range of commodities and industries. As we talk about the upward impact on power prices driven by AI infrastructure requirements, we need to keep in mind that AI will also radically transform industries globally and reduce cost of production.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Yes, there’s been massive excitement around everything connected to data centers, energy generation, storage, transmission, cooling. But from a VC perspective, building and scaling data centers isn’t a startup timeline. It’s a decade-long struggle of permits, substations, and grid upgrades. To put numbers on it, hyperscale data centers take 3 to 6 years to permit and connect in the US today. In some markets, interconnection alone can exceed 5 to 7 years. So in 2026, I expect to see continued traction for energy companies that are not only tied to data centers but can expand into commercial and industrial use cases and front-of-the-meter applications. Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market.

Related to this is the supply of critical metals, which I continue to be very focused on: mining, extraction, refining, and recycling. This is critical not only for data centers (especially copper), but also for EV batteries with lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

In places where thermal (coal and gas) and nuclear plants are being retired, because those sites already have high-capacity grid connections. That makes deploying new clean generation dramatically faster. In the U.S. alone, more than 60 GW of coal capacity has retired since 2015, and another 40+ GW is scheduled to retire by 2030. Each retirement frees up a transmission node that took decades to build. Reusing that interconnection is often the difference between a 2-year vs. an 8-year project timeline. And that’s where you could install next-gen nuclear reactors, like Stellaria, that cut long-lived waste, capex, opex, deployment time, and extends fuel use, or geothermal energy like Factor2 Energy, utilizing underground CO2 reservoirs for lower constraints on deployment location.

The same is true of industrial sites (chemicals, steel, refineries) that already have oversized grid connections. These sites are trying to expand production, and add storage, and they already have one of the hardest problems solved: interconnection. If you want to electrify heavy industry quickly, you go where the grid already exists.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

No one can really know, but the battery recycling and circular critical materials subsector is one I’d watch closely. Lithium, nickel, and cobalt prices are extremely sensitive to geopolitics, and recycling provides a lower-risk, domestic supply for the U.S.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Relectrify is deploying their battery systems at commercial production scale in 2026 with a cumulative capacity of 100 MWh. They use cell-level semiconductor circuitry to individually control battery cells at high frequency, directly producing an alternating current waveform. No need for an inverter anymore, which is a direct win on CAPEX, improved usable lifetime battery capacity, and lower OPEX by identifying and replacing malfunctioning cells with precision. It’s happening now.

And overall, grid-scale energy storage beyond lithium, driven by both AI data centers and renewable growth. Without it, you simply can’t run 24/7 clean power outside of nuclear and hydro. Globally, stationary storage is projected to grow from ~45 GWh in 2023 to hundreds of GWs by 2030. Some of the new technologies are already ready today.

Battery recycling and closed-loop supply chains with automakers (recycled lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper going back into new batteries) are also already scaling. 2026 is about acceleration. Ascend Elements has already built the largest lithium-ion battery recycling facility in North America, and has now achieved the first production of recycled lithium carbonate. Imports make up the majority of the US supply of lithium carbonate today, mostly from Argentina and Chile. If you can secure your metal supply with lower-cost recycled content, isn’t that a big win?

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Companies like Chemfinity, that could make domestic metal refining at cost parity with China, and anything tied to mining, extraction, refining, and recycling of critical metals for data centers and EVs. Copper is THE metal for data centers. It’s used in power cables, busbars, transformers, cooling loops. A single gigawatt of data-center capacity requires on the order of tens of thousands of tonnes of copper. And about 40% – 45% of the world’s copper refining is in China, followed by Chile. It’s the same geographical structure as lithium refining and battery precursor chemistry. People talk about energy security. This is what it actually looks like.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Push for growth will continue but attention will shift from flashy gigawatt announcements to construction, commissioning, and dealing with the brutal realities of interconnect and permitting delays. The result will be a huge upwelling of “bring your own generation” and “demand flexibility.”

The age of ASSPs/ASICs will begin in earnest for AI data centers. GPUs will continue to grow, but the rate will taper in favor of more specialist chips that are far more efficient, especially for inference loads. This will start decoupling data center power consumption from token generation.

The unit economics of the marquee foundational AI shops will leak. They will not look good. But they will convince investors to support them through their trough of upside down unit economics until they achieve positive unit economics, which will come sooner than expected. But the shine will be off: These will fall into a different bucket than high margin SaaS companies from prior bubbles.

Data centers will become far better grid participants through flexibility, load shaping, and power quality, and they will be rewarded with far faster interconnect times than other big loads — the more tech they adopt, the faster they’ll get connected.

We’ll see the first off-grid world-scale data center NTP [notice to proceed, or a letter telling a contractor to begin work]. We’ll also see more NIMBY pushback on proximate data centers because of everything from power costs to size to water use.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

Nuclear fusion! I think we’ll see the first net gain by analysis (i.e., deuterium fusion where it would be Q>1 if it were tritium) in a startup reactor.

Geothermal will be hot on solar’s heels in terms of new generation with linearly deploying gas assets.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

SPAC or IPO? Lots in the pipe, pun intended.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Geothermal for electricity and district heating. Friction is still way too high for single site geothermal heat loops to scale much faster than today. Thermal energy storage (load shifting) for industrial applications.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

Robotics (not the humanoid kind) are taking over a huge number of labor-intensive industries; they will impact many industrial, agriculture, waste, and manufacturing operations in 2026.

Logistics and manufacturing efficiency: electrification, efficiency, onshoring, and AI are pushing on emissions from half of the economy and these sectors are economic, not impact buyers. Give them long-term certainty on lower costs vs. conventional fuels, for example, and you’ll have buyers. This is everything from electrified autonomous trucking to electric autonomous rail and dark terminals.

Resilience technology is going to really get going. Insurance costs (due to climate risk) are outpacing every other cost for homeowners and impacting commercial operations. Businesses and individuals are going to aggressively begin to invest in resilience in the face of accelerating climate change and extreme weather but also aging infrastructure and a shift from centralized to distributed resource paradigms.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

Data centers will serve as factories for the next phase of AI innovation powering America’s society and economy. I think local governments will step up more in 2026 and challenge hyperscalers to deliver solutions that are more in line with community needs and municipal partnership that allows for swifter construction. Energy affordability is top of mind, and we really need to reverse the trend of 2025 of rising costs.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

The call is coming from inside the house in 2026. In other words, consumers have more impact than anyone thinks. Decentralized infrastructure solutions, including rooftop solar, energy storage, and distributed energy resources, like heat pumps and smart thermostats, are available today. Households can turn them on swiftly, cost-effectively, and without the major disruptions to grids across the nation we are seeing today. It’s faster to permit than building new centralized power plants.

If enough people adopt these approachable solutions, America’s grid has a better shot at handling the increased capacity from the data center AI boom.

There’s also an alignment opportunity hiding in plain sight: AI pioneers and Big Tech companies want a faster, more predictable path to build. Local and state governments want affordability, economic investment, and resilience. Communities are actually in a unique position to trade swift permitting and flexible construction timelines for economic rejuvenation, tax revenue, and job creation from the private sector.

By enabling more efficient households with lower utility bills, hyperscalers can access the energy they need to operate AI data centers. Much faster. That’s why this isn’t a moonshot. The opposite, in fact.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Mill. We’ll deploy more Food Recyclers, and on a different scale, than ever before. We’re planning more partnerships to encourage more households, businesses, and communities to view food as something to return back to the food system rather than leave for weeks in dumpsters and then years in landfills.

Robotics is going to attract massive funding and private sector attention in 2026. Simultaneously, builders will move away from the hype around humanoid models towards functional robots designed to handle specific tasks and make life easier. The future of robotics will look more like Roomba than your neighbor Rhonda, which actually bodes well from both an affordability and technology risk perspective.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

We will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers. Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion-dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems. In order for AI to power the future without tanking grids or negatively impacting communities, it must be paired with physical hardware that solves problems and makes everyday life better for people. We’ll benefit as much from an AI smartphone as we will with an AI-powered waste facility.

Data centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?

I think data centers will still dominate in 2026. But I guess I’m a little jaded on this stuff because I was in the last AI cycle — it’s a lot of the same conversation. But the level of investment is orders of magnitude greater. The level of attention is orders of magnitude greater. And so it’s going to take a long while for this to shake out one way or another.

The spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station. Could a bubble burst in 2026? Sure. But that would take a while to be manifested. It’s going to take months to a year perhaps to to really be manifested. You’d have to shut it off midstream and try to claw your money back. That’s pretty hard to do.

Where is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?

This has been talked about a lot, but the data use, the requirements for data, it scales fairly exponentially. Power it scales quite linearly. As a consequence, it’s going to take a long while, I think, for the physical world to catch up to the data demand side. It’s really all of the above. If you can if you can do anything in power generation, power storage, transmission, distribution, if you can improve grid operations — the list goes on and on and on.

A bull market in electricity like this, I don’t know how long it’s been, maybe like a century? And so it really, at least to us, it looks like it’s all of the above. Lots and lots of interesting opportunities within that. We’ve seen some companies go public in the like the last 12, 18 months. We probably will see more. I think it’s fair to to think that there will be.

Which climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?

I think power generation is gonna see more public companies in 2026, for sure. There could be a wide, wide variety there. Nuclear everything is in vogue right now. We’ll likely see more of those. Geothermal, we’ll definitely see some of those. And you’ve already got a bunch of interesting players who are in project development and implementation, some of those could go public as well. It’s not just the tech companies, but the folks up and down the value chain.

Which technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?

Nuclear fission companies in particular. That could be a bubble for sure, but if some of these companies start succeeding and start getting uh projects built. Every few years these opportunities pop up, and it makes sense that people take advantage of those opportunities to raise some additional cash and grow more rapidly.

What trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?

There haven’t been any technologies I’ve seen recently where I’m like, ‘Oh wow that’s going to change the world, everyone should be looking at that.’ I do think it is more about scaling for a lot of these right now. If you can hit scale quickly, it’s an amazing opportunity.

If you look at the the various trends, it’s not just the manufacturing demand. The other driver is the regionalization of everything, which is driving demand for labor, for resources. Fill in the blank, there’s demand for it.

            <div id="article-text">There are nights when the dance floor beckons but the bones refuse. When the urge to party arrives, it may be too late to book a babysitter. Perhaps you’re already in sweatpants, or closing time is before midnight where you live. Possibly, the prospect of going out has been raised but vetoed by a cohabitant, and you don’t want to tango alone. You could also be the kind of person who is more interested in the idea than the reality of loud, sweaty, euphoric congresses found in clubs and music venues.

Fortunately, mood-altering substances are available at home—by which, of course, I mean books. A rich literature on pleasure-oriented nightlife is available for consultation or consolation on your evening in. These five books offer a bit of vicarious sweat and thrill to get you as close to the experience as possible without demanding that you leave your couch. They also invite readers to think more expansively about what exactly draws so many people to mingle in the dark—the club’s human stakes, its sensory pleasures, and its illuminating social history. Reading a good book is not the same as riding a social high into the wee hours, but it may equip you with a sense of possibility that you can apply far beyond the coatroom. On the right night, wise women attest, a DJ can save your life.

The Haçienda: How Not to Run a Club, by Peter Hook

The Haçienda in Manchester was a catalyst of the U.K. acid house scene in the late ’80s, and a prophecy foretold: “The haçienda must be built,” the Situationist poet Ivan Chtcheglov wrote in 1953. Heeding these cryptic words some three decades later, the audacious (and well-read) impresario Tony Wilson opened the Haçienda together with the circle of post-punk musicians and designers involved with his label, Factory Records. Their attempt to decipher Chtcheglov’s mystical phrase lasted 15 years. Hook, the bassist for New Order, served as a kind of player-coach at the Haçienda, helping manage its madcap affairs while his band became the club’s cash cow. In this memoir of misbegotten business administration, Hook returns to the storied nights out that changed British culture even as they threatened to bankrupt him—and worse. Beset by gangs and guns, the Haçienda faltered in the ’90s despite clever-sounding schemes such as replacing the club’s security with the gangsters themselves. This is a scrapbook of utopian folly, yes, but also an insider’s look at what was, for a time, the wildest workplace on Earth.

Love Saves the Day: A History of American Dance Music Culture, 1970–1979, by Tim Lawrence

“Disco sucks” was the cry of philistines, if not bigots, Lawrence argues. In this meticulous but inviting cultural history of New York nightlife in the 1970s, he follows disco’s rise from underground clubs such as the Loft to the vaunted lights of Studio 54 and the FM airwaves of American suburbs. Versions of this story have been told before, but what distinguishes Love Saves the Day are the more than 300 interviews Lawrence conducted with promoters, partiers, and legendary DJs such as Frankie Knuckles. It’s full of wisdom from the elders of American club culture: how to stagger straight and gay crowds on a Friday night, how to find the next great floor-filling single, how to build a DJ set like a furnace that can burn all night. Lawrence also folds in a number of select club “discographies” so you can reproduce Jimmy Stuard’s set from 12 West, circa 1976, at home (on nice speakers, perhaps, or an iPhone placed in a cereal bowl).

Bright Lights, Big City, by Jay McInerney

Some might say McInerney’s debut novel reads a bit long in the tooth four decades after it first offered the curious public a glimpse of Manhattan-yuppie hedonism. Still, no syllabus on clubbing could be complete without the opening chapter’s rendering of the dislocation and dread that may await the partygoer “on that imperceptible pivot where two A.M. changes to six A.M.” For the nameless protagonist—a young fact-checker recently separated from his wife—a punishing club itinerary provides the opposite of community and connection. Something important is being avoided, in fact, on the dance floor and in the many crowded bathroom stalls where lines of “Bolivian Marching Powder” are hungrily apportioned. Beyond its glitz and sleaze, Bright Lights is a sobering lesson on why partying does not always soothe a troubled soul.

Legendary: Inside the House Ballroom Scene, by Gerard H. Gaskin

One of the older photographs in Gaskin’s book, from 1998, finds an impeccably suited ballroom performer strutting the boards of what appears to be a community-center gymnasium. Scanning from head to toe, the viewer sees a banded fedora, cigar, jacket and trousers, and, finally, holding it all up (easily missed at first glance): vertiginously high stilettos. It’s an image of heroic poise, accentuated by the look of enchantment on the faces of a trio of young men watching from folding chairs. Gaskin has long enjoyed a reputation as the “Trinidadian Andy Warhol” of the ballroom scene in New York City, writes the scholar Frank Roberts, a subject of Gaskin’s; for those who performed in that world between the mid-1990s and the early 2010s, when these photos were taken, appearing in a Gaskin portrait was a “rite of passage.” His pictures illustrate the drama and grandeur of these events, but they also convey the importance of the club as a place where dignity—elsewhere denied—may be claimed without apology, and freedom can be realized for the length of the catwalk.

Wark’s sprawling intelligence is a pleasure to access on any subject. In Raving, Wark blends autofiction and theory to chaperone the reader through the trans rave scene in New York City—or at least the scene as she found it in the years before and after 2020. “First thing I look for at raves: who needs it,” she writes of these parties, “and among those who need it, who can handle their habit?” Vividly told, Raving is no gawking ethnography; it’s a sticky and tender little book with serious ethical contemplation at its center. Wark is attentive to the essence of raving as a Black art form and its special significance for queer people, but she approaches it as an activity open to anyone who can handle it—not a way of life so much as a way of creating new lives together.

            <h2>The Holiday Traditions of a Nation Long Dead</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-31</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every year in late December, my childhood home transformed into a vision of American bliss. We’d gather to ornament a tree, drape string lights around the house, and sit down to an elaborate feast. Not long after dawn the next day, while our little sister still slept, my brother and I would impatiently sneak downstairs to see our gifts, which we understood to have been delivered by a kindly old man. It could have been a scene out of A Christmas Story. Except we weren’t celebrating Christmas. My family was celebrating the Soviet version of New Year’s, a holiday that resembles Christmas in nearly every way, except that it takes place almost a week later and excludes Jesus, God, or any other signifier of religion. We were keeping the national tradition alive in suburban America, years after the country that invented it had dissolved.

Soviet New Year’s began as a ritual in a country where all the religious rituals were gone. Long before the 1917 revolution that brought them to power, the leaders of the Soviet Union had decried religion as, in Karl Marx’s phrase, the opium of the masses. Their officially atheist government suppressed many kinds of spiritual observance, including Christmas. But by the mid-1930s, Soviet leaders sensed that people needed something to take the edge off in the dead of winter, a carnivalesque custom of the sort that Christmas once provided. So they took the most fun parts of the Christian holiday and plopped them on New Year’s.

It became arguably the most important holiday on the country’s calendar. Other celebrations tended to come with historical significance, such as the anniversary of the revolution and of the Soviets’ victory in World War II. But New Year’s, at its core, was about nothing more and nothing less than family: a chance to come together and take stock. That may be a big reason it survived the Union’s dissolution. Even after religious institutions were allowed to conduct their services without government interference and their holidays were acknowledged, New Year’s remained important for both the people who had left the region and those who still lived there.

But today, Soviet New Year’s customs are in danger of slipping away or evolving beyond recognition. Some people still celebrate the holiday the old way, with their families and gifts. Many, though, are establishing new practices that reflect new values and new political circumstances: Wars between former Soviet republics, for instance, and the ways that political leaders have used the momentous nature of the night for their own gains, have changed how people celebrate. A holiday that once felt embedded in the identity and culture of the Soviet people may soon become untethered from its history.

Soviet New Year’s began at a time when morale in the country was, in general, low. It was the 1930s, and Ukraine had suffered one of the worst man-made famines in world history. The idea to bring joy to the winter came from a Communist Party leader named Pavel Postyshev, who had been one of the famine’s administrators. During an intimate car ride around Moscow with General Secretary Joseph Stalin and a future successor, Nikita Khrushchev, Postyshev proposed reviving the tradition of trees, but tied to a secular holiday. Stalin enthusiastically endorsed the idea, and in 1935, a letter from Postyshev appeared in Pravda, the official newspaper of the party’s central committee, arguing that all Soviet children should get to experience the cheer that the bourgeoisie’s children once had: “Let’s organize a fun New Year’s Eve party for the kids.”

Postyshev’s idea spread like a wildfire in reverse—trees sprang up across the Soviet Union. The first year, delegates from the local party leadership and schoolteachers gathered parents and instructed them in how to decorate a tree. In some schools, Grandfather Frost, a Santa Claus equivalent, distributed gifts to kids. Soon, families adopted the new practice as their own. But Postyshev never got to see the extent of it. In the ’30s, Stalin consolidated power, punishing anyone he suspected of opposing him, including Postyshev—who was executed in 1939. The holiday soon became another tool for Stalin to reinforce his power and centrality in Soviet life. “The cheerful, happy children sang, danced, recited poems, praising in the songs and poems of their beloved Stalin, who gave them a joyful and happy life,” one 1938 newspaper report read.

After Stalin died, in 1953, the holiday’s focus turned away from politics. In 1956, Khrushchev delivered a speech criticizing Stalin’s “cult of personality” and his purges, signaling to people that they could drop the anxieties about political correctness that had constricted their lives in the Stalin era. The film Carnival Night, released that same year, captured the iconoclastic mood. In it, workers resist the efforts of their company director to organize a New Year’s celebration in which everything is acceptable to the people above him and no fun for those below. He plans to deliver a speech, but a worker persuades a magician to make the text disappear; when the director later goes to grab it, he instead finds a string of scarves and other knickknacks. The company director, representing a self-aggrandizing political blowhard, is humiliatingly sidelined, and the workers have a grand time.

By the time my dad started celebrating New Year’s in Moscow, in the ’60s, most of the elements of the holiday I would come to know as a kid were present: family dinner, gifts, and a decorated tree. It had become an unquestioned fulcrum of Soviet life. If there was a custom of reading poems or singing songs in Khrushchev’s honor, it wasn’t ubiquitous. Once the country’s leaders began giving an annual New Year’s address, in 1970, these speeches weren’t taken seriously. They were filled with empty platitudes, “void of meaning,” according to The Invention of Russia, by the journalist Arkady Ostrovsky. “These addresses were merely a prompt for popping the corks from bottles.”

That cork-popping continued even as the Soviet Union dissolved and many people left the region. I was born in Moscow in 1996, five years after the fall of the Union, and we moved to upstate New York five years after that. For a long time, the New Year’s my family celebrated was stuck in amber, the old tree-and-gifts version. In the former Soviet republics, people still considered the day significant but changed some of the customs. In Armenia, for instance, once religious holidays were again allowed, religious institutions attached themselves to New Year’s. From the early 1990s until 2023, the head of the national Church would deliver a midnight address right before the country’s president or prime minister. Tigran Simyan, a professor at Yerevan State University who studies the evolution of New Year’s in Armenia and the post-Soviet world, told me, “Our happy New Year, for us, is more important than Christmas.”

Politics also returned to the holiday after the Soviet Union’s fall. In Russia, the seeming end of single-party rule and a brief moment of political competition revived the status of the New Year’s address. It was a rare time when all eyes were focused on the same speaker. The Russian Federation’s first president, Boris Yeltsin, strategically resigned on December 31, 1999, giving his handpicked successor, Vladimir Putin, the opportunity to introduce himself during a midnight address as the millennium turned. “The ritual was unmistakably staged,” Ostrovsky writes in The Invention of Russia. “The New Year’s address had greater symbolic value than any election.”

In more recent times, young Russians have tended to focus on partying on New Year’s Eve. But the many people who maintain the Soviet way of celebrating at home with family might still put on Putin’s address. Once again, a popular film captures the mood. The plot of 2010’s Yolki is almost the exact opposite of Carnival Night’s. Whereas the 1956 film is about a collaborative effort to prevent a speech, Yolki features people across the country working together to help a girl on her quixotic quest to insert a phrase into the president’s midnight address, granting the address central importance. Yolki was the first in what became Russia’s most financially successful non-animated film franchise, despite the series’ declining artistic and entertainment value. Its 12th sequel, set as ever on New Year’s Eve, came out this December.

Eventually, politics’ creep back into the New Year’s holiday began to affect the way my family celebrated in the United States. Although for years, none of us took what Putin said in his address too seriously, my grandparents still put it on out of habit. But as his regime grew more repressive and violent, we let that go. The way I remember it, we stopped after Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine, in 2014, deciding that we didn’t need to support Putin’s rule on our holiday. But my dad dates our move away from the midnight address to earlier, in 2012. That year, Putin stepped through a loophole in constitutional term limits and returned to the presidency, then brutally suppressed the protests that followed. “I didn’t want to hear him anymore,” my dad told me recently.

After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in February 2022, some Ukrainians’ New Year’s celebrations stopped. “What is there to celebrate when there is a war?” a Ukrainian soldier serving on the front line asked Euronews last New Year’s. Meanwhile, I spent last New Year’s in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, where clubs had just been closed for weeks in deference to protests over the government pausing its European Union accession bid. Though some young people I talked with were spending the night with their family, many spilled out onto Rustaveli Avenue in the city center for a combination party, protest, and celebration. Without a single state to hold it together, and so many interstate conflicts, the Soviet New Year’s tradition is splintering across the Soviet diaspora.

Perhaps soon the holiday will become unrecognizable from its former iteration, especially as the people who remember its origins adapt to new cultures or pass away. My own family no longer makes a point of gathering on the holiday. In part, that’s because my siblings and I have gotten older, scattered, and given in to assimilationist pressure—the fear of missing out on the American custom of partying with our friends on New Year’s. But we’ve also lost the center of gravity that held us to the Soviet tradition. Early in November, my last surviving grandmother suffered a stroke, which paralyzed most of her body, leaving only her eyes and one arm fully mobile. Her grandfather, my great-great-grandfather, became a Bolshevik in 1905 and participated in the three revolutions that led to the establishment of the Soviet Union. His son, her father, wrote and disseminated anti-religious propaganda. Much of my family’s adherence to the holiday might very well be because of this history. On Thanksgiving, days before my grandmother died, I told her I was researching our holiday tradition. She squeezed my hand and blinked knowingly.

Watching the tradition slip away feels like losing part of the Soviet and post-Soviet identity that’s defined my family for more than a century. I feel a grief that’s hard to disentangle from my grief for the people who passed the tradition on to me. But looking back on how my family has acted in decisive moments, I’m also aware of an opportunity. My forefathers helped form the Soviet identity and its rituals, even before there was a country to promote them. Likewise, during and after the Soviet Union’s existence, although politicians repeatedly imposed a tone that fit their priorities, my family chose how to spend the day. Ultimately, the common people reshaped the holiday to suit their needs and values. Their examples prove that people can make their own traditions, with whatever ideals they inherit.

            <h2>A Symbol of New York Is Gone</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/12/metrocard-farewell-new-york-subway/685276/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On a chilly December morning, I descended a flight of stairs and entered the New York Transit Museum. Housed in a decommissioned subway station in downtown Brooklyn, the museum was packed with elementary-school children on a field trip. All around me, tour guides shepherded groups of them through the various exhibits. Later on, I heard one guide ask if any of the students knew how to pay for the subway. “You tap a phone,” a child volunteered.

For decades, the default answer has been something else: You swipe a MetroCard. Something like a flimsy yellow credit card, the MetroCard has bound together nearly everyone in the city—real-estate moguls and tenants, Mets and Yankees fans, lifelong New Yorkers like myself and new arrivals from Ohio. Any tourist who visited New York inevitably got one. But now the MetroCard era is about to end. Today is the last day you can purchase a card.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the organization that operates the city’s public-transit system, has for years been phasing out the MetroCard in favor of contactless payment—tapping your phone or a credit card, much as you would at any store. The new system, known as OMNY (“One Metro New York”), will bring together the benefits of technological progress: tens of millions of dollars in savings for both riders and the MTA each year, shorter lines, less plastic waste. Many other large metro systems have already fully transitioned to tap-and-go; in this sense, New York is behind the times.

In 2025, swiping a plastic rectangle through a card reader feels like an anachronism, but the MetroCard shouldn’t be taken for granted. Every little yellow plastic rectangle represents a genuine technological marvel.

At first, the MetroCard was a flop. The system was designed to be a technological leap forward: No longer would New Yorkers have to lug around physical tokens to pay for subways and buses. MetroCards would not only be lighter, but allow users to transfer between trains and buses without having to pay a second time. Despite the obvious upside, convincing people to embrace the swipe was not easy. When the MetroCard debuted, in 1994, “everybody was like, ‘I don’t want to give up my tokens. You’ll get my tokens out of my cold dead hands,’” Jodi Shapiro, the Transit Museum’s curator, told me. People lined up to buy as many tokens as possible before sales ended so they could put off converting to the MetroCard for as long as possible. Television segments reassured New Yorkers that “they could get to work by using plastic.” The MTA put out ads and flyers explaining how to use the card, and briefly considered having someone dressed as an aardvark (the “Cardvaark”) go to Times Square and educate passersby about the MetroCard.

Despite a rough start, the MetroCard swipe eventually just became routine. Knowing how to swipe a MetroCard—the crook of your elbow, the gentle flick of your wrist as you glide the magnetic stripe through the card reader—is essential New York knowledge. To create the infrastructure for this system, “all of this technology had to be upgraded,” Shapiro said. “And some of it had to be invented.” The MTA needed not just physical cards, but also a way to read them, vending machines to sell them, and a central computer system to track each one and process every transaction. Even the “swipe” mechanism, faster and easier to maintain than fare cards in other American cities at the time, was bespoke—designed specifically for New York City public transit’s sprawl and enormous ridership.

Last month, I visited the facility in Queens that mints the city’s MetroCards to see this logistical feat for myself. Known as the Fortress Revenue Collection Lab, the building does look startlingly like a fortress—with barbed wire, barred windows, brick walls, and a central tower. Before the trip, the MTA made me agree not to disclose the precise location, and when I arrived, Michael Ellinas, the MTA’s senior vice president of revenue control, led me through an entrance monitored by security guards. All of these measures safeguard the millions of MetroCards processed and stored inside the facility, many of them already loaded with money—just 1,000 monthly passes would be worth $132,000.

The Revenue Fortress Collection Lab doesn’t make MetroCards from scratch. The plastic yellow cards are first manufactured in North Carolina and the United Kingdom before they are shipped, some 10,000 per box, to Queens, where they are turned into usable MetroCards. Employees load decks of blank cards onto conveyor belts that assign each a serial number and encode its magnetic stripe with value: monthly passes, single-ride cards, and so on, or zero dollars if the MetroCard is intended for someone to purchase from one of the vending machines throughout the MTA system. There are roughly 100 types of MetroCards, and the encoding process is what “puts the secret sauce on the magnetic stripe,” Ellinas told me. The room is kept between 35 and 55 percent humidity: Too muggy and the cards might stick together, too dry and they might develop static.

Some of the MetroCards are then brought to another conveyor belt and wrapped in plastic for individual retail at pharmacies and gas stations. Modified from machines used by Planters factories to wrap peanuts, this contraption envelops 5,000 MetroCards every hour—or more than one every second. Sunillall Harbajan, an MTA employee overseeing the room’s operations, told me he has a nickname for the machine: “The Beast.”

At its peak, the fortress was pumping out 180 million MetroCards every year; some 3.2 billion have been prepared in total. By the time I visited the fortress, just about 10 percent of riders were still using MetroCards, and the facility was no longer making them every day. Ellinas had timed the run so that I could witness it. “All good things come to an end, but I’m happy to have been part of it,” Karen Kunak, the MTA’s chief officer of processing operations, told me from inside the fortress, surrounded by boxes of MetroCards. She started at the MTA as a college intern 36 years ago—before the MetroCard was even around: “We made it into a thing, its own living, breathing thing.” Employees operating the MetroCard machines are being retrained to work elsewhere across the MTA.

If the city had never adopted the MetroCard—had not installed electronic turnstiles systemwide, developed a complex computer system, gotten people used to paying with a card at all—OMNY would have been a far more gargantuan effort. The switch from paying with one sort of card to another is far less jarring than going from coins to a piece of plastic. “If all of the technological things had not been done to make MetroCard a viable fair-payment system,” Shapiro said, “we wouldn’t have OMNY now.” Eventually, the fortress will be reconfigured into an OMNY facility, just as MetroCard vending machines in subway stations have been replaced by OMNY vending machines. (Those who don’t want to use a phone or credit card or don’t have one can instead purchase an OMNY card.)

In saying goodbye to the MetroCard, New York City is saving time, money, and waste. But the city is also losing a bit of friction, and a common denominator, that is central to its character. New Yorkers and tourists lined up to buy special MetroCards designed in collaboration with local legends and institutions—Biggie Smalls, David Bowie, the library—that are now collectors’ items. Before long, even the basic MetroCards might be coveted as well. There will never be a card to celebrate a World Series victory for my beloved New York Mets. The leap into modernity can feel like sliding into a featureless void, in which every transaction of any sort becomes hard to distinguish. Paying to ride the subway is now like paying for a coffee at Starbucks.

Or perhaps it is just me; the MetroCard is all I’ve ever really known. My friends and I used to protect our student MetroCards, which allowed us to ride for free, like amulets, our keys to the city. As I walked through the Transit Museum with Shapiro, she and an MTA spokesperson accompanying us poked fun at visitors who didn’t remember the subway token. I remained quiet, not wanting to out myself.</div>

            <div id="article-text">In case you’re settling into winter and lamenting not having read everything The Atlantic has published this year, you’re in luck. I’ve created a list of stories you may have missed that are very much worth your time. The assortment ranges widely: eating an organ feast in Mark Twain’s Paris, experiencing a comedy-show adventure in Riyadh, drifting after a shipwreck in the Pacific, and diving into the secrets of the Inca empire. “What Parents of Boys Should Know” sparked many conversations in my group chats, as did this photo of Abraham Lincoln’s ear being cleaned. There are stories that contextualized a chaotic moment for the American experiment, drawing deeply on history.

I hope you’ll spend time with this selection, and I would love to hear what you think. Send me a note: [email protected].

New Year’s Resolutions That Will Actually Lead to Happiness

If you are someone who follows a traditional religion, you most likely have a day such as Yom Kippur, Ashura, or Ash Wednesday, dedicated to atoning for your sins and vowing to make improvements to your life. But if you are not religious, you might still practice a day of devotion and ritualistic vows of self-improvement each year on January 1. New Year’s Day rings in the month of January, dedicated by the ancient Romans to their god Janus. Religious Romans promised the two-faced god that they would be better in the new year than they had been in the past.

According to the Pew Research Center, historically between one-third and one-half of Americans observe this pagan rite every year by making their own New Year’s resolutions. The most common resolutions are fairly predictable: financial resolutions, like saving more money or paying down debt (51 percent in 2019); eating healthier (51 percent); exercising more (50 percent); and losing weight (42 percent).

Old Janus is pretty annoyed at this point, I imagine, because our resolutions overwhelmingly fail.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">How much effort should a country expend to rescue someone who appears to hate its values? That is the question posed by the case of Alaa Abd el-Fattah.

Abd el-Fattah is an Egyptian pro-democracy campaigner who has been in and out of prison since 2006 for opposing the regimes of Hosni Mubarak and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and for drawing attention to torture and other abuses. In 2021, he was granted British citizenship through a somewhat tenuous connection—his mother, Laila, had been born in London while her mother was studying in the United Kingdom—which gave the British government greater standing to lobby Cairo on his behalf. It pressed his case under three Conservative prime ministers (Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak) and, since June 2024, under Labour’s Keir Starmer. Six months ago, a government minister said that the case had been “a top priority every week that I have been in office.”

Last week, those efforts finally paid off. Egypt lifted a travel ban on Abd el-Fattah, who had been released from jail in September, and Starmer declared that he was “delighted” that Abd el-Fattah was “back in the UK and has been reunited with his loved ones.”

That delight was short-lived. Within hours, Abd el-Fattah’s tweets from the time of the Arab Spring, when he was around 30, resurfaced on X. In these, he reportedly wished violence on “all Zionists, including civilians”—read: Jews. He also called for the murder of police officers, and sarcastically described his dislike of white people. In a 2010 discussion of the death of one of the terrorists who had tortured and killed Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, he declared, “My heroes have always killed colonialists.”

The populist insurgent Nigel Farage could not have scripted a better attack ad against Britain’s two established parties. At best, both Labour and the Conservatives have spent political capital on an activist who has repeatedly expressed thoughtless and hateful views in public. At worst, the government has invited in a provocateur who will continue to spread poison and incite violence. “It is unclear to me why it has been a priority for successive governments to bring this guy over here,” the rank-and-file Labour politician Tom Rutland wrote on X, adding, “His tweets are impressive in how they manage to be vile in such a variety of ways.”

In a statement of apology, Abd el-Fattah suggested that his statements were in keeping with the prevailing ethos of early-2010s Twitter—which was full of performative, deliberately offensive left-wing posturing. His posts, he said, were the “writings of a much younger person, deeply enmeshed in antagonistic online cultures, utilising flippant, shocking and sarcastic tones in the nascent, febrile world of social media.” In his offline activism, Abd el-Fattah maintained, he was known for “publicly rejecting anti-Jewish speech in Egypt, often at risk to myself, defence of LGBTQ rights, defence of Egyptian Christians, and campaigning against police torture and brutality.” However, Abd el-Fattah also questioned why the tweets had been “republished” now with their meanings “twisted.” On Facebook, he appears to have liked a comment suggesting that it was—you guessed it—a “campaign launched by the Zionists.”

The situation is deeply embarrassing for Starmer, who welcomed Abd el-Fattah’s arrival in Britain so warmly. He now claims not to have known about the “absolutely abhorrent” tweets and is promising to “review the information failures in this case.” Apparently, despite years of campaigning for this guy, the combined might of the British civil service never thought to search his Twitter handle. If the authorities had conducted even a cursory background check, they would have found opinions such as this (now-deleted) assertion from 2012: “I’m a racist, I don’t like white people so piss off.”

Nor did civil servants enter Abd el-Fattah’s name into a search engine, which would have revealed the 2014 reports on his controversial nomination for a free-speech prize. One of these, headlined “A Dissident for Hate,” observed that “Mr. Abdel Fattah may have been brave in confronting authoritarianism in his own country. But his rhetoric on Israel and moderate Arabs is another story.”

The British right is now arguing that Abd el-Fattah and his celebrity supporters—including Naomi Klein, Olivia Colman, and Mark Ruffalo—have made the British government look foolish. Why is Starmer loudly welcoming “back” a man who has never before spent a significant amount of time in Britain, who abhors its geopolitical alliances, and who apparently dislikes the majority of its population? Farage, the leader of the right-wing Reform Party, has unsurprisingly called for Abd el-Fattah to be stripped of his British citizenship. So has Kemi Badenoch, the current leader of the Conservatives—the party in charge when Abd el-Fattah was awarded that citizenship in the first place.

Idrees Kahloon: Political parties have disconnected from the public

Former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss, who has lately joined the podcast circuit, wrote on X that Abd el-Fattah’s case shows that “the human-rights/NGO industrial complex has completely captured the British state.” This is the same Liz Truss who, as foreign secretary in 2022, assured Parliament that she was “working very hard to secure his release.” Was she then unaware of his tweets? Or was she then posturing as a policy maker, whereas now she is trying to make a living as a YouTuber? (Yes, she is Dan Bongino in reverse.) The Conservatives’ shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, has also piled on Abd el-Fattah’s story, condemning the celebrities who campaigned for his release as “useful idiots.” Jenrick covets Badenoch’s job—and his plan to win it relies on outflanking her on crime and immigration.

Liberals and conservatives have politicized this story. Starmer—and the previous incarnation of Truss—treated Abd el-Fattah as a kind of mascot, a living totem of Britain’s enlightened attitudes toward political dissent in comparison with those of Middle Eastern dictatorships. Today’s version of Truss, and the rest of the populist right, are now holding him up as Exhibit A in their argument that the West needs to be tougher on Muslim immigration to Europe.

As ever, the challenge is to look beyond this ideological point-scoring and consider the case on its own merits. I was deeply unimpressed that one of Abd el-Fattah’s first public statements after his longed-for deliverance was to repost a complaint that Starmer had not publicly condemned Sisi’s dictatorship while announcing his release. Welcome to the grubby reality of international diplomacy! But if I had missed many of my child’s birthdays in detention, I might also find it hard to be gracious.

Still, British Jews have every right to question their state’s extraordinary efforts to free someone who has called for violence against them and who has recanted only in the vaguest terms. The Jewish community is under threat here: The aftermath of October 7 and the war in Gaza have led to more visible anti-Semitism in Britain, in many cases from self-declared Islamists. On Yom Kippur, a militant Islamist called Jihad Al-Shamie (in retrospect, the first name was a clue) killed one person and injured others in a stabbing attack on a synagogue in Manchester. Earlier this month, two men were convicted of plotting what authorities described as an “ISIS-inspired” atrocity in the same city. “Here in Manchester, we have the biggest Jewish community,” one of the plotters told an undercover police officer whom he believed to be a co-conspirator. “God willing we will degrade and humiliate them (in the worst way possible), and hit them where it hurts.” Social media is one of the key drivers and reinforcers of anti-Semitic extremism; tweets like Abd el-Fattah’s are not just harmless letting-off of steam.

Still, if he repeats such sentiments now that he lives in Britain, Abd el-Fattah could be subject to prosecution for incitement to violence, or hate speech. The British state has pursued people for less: See the recent prosecution against the gender-critical campaigner Graham Linehan—the case was eventually dropped—or the conviction of a woman named Lucy Connolly for posting that hotels housing asylum-seekers should be set on fire.

Taking away Abd el-Fattah’s British passport is another matter. Once granted, citizenship is citizenship, no matter how stupid or evil or thoughtless its holder turns out to be. I don’t want to live in a country where naturalized or joint citizens are treated as second-class Britons, forever on probation. Now that he has a UK passport, Alaa Abd el-Fattah is entitled to the protection of the British state, just like Liz Truss—or like Kemi Badenoch, for that matter, whose British citizenship rests on the coincidence of her Nigerian mother having given birth to her in London.

Yet you can take an inclusive view of British citizenship and still believe that people should be vetted before receiving it. Starmer’s post gushing about Abd el-Fattah’s arrival was catastrophically ill-judged, both in his assessment of this particular case and as a representation of his wider governing philosophy. Starmer, a former human-rights lawyer, approaches every problem with an arid obsession with process rather than outcome—as if, when people follow every dot and comma of the rules, nothing bad can happen and no one should complain.

The Abd el-Fattah decision follows this pattern. Starmer celebrated the bureaucratic machinations of this case—granting automatic citizenship by descent and then securing the end of Abd el-Fattah’s travel ban—without enough attention to the politics. Yes, he was failed by his officials and their lack of briefing. But he also suffered a personal failure of imagination: Is it such a stretch to ask whether a Middle Eastern activist raised among members of the Egyptian communist intelligentsia has any worrisome opinions on Israel or Jews? Part of Starmer’s pitch to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as leader of Labour was that his predecessor had turned a blind eye to anti-Semitism. (He eventually kicked Corbyn out of the party altogether for this offense.) But in the past two years, he has struggled to identify and police the line between legitimate criticism of the Israeli government and wider animus against Jews, often camouflaged as attacks on “Zionists.”

At the same time, populists on the right have begun to insist, in more and more explicit terms, that Muslims cannot be integrated into Europe because their values are too different—the grooming-gangs scandal is offered as evidence here—and because they feel more loyalty to the ummah than to the countries to which they have immigrated. That view ignores the many followers of moderate Islam, such as London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who have found no contradiction between their faith and Western liberalism. But the views of Abd el-Fattah punch that bruise.

Another case like this may not arrive again—not least because Britain’s current appetite for enforcing its values abroad is low. In June, Starmer cut the foreign-aid budget, and some of what remains is spent domestically anyway, on housing asylum seekers. Starmer’s home secretary, Shabana Mahmood—herself a British Muslim—has announced a drastic tightening of eligibility requirements for citizenship.

Starmer—and his Conservative predecessors—were right to call for Abd el-Fattah’s release. What was absurd, however, was to frame his arrival on British soil as an unalloyed blessing. Starmer was thinking like the procedure-obsessed human-rights lawyer he used to be, not the political and moral leader that Britain needs right now.</div>

            <div id="article-text">This article was updated on December 31, 2025 at 9:33am.

In the opening scene of the black comedy The Death of Stalin, a pianist in Moscow is told her orchestra is giving a command performance for Joseph Stalin, and refuses to play on political grounds. A frantic radio director, fearing he will be arrested or shot if he fails to produce the concert in time, begs her to reconsider, finally prevailing with an offer of 20,000 rubles.

Recently, the Trump administration faced a similar situation. After Donald Trump purported to rename the Kennedy Center after himself, the jazz musician Chuck Redd withdrew from a planned Christmas Eve concert. The administration’s response was somehow both more authoritarian and comic than the one in the movie.

The Kennedy Center’s president, Richard Grenell, announced that the Center intends to sue Redd for his impudence. Grennell’s letter threatening legal action depicts Redd as a sad loser suffering “dismal ticket sales and lack of donor support” and “lagging” attendance whose withdrawal, paradoxically, is “very costly to a non-profit Arts institution.”

One might presume the withdrawal of an obscure performer detested by the audience and donors alike would be easily brushed off, or even welcomed. Yet Grenell demands $1 million in damages.

Grenell’s letter argues not only that Redd has harmed the Center’s finances, but that his withdrawal constitutes an “act of intolerance” driven by “the sad bullying tactics employed by certain elements on the left.” Grenell vows, “We will not let them cancel shows without consequences.”

This is a strange interpretation of “cancel culture.” The concept, in its original form, described a tendency on the political left to react to minor ideological or linguistic offenses by demanding firings or social shunning, demands often reinforced by outraged social-media mobs. The problem with cancel culture—from the liberal standpoint, anyway—is that it is coercive.

But for an individual to decide not to participate in a politicized ritual at an artistic institution now renamed, Soviet-style, after the still-living head of its reigning personality cult is not coercive. Permitting individuals to choose which ideas they wish to endorse is the essence of liberalism.

The MAGA movement, of course, has no use for liberalism, which is why it naturally sees such an act of conscience as an attack. “The outrageous behavior is scarcely out of the ordinary for a political side less reliant on policy platforms and more reliant on bullets of deranged assassins,” fumes a column in Steve Bannon’s National Pulse, tweeted out by the official Kennedy Center social-media account.

In the minds of President Trump’s loyalists, refusing to genuflect to the great leader reflects the same general impulse as attempting to assassinate him. This was Stalin’s premise, too. Imposing the personality cult upon the state is designed not only to burnish the leader’s image, but to create opportunities to smoke out dissidents. Trump’s mania for renaming things after himself and turning his birthday into a national holiday celebrated with military parades forces individual members of the bureaucracy to choose between complying with his ego-gratifying demands or exposing themselves as the kind of officials who might decline illegal orders.

The comic aspect of the Kennedy Center threat is that Trump has little leverage over artists. He can fire a general who refuses to organize a parade for him, but he can’t make Lin-Manuel Miranda put Hamilton in the Kennedy Center.

The administration’s apparent plan to resolve this difficulty is to shame or browbeat members of the artistic community into performing there. “Any artist cancelling their show at the Trump Kennedy Center over political differences isn’t courageous or principled—they are selfish, intolerant, and have failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people,” the Center’s vice president of public relations told the New York Post.

Trump has treated last year’s election as eternal proof that he is the incarnation of the public will and that any opposition to him is a kind of alienation from the people. From this belief, it follows that performing in Trump’s cultural center is a public duty. But since the administration currently lacks the power to lock up artists who don’t comply, this demand is as silly as it is presumptuous.</div>

Europe should indeed correct its mistakes.  Mistake #1 being evolving into the planet&#39;s &quot;bedroom community&quot; where nearly everything of value is made elsewhere, by others.

There is plenty of manufacturing in the EU. More than in the USA, both in absolute numbers and as a GDP percentage. Why do you think the orange shitgibbon whines about trade deficit with the EU?

My theory is that no one ever learns important life lessons the easy way. It is always the hard way.

Let&#39;s not forget that this has happened because people like you voted for a rapist and pedophile for President.  One thing we can count on is that your &quot;theory&quot; will never be that you&#39;re to blame.

Ideally an unvaccinated kid should not be allowed to attend public schools unless there is an overwhelming medical reason (known allergy in the child) for not being vaccinated. That particular boat seems to have left, so perhaps we need to see some cases where the parents of a child who is in the chain that leads to damage or death in another child is sued for the damages. This would only be just...

You mean like it used to be until recently?

It might be an extreme one: unvaxxed Billy bursts into immuno-compromised Johnnie&#39;s otherwise sterile hospital room without a facemask because he&#39;s his best friend. Johnnie dies of measles and Billy had it at the time. Once the story started to roll, it would send the message.

When you have people in government creating doubt about the effectiveness of vaccines in general, then those people in government are fully responsible for the drop in vaccination rates.   The US government even has it in the preamble to the US Constitution...&quot;...to promote the general welfare...&quot;, and that says government should be doing things to improve things for the overall population.  While some doubt might be reasonable for NEW vaccines, the idea of vaccines overall has been proven to be a good thin

When you have Republicans saying they want things to be like their were in the 50s, then put an anti-vaxxer in charge of the nation&#39;s top health agency, what would you expect?

Whooping cough cases are also seeing a similar increase as well as deaths.

Why don&#39;t you go on CDC&#39;s website and see when the spike happened, which month of this year, and when the bulk of the cases were reported, then come back and tell us that a new administration&#39;s federal policies would have had anything to do with it.

Also go look at which state most of the cases are reported.  And ponder maybe there&#39;s something specific going on rather than your politically charged ramblings.

The spike happened in an area where the measles vaccination rate is low, which makes it easy to have an outbreak. The vaccination rate is low because there has been since September 1st, 2023 a broad &quot;exemption&quot; from vaccination due to reasons of religious-based willful ignorance:

Since September 1, 2003, Texas law has allowed parents to exempt their children from school-required vaccines for reasons of conscience, which includes religious and philosophical beliefs. This is a much broader standard than states that only allow narrow medical exemptions.  So, it is the policy of the party of the current administration as practiced in one of the states that is best aligned with the raging idiocy of that administration emanating from its leaders,  ratfuck jr. and donold j. trump.But pl

So, it is the policy of the party of the current administration as practiced in one of the states that is best aligned with the raging idiocy of that administration emanating from its leaders,  ratfuck jr. and donold j. trump.

Apparently vaccination rates are dropping by quite a bit: https://www.washingtonpost.com... [washingtonpost.com]

And parents will not know the extent of their stupidity because the CDC won&#39;t be collecting data like they did in the past. Immuno-compromised kids will lose.

From Ten countries in the Americas report measles outbreaks in 2025 [paho.org] we can see that Mexico and Canada already had more cases back in August than the US does now at the end of the year despite them having much smaller populations than the US.

Countries with the highest case numbers include Canada (4,548 cases), Mexico (3,911 cases), and the United States (1,356 cases).

I find it interesting that ABC chose not to mention this pertinent information, makes me wonder what other news they&#39;re suppressing.

And the other half are unvaccinated Americans who visit abroad and bring it back, infecting whole communities.

Likely in the new year, the CDC and WHO will remove the US from the list of countries that have &quot;eradicated&quot; measles.

Which also happens to coincide (who knows maybe nothing) with the largest spike in immigrant influx. In 1989 to 1991, Immigration was even higher than the years between 1900 to 1910. And yes, I know the population was smaller back then, but the surrounding years to 1989 to 1991 didn&#39;t have anywhere near this spike.While I do understand that anti-vaxxer children are probably overrepresented in this number, even if you ware vaccinated it will just lower the chances, not eliminate all cases.

It&#39;s hard to tell because the author doesn&#39;t seem to have worked very hard to find out why.  Yes, he tried to contact some of the incoming Mayor&#39;s staff, but he didn&#39;t contact the people responsible for security.  That would be the police department and maybe Homeland Security.  An actual reporter may have gotten further.  No offense to him, but it doesn&#39;t look like the author does much of that.

Why not both? The stupidity is clear. But the malice could be pretending to do something while never checking or even caring about effectiveness, and thereby giving a false sense of security. I would call that &quot;indifferent maliciousness&quot;.

Be glad they didn’t generalize their ban further:

“Those Raspberry Pi’s and Flipper Zero’s have at least one thing in common: transistors.  Ban *THOSE* from the events!” /s

Of course, they&#39;ll still let everyone to bring their smartphones so they can fill social media with selfies with the new major.

We&#39;ll just ignore the fact that they&#39;re far more advanced or dangerous than either a Raspberry Pi or a Flipper Zero are in the right hands.

What about orange-pies or my old Jetson nano?

Police &quot;discretion&quot; already does that.  Everywhere.  All the time.  At every level.

Why would anyone bring a Raspberry Pi to a mayoral inauguration?  Maybe that could happen unwittingly, being embedded in some media equipment or whatnot, but someone knowingly walking around with a RPi?

Doesn&#39;t make sense that anyone would imagine this is an actual &quot;security&quot; problem.

.. and we are not focused on Mamdani&#39;s destructive planned policies.  Nor his wacko inauguration, virtually in hiding. [fox5ny.com]

Nearly everything delivered by USPS is junk mail.  There has to be a better option than a failed organization surviving solely off spam and subsidies.

It&#39;s not strictly required, it&#39;s merely allowed.

That said, things like legal documents (real estate tax bills, jury duty summons, health insurance cards, etc) go through the mail as letters. And while a lot of their revenue is junk mail, they also do a lot of Amazon&#39;s deliveries for them. Especially the 3rd party stuff.

You&#39;re correct about the Constitution. However, as it relates to packages, Denmark isn&#39;t shutting down package delivery, just letters. For those who *must* deliver a letter, they could still ship it as a package, it just might cost more.

Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution says that &quot;The Congress shall have the power...To establish Post Offices and post Roads;&quot;

https://www.archives.gov/found... [archives.gov]

This doesn&#39;t require Congress to do so, it only gives it the authority to do so.

The USA is no Denmark. Lot&#39;s of unconnected between the Mississippi and the Pacific coast. Postal is a service they rely on.

Stop propagating the Republican myth that the USPS is a failed organization - it is not, and the only reason the Republicans push that bullshit is to further their control over it, and justify selling it off.

USPS is the most reliable and universal delivery service. It works. UPS and FedEx are true shit.I&#39;ve had more problems with my packages due to USPS than either of those carriers. UPS hands off small packages to USPS and this makes them take longer to be delivered. If you want to see how incompetent USPS is, put a very wrong zip code on a small package and watch it bounce between states multiple times because they have no logic to detect that.None of this necessarily means the USPS should be dissolved, but your idea of their competence is wholly unwarranted.

You must live in a different place than I do. The USPS has terrible hours, long lines, and when it&#39;s lunchtime (a peak time to go to the Post Office) workers go on lunch break, rather than scheduling lunch breaks around peak times. By contrast, UPS and FedEx stores have hours that accommodate their customers, and shorter lines.

I personally do NOT have the same warm, fuzzy feelings about the USPS that you do.

Some commenters here seem to be in need of some factual information.

PostNord AB is a private company and has been for some years, so the idea that this is a government service being withdrawn is untrue.

Danish law requires everyone to have access to postal services for letters. Therefore another private company, DAO, will provide postal delivery to everyone in Denmark and the ability for everyone in Denmark to send letters from DAO service points (in shops, etc).

A significant subsidy is being provided to DAO to enable a universal delivery service.

DAO will be the national postal service for international treaty (UPU) purposes, enabling letter and small parcel post between Denmark and other countries according to UPU agreements.

Fun fact for you - slashdot doesn&#39;t care as long as title is clickbaity and text irrelevant enough...

Postnord is owned by Swedish state and Danish state

Is this another case of &quot;private company that is actually wholly or mostly owned by the state&quot; like it is here in Finland?

Or is it an actual proper fully privatized company?

With the explosion of delivery, postal services should be swimming in cash. Sounds to me like the profitable bits were sold off while the taxpayers end up paying for the rest.

At least here in Finland, there&#39;s an option to receive a lot of mail electronically. For example official mail, a lot of billing services etc just send it electronically to Finnish Post, who informs you you have digital mail and you can read it via a browser or an app.

Granted government also has their own app that covers most of the communications you will have with national bureaucracy. Everything from taxation related mail to things like car registration can be handled there directly.

It became too expensive in the end. I got a few until last year, I would get a 2-3 Christmas cards, and I would send the same. We kept it up for the nostalgia but decided to skip it last year because the price of a letter was just stupid.I know of people who would send out wedding invitations, but spend a day driving around and delivering themselves instead of mailing them and only us the post for those too far away.IIRC the price was in the end over 5$ pr letter as a minimum. Where I live it looked like th

Instead of talking about their new laser, lets talk about the genocide and war crimes Israel have committed against the people in Gaza. 70,000 dead, including 20,000 children in two years. Many more in the preceding years.

Nearly 40 aid organisations will no longer be permitted to operate in Gaza come January 1st.

Israel wants land. Israel will starve and kill all Gazans to get that land. Land that was never theirs.

I put it to you that Benjamin Netanyahu is in the same league of mass-murdering evil leaders as

you mean the illegaly occupied territories? that&#39;s their land.

Palestinians however have chosen war over piece consistently for 90 years.Wrong. Israel funded Hamas&#39;s attacks on Israel because Israel is the one who has consistently chosen violence over peace. Israel has literally never been one of the good guys at any point in it&#39;s existence.

Wrong. Israel funded Hamas&#39;s attacks on Israel because Israel is the one who has consistently chosen violence over peace. Israel has literally never been one of the good guys at any point in it&#39;s existence.

The evidence says otherwise.Netanyahu has bragged repeatedly about making sure Hamas gets funded because it&#39;s part of his strategy on Gaza. The war criminal has outright told us that he&#39;s a war criminal, on public television, and you&#39;re in favor of his genocide.

Would under seige be language more to your liking?

They didn&#39;t have free import or export ability, so it definitely feels like a seige.

Not according to any fucking map drawn in your lifetime. You might as well say Americans should go back to England (I know they&#39;re not mostly from there, that&#39;s my point)

&quot;Invade&quot; is a very gentle word to describe what they did.

It is quite unclear who invaded what and on whose orders.

Hamas is a product of Israel. It was brought into existence with a lot of help by the very same Zionist factions of Israeli politics that rule Israel today. They did so with two goals in mind. One, to dilute the influence of the Arafat political movement, and two, to create a continuous disruption of the peace process, which the fans of the Eretz Israel lebensraum policies (of which the current PM, mr. nazi putinyahu is a prominent one) have always be

Ah yes, killing about 100 civilians (a disgusting attack, that should never have happened), deserves a genocide of literal millions, thatâ(TM)s a proportionate and reasonable response.

Most genocides don&#39;t include an offer to stop as soon as the other side returns hostages. This is at the most an &quot;easily negotiated against genocide&quot;. I understand the urge to hold Jews to an impossible double standard (and there&#39;s a word for that) but imagine if it were your loved ones being kidnapped and tortured, and what you wouldn&#39;t be willing to do to get them back.

No, they never offered anything official ... even though they knew for 99% certain that it would never be signed without a right of return. That 1% chance it would be signed meant Israel can not and will not offer anything real.

A slow motion ethnic cleansing of greater Israel (with maybe some speedup if there is a WW3) has and will continue to be the only plan which is politically acceptable in Israel, the rest is just distraction. That&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t significant forces inside Israel for other solutions, but they are more easily distracted than the Greater Israelites.

I feel like we need to step back occasionally and just notice how weird this whole situation is.

What other examples are there of states based on ethnicity that we find acceptable? The notion of an Islamic State would never be accepted, but a Jewish State? And isn&#39;t the implication that Jews need their own country because they can&#39;t get along with anyone else, as proven by the fact that Israel practices apartheid?

Let&#39;s also talk about how they must be fucking saints to dump all this money into shooting down incoming rockets and drones. If an enemy launched a sustained rocket and drone strike on the US, we would push them back to the stone age if that&#39;s what it took to stop the attacks. Shooting down incoming munitions? That&#39;s far too kind a response.

Oh, it&#39;s fucking hilarious.  People cry genocide and then cry to keep the borders shut.  With that in mind, it becomes clear that the left are insane liars, or the left are genocidal maniacs.

All they need to do is put it on a track. Somehow I got the idea from the summary that they were drones with lasers but the image pretty clearly shows a heavy device mounted on a platform.

What are they going to do put one on every rooftop? Looks like there will still be a lot of shrapnel if they blow them up in the air.

Lasers need a honking big power supply, think 20ft container size. Capacitors to drive it are juicy on radars, and the emf spike is triangulated. Overdriven lasers, wear out. There is a lifetime, and it is not huge, maybe a low as 100 shots. Weather and rain. 5km range, but 1 km would be more like it.  Drones and glide bombs are SO cost effective in wiping out both tanks and container sized trucks. So basically expensive kit, restricted use.  Probably best to guard Patriot like million bucks a pop systems. Best bang for buck is getting out of war and into peace.

Peace isn&#39;t the goal. The goal is to keep ramping things up as an excuse for genocide and ethnic cleansing.

The main reason that Israel helped Hamas come to power, and then funded them, was to ensure that no moderate who was pushing for a two state solution could make any progress.

It&#39;s also designed to stop drones and glide bombs, so I don&#39;t know why you would pick those as your example threats.

https://www.aju.edu/events/jew... [aju.edu]

Hats off to Israel for taking a huge step towards solving the dangers of drones.

Here&#39;s something from my country that I can be proud of (while I&#39;ve got many things to be ashamed of... thanks to our stupid, bad government... I really hope they get dethroned soon)

seems easy to defeat, just make ur bombs reflective. i&#39;m sure it will still absorb some energy, but enough to make it explode in air? would it take multiple pulses there by lowering the number of objects that can be targeted?

Extremely manouvrable ground skimming UAVs will be cheap tech in the near future. Unless you mount the laser on balloons, they won&#39;t do shit against those.

The war in the Ukraine has massively accelerated low cost weapon development.

One thing a lot of people following Ukraine war seem to miss is that these small drones are awful in forested areas and urban areas. They&#39;re only as powerful as they are in large open spaces, like Eurasian steppe. Which is what covers much of front line in Ukraine.

This is one of the reasons why even minor towns have become near impenetrable, and most drone activity now focuses on attacking long and open supply routes to the front lines over actual front lines which tend to go through small patches of forest

My country has more border with Russians than the rest of EU combined. Keeping dense forests with minimal road infrastructure on our eastern border has been a project of almost a century.

Because forests don&#39;t just stop drones. They&#39;re also really good at stopping armor. They&#39;re also really good at hiding troops from bombers.

Iran has announced the first deployment of its disco-ball drone.

500 people were critically injured during the first clash between the disco-ball drone and Israel&#39;s drone defense laser.  Officials said  &quot;the collateral damage over a wide area was significant and is something we&#39;re working to reduce&quot;.

UK DragonFire - anti-drone laser has been shooting down Russian drones for months ...

The main point for African countries is not catching up or narrowing a gap, but seeing real-world improvements in the lives of millions. Do you think some kid who&#39;s able to do their homework at night for the first time is going to give a shit that Belgium&#39;s economy has also improved over the last year?

>> And Starlink is made by Elon Musk, and Chromebooks (and transparent translation) are produced by GoogleIf you think this is how education works in Africa&#39;s countries, go and build yourself an OLPC sucessor.Hint: it does not work that way.

Starlink is prohibited from operating in South Africa by the South African government, thus depriving millions of poor rural people of broadband access.

The reason for the ban is that Starlink is required to hand over 30% of the equity in its local business to a select group of locals, based on their race.

Not on the same cost basis as Chinese manufacturers.

that&#39;s not how industry works.Especially semiconductors.

The African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa has caused massive corruption across the economy. As such it is a warning against &#39;socialism&#39; - state owned monopolies are horrible, and such &#39;state ownership&#39; is the policy of the ANC.

The fantastic thing about the rise of cheap solar and storage is that it strips away the ability of corrupt and incompetent governments and power companies to cause so much harm. See also: Pakistan, where the deployments of behind-the-meter solar have been even larger as a percentage of grid capacity.

The fantastic thing about the rise of cheap solar and storage is that it strips away the ability of corrupt and incompetent governments and power companies to cause so much harm.It&#39;s easy for them to outlaw solar and battery installations, either directly or effectively, and then use those laws for selective enforcement and engage in asset forfeiture. So, no, not really.

&quot;The solar surge does little to address the most pressing social and economic problems of developing countries like South Africa, the need to generate new jobs for millions of young citizens&quot; is just out and out bullshit. That&#39;s only looking at first-order effects, yet cheap energy is famously most important for its second-order economic benefits. If energy is cheap, everything else gets cheaper; if its price rises, so does the price of everything else. When prices get more affordable over time, productivity can improve.

As I&#39;ve mentioend a couple of times in recent posts, there are massive and profound benefits for people in sub-Saharan Africa from the current rapid and remarkable deployment of cheap solar and battery installations. These include: explosive growth in two and three wheel transport, leading to oil demand destruction (fuel for two and three wheelers is a dominant fraction of current consumption in many African cities), rapid improvements in air quality and thus respiratory health, big cuts in balance-of-payments drains for national economies, stabilised household finances as daily unpredictable cash drains for fuel become stabilised amortised capex, massive cuts to risks and time spent by women and girls in particular eg for water collection, etc. No more kerosene heating at home means a rapid drop in respiratory conditions from indoor air pollution. Kids can study after dark, meaning better educational outcomes. Vaccine storage becomes much lower risk because small clinics have reliable power. Rural African communities can narrow the gap with urban. These all lead to substantial economic improvements for everyone.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh does not seem happy that his name has become synonymous with racist immigration enforcement. In September, the justice wrote that Hispanic residents’ “apparent ethnicity” could be a “relevant factor” in federal agents’ decision to stop them and demand proof of citizenship. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection promptly seized upon his opinion as a license to stop any Hispanic person on the basis of race—often with excessive, even sadistic force—and detain them until they proved their lawful presence. Law professor Anil Kalhan termed these encounters “Kavanaugh stops,” and the name swiftly caught on as evidence mounted that they had become standard practice across the country. Lawyers also provided courts with evidence that Kavanaugh had sanitized the reality of this practice to the point of fiction. The justice claimed that these were “brief investigative stops” and that any lawful resident would be “promptly” released. In truth, federal agents brutalized, kidnapped, and tormented people—including many U.S. citizens—simply because of their ethnicity, even after they asserted legal status.

Now it appears that Kavanaugh has some regrets. Last Tuesday, the justice backtracked from his previous position without quite acknowledging the retreat. He did so in a concurrence to the Supreme Court’s decision to block President Donald Trump’s deployment of the National Guard—a case that does not even directly concern “Kavanaugh stops.” In a footnote, he declared that race and ethnicity could not be “considerations” when officers make “immigration stops or arrests.” That directly conflicts with his earlier assertion that officers can use race and ethnicity as a “factor” when deciding whom to detain. The two positions cannot be reconciled. Yet Kavanaugh did not admit that he had changed his position; he simply pretended that the law in this area was “clear,” when he himself muddied it just months earlier.

On this week’s episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed this strange, tacit walk-back.

Dahlia Lithwick: It’s the icing on top of the Christmas cake that Brett Kavanaugh, in an unrelated discussion, gave himself the gift of forgiveness for his notorious “Kavanaugh stops” opinion.

Mark Joseph Stern: I think he is begging us to please cease and desist calling them “Kavanaugh stops.” This footnote is buried in the opinion and doesn’t really have anything to do with it. He just says: By the way, this conflict is about immigration stops. Then he segues into his view on the law around immigration stops, which he claims to be “longstanding and clear.” He writes: “The Fourth Amendment requires that immigration stops must be based on reasonable suspicion of illegal presence, stops must be brief, arrests must be based on probable cause, and officers must not employ excessive force. Moreover, the officers must not make interior immigration stops or arrests based on race or ethnicity.”

Wow! Immigration stops can’t be based on race? What a concept! A concept that you, Brett Kavanaugh, rejected just a few months ago, in September, in the Vasquez Perdomo case. Back then, you wrote that immigration stops could be at least partly based on race or ethnicity, and that a person’s appearance as Latino could be one reason for them to be stopped by immigration officers.

I wonder what has changed since September.

Well, I think he is trying to rid “Kavanaugh stops” from the discourse, which is never going to happen. And maybe he’s trying to send a message to the Trump administration to cool it down. Because now we have CBP Chief Greg Bovino declaring that agents can engage in racial profiling. Bovino has even said that every single person in this country has to walk around with proof of citizenship or else face arrest on suspicion of being undocumented. Kavanaugh is probably a little unnerved that all these violent, racist arrests and abductions are taking his name. He doesn’t want to be remembered by history as this great villain who greenlit the worst wave of violent racial profiling by the federal government in ages. But this footnote changes nothing. He cannot walk back what he has unleashed.

This goes to all the quibbles that we surfaced about the shadow docket when Vasquez Perdomo came out. Because if the justices are going to go ahead and reverse precedent about immigration stops, and then their decision gets operationalized by the Trump administration, they can’t say: Oh, sorry, we didn’t mean that. They certainly can’t do it in a case that does not directly relate back to “Kavanaugh stops.” So this is weird dicta in a random case that is trying to undo crappy but unfortunately enforceable doctrine. And Kavanaugh is just like: No, it’s the shadow docket—I can do what I want! I get a do-over. I get takesies-backsies. We’re now at full Etch A Sketch: I’m making law. I’m breaking law. I’m changing law.

I’ve seen some commentators praise Kavanaugh for sort of responding to criticism here. I do not think he gets any points. He did what he did in Vasquez Perdomo; he should have foreseen the consequences. Every intelligent observer understood what was going to happen when his opinion dropped in September. Now he seems to regret it—though he still hasn’t apologized directly or acknowledged that he was wrong, and is pretending that what he said earlier is consonant with what he’s saying now. Too little, too late.

            <h2>One State Supreme Court’s Lazy “Shortcut” Erases Civil Rights</h2>
            <p><strong>News and Politics - Slate Magazine | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/12/colorado-supreme-court-civil-rights-constitution.html?via=rss">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This piece was originally published in the Behind the Bench newsletter on state constitutional law. Behind the Bench is published by the State Law Research Initiative.

It can be astonishing, and more than a little depressing, to see the lengths some courts go to avoid upholding basic constitutional rights. In June, I wrote about how the North Carolina Supreme Court’s Republican majority dilutes civil rights by requiring claimants to prove that challenged state actions, including discriminatory laws, are “unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.” The problem, as liberal Justice Anita Earls pointed out, is that “either the statute is consistent with the constitution or not,” and the “notion that you have to somehow establish that beyond a reasonable doubt makes no sense”—except, of course, as an excuse to erode civil rights.

Today, I bring your attention to the Colorado Supreme Court, which this month reaffirmed an inexplicable quirk of its excessive sentencing jurisprudence that preemptively extinguishes constitutional rights for entire categories of people. The court declares certain crimes to be “per se grave or serious,” which in practice means that no one convicted of such crimes can ever challenge their sentence, no matter its severity. The long-standing rule is both wholly illogical and blatantly unconstitutional (in the sense that it erases constitutional rights), but there is some good news: It appears that two justices are finally ready to, in their words, “deep six this concept.”

Colorado’s state constitution prohibits “cruel and unusual” punishment, including excessive or “disproportionate” prison terms. To assess excessive punishment claims, Colorado courts begin by comparing “the gravity or seriousness of the offense to the harshness of the penalty.” Normally, Colorado case law takes a relatively capacious view of how a crime’s “gravity” should be measured. It accounts not just for the offense and its elements but also for potentially mitigating factors such as whether the person “was an accessory, complicitor, or principal,” along with the person’s “culpability and motive.” In theory, this definition captures how personal characteristics (such as youth, disability, or addiction) and other circumstances (such as the role of group dynamics, poverty, or coercive relationships) might reduce someone’s culpability and factor into the constitutional analysis.

But for some offenses, the Colorado Supreme Court—and only the Colorado Supreme Court—has devised what it calls “the ‘per se’ shortcut.” Under this rule, the court “designate[s] certain crimes ‘per se grave or serious,’ ” which, the court says, renders a sentence all but “impervious to attack on proportionality grounds.” In other words, the court’s justices have decided they will not do their jobs for people who have certain convictions. Rather than actually assess excessive punishment claims in light of all the factors the law requires, they will just assume that these claims fail, giving prosecutors and legislators free rein to pursue the sort of punitive excess that has fueled mass incarceration for decades.

And it’s not like this rule has been reserved for what might intuitively be the most violent, high-culpability crimes. Robbery, for example, remains “per se grave or dangerous” even though the circumstances under which robberies take place vary wildly, as do the characteristics of the people who commit them (more on that below). Even worse, for nearly 30 years Colorado courts put all drug offenses, including mere possession, on this list until a “clarify[ing]” decision in 2019 finally changed that. (It took decades for the Colorado Supreme Court to realize that it “makes little sense to automatically treat the sale of a large quantity of cocaine by the leader of a drug cartel as equally grave or serious as the mere possession of a very small quantity of cocaine by a drug addict who is not involved in sale or distribution.”)

The court concedes that this “shortcut” is “unique to Colorado law” and that it “eliminates a longstanding layer of due process for criminal defendants.” Nonetheless, it remains on the books because it supposedly “saves time” and promotes “consistency.” I would submit that “saving time” is never a good reason to dispense with constitutional rights, but the court’s claims to efficiency are dubious in any case. Now, instead of properly analyzing its cruel and unusual clause, the court spends its time hopelessly trying to figure out what on earth “per se grave or serious” actually means and what offenses it applies to. With this rule in place, and with prosecutors thirsty to invoke it, the first part of every excessive punishment analysis turns into Tom Cruise cross-examining Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men: Q: “Grave Danger?” A: [Raises eyebrow] “Is there another kind?”

But there is a glimmer of hope. In People v. Kennedy, decided earlier this month, Justices Carlos Samour and Richard Gabriel “specially concurred” to advocate nixing the per se grave or serious shortcut.

In Kennedy, the court stood by its shortcut and upheld the 24-year prison term at issue. But it also held that vehicular homicide–DUI is not “per se grave or serious” because it is a strict liability crime with no specific intent element. “When a crime requires no proof of mens rea,” the court said, “it is impossible to evaluate the culpability of defendants convicted of the offense under every factual scenario.”

It is good that the court declined to expand the shortcut to cover a new offense, but the analytical problem here is that the same reasoning applies to crimes that do require proof of intent. To use an example mentioned above, the court thinks that people who commit robbery have sufficiently high culpability “under every factual scenario”—a conclusion that can only be understood as the willful ignorance of reality. Just a few other facts one might want to know: How old is the person? Are they a youth or emerging adult under age 25, and therefore more susceptible to peer pressure and impulsive decisionmaking? Was the person coerced by an abusive partner or authority figure? Did the person use a weapon and if so what kind? Was it a gun that turned out to be fake? Did the person act out of desperation? Was anyone physically harmed? The list goes on. To say that virtually no punishment could be unconstitutionally severe for all robbery convictions across all factual scenarios is absurd.

Justices Samour and Gabriel, at least, have started to push back. They argued that “easier and faster isn’t always better,” and that such “superficial proportionality review” is inappropriate when constitutional rights are at stake. Ultimately, they found “the drawbacks of per se designations far outweigh any purported benefits.”

Of course, Samour and Gabriel are right, but I’d add another critique: This constitutional “shortcut” makes absolutely no sense. Recall what it is ostensibly a shortcut to: comparing the gravity and/or seriousness of a criminal offense (including, per Colorado case law, characteristics of the offender) with the severity of the punishment imposed for it. In this context, neither “grave” nor “serious” is a bright-line, binary category. They exist along a spectrum. There is no being “not serious” up to a point before falling over a line into “seriousness.” This isn’t bankruptcy. This is a test about whether certain prison terms are too severe; one would think or at least hope that the Colorado Supreme Court is not perfectly fine with incarceration for wholly unserious crimes. To say that an offense is automatically “serious” or “grave,” therefore, means absolutely nothing, and it certainly doesn’t help understand if the resulting criminal punishment is fair.

What the court must mean, then, is that some crimes are sufficiently serious, but that only makes sense relative to the punishment imposed—a fact irrelevant to the court’s per se designation.

Perhaps I am thinking too hard about this. Such an arbitrary, court-created rule—born out of some combination of cowardly deference to extreme punishments and sheer laziness, and that even prosecutors agree is “a weird concept anyway”—doesn’t deserve that much credit. The point is: The Colorado Supreme Court’s rule, it turns out, is less a shortcut and more a barrier to protecting fundamental constitutional rights that should be torn down.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Feature In the early 1990s, internetworking wonks realized the world was not many years away from running out of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addresses, the numbers needed to identify any device connected to the public internet. Noting booming interest in the internet, the internet community went looking for ways to avoid an IP address shortage that many feared would harm technology adoption and therefore the global economy.

A possible fix arrived in December 1995 in the form of RFC 1883, the first definition of IPv6, the planned successor to IPv4.

The most important change from IPv4 to IPv6 was moving from 32-bit to 128-bit addresses, a decision that increased the available pool of IP addresses from around 4.3 billion to over 340 undecillion – a 39-digit number. IPv6 was therefore thought to have future-proofed the internet, because nobody could imagine humanity would ever need more than a handful of undecillion IP addresses, never mind the entire range available under IPv6.

As billions of devices and people came online, first using PCs and then wielding smartphones, conventional wisdom assumed that network operators would move to IPv6 rather than persist with IPv4.

Yet according to data from Google, the Asia Pacific Network Information Center (APNIC), and Cloudflare, less than half of all netizens use IPv6 today.

To understand why, know that IPv6 also suggested other, rather modest, changes to the way networks operate.

&quot;IPv6 was an extremely conservative protocol that changed as little as possible,&quot; APNIC chief scientist Geoff Huston told The Register. &quot;It was a classic case of mis-design by committee.&quot;

And that notional committee made one more critical choice: IPv6 was not backward-compatible with IPv4, meaning users had to choose one or the other – or decide to run both in parallel.

For many, the decision of which protocol to use was easy because IPv6 didn&#39;t add features that represented major improvements.

&quot;One big surprise to me was how few features went into IPv6 in the end, aside from the massive expansion of address space,&quot; said Bruce Davie, a veteran computer scientist recently honored with a lifetime achievement award by the Association for Computing Machinery&#39;s Special Interest Group on Data Communications, which lauded him for &quot;fundamental contributions in networking systems through design, standardization, and commercialization of network protocols and systems.&quot;

Davie said many of the security, plug-and-play, and quality of service features that didn&#39;t make it into IPv6 were eventually implemented in IPv4, further reducing the incentive to adopt the new protocol. &quot;Given the small amount of new functionality in v6, it&#39;s not so surprising that deployment has been a 30 year struggle,&quot; he said.

Another innovation that meant IPv6 made less sense was network address translation (NAT), which allows many devices to share a single public IPv4 address. NAT meant IPv4 network operators could connect thousands of devices with a single IP address, meaning their existing IP addresses became more useful.

&quot;These solutions were relatively easy to deploy, aligned with existing expertise, and avoided large-scale infrastructure changes,&quot; said Alvaro Vives, manager of the learning and development team at RIPE NCC, the regional internet registry for 76 nations across Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia.

Because NAT stalled IPv6 adoption, vendors didn&#39;t rally behind the new protocol.

&quot;Migration costs, complexity, and training requirements remain high, while short-term ROI is low,&quot; Gartner distinguished VP analyst Andrew Lerner told The Register. &quot;Performance parity across applications and devices is inconsistent, and some organizations even disable IPv6 for better performance. Lack of dual-stack support in legacy infrastructure is another barrier,&quot; he added.

While IPv6 didn&#39;t take off as expected, it&#39;s not fair to say it failed.

&quot;IPv6 wasn&#39;t about turning IPv4 off, but about ensuring the internet could continue to grow without breaking,&quot; said John Curran, president and CEO of the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN).

&quot;In fact, IPv4&#39;s continued viability is largely because IPv6 absorbed that growth pressure elsewhere – particularly in mobile, broadband, and cloud environments,&quot; he added. &quot;In that sense, IPv6 succeeded where it was needed most, and must be regarded as a success.&quot;

RIPE NCC&#39;s Alvaro Vives agrees. &quot;What IPv6 got right was its long-term design,&quot; he told The Register. &quot;It provides a vast address space that allows networks to be planned more simply and consistently. This has enabled innovation, from large mobile networks to the Internet of Things and advanced routing techniques such as Segment Routing over IPv6.&quot;

Gartner&#39;s Lerner thinks the time has come for organizations to develop detailed IPv6 migration plans.

&quot;Validate application compatibility, and ensure new infrastructure supports IPv6,&quot; he advised. &quot;Pilot deployments and lab testing with DNS64/NAT64 are recommended. Over time, IPv6 adoption will accelerate as private IPv4 space depletes and cloud providers introduce pricing models that favor IPv6.&quot;

APNIC&#39;s Huston, however, thinks that IPv6 has become less relevant to the wider internet.

&quot;I would argue that we actually found a far better outcome along the way,&quot; he told The Register. &quot;NATS forced us to think about network architectures in an entirely different way.&quot;

That new way is encapsulated in a new technology called Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC), that doesn&#39;t require client devices to always have access to a public IP address.

&quot;We are proving to ourselves that clients don&#39;t need permanent assignment of IP address, which makes the client side of network far cheaper, more flexible, and scalable,&quot; he said.

Huston thinks IPv6 has also become less relevant to servers.

&quot;These days the Domain Name Service (DNS) is the service selector, not the IP address,&quot; Huston told The Register. &quot;The entire security framework of today&#39;s Internet is name based and the world of authentication and channel encryption is based on service names, not IP addresses.&quot;

&quot;So folk use IPv6 these days based on cost: If the cost of obtaining more IPv4 addresses to fuel bigger NATs is too high, then they deploy IPv6. Not because it&#39;s better, but if they are confident that they can work around IPv6&#39;s weaknesses then in a largely name based world there is no real issue in using one addressing protocol or another as the transport underlay.&quot;

But there are plenty of organizations that still see a need for IPv6. Huawei sought 2.56 decillion IPv6 addresses and Starlink appears to have acquired150 sextillion, which is helping to push more countries past 50 percent IPv6 adoption. ®

            <h2>Everybody has a theory about why Nvidia dropped $20B on Groq - they're mostly wrong</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-31</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This summer, AI chip startup Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of $6.9 billion. Just three months later, Nvidia celebrated the holidays by dropping nearly three times that to license its technology and squirrel away its talent.

In the days that followed, the armchair AI gurus of the web have been speculating wildly as to how Nvidia can justify spending $20 billion to get Groq’s tech and people.

Pundits believe Nvidia knows something we don&#39;t. Theories run the gamut from the deal signifying Nvidia intends to ditch HBM for SRAM, a play to secure additional foundry capacity from Samsung, or an attempt to quash a potential competitor. Some hold water better than others, and we certainly have a few of our own.

Nvidia paid $20 billion to non-exclusively license Groq&#39;s intellectual property, which includes its language processing units (LPUs) and accompanying software libraries.

Groq&#39;s LPUs form the foundation of its high-performance inference-as-a-service offering, which it will keep and continue to operate without interruption after the deal closes.

The arrangement is clearly engineered to avoid regulatory scrutiny. Nvidia isn&#39;t buying Groq, it&#39;s licensing its tech. Except… it&#39;s totally buying Groq.

How else to describe a deal that sees Groq’s CEO Jonathan Ross and president Sunny Madra move to Nvidia, along with most of its engineering talent?

Sure, Groq is technically sticking around as an independent company with Simon Edwards at the helm as its new CEO, but with much of its talent gone, it&#39;s hard to see how the chip startup survives long-term.

The argument that Nvidia just wiped a competitor off the board therefore works. Whether that move was worth $20 billion is another matter, given it could provoke an antitrust lawsuit.

One prominent theory about Nvidia’s motives is that Groq’s LPUs use static random access memory (SRAM), which is orders of magnitude faster than the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) found in GPUs today.

A single HBM3e stack can achieve about 1 TB/s of memory bandwidth per module and 8 TB/s per GPU today. The SRAM in Groq&#39;s LPUs can be 10 to 80 times faster.

Since large language model (LLM) inference is predominantly bound by memory bandwidth, Groq can achieve stupendously fast token generation rates. In Llama 3.3 70B, the benchmarkers at Artificial Analysis report that Groq&#39;s chips can churn out 350 tok/s. Performance is even better when running a mixture of experts models, like gpt-oss 120B, where the chips managed 465 tok/s.

We&#39;re also in the middle of a global memory shortage and demand for HBM has never been higher. So, we understand why some might look at this deal and think Groq could help Nvidia cope with the looming memory crunch.

The simplest answer is often the right one – just not this time.

Sorry to have to tell you this, but there&#39;s nothing special about SRAM. It&#39;s in basically every modern processor, including Nvidia&#39;s chips.

SRAM also has a pretty glaring downside. It&#39;s not exactly what you&#39;d call space efficient. We&#39;re talking, at most, a few hundred megabytes per chip compared to 36 GB for a 12-high HBM3e stack for a total of 288 GB per GPU.

Groq&#39;s LPUs have just 230 MB of SRAM each, which means you need hundreds or even thousands of them just to run a modest LLM. At 16-bit precision, you&#39;d need 140 GB of memory to hold the model weights and an additional 40 GB for every 128,000 token sequence.

Groq needed 574 LPUs stitched together using a high-speed interconnect fabric to run Llama 70B.

You can get around this by building a bigger chip – each of Cerebras&#39; WSE-3 wafers features more than 40 GB of SRAM on board, but these chips are the size of a dinner plate and consume 23 kilowatts. Anyway, Groq hasn&#39;t gone this route.

Suffice it to say, if Nvidia wanted to make a chip that uses SRAM instead of HBM, it didn&#39;t need to buy Groq to do it.

So, what did Nvidia throw money at Groq for?

Our best guess is that it was really for Groq&#39;s &quot;assembly line architecture.&quot; This is essentially a programmable data flow design built with the express purpose of accelerating the linear algebra calculations computed during inference.

Most processors today use a Von Neumann architecture. Instructions are fetched from memory, decoded, executed, and then written to a register or stored in memory. Modern implementations introduce things like branch prediction, but the principles are largely the same.

Data flow works on a different principle. Rather than a bunch of load-store operations, data flow architectures essentially process data as it&#39;s streamed through the chip.

As Groq explains it, these data conveyor belts &quot;move instructions and data between the chip&#39;s SIMD (single instruction/multiple data) function units.&quot;

&quot;At each step of the assembly process, the function unit receives instructions via the conveyor belt. The instructions inform the function unit where it should go to get the input data (which conveyor belt), which function it should perform with that data, and where it should place the output data.&quot;

According to Groq, this architecture effectively eliminates bottlenecks that bog down GPUs, as it means the LPU is never waiting for memory or compute to catch up.

Groq can make this happen with an LPU and between them, which is good news as Groq&#39;s LPUs aren&#39;t that potent on their own. On paper, they achieve BF16 perf, roughly on par with an RTX 3090 or the INT8 perf of an L40S. But, remember that&#39;s peak FLOPS under ideal circumstances. In theory, data flow architectures should be able to achieve better real-world performance for the same amount of power.

It&#39;s worth pointing out that data flow architectures aren&#39;t restricted to SRAM-centric designs. For example, NextSilicon&#39;s data flow architecture uses HBM. Groq opted for an SRAM-only design because it kept things simple, but there&#39;s no reason Nvidia couldn&#39;t build a data flow accelerator based on Groq&#39;s IP using SRAM, HBM, or GDDR.

So, if data flow is so much better, why isn&#39;t it more common? Because it&#39;s a royal pain to get right. But, Groq has managed to make it work, at least for inference.

And, as Ai2&#39;s Tim Dettmers recently put it, chipmakers like Nvidia are quickly running out of levers they can pull to juice chip performance. Data flow gives Nvidia new techniques to apply as it seeks extra speed, and the deal with Groq means Jensen Huang’s company is in a better position to commercialize it.

Groq also provides Nvidia with an inference-optimized compute architecture, something that it&#39;s been sorely lacking. Where it fits, though, is a bit of a mystery.

Most of Nvidia’s &quot;inference-optimized&quot; chips, like the H200 or B300, aren&#39;t fundamentally different from their &quot;mainstream&quot; siblings. In fact, the only difference between the H100 and H200 was that the latter used faster, higher capacity HBM3e which just happens to benefit inference-heavy workloads.

As a reminder, LLM inference can be broken into two stages: the compute-heavy prefill stage, during which the prompt is processed, and the memory-bandwidth-intensive decode phase during which the model generates output tokens.

That&#39;s changing with Nvidia&#39;s Rubin generation of chips in 2026. Announced back in September, the Rubin CPX is designed specifically to accelerate the compute-intensive prefill phase of the inference pipeline, freeing up its HBM-packed Vera Rubin superchips to handle decode.

This disaggregated architecture minimizes resource contention and helps to improve utilization and throughput.

Groq&#39;s LPUs are optimized for inference by design, but they don&#39;t have enough SRAM to make for a very good decode accelerator. They could, however, be interesting as a speculative decoding part.

If you&#39;re not familiar, speculative decoding is a technique which uses a small &quot;draft&quot; model to predict the output of a larger one. When those predictions are correct, system performance can double or triple, driving down cost per token.

These speculative draft models are generally quite small, often consuming a few billion parameters at most, making Groq&#39;s existing chip designs plausible for such a design.

Do we need a dedicated accelerator for speculative decoding? Sure, why not. Is it worth $20 billion? Depends on how you measure it. Compared with publicly traded companies whose total valuation is around $20 billion, like HP, Inc., or Figma, it may seem steep. But for Nvidia, $20 billion is a relatively affordable amount – it recorded $23 billion in cash flow from operations last quarter alone. In the end, it means more chips and accessories for Nvidia to sell.

Perhaps the least likely take we&#39;ve seen is the suggestion that Groq somehow opens up additional foundry capacity for Nvidia.

Groq currently uses GlobalFoundries to make its chips, and plans to build its next-gen parts on Samsung&#39;s 4 nm process tech. Nvidia, by comparison, does nearly all of its fabrication at TSMC and is heavily reliant on the Taiwanese giant’s advanced packaging tech.

The problem with this theory is that it doesn&#39;t actually make any sense. It&#39;s not like Nvidia can&#39;t go to Samsung to fab its chips. In fact, Nvidia has fabbed chips at Samsung before – the Korean giant made most of Nvidia’s Ampere generation product. Nvidia needed TSMC&#39;s advanced packaging tech for some parts like the A100, but it doesn’t need the Taiwanese company to make Rubin CPX. Samsung or Intel can probably do the job.

All of this takes time, and licensing Groq&#39;s IP and hiring its team doesn&#39;t change that.

The reality is Nvidia may not do anything with Groq&#39;s current generation of LPUs. Jensen might just be playing the long game, as he&#39;s been known to do. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion COBOL turned 66 this year and is still in use today. Major retail and commercial banks continue to run core account processing, ATM networks, credit card clearing, and batch end-of-day settlement. On top of that, many payment networks, stock exchanges, and clearinghouses rely on COBOL for high‑volume, high‑reliability batch and online transaction processing on mainframes.

Which reminds me, mainframes are still alive and well too. Banking, insurance, governments, inventory management – all the same places you&#39;ll find COBOL, you&#39;ll find mainframes as well.

None of that is as sexy as the latest AI program or the newest cloud-native computing release, but old dogs with their old tricks still have useful work to perform.

All of which made me wonder what other technologies are likely to still be in use 50 or more years after they were first released. Here are the ones my friends and I came up with.

First, though, I want to point out that the current standard, COBOL 2023, is very different from the COBOL that Admiral Grace Hopper helped create. The same is true of mainframes. The first IBM mainframe, 1952&#39;s 701, and even 1965&#39;s IBM/360, which became COBOL&#39;s top platform, don&#39;t look much at all like today&#39;s IBM z17. Nevertheless, there&#39;s a clear line running from those much earlier technologies to the ones at our fingertips today. Nothing stays the same when it comes to computing, even if the names don&#39;t change.

Starting with languages, C, the language of choice for system programmers, is still alive and well, as it&#39;s already over 50 years old. I expect it, and COBOL too, to reach the century mark.

Yes, I know all about C&#39;s built-in security problems, but you still can&#39;t beat it when it comes to raw speed. Sure, assembler is even faster – just ask the FFmpeg developers – but you can run C on pretty much any CPU.

Lately, there&#39;s been a lot of talk about Rust replacing C for system programming. And, yes, memory-safe Rust is now a full-fledged language for programming in the Linux kernel. However, speed and portability have always been C&#39;s killer features, and that hasn&#39;t changed.

SQL also isn&#39;t going anywhere this century. It&#39;s embedded in every major relational database management system (RDBMS), and it&#39;s here for the long run. There are tens of billions of lines of SQL in stored procedures and queries. It&#39;s embedded in far too much data – and business logic is bound to it – for it to disappear.

Another language that people love to hate, JavaScript/TypeScript, isn&#39;t going anywhere either. Much as developers like to make fun of it, it&#39;s still the de facto language of the web browser and a major server‑side runtime. So long as we&#39;re using the web platform, JavaScript, in one dialect or another, will be required for compatibility.

Linux is forever. We&#39;ll still be running Linux come 2100. Heck, I won&#39;t be surprised to see computers still running Linux in 2125. Oh, and I expect Linus Torvalds&#39; other greatest creation, Git, to be with us for at least another 50 years.

Along with Linux, I expect vi and Emacs to persist. We&#39;ll also need fast text editors. Even Bash, which has outlasted all the other Unix/Linux shells, may hang around for another century or so.

A technology I think is here for the foreseeable future but others might disagree with is Kubernetes. This is the default container orchestration program for pretty much every cloud around. It has its critics, but love it or hate it, it&#39;s the foundation for cloud-native computing and all the dozens of other programs and services we use for modern-day cloud computing.

Moving on to higher levels of technology, I see Photoshop going on for decades more to come. Yes, I&#39;m a big open source fan, and GIMP is what I use, but facts are facts. If you do serious work with images, you&#39;re almost certainly a user of Photoshop and its ecosystem.

File formats are another matter. Once one is established as the top format in any field, it tends to hang on forever. That&#39;s why we&#39;re still using Microsoft&#39;s DOC and its newer variant, DOCX, instead of the superior and far more open ODF. That&#39;s not a good thing.

For example, we all use Adobe PDF when we need a document to look and behave the same everywhere, be hard to accidentally change, and remain readable for years and years. However, people who work with PDF a lot are painfully aware that there are many PDF variants, and they have more than their share of compatibility problems.

As my friend Dan Rosenbaum, an editor and singer, pointed out to me, there are industry standards such as the proprietary Finale for music notation, which was abandoned by its maker. In the continuing aftershocks, musicians have discovered there&#39;s no easy way to port Finale compositions to any other format, and thus any other music notation program. This has led to what he describes as an &quot;ongoing crisis in that industry.&quot;

This leads to my final thought of technologies that will stand the test of time. They&#39;re almost always open standards and/or open source. Any tech that relies on a single company is brittle. Yes, even DOC/DOCX and PDF. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hong Kong’s banks have a new weapon against scams: Accounts that require customers to visit a branch to access their funds.

The territory’s Monetary Authority calls these accounts a “Money Safe.”

Chief executive Eddie Yue introduced them in late 2024 in a letter [PDF] that stated they’re needed due to “the surge in fraud and scam cases in recent years with customer losses typically involving payments from customers’ bank accounts.”

Yue observed that scammers sometimes establish internet banking accounts without customers’ permission. The Monetary Authority therefore required all local banks to establish Money Safe accounts that allow customers to set aside funds which they can only access by visiting a brick-and-mortar bank. Digital banks that don’t operate branches require customers to visit their offices for ID checks.

As explained in a Hong Kong government announcement published on Tuesday, “When customers need to use the protected deposits, banks will conduct a face-to-face anti-scam verification with the customers, thus offering them a chance to carefully consider whether they have been scammed. Customers can transfer or withdraw the deposits only after completing the process.”

The Monetary Authority gave banks until December 31st to develop and deploy Money Safe accounts, and all have complied. Some put them into operation months ago, have since added features such as in app creation of Money Safe accounts, and have promoted their implementation as superior.

Hong Kong’s government will now promote Money Safe with advertising and other tactics, and is already encouraging residents to use the accounts to store any cash they don’t intend to spend in the near future.

Hong Kong’s financial services industry accounts for around a quarter of its gross domestic product. The territory is also widely seen as uniquely well positioned to facilitate trade with China, the world’s second-largest economy.

Protecting Hong Kong’s banks is therefore a priority for the territory’s government.

For what it’s worth, The Register subscribes to newsfeeds from many Asian governments. Only Hong Kong’s feed includes constant notifications of cyberattacks on banks. Scarcely a day passes without the territory’s government warning about newly-discovered phishing campaigns or fake bank websites.

Money Safe may make those attacks less effective. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A ransomware negotiator and a security incident response manager have admitted to running ransomware attacks.

Readers may recall the October 2025 indictments of Ryan Clifford Goldberg, Kevin Tyler Martin, and an unnamed third co-conspirator, who authorities believe ran a ransomware racket.

On Monday, Goldberg and Martin pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to obstruct, delay, or affect commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce by extortion.

According to a Justice Department announcement, the two men and their co-conspirator agreed to pay administrators of the ALPHV BlackCat ransomware 20 percent of any ransom payments they secured, in return for use of the crimeware.

The three then used their infosec skills – all are cybersecurity professionals – to plant the ransomware at five targets and once it was running, tried to extort their victims.

The trio’s ransomware rampage ran from May to November 2023 and saw them infect a medical device company, a pharmaceutical firm, a doctor&#39;s office, an engineering company, and a drone manufacturer.

Only one victim – the medical device company – paid up, to the tune of around $1.2 million in bitcoin. The three perps split that payment three ways and tried to launder the proceeds, the DOJ says.

“These defendants used their sophisticated cybersecurity training and experience to commit ransomware attacks – the very type of crime that they should have been working to stop,” Assistant Attorney General A. Tysen Duva of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division said in a canned statement.

A federal district court will sentence Goldberg and Martin in March and has the option to jail them for 20 years apiece.

ALPHV is notorious for the 2024 attack on Change Healthcare, which left US pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens struggling to fill prescriptions because they could not contact customers’ insurance companies to process payments. A few weeks after the Change Healthcare incident, blockchain detectives spotted $22 million worth of cryptocurrency reaching the ransomware gang. A couple of days later, the FBI locked ALPHV’s website – for the second time – and the gang dropped out of view.

One interpretation of those events was that ALPHV’s operators retired to enjoy their ill-gotten gains. However, The Register has reported that ransomware gangs sometimes take a break and re-emerge with new tools, tradecraft, and branding. ®

            <h2>New York’s incoming mayor bans Raspberry Pi at his inauguration party</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/31/zohran_mamdani_raspberry_pi_ban/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New York’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has invited the city’s residents to join him at a block party to celebrate his inauguration but told attendees not to bring a Raspberry Pi single-board computer to the event.

The Pi appears on the prohibited items list, along with explosives, weapons, drones, laser pointers, and the Flipper Zero (Maker community Adafruit first reported the list).

The Register has previously described perceptions of the Flipper Zero as swinging between “a fun little tool to help you learn about all the radio signals surrounding you, or a potential weapon for hoodie-wearing criminals seeking to take over your electronic life.”

The battery-powered device includes multiple radios and allows users to develop apps that put them to work. Flipper Zero also includes an RFID module that the device’s makers suggest could come in handy for cloning access cards, and an NFC module capable of emulating electronic tags.

There’s obvious potential for miscreants to use a Flipper Zero to make mischief at large events, perhaps by cloning ID cards to gain access to secure areas, or by messing with wireless communications.

A Raspberry Pi could do all that and more, but the single-board devices aren’t as neatly packaged as the Flipper Zero and would therefore be more conspicuous.

Adafruit laments that listing the Raspberry Pi as a forbidden item besmirches a brand beloved by educators and artists, and also points out that banning the single-board machine is futile given that miscreants could program a smartphone to perform evil deeds at the inauguration. ®

﻿The FCC is taking an ax to America’s broadband rules, even as some states are stepping up.

The fight for net neutrality never seems to be truly won or lost.

Federal net neutrality rules have been on and off for the past 15 years. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) passed the Open Internet Order under President Barack Obama in 2010, prohibiting ISPs from blocking or throttling lawful internet traffic, the baseline rule of net neutrality. Then, at the request of those ISPs, a court blocked its rules. An updated framework was passed by the FCC in 2015, only to be overturned in 2017 under President Donald Trump’s first administration. It seemed poised for a comeback in 2024, but the victory lasted mere months before a court overturned it — kicking off a rough year for the open internet and broadband regulation as a whole.

Rather than fight the court’s ruling against net neutrality, the Trump administration’s FCC has preemptively removed the rules — without a chance for public comment. The move was part of FCC Chairman Brendan Carr’s “Delete, Delete, Delete” initiative, which aims to wipe out “unnecessary” regulations.

ISPs have long described net neutrality rules as onerous. For instance, USTelecom president and CEO Jonathan Spalter claimed the 2024 vote to reinstate the FCC’s net neutrality rules was a “counterproductive, unnecessary, and anti-consumer regulatory distraction.”

However, Matt Wood, vice president of policy and general counsel at the nonprofit Free Press, says in an interview with The Verge that ISPs often feel little financial impact from these rules, and may even already be complying with them. “A lot of cable and phone companies, when they talk to their business people and then go back to investors and to the financial analysts, they’re saying, ‘Yep, this is how we’re doing it anyway.’ So, I think a lot of their complaints about the supposed ‘burdens’ from these rules are really just ideological in nature.”

“A lot of their complaints about the supposed ‘burdens’ from these rules are really just ideological in nature.”

Why bother with regulations if ISPs are already (theoretically) compliant? It comes down to accountability and transparency. Regulations ensure voters, not ISPs, are setting the rules of the road online — otherwise, there’s nothing to stop them from changing their operations down the line.

The FCC’s anti-regulatory agenda for telecoms reaches even further than net neutrality. Chao Jun Liu, senior legislative associate at the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), notes the FCC’s recent move to reverse Biden-era telecom cybersecurity rules. Carr’s FCC also rolled back requirements for them to provide “nutrition labels” for their broadband pricing, claiming it was “burdensome” for ISPs to display those details.

“There is very much this theme of, ISPs just want to do whatever they want to do with no limits and nobody telling them how to do it, when to do it, [or] on what timeline,” Liu tells The Verge.

Federal regulations for ISPs seem to be dissolving like wet paper, but luckily they’re not the only line of defense for consumers.

“ISPs just want to do whatever they want to do with no limits and nobody telling them how to do it.”

State legislators took up net neutrality in the late 2010s, after the reversal of the FCC’s 2015 order. California’s 2018 net neutrality law, considered the nation’s gold standard, even includes some policies that were left out of the 2015 federal standards, like banning zero-rating, which allows ISPs to exempt certain apps or services from customers’ data caps. Several other states have adopted similar rules, including Washington, Oregon, Colorado, New Jersey, and Vermont.

The most recent repeal has prompted a new wave of these efforts. Maine passed a bipartisan net neutrality bill in June, without a signature from Gov. Janet Mills. A bill to expand “public utility” net neutrality rules to ISPs was also introduced in Pennsylvania in March. Similar bills were introduced in the New York state Senate and state Assembly this year as well.

ISPs have so far largely shied away from openly offering paid prioritization or conventional “fast lanes,” something supporters of net neutrality attribute at least partly to state-level regulations. “I think that state-level net neutrality laws, and the threat of new ones, has kept some of the worst outcomes in check,” says John Bergmayer, legal director at the nonprofit Public Knowledge, in a statement to The Verge.

This reluctance, however, could be changing. T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T all offer network slicing on their 5G networks, allowing certain customers (mainly businesses) to pay for virtual networks with higher speeds — which, while it doesn’t inherently violate net neutrality standards, could lay the groundwork for segmented networks.

State-level laws are the next target on the deregulation chopping block.

State-level laws are also the next target on the deregulation chopping block. In October, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) began a push to pressure states into exempting ISPs from their net neutrality laws in order to be eligible for funding from the Biden-era Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program. In a speech at the Hudson Institute, NTIA administrator Arielle Roth called state-level net neutrality laws “a form of rate regulation,” the practice of determining what companies can charge for their services.

Accusations of rate regulation have become common, but Free Press’s Matt Wood argues that they’re overblown. While BEAD does prohibit rate regulation, state-level net neutrality laws don’t inherently fall under that label. Opponents of net neutrality “characterize any and every consumer safeguard as rate regulation when I don’t think it actually has any legitimate impact on the rates companies can charge for the services they offer in the broadband space,” says Wood.

And, again, this is part of a larger deregulatory agenda. EFF’s Chao Jun Liu pointed out similarities with efforts to leverage BEAD funds against AI regulation, including through a recently signed executive order. These attempts to connect AI regulation and broadband funding are “a new development,” says Liu. “This is very much a Brendan Carr, Trump administration special.”

At a time when broadband expansion remains vital, the Trump administration is threatening much-needed infrastructure funding to attack tech regulation. Unfortunately, despite being a bipartisan program, BEAD is where this debate is currently being played out. As Wood says, “Why are we making broadband deployment, which is pretty popular and pretty bipartisan, into yet another front in these culture wars?”

“Why are we making broadband deployment into yet another front in these culture wars?”

Legal experts have pointed out that Roth and the NTIA don’t necessarily have the authority to preempt state-level net neutrality laws for the sake of BEAD funding. However, it seems likely the debates over those funds will delay BEAD’s rollout even further and, along with it, the program’s mission to expand broadband development, particularly to underserved communities.

So, while the tug-of-war over net neutrality regulations continues, so do issues with broadband access in the US. Internet affordability is a persistent challenge across the country, but especially in rural areas where people often have only one or two providers to choose from. BEAD was intended to help address that issue, but now could get bogged down in debate over AI regulations.

Even in areas with robust internet access, high prices are still a problem, particularly since the Affordable Connectivity Program was shut down almost two years ago. On top of that, the US is experiencing a wave of bills that could roll out widespread age verification rules online, sparking debate about privacy, censorship, and free speech.

All of this — not just the fate of net neutrality — leaves the internet in a perilous state going into 2026.

With the year coming to a close, now’s a good time to set yourself up for a cleaner, more organized start in 2026. The Dreame X40 Ultra — one of our favorite robot vacuum deals from Black Friday — can handle most of the heavy lifting for you, and it’s once again on sale. You can currently buy it for $503 ($697 off) at Amazon at checkout, which is just $4 more than its record low price set during Black Friday.

Before the Dreame X50 Ultra took its place, the X40 Ultra was our favorite robovac / mop hybrid for hard floors and carpets. Like the X50 Ultra, it delivers excellent mopping performance, thanks to dual oscillating mop pads that can extend into edges and reach under consoles and cabinets. It can also automatically detach and reattach its mop pads when switching between mopping and vacuuming.

While the X50 Ultra is nearly twice as powerful, the X40 Ultra’s 12,000Pa of suction is still more than capable of handling everyday dirt and debris. It also features AI-powered dirt detection, allowing the robot to slow down and make additional passes over especially dirty areas. What’s more, the X40 Ultra can empty its own dustbin, refill its water tank, and clean its washboard, with mop pads that wash and dry themselves for minimal upkeep.

What you don’t get are some of the newer X50 Ultra upgrades, including the motorized swing arm that lets it clear higher thresholds and the improved dual rubber roller brush system, which does a better job picking up fine debris. That said, the X40 Ultra still performed very well in our testing, making it a great investment — especially considering it now costs about half as much as its successor.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Political violence has become illegible, and increasingly, politics and language have too.

In a good and just society, it would have been possible to bury Charlie Kirk without either threatening mass violence toward his enemies or making light of his death with a furry sex meme. But America in 2025 did not remotely resemble a working society, let alone a civil one, and Kirk’s killing came prepackaged with its own desecrating shitposts.

There was, briefly, an attempt at a national mood of somberness. The president ordered flags across the nation to be lowered to half-staff. Politicians, celebrities, and other public figures — even those not aligned with Kirk on the right — rushed out with condolences and grief, painting completely unrecognizable pictures of a man who was a once-in-a-generation talent at getting a rise out of other people. “Kirk was practicing politics in exactly the right way,” wrote the liberal pundit Ezra Klein in The New York Times, describing him as “one of the era’s most effective practitioners of persuasion.”

Kirk’s megachurch memorial service was well-attended, with additional solemnities elsewhere in the form of the ritual sacrifices of random people’s jobs. A Reuters investigation would later find more than 600 people who had been fired, suspended, or investigated for social media posts they made about Charlie Kirk — some of them merely quoting Kirk, a professional asshole who, among other things, pushed the “great replacement” theory and myths of white genocide.

Comedian Jimmy Kimmel became the most prominent victim of this crusade after making a fairly mild joke on his late night show. The actual upshot of the quip — which mocked Trump for his apparent disinterest in Kirk only days after the young man’s death — was completely ignored, and Kimmel was lambasted for showing insufficient grief over the newly canonized saint of MAGA. The chair of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, successfully threatened Disney into taking Kimmel off the air — only to be mogged by the general public, which berated Disney into reinstating Kimmel’s show.

In a sense, this circus was business as usual. The amnesia of the elites, the tone-policing witch hunts, the pageantry of memorialization: these are the reflexive acts of a society on the verge of launching a systemic assault on civil liberties. But as much as the right wing tried to channel 9/11, and as much as corporations and media organizations and left-wing politicians played along, something about the way Americans communicate with each other was fundamentally different. Perhaps the first indication of where we were as a country was a video posted by a TikTok user at the Utah Valley University event, recorded just moments after the shooting. “It’s your boy, Elder TikTok!” he shouted. “Shots fired!”

“It’s your boy, Elder TikTok!” he shouted. “Shots fired!”

Despite the mass reprisals against Kirk’s shitposting detractors over the following weeks and months, the memeing continued apace. And very shortly after Kirk’s death, influencers on the right-wing fringe — like Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes — had almost compulsively fallen into conspiratorial theorizing about the shooting, their instincts settling the blame on (of course) Israel. Even the center of MAGA could not hold; the long, sustained sainting of Kirk was simply too incongruous with the deportation ASMR memes. Vice President JD Vance tried to stick with the serious tone — now, months later, he is the subject of an AI slop musical tribute to Kirk that has gone viral on TikTok, with the soaring hook (“We are Charlie Kiiiiiiiiiiirk”) a popular target for mockery.

2025 has been defined by Charlie Kirk, though not by what Charlie Kirk espoused, nor who he was, nor who his allies purport him to have been. The hysteria, the inanity, and the sheer incoherence surrounding his death has become emblematic of America. It took a decade before 9/11 jokes could really land, but Kirk’s death had been turned into a joke before the bullet even hit him. Politics is fully immersed in its postliterate era, and political violence, too, has become illegible.

Two days after Kirk was shot, law enforcement announced the arrest of his alleged killer. In a press conference, the governor of the state of Utah proceeded to read out loud a series of internet memes that had been scratched into bullet casings recovered with the alleged weapon.

The first — “notices bulge OWO what’s this?” — was a mocking reference to furry online sexual roleplay. The next, which ominously opened with “Hey fascist, catch,” ended with a series of arrows encoding a button combo strike in the video game Helldivers 2, a third-person shooter that satirizes fascism. The one after that was a reference to the Italian song “Bella ciao” (historically an antifascist anthem but also a generally catchy jingle). The governor wrapped up the list with the most ignominious possible conclusion, saying, “if you read this you are gay lmao,” making sure to carefully spell out each of the letters in the final abbreviation.

This should be understood as a genuinely humiliating moment for America, one in which our elected leaders succumbed to the murderous version of calling Moe’s Tavern and asking for Heywood Jablome. A civilized society does not heap furry sex memes on top of a grave.

Yet this act of vandalism on American dignity was the most responsible act the governor could undertake, given the circumstances. Just 24 hours earlier, someone — presumably in law enforcement — had leaked an internal bulletin to right-wing influencer Steven Crowder. “All cartridges have engraved wording on them, expressing transgender and anti-fascist ideology,” the memo said.

A civilized society does not heap furry sex memes on top of a grave

By reading aloud the messages on the bullets, the governor was broadcasting the closest thing to a manifesto for the alleged shooter. But he was also providing transparency into an investigation that had been riddled with irresponsible leaks and flagrant missteps. In the hours after the killing, FBI Director Kash Patel had shot off a quickfire post on X to declare that a suspect had been taken into custody, only for the FBI to have to announce, shortly thereafter, that that person was not a suspect and had been released. When Crowder published his ATF leak, the rumor that the shooter was trans exploded out of control. In carefully engaging with the truth of the bullets, Cox — probably unknowingly, given his remarks the following day — exonerated a vulnerable and politically persecuted community that is frequently slandered with falsely attributed mass shootings.

The right then attempted to pin the shooting on the shadowy forces of antifa, using “Hey fascist, catch” and “Bella ciao” as justification. Two weeks later, Trump would sign an executive order designating antifa a domestic terror organization (a designation that doesn’t exist) and then issue a national presidential security memorandum directing various departments and agencies to launch an expansive war on antifa. (The war on antifa is inextricable from Trump’s war on the English language, because, if you are literate, his opposition to anti-fascism necessarily raises the question of what Trumpism actually is.)

On a memorial episode of Kirk’s podcast, Stephen Miller, appearing alongside JD Vance, swore vengeance on the “networks” backing antifa. “With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security, and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people. It will happen, and we will do it in Charlie’s name.”

Aside from the ambiguous bullet casings, there’s no apparent evidence that Kirk’s accused killer is antifa — there is neither a forthright declaration of political motivation, nor a total absence of it. One affidavit points to a romantic relationship being the motive; this is hardly made clear in any piece of writing by alleged shooter Tyler Robinson, let alone the infamous bullets. “remember how I was engraving bullets?” Robinson allegedly texted a friend. “The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme, if I see ‘notices bulge uwu’ on fox new I might have a stroke.”

We understand these acts of violence as political because of the circumstances more than anything else

There’s a reason why, under normal circumstances, broadcasting those types of details is considered bad form — such details have a tendency to spark copycat killings. Two weeks after Charlie Kirk was killed, a gunman opened fire at an ICE field office in Dallas, killing a detainee and wounding others before taking his own life. The alleged shooter, Joshua Jahn, left no manifesto that we know of, but an unused bullet — according to a photo released by law enforcement — had the phrase “ANTI-ICE” written on it in what looks like pen or marker.

The tonal weirdness of this micro-manifesto immediately led internet posters to compare the message on the bullets to a 2015 alleged hate crime in Mississippi where the phrase “Blacks Rule” had been spray-painted onto a driveway. Neither phrase is in common parlance; each is so jarring that it makes “hello my fellow kids” sound like convincing zoomer lingo. The fact that only a detainee and the shooter himself had been killed made the incident seem even more suspicious, especially to internet audiences (on both the right and the left) that had already spun themselves up into concocting conspiracy theories about Kirk’s killing.

Jahn’s brother told NBC News that his sibling “didn’t have strong feelings about ICE” and that “he wasn’t interested in politics on either side as far as I knew.” Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein reported that one of Jahn’s Steam handles was “#Impeachment,” presumably a reference to impeaching Trump. Some of his anonymous sources — apparently friends of Jahn’s — emphasize that this was an “ironic” mockery of earnest resistance libs. But another source made a subtle differentiation: “If it was ironic, it’s that half irony — where you’re half-kidding, half-serious, just in case.”

Individuals’ politics are often in flux, and the kind of person who willfully kills another is not, one might say, engaging with the world as they did before. Nevertheless, Jahn (born 1996) did not leave behind much in the way of a point of view; the same goes for Robinson (born 2003). We understand their acts of violence as political because of the circumstances more than anything else.

The apparent laconicism of this pair of zoomer killers is striking, given the wordiness of their predecessors. Even Luigi Mangione (born 1998) — accused of assassinating UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last year — allegedly left a 260+ word missive for “the feds.” (That would be half a page if typed; it was handwritten, and so poorly that portions are indecipherable.) Over time, political killers have had less and less to say.

Anders Breivik (born 1979), who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011, left a 1,518 page manifesto. The 2019 Christchurch, New Zealand shooter (born 1990) left behind 74 pages. The 2019 El Paso shooter (born 1998) 10 pages; the 2022 Buffalo shooter (born 2003) left 180 pages that were extensively plagiarized from both Breivik and the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski.

Politics has become divorced from reality and reason

Perhaps this is not surprising. Literacy has been in steep decline in many parts of the world, including the United States, where most of these men were. A study that took place in 2015 tested a pool of undergraduates on how well they understood the opening of Charles Dickens’ Bleak House and concluded that over half “understood so little” that “they would not be able to read the novel on their own.” Of course, Dickens is not exactly known for his clear, legible prose — but alarmingly, the students in the study were English majors. High schools assign fewer books cover-to-cover, with the result that college students arrive at university and struggle to read a full book. The stresses of the pandemic and remote learning, too, left an indelible mark on the education of an entire cohort. As Gen Z grows older, zoomer parents report that they don’t like reading to their own children. A study published this year says that reading for pleasure is down 40 percent.

At the same time, politics has gotten more divorced from reality and reason. The results are dizzying when the sheer brainrot of the Trump administration collides with judges who are still operating under the assumption that words should mean things and refer to real objects. “We rule on facts, not on supposition or conjecture, and certainly not on fabrication or propaganda,” wrote a distraught appeals court judge in the lawsuit over Trump’s attempt to send the National Guard into Portland, Oregon. (She was the dissenting voice on the panel; the other two judges, Trump appointees, ruled in favor of allowing the president to send in the Guard.)

But incoherence has become an entirely normal property of politics, and incoherent violence — the ICE raids, third country deportations, drone boat strikes — is central, rather than incidental, to the political system. In this sense, the subliterate zoomer killers are not at the fringe of society, but are the epitome of it.

The media has spent the last few months trying to make sense out of nonsense, attempting to conjure motive, manifesto, and meaning out of the dumbest shit scrawled onto bullets. These were sad attempts to impose meaning on an increasingly incoherent world by a literati that has not yet accepted its irrelevance in a postliterate society. But the most humiliating display of literate obliviousness in the face of the total collapse of meaning, however, was Ezra Klein’s bizarre eulogy to Charlie Kirk. The now-infamous column (“Charlie Kirk Was Practicing Politics the Right Way”) can best be understood as an expression of class solidarity. Klein, I would argue, sees both himself and Kirk as being Debate Guys, wordcels who engage in the marketplace of ideas and let speech sort itself out into political action.

Ezra Klein is an artifact of the politics of literacy, a paradigm that is waning faster than my fingers can type these useless, useless words. But Charlie Kirk’s Debate Guy persona was a meme layered on top of sophisticated machinery. His Talking Points USA and Professor Watchlist were very much about action in the real world. In one deleted tweet, Kirk claimed that TPUSA had sent “80+ buses full of patriots” to DC for what would become the January 6th insurrection.

Kirk’s podcast was a form of infrastructure, one controlled by Kirk, and not The New York Times or another brand. The parasocial relationships he built with his audience granted him direct access to President Donald Trump. Kirk understood that his nonviolent engagement with the public was a form of amusement to fill the void, a conversion mechanism to boost subscriber rates, imbued with as much meaning as a daily crossword puzzle or Wordle.

Kirk did not commit violence, not because he abhorred it, but because committing violence was someone else’s job. Last year, he called for using whips against migrants, saying, “Of course you should be able to use whips against foreigners that are coming into your country. Why is that controversial?” In early June of this year, as the president deployed troops to Los Angeles, Kirk publicly advocated for invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 to crush the immigration protests. And in August, he called for “federalizing” the district of Columbia, saying, “Roll in the tanks, bring in the military.”

With his close relationship to the commander in chief of the United States of America, Charlie Kirk was no mere talker, idea-peddler, or purveyor of discourse. He built an empire on legitimizing violence and harvesting the enthusiasm and glee around it. Even before his death became a pretext to enact violence on American cities, he had already substantively shaped history. Charlie Kirk was a part of the real world in a way that Ezra Klein will never be.

One might even say that Kirk already understood that the future of politics was aura farming and shitposting, switching fluidly between calling for “massive indictments” against Trump’s political enemies and telling Taylor Swift to “submit to your husband.” For Kirk and for much of society today, words are not expressions with referents, but rather, performative speech acts with specific functions — in his case, owning the libs.

You do not bring a persuasive argument to a gunfight

The most significant resistance to Trumpism, too, appears to be abandoning the realm of literate politics; after all, you do not bring a persuasive argument to a gunfight. In Portland, Oregon, inflatable frog suits — a symbol imbued with no inherent meaning or political point of view — became de rigueur. But perhaps the most telling sign is that resistance against ICE in Chicago and New York is best expressed not in slogans but in whistles and car honks.

It’s useless to call for civil debate as “politics in the right way”; politics has moved beyond words. Where there are words at all, they are but a way to express a meme, a vibe, an aesthetic. They are a method to channel brainrot, like any other medium of communication. To expect words to mean words, for them to attach to objects in time and space and to line up with any internal logic — this is the sort of cringe that will fade into the periphery along with the millennial pause, that half-second of silence where the older generation gathers their thoughts.

And we can understand this rise in political violence as something that exists on the same wavelength as the illegible politics that govern our society today. Like bombing shipwrecked sailors in the name of fighting drug trafficking, it is action for action’s sake, as crass and consequential as a Pokémon deportation meme.

A post, a podcast, a screenshot, a meme, a whistle, a bullet — in all things, only the medium is the message.

            <div id="article-text">If you unwrapped Nintendo’s powerful Switch 2 during the holidays, we have opinions on which games you should play.

If you unwrapped Nintendo’s powerful Switch 2 during the holidays, we have opinions on which games you should play.

2025 was a big year for gaming, and that includes gaming hardware. Nintendo launched its Switch 2 console in June, and since then, numerous Switch 2 titles and noteworthy updates for original Switch games have launched. These include brand-new Nintendo experiences like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza, as well as some belated but welcome third-party titles, including Cyberpunk 2077 and Divinity: Original Sin 2. Even classics like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild got some new life on the upgraded console.

If you’re considering buying a console, or you’re getting one for someone else, there are 11 games that we think are a must-buy for any Switch 2 owner.

So what if Mario Kart World comes in the box with the $499 Switch 2 bundle? It’s still so easy to recommend because few other games match the briskness at which it just lets you get going and have fun. The latest entry in Nintendo’s top-selling racing franchise adds many new characters, an open-world single-player mode, unique interconnected courses, and a lot more.

One of the best ways to play the original Hollow Knight was on a Nintendo Switch, so it’s no surprise that the Switch 2 is a great way to enjoy the long-awaited sequel, Silksong. The side-scrolling action exploration game looks fantastic, and its gorgeous animations are easier to appreciate thanks to the console’s 120Hz refresh rate screen.

Before Larian Studios made Baldur’s Gate 3, it was best known for its Divinity series. The developers recently announced a reboot of the RPG franchise, but for now, the closest thing to BG3 that Switch 2 owners can experience right now is Divinity: Original Sin 2, a fantastic RPG that first launched in late 2017. It just got a free Switch 2 update that enhances visuals and reduces slowdown, and I highly recommend playing it.

The team that developed Super Mario Odyssey clearly had a ball with its most recent game, Donkey Kong Bananza. It’s just as ambitious in terms of level design, giving Donkey Kong several unique powers of transformation. But it’s significantly more destructive, letting him demolish everything in sight with his fists or punch through the ground to get around obstacles.

You know Nintendo did something right with the Switch 2 when the graphics showcase Cyberpunk 2077 shows up as a launch game. The first-person-shooter-meets-RPG plays well on the system, especially when you use the Joy-Con 2 in mouse mode, which makes it feel a bit like the PC version. This version of the game includes the excellent Phantom Liberty DLC that adds even more action, plus Idris Elba.

After nearly a decade in development, the first new Metroid Prime game in nearly 20 years is now available for the Switch 2. It runs at glorious 4K on the new hardware (or up to 120 frames per second in 1080p), but beyond looks, it’s great to be back in Samus Aran’s butt-kicking boots again. This time, she’s got the Vi-O-La motorcycle for getting around the desert terrain that connects the main dungeons. The story and exploration may not have the same magic as the original Prime, but its best parts are still worth paying the price of admission to experience.

Splatoon 3 was already a fun game on the original Switch, but it’s even better with the free Switch 2 update. With faster loading speeds and better-looking visuals, you owe it to yourself to make a splashy mess in its fun single-player campaign and online multiplayer modes.

The release of the Switch 2 made old things new again. For example, the original Switch launch title The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has never looked or played better than it does in the new Switch 2 Edition, which costs $10 if you own the Switch game or $70 by itself (the upgrade is free if you have Switch Online + Expansion Pack). Faster frame rates, speedier loading times, better visuals, and a GPS-style mobile app feature make this one feel like a breath of fresh air.

Rockstar Games’ open-world Western was late to hit the original Switch, but the new (and free) Switch 2 update makes it shine in some surprising ways. Not only does it boost the visuals and performance thanks to the new console’s more powerful specs, it adds a PC-like mouse mode to make it much easier to aim (and more fun to play).

If you’ve never played No Man’s Sky, can we switch brains so I can experience it again for the first time? The space exploration game with an infinite universe (made possible via procedural generation that makes each player’s experience unique) is one of gaming’s biggest success stories in recent years. The developers pile on numerous substantive updates each year, making this an excellent game to play, whether you want to chill or engage in building a space empire. Oh, and the Switch 2 update is free for those who own the base game.

Fortnite is the only game on this list that’s free to play, but that doesn’t make it one that you should pass up. Epic Games’ battle royale-style shooter is a cultural juggernaut that includes characters representing a huge array of fandoms. The Switch 2 port makes it feel like an entirely different game than the original Switch version. You can drop in as a character from Dragon Ball Z, lock and load as your favorite family member from The Simpsons, or assume the role of Sabrina Carpenter or Kim Kardashian, to name some of the literally dozens of tie-ins that are fun to see in-game.

            <div id="article-text">The pair targeted several companies with ALPHV / BlackCat ransomware and extorted $1.2 million in Bitcoin.

The pair targeted several companies with ALPHV / BlackCat ransomware and extorted $1.2 million in Bitcoin.

Two former employees at cybersecurity firms — one of whom was a ransomware negotiator — have pleaded guilty to carrying out a series of ransomware attacks in 2023. The Department of Justice announced the guilty pleas on Tuesday, saying 40-year-old Ryan Goldberg and 36-year-old Kevin Martin extorted $1.2 million in Bitcoin from a medical device company and targeted several others.

Goldberg, Martin, and an unnamed co-conspirator were indicted for the attacks in October, which involved using ALPHV / BlackCat ransomware to encrypt and steal data from their victims. As reported by the Chicago Sun-Times, Martin and the third conspirator worked as ransomware negotiators at Digital Mint, a cybercrime and incident response company, while Goldberg was an incident response manager at Sygnia Cybersecurity Services.

ALPHV / BlackCat is a hacker group that uses a ransomware-as-a-service model, with the developers who maintain the malware often taking a cut of stolen funds from the cybercriminals who use it to target victims. In 2023, the FBI developed a decryption tool designed to recover data from victims of ALPHV / BlackCat, which has been linked to high-profile attacks on companies like Bandai Namco, MGM Resorts, Reddit, and UnitedHealth Group.

The DOJ’s indictment claims Goldberg, Martin, and the co-conspirator used the ransomware in an attempt to extort millions of dollars from victims throughout the US, including a pharmaceutical company, a doctor’s office, an engineering company, and a drone manufacturer.

“These defendants used their sophisticated cybersecurity training and experience to commit ransomware attacks — the very type of crime that they should have been working to stop,” Assistant Attorney General A. Tysen Duva of the DOJ’s Criminal Division says in a statement. “The Department of Justice is committed to using all tools available to identify and arrest perpetrators of ransomware attacks wherever we have jurisdiction.”

Goldberg and Martin pleaded guilty to one count of “conspiracy to obstruct, delay, or affect commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce by extortion.” Their sentencing is scheduled for March 12th, 2026, where they’ll face up to 20 years in prison.

            <h2>Why inventing new emotions feels so good</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-31</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/31/1129403/new-emotions-online-life-feelings/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s a “complex and subtle emotion that elicits feelings of comfort, serenity, and a gentle sense of floating.” It’s peaceful, but more ephemeral and intangible than contentment. It might be evoked by the sight of a sunset or a moody, low-key album.

If you haven’t ever felt this sensation—or even heard of it—that’s not surprising. A Reddit user named noahjeadie generated it with ChatGPT, along with advice on how to evoke the feeling. With the right essential oils and soundtrack, apparently, you too can feel like “a soft fuzzy draping ghost floating through a lavender suburb.”

Don’t scoff: Researchers say more and more terms for these “neo-­emotions” are showing up online, describing new dimensions and aspects of feeling. Velvetmist was a key example in a journal article about the phenomenon published in July 2025. But most neo-emotions aren’t the inventions of emo artificial intelligences. Humans come up with them, and they’re part of a big change in the way researchers are thinking about feelings, one that emphasizes how people continuously spin out new ones in response to a changing world.

Velvetmist might’ve been a chatbot one-off, but it’s not unique. The sociologist Marci Cottingham—whose 2024 paper got this vein of neo-emotion research started—cites many more new terms in circulation. There’s “Black joy” (Black people celebrating embodied pleasure as a form of political resistance), “trans euphoria” (the joy of having one’s gender identity affirmed and celebrated), “eco-anxiety” (the hovering fear of climate disaster), “hypernormalization” (the surreal pressure to continue performing mundane life and labor under capitalism during a global pandemic or fascist takeover), and the sense of “doom” found in “doomer” (one who is relentlessly pessimistic) or “doomscrolling” (being glued to an endless feed of bad news in an immobilized state combining apathy and dread).

Of course, emotional vocabulary is always evolving. During the Civil War, doctors used the centuries-old term “nostalgia,” combining the Greek words for “returning home”and “pain,” to describe a sometimes fatal set of symptoms suffered by soldiers—a condition we’d probably describe today as post-traumatic stress disorder. Now nostalgia’s meaning has mellowed and faded to a gentle affection for an old cultural product or vanished way of life. And people constantly import emotion words from other cultures when they’re convenient or evocative—like hygge (the Danish word for friendly coziness) or kvell (a Yiddish term for brimming over with happy pride).

Cottingham believes that neo-­emotions are proliferating as people spend more of their lives online. These coinages help us relate to one another and make sense of our experiences, and they get a lot of engagement on social media. So even when a neo-emotion is just a subtle variation on, or combination of, existing feelings, getting super-specific about those feelings helps us reflect and connect with other people. “These are potentially signals that tell us about our place in the world,” she says.

These neo-emotions are part of a paradigm shift in emotion science. For decades, researchers argued that humans all share a set of a half-dozen or so basic emotions. But over the last decade, Lisa Feldman Barrett, a clinical psychologist at Northeastern University, has become one of the most cited scientists in the world for work demonstrating otherwise. By using tools like advanced brain imaging and studying babies and people from relatively isolated cultures, she has concluded there’s no such thing as a basic emotional palette. The way we experience and talk about our feelings is culturally determined. “How do you know what anger and sadness and fear are? Because somebody taught you,” Barrett says.

If there are no true “basic” biological emotions, this puts more emphasis on social and cultural variations in how we interpret our experiences. And these interpretations can change over time. “As a sociologist, we think of all emotions as created,” Cottingham says. Just like any other tool humans make and use, “emotions are a practical resource people are using as they navigate the world.”

Some neo-emotions, like velvetmist, might be mere novelties. Barrett playfully suggests “chiplessness” to describe the combined hunger, frustration, and relief of getting to the bottom of the bag. But others, like eco-anxiety and Black joy, can take on a life of their own and help galvanize social movements.

Both reading about and crafting your own neo-emotions, with or without chatbot assistance, could be surprisingly helpful. Lots of research supports the benefits of emotional granularity. Basically, the more detailed and specific words you can use to describe your emotions, both positive and negative, the better.

Researchers analogize this “emodiversity” to biodiversity or cultural diversity, arguing that a more diverse world is more enriched. It turns out that people who exhibit higher emotional granularity go to the doctor less frequently, spend fewer days hospitalized for illness, and are less likely to drink when stressed, drive recklessly, or smoke cigarettes. And many studies show emodiversity is a skill that, with training, people can develop at any age. Just imagine cruising into this sweet, comforting future. Is the idea giving you a certain dreamy thrill?

Are you sure you’ve never felt velvetmist?

            <h2>The ascent of the AI therapist</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-30</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/30/1129392/book-reviews-ai-therapy-mental-health/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.

Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot. On a broader scale, researchers are exploring AI’s potential to monitor and collect behavioral and biometric observations using wearables and smart devices, analyze vast volumes of clinical data for new insights, and assist human mental-health professionals to help prevent burnout.

But so far this largely uncontrolled experiment has produced mixed results. Many people have found solace in chatbots based on large language models (LLMs), and some experts see promise in them as therapists, but other users have been sent into delusional spirals by AI’s hallucinatory whims and breathless sycophancy. Most tragically, multiple families have alleged that chatbots contributed to the suicides of their loved ones, sparking lawsuits against companies responsible for these tools. In October, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed in a blog post that 0.15% of ChatGPT users “have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” That’s roughly a million people sharing suicidal ideations with just one of these software systems every week.

The real-world consequences of AI therapy came to a head in unexpected ways in 2025 as we waded through a critical mass of stories about human-chatbot relationships, the flimsiness of guardrails on many LLMs, and the risks of sharing profoundly personal information with products made by corporations that have economic incentives to harvest and monetize such sensitive data.

Several authors anticipated this inflection point. Their timely books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

LLMs have often been described as “black boxes” because nobody knows exactly how they produce their results. The inner workings that guide their outputs are opaque because their algorithms are so complex and their training data is so vast. In mental-health circles, people often describe the human brain as a “black box,” for analogous reasons. Psychology, psychiatry, and related fields must grapple with the impossibility of seeing clearly inside someone else’s head, let alone pinpointing the exact causes of their distress.

These two types of black boxes are now interacting with each other, creating unpredictable feedback loops that may further impede clarity about the origins of people’s mental-­health struggles and the solutions that may be possible. Anxiety about these developments has much to do with the explosive recent advances in AI, but it also revives decades-old warnings from pioneers such as the MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum, who argued against computerized therapy as early as the 1960s.

Charlotte Blease, a philosopher of medicine, makes the optimist’s case in Dr. Bot: Why Doctors Can Fail Us—and How AI Could Save Lives. Her book broadly explores the possible positive impacts of AI in a range of medical fields. While she remains clear-eyed about the risks, warning that readers who are expecting “a gushing love letter to technology” will be disappointed, she suggests that these models can help relieve patient suffering and medical burnout alike.

“Health systems are crumbling under patient pressure,” Blease writes. “Greater burdens on fewer doctors create the perfect petri dish for errors,” and “with palpable shortages of doctors and increasing waiting times for patients, many of us are profoundly frustrated.”

Blease believes that AI can not only ease medical professionals’ massive workloads but also relieve the tensions that have always existed between some patients and their caregivers. For example, people often don’t seek needed care because they are intimidated or fear judgment from medical professionals; this is especially true if they have mental-health challenges. AI could allow more people to share their concerns, she argues.

But she’s aware that these putative upsides need to be weighed against major drawbacks. For instance, AI therapists can provide inconsistent and even dangerous responses to human users, according to a 2025 study, and they also raise privacy concerns, given that AI companies are currently not bound by the same confidentiality and HIPAA standards as licensed therapists.

While Blease is an expert in this field, her motivation for writing the book is also personal: She has two siblings with an incurable form of muscular dystrophy, one of whom waited decades for a diagnosis. During the writing of her book, she also lost her partner to cancer and her father to dementia within a devastating six-month period. “I witnessed first-hand the sheer brilliance of doctors and the kindness of health professionals,” she writes. “But I also observed how things can go wrong with care.”

A similar tension animates Daniel Oberhaus’s engrossing book The Silicon Shrink: How Artificial Intelligence Made the World an Asylum. Oberhaus starts from a point of tragedy: the loss of his younger sister to suicide. As Oberhaus carried out the “distinctly twenty-first-century mourning process” of sifting through her digital remains, he wondered if technology could have eased the burden of the psychiatric problems that had plagued her since childhood.

“It seemed possible that all of this personal data might have held important clues that her mental health providers could have used to provide more effective treatment,” he writes. “What if algorithms running on my sister’s smartphone or laptop had used that data to understand when she was in distress? Could it have led to a timely intervention that saved her life? Would she have wanted that even if it did?”

This concept of digital phenotyping—in which a person’s digital behavior could be mined for clues about distress or illness—seems elegant in theory. But it may also become problematic if integrated into the field of psychiatric artificial intelligence (PAI), which extends well beyond chatbot therapy.

Oberhaus emphasizes that digital clues could actually exacerbate the existing challenges of modern psychiatry, a discipline that remains fundamentally uncertain about the underlying causes of mental illnesses and disorders. The advent of PAI, he says, is “the logical equivalent of grafting physics onto astrology.” In other words, the data generated by digital phenotyping is as precise as physical measurements of planetary positions, but it is then integrated into a broader framework—in this case, psychiatry—that, like astrology, is based on unreliable assumptions.

Oberhaus, who uses the phrase “swipe psychiatry” to describe the outsourcing of clinical decisions based on behavioral data to LLMs, thinks that this approach cannot escape the fundamental issues facing psychiatry. In fact, it could worsen the problem by causing the skills and judgment of human therapists to atrophy as they grow more dependent on AI systems.

He also uses the asylums of the past—in which institutionalized patients lost their right to freedom, privacy, dignity, and agency over their lives—as a touchstone for a more insidious digital captivity that may spring from PAI. LLM users are already sacrificing privacy by telling chatbots sensitive personal information that companies then mine and monetize, contributing to a new surveillance economy. Freedom and dignity are at stake when complex inner lives are transformed into data streams tailored for AI analysis.

AI therapists could flatten humanity into patterns of prediction, and so sacrifice the intimate, individualized care that is expected of traditional human therapists. “The logic of PAI leads to a future where we may all find ourselves patients in an algorithmic asylum administered by digital wardens,” Oberhaus writes. “In the algorithmic asylum there is no need for bars on the window or white padded rooms because there is no possibility of escape. The asylum is already everywhere—in your homes and offices, schools and hospitals, courtrooms and barracks. Wherever there’s an internet connection, the asylum is waiting.”

Eoin Fullam, a researcher who studies the intersection of technology and mental health, echoes some of the same concerns in Chatbot Therapy: A Critical Analysis of AI Mental Health Treatment. A heady academic primer, the book analyzes the assumptions underlying the automated treatments offered by AI chatbots and the way capitalist incentives could corrupt these kinds of tools.

Fullam observes that the capitalist mentality behind new technologies “often leads to questionable, illegitimate, and illegal business practices in which the customers’ interests are secondary to strategies of market dominance.”

That doesn’t mean that therapy-bot makers “will inevitably conduct nefarious activities contrary to the users’ interests in the pursuit of market dominance,” Fullam writes.

But he notes that the success of AI therapy depends on the inseparable impulses to make money and to heal people. In this logic, exploitation and therapy feed each other: Every digital therapy session generates data, and that data fuels the system that profits as unpaid users seek care. The more effective the therapy seems, the more the cycle entrenches itself, making it harder to distinguish between care and commodification. “The more the users benefit from the app in terms of its therapeutic or any other mental health intervention,” he writes, “the more they undergo exploitation.”

This sense of an economic and psychological ouroboros—the snake that eats its own tail—serves as a central metaphor in Sike, the debut novel from Fred Lunzer, an author with a research background in AI.

Described as a “story of boy meets girl meets AI psychotherapist,” Sike follows Adrian, a young Londoner who makes a living ghostwriting rap lyrics, in his romance with Maquie, a business professional with a knack for spotting lucrative technologies in the beta phase.

The title refers to a splashy commercial AI therapist called Sike, uploaded into smart glasses, that Adrian uses to interrogate his myriad anxieties. “When I signed up to Sike, we set up my dashboard, a wide black panel like an airplane’s cockpit that showed my daily ‘vitals,’” Adrian narrates. “Sike can analyze the way you walk, the way you make eye contact, the stuff you talk about, the stuff you wear, how often you piss, shit, laugh, cry, kiss, lie, whine, and cough.”

In other words, Sike is the ultimate digital phenotyper, constantly and exhaustively analyzing everything in a user’s daily experiences. In a twist, Lunzer chooses to make Sike a luxury product, available only to subscribers who can foot the price tag of £2,000 per month.

Flush with cash from his contributions to a hit song, Adrian comes to rely on Sike as a trusted mediator between his inner and outer worlds. The novel explores the impacts of the app on the wellness of the well-off, following rich people who voluntarily commit themselves to a boutique version of the digital asylum described by Oberhaus.

The only real sense of danger in Sike involves a Japanese torture egg (don’t ask). The novel strangely sidesteps the broader dystopian ripples of its subject matter in favor of drunken conversations at fancy restaurants and elite dinner parties.

The sudden ascent of the AI therapist seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes.

Sike’s creator is simply “a great guy” in Adrian’s estimation, despite his techno-messianic vision of training the app to soothe the ills of entire nations. It always seems as if a shoe is meant to drop, but in the end, it never does, leaving the reader with a sense of non-resolution.

While Sike is set in the present day, something about the sudden ascent of the AI therapist—­in real life as well as in fiction—seems startlingly futuristic, as if it should be unfolding in some later time when the streets scrub themselves and we travel the world through pneumatic tubes. But this convergence of mental health and artificial intelligence has been in the making for more than half a century. The beloved astronomer Carl Sagan, for example, once imagined a “network of computer psychotherapeutic terminals, something like arrays of large telephone booths” that could address the growing demand for mental-health services.

Oberhaus notes that one of the first incarnations of a trainable neural network, known as the Perceptron, was devised not by a mathematician but by a psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt, at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in 1958. The potential utility of AI in mental health was widely recognized by the 1960s, inspiring early computerized psychotherapists such as the DOCTOR script that ran on the ELIZA chatbot developed by Joseph Weizenbaum, who shows up in all three of the nonfiction books in this article.

Weizenbaum, who died in 2008, was profoundly concerned about the possibility of computerized therapy. “Computers can make psychiatric judgments,” he wrote in his 1976 book Computer Power and Human Reason. “They can flip coins in much more sophisticated ways than can the most patient human being. The point is that they ought not to be given such tasks. They may even be able to arrive at ‘correct’ decisions in some cases—but always and necessarily on bases no human being should be willing to accept.”

It’s a caution worth keeping in mind. As AI therapists arrive at scale, we’re seeing them play out a familiar dynamic: Tools designed with superficially good intentions are enmeshed with systems that can exploit, surveil, and reshape human behavior. In a frenzied attempt to unlock new opportunities for patients in dire need of mental-health support, we may be locking other doors behind them.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <h2>Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-29</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/29/1129308/bangladesh-garment-sustainability-frugal-factories/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals like lead and cadmium—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has quietly become an unlikely leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions. Bangladesh now boasts 268 LEED-certified garment factories—more than any other country. Dye plants are using safer chemicals, tanneries are adopting cleaner tanning methods and treating wastewater, workshops are switching to more efficient LED lighting, and solar panels glint from rooftops. The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads.

In Fakir Eco Knitwears’ LEED Gold–certified factory in Narayanganj, a city near Dhaka, skylights reduce energy consumption from electric lighting by 40%, and AI-driven cutters allow workers to recycle 95% of fabric scraps into new yarns. “We save energy by using daylight, solar power, and rainwater instead of heavy AC and boilers,” says Md. Anisuzzaman, an engineer at the company. “It shows how local resources can make production greener and more sustainable.”

The shift to green factories in Bangladesh is financed through a combination of factory investments, loans from Bangladesh Bank’s Green Transformation Fund, and pressure from international buyers who reward compliance with ongoing orders. One prominent program is the Partnership for Cleaner Textile (PaCT), an initiative run by the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation. Launched in 2013, PaCT has worked with more than 450 factories on cleaner production methods. By its count, the effort now saves 35 billion liters of fresh water annually, enough to meet the needs of 1.9 million people.

It’s a good start, but Bangladesh’s $40 billion garment industry still has a long way to go. The shift to environmentalism at the factory level hasn’t translated to improved outcomes for the sector’s 4.4 million workers.

Wage theft and delayed payments are widespread. The minimum wage, some 12,500 taka per month (about $113), is far below the $200 proposed by unions—which has meant frequent strikes and protests over pay, overtime, and job security. “Since Rana Plaza, building safety and factory conditions have improved, but the mindset remains unchanged,” says A.K.M. Ashraf Uddin, executive director of the Bangladesh Labour Foundation, a nonprofit labor rights group. “Profit still comes first, and workers’ freedom of speech is yet to be realized.”

In the worst case, greener industry practices could actually exacerbate inequality. Smaller factories dominate the sector, and they struggle to afford upgrades. But without those upgrades, businesses could find themselves excluded from certain markets. One of those is the European Union, which plans to require companies to address human rights and environmental problems in supply chains starting in 2027. A cleaner Buriganga River mends just a small corner of a vast tapestry of need.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s been a busy and productive year here at MIT Technology Review. We published magazine issues on power, creativity, innovation, bodies, relationships, and security. We hosted 14 exclusive virtual conversations with our editors and outside experts in our subscriber-only series, Roundtables, and held two events on MIT’s campus. And we published hundreds of articles online, following new developments in computing, climate tech, robotics, and more.

As the year winds down, we wanted to give you a chance to revisit a bit of this work with us. Whether we were covering the red-hot rise of artificial intelligence or the future of biotech, these are some of the stories that resonated the most with our readers.

We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.

Understanding AI’s energy use was a huge global conversation in 2025 as hundreds of millions of people began using generative AI tools on a regular basis. Senior reporters James O’Donnell and Casey Crownhart dug into the numbers and published an unprecedented look at AI’s resource demand, down to the level of a single query, to help us know how much energy and water AI may require moving forward.

We’re learning more about what vitamin D does to our bodies

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, particularly in the winter when there’s less sunlight to drive its production in our bodies. The “sunshine vitamin” is important for bone health, but as senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou reported, recent research is also uncovering surprising new insights into other ways it might influence our bodies, including our immune systems and heart health.

Senior editor Will Douglas Heaven’s expansive look at how to define AI was published in 2024, but it still managed to connect with many readers this year. He lays out why no one can agree on what AI is—and explains why that ambiguity matters, and how it can inform our own critical thinking about this technology.

Ethically sourced “spare” human bodies could revolutionize medicine

In this thought-provoking op-ed, a team of experts at Stanford University argue that creating living human bodies that can’t think, don’t have any awareness, and can’t feel pain could shake up medical research and drug development by providing essential biological materials for testing and transplantation. Recent advances in biotechnology now provide a potential pathway to such “bodyoids,” though plenty of technical challenges and ethical hurdles remain.

It’s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot

Chatbots were everywhere this year, and reporter Rhiannon Williams chronicled how quickly people can develop bonds with one. That’s all right for some people, she notes, but dangerous for others. Some folks even describe unintentionally forming romantic relationships with chatbots. This is a trend we’ll definitely be keeping an eye on in 2026.

The electric grid is bracing for disruption from more frequent storms and fires, as well as an uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. And in many ways, the publicly owned utility company Lincoln Electric in Nebraska is an ideal lens through which to examine this shift as it works through the challenges of delivering service that’s reliable, affordable, and sustainable.

Exclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that’s over 30 years old

This year saw the birth of the world’s “oldest baby”: Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived on July 26. The embryo he developed from was created in 1994 during the early days of IVF and had been frozen and sitting in storage ever since. The new baby’s parents were toddlers at the time, and the embryo was donated to them decades later via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

How these two brothers became go-to experts on America’s “mystery drone” invasion

Twin brothers John and Gerald Tedesco teamed up to investigate a concerning new threat—unidentified drones. In 2024 alone, some 350 drones entered airspace over a hundred different US military installations, and many cases went unsolved, according to a top military official. This story takes readers inside the equipment-filled RV the Tedescos created to study mysterious aerial phenomena, and how they made a name for themselves among government officials.

Our newsroom has published this annual look at advances that will matter in the long run for over 20 years. This year’s list featured generative AI search, cleaner jet fuel, long-acting HIV prevention meds, and other emerging technologies that our journalists think are worth watching. We’ll publish the 2026 edition of the list on January 12, so stay tuned. (In the meantime, here’s what didn’t make the cut.)

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

Unveiled by the buzzy startup Deep, Vanguard will let teams of scientists live and work on the seabed for a week at a time.

We’ll keep following these developments, but this just wasn’t their year. Here’s why.

It’s free and easy to nominate yourself or someone you know—here’s how.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-­conditioning, which requires more power and strains grids. But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat—no additional energy required.

“Radiative cooling is universal—it exists everywhere in our daily life,” says Qiaoqiang Gan, a professor of materials science and applied physics at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Pretty much any object will absorb heat from the sun during the day and radiate some of it back at night. It’s why cars parked outside overnight are often covered with condensation, Gan says—their metal roofs dissipate heat into the sky, cooling the surfaces below the ambient air temperature. That’s how you get dew.

Humans have harnessed this basic natural process for thousands of years. Desert peoples in Iran, North Africa, and India manufactured ice by leaving pools of water exposed to clear desert skies overnight, when radiative cooling happens naturally; other cultures constructed “cool roofs” capped with reflective materials that scattered sunlight and lowered interior temperatures. “People have taken advantage of this effect, either knowingly or unknowingly, for a very long time,” says Aaswath Raman, a materials scientist at UCLA and cofounder of the radiative­cooling startup SkyCool Systems.

Modern approaches, as demonstrated everywhere from California supermarket rooftops to Japan’s Expo 2025 pavilion, go even further. Normally, if the sun is up and pumping in heat, surfaces can’t get cooler than the ambient temperature. But back in 2014, Raman and his colleagues achieved radiative cooling in the daytime. They customized photonic films to absorb and then radiate heat at infrared wavelengths between eight and 13 micrometers—a range of electromagnetic wavelengths called an “atmospheric window,” because that radiation escapes to space rather than getting absorbed. Those films could dissipate heat even under full sun, cooling the inside of a building to 9 °F below ambient temperatures, with no AC or energy source required.

That was proof of concept; today, Raman says, the industry has mostly shifted away from advanced photonics that use the atmospheric-window effect to simpler sunlight-scattering materials. Ceramic cool roofs, nanostructure coatings, and reflective polymers all offer the possibility of diverting more sunlight across all wavelengths, and they’re more durable and scalable.

Now the race is on. Startups such as SkyCool, Planck Energies, Spacecool, and i2Cool are competing to commercially manufacture and sell coatings that reflect at least 94% of sunlight in most climates, and above 97% in humid tropical ones. Pilot projects have already provided significant cooling to residential buildings, reducing AC energy needs by 15% to 20% in some cases.

This idea could go way beyond reflective rooftops and roads. Researchers are developing reflective textiles that can be worn by people most at risk of heat exposure. “This is personal thermal management,” says Gan. “We can realize passive cooling in T-shirts, sportswear, and garments.”

Of course, these technologies and materials have limits. Like solar power grids, they’re vulnerable to weather. Clouds prevent reflected sunlight from bouncing into space. Dust and air pollution dim materials’ bright surfaces. Lots of coatings lose their reflectivity after a few years. And the cheapest and toughest materials used in radiative cooling tend to rely on Teflon and other fluoropolymers, “forever chemicals” that don’t biodegrade, posing an environmental risk. “They are the best class of products that tend to survive outdoors,” says Raman. “So for long-term scale-up, can you do it without materials like those fluoropolymers and still maintain the durability and hit this low cost point?”

As with any other solution to the problems of climate change, one size won’t fit all. “We cannot be overoptimistic and say that radiative cooling can address all our future needs,” Gan says. “We still need more efficient active air-conditioning.” A shiny roof isn’t a panacea, but it’s still pretty cool.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/25/1130298/ai-wrapped-the-14-ai-terms-you-couldnt-avoid-in-2025/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If the past 12 months have taught us anything, it’s that the AI hype train is showing no signs of slowing. It’s hard to believe that at the beginning of the year, DeepSeek had yet to turn the entire industry on its head, Meta was better known for trying (and failing) to make the metaverse cool than for its relentless quest to dominate superintelligence, and vibe coding wasn’t a thing.

If that’s left you feeling a little confused, fear not. As we near the end of 2025, our writers have taken a look back over the AI terms that dominated the year, for better or worse.

Make sure you take the time to brace yourself for what promises to be another bonkers year.

As long as people have been hyping AI, they have been coming up with names for a future, ultra-powerful form of the technology that could bring about utopian or dystopian consequences for humanity. “Superintelligence” is that latest hot term. Meta announced in July that it would form an AI team to pursue superintelligence, and it was reportedly offering nine-figure compensation packages to AI experts from the company’s competitors to join.

In December, Microsoft’s head of AI followed suit, saying the company would be spending big sums, perhaps hundreds of billions, on the pursuit of superintelligence. If you think superintelligence is as vaguely defined as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, you’d be right! While it’s conceivable that these sorts of technologies will be feasible in humanity’s long run, the question is really when, and whether today’s AI is good enough to be treated as a stepping stone toward something like superintelligence. Not that that will stop the hype kings. —James O’Donnell

Thirty years ago, Steve Jobs said everyone in America should learn how to program a computer. Today, people with zero knowledge of how to code can knock up an app, game, or website in no time at all thanks to vibe coding—a catch-all phrase coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy. To vibe-code, you simply prompt generative AI models’ coding assistants to create the digital object of your desire and accept pretty much everything they spit out. Will the result work? Possibly not. Will it be secure? Almost definitely not, but the technique’s biggest champions aren’t letting those minor details stand in their way. Also—it sounds fun! — Rhiannon Williams

One of the biggest AI stories over the past year has been how prolonged interactions with chatbots can cause vulnerable people to experience delusions and, in some extreme cases, can either cause or worsen psychosis. Although “chatbot psychosis” is not a recognized medical term, researchers are paying close attention to the growing anecdotal evidence from users who say it’s happened to them or someone they know. Sadly, the increasing number of lawsuits filed against AI companies by the families of people who died following their conversations with chatbots demonstrate the technology’s potentially deadly consequences. —Rhiannon Williams

Few things kept the AI hype train going this year more than so-called reasoning models, LLMs that can break down a problem into multiple steps and work through them one by one. OpenAI released its first reasoning models, o1 and o3, a year ago.

A month later, the Chinese firm DeepSeek took everyone by surprise with a very fast follow, putting out R1, the first open-source reasoning model. In no time, reasoning models became the industry standard: All major mass-market chatbots now come in flavors backed by this tech. Reasoning models have pushed the envelope of what LLMs can do, matching top human performances in prestigious math and coding competitions. On the flip side, all the buzz about LLMs that could “reason” reignited old debates about how smart LLMs really are and how they really work. Like “artificial intelligence” itself, “reasoning” is technical jargon dressed up with marketing sparkle. Choo choo! —Will Douglas Heaven

For all their uncanny facility with language, LLMs have very little common sense. Put simply, they don’t have any grounding in how the world works. Book learners in the most literal sense, LLMs can wax lyrical about everything under the sun and then fall flat with a howler about how many elephants you could fit into an Olympic swimming pool (exactly one, according to one of Google DeepMind’s LLMs).

World models—a broad church encompassing various technologies—aim to give AI some basic common sense about how stuff in the world actually fits together. In their most vivid form, world models like Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 and Marble, the much-anticipated new tech from Fei-Fei Li’s startup World Labs, can generate detailed and realistic virtual worlds for robots to train in and more. Yann LeCun, Meta’s former chief scientist, is also working on world models. He has been trying to give AI a sense of how the world works for years, by training models to predict what happens next in videos. This year he quit Meta to focus on this approach in a new start up called Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs. If all goes well, world models could be the next thing. —Will Douglas Heaven

Have you heard about all the people saying no thanks, we actually don’t want a giant data center plopped in our backyard? The data centers in question—which tech companies want to built everywhere, including space—are typically referred to as hyperscalers: massive buildings purpose-built for AI operations and used by the likes of OpenAI and Google to build bigger and more powerful AI models. Inside such buildings, the world’s best chips hum away training and fine-tuning models, and they’re built to be modular and grow according to needs.

It’s been a big year for hyperscalers. OpenAI announced, alongside President Donald Trump, its Stargate project, a $500 billion joint venture to pepper the country with the largest data centers ever. But it leaves almost everyone else asking: What exactly do we get out of it? Consumers worry the new data centers will raise their power bills. Such buildings generally struggle to run on renewable energy. And they don’t tend to create all that many jobs. But hey, maybe these massive, windowless buildings could at least give a moody, sci-fi vibe to your community. —James O’Donnell

The lofty promises of AI are levitating the economy. AI companies are raising eye-popping sums of money and watching their valuations soar into the stratosphere. They’re pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into chips and data centers, financed increasingly by debt and eyebrow-raising circular deals. Meanwhile, the companies leading the gold rush, like OpenAI and Anthropic, might not turn a profit for years, if ever. Investors are betting big that AI will usher in a new era of riches, yet no one knows how transformative the technology will actually be.

Most organizations using AI aren’t yet seeing the payoff, and AI work slop is everywhere. There’s scientific uncertainty about whether scaling LLMs will deliver superintelligence or whether new breakthroughs need to pave the way. But unlike their predecessors in the dot-com bubble, AI companies are showing strong revenue growth, and some are even deep-pocketed tech titans like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Will the manic dream ever burst? —Michelle Kim

This year, AI agents were everywhere. Every new feature announcement, model drop, or security report throughout 2025 was peppered with mentions of them, even though plenty of AI companies and experts disagree on exactly what counts as being truly “agentic,” a vague term if ever there was one. No matter that it’s virtually impossible to guarantee that an AI acting on your behalf out in the wide web will always do exactly what it’s supposed to do—it seems as though agentic AI is here to stay for the foreseeable. Want to sell something? Call it agentic! —Rhiannon Williams

Early this year, DeepSeek unveiled its new model DeepSeek R1, an open-source reasoning model that matches top Western models but costs a fraction of the price. Its launch freaked Silicon Valley out, as many suddenly realized for the first time that huge scale and resources were not necessarily the key to high-level AI models. Nvidia stock plunged by 17% the day after R1 was released.

The key to R1’s success was distillation, a technique that makes AI models more efficient. It works by getting a bigger model to tutor a smaller model: You run the teacher model on a lot of examples and record the answers, and reward the student model as it copies those responses as closely as possible, so that it gains a compressed version of the teacher’s knowledge.  —Caiwei Chen

As people across the world spend increasing amounts of time interacting with chatbots like ChatGPT, chatbot makers are struggling to work out the kind of tone and “personality” the models should adopt. Back in April, OpenAI admitted it’d struck the wrong balance between helpful and sniveling, saying a new update had rendered GPT-4o too sycophantic. Having it suck up to you isn’t just irritating—it can mislead users by reinforcing their incorrect beliefs and spreading misinformation. So consider this your reminder to take everything—yes, everything—LLMs produce with a pinch of salt. —Rhiannon Williams

If there is one AI-related term that has fully escaped the nerd enclosures and entered public consciousness, it’s “slop.” The word itself is old (think pig feed), but “slop” is now commonly used to refer to low-effort, mass-produced content generated by AI, often optimized for online traffic. A lot of people even use it as a shorthand for any AI-generated content. It has felt inescapable in the past year: We have been marinated in it, from fake biographies to shrimp Jesus images to surreal human-animal hybrid videos.

But people are also having fun with it. The term’s sardonic flexibility has made it easy for internet users to slap it on all kinds of words as a suffix to describe anything that lacks substance and is absurdly mediocre: think “work slop” or “friend slop.” As the hype cycle resets, “slop” marks a cultural reckoning about what we trust, what we value as creative labor, and what it means to be surrounded by stuff that was made for engagement rather than expression. —Caiwei Chen

Did you come across the hypnotizing video from earlier this year of a humanoid robot putting away dishes in a bleak, gray-scale kitchen? That pretty much embodies the idea of physical intelligence: the idea that advancements in AI can help robots better move around the physical world.

It’s true that robots have been able to learn new tasks faster than ever before, everywhere from operating rooms to warehouses. Self-driving-car companies have seen improvements in how they simulate the roads, too. That said, it’s still wise to be skeptical that AI has revolutionized the field. Consider, for example, that many robots advertised as butlers in your home are doing the majority of their tasks thanks to remote operators in the Philippines.

The road ahead for physical intelligence is also sure to be weird. Large language models train on text, which is abundant on the internet, but robots learn more from videos of people doing things. That’s why the robot company Figure suggested in September that it would pay people to film themselves in their apartments doing chores. Would you sign up? —James O&#39;Donnell

AI models are trained by devouring millions of words and images across the internet, including copyrighted work by artists and writers. AI companies argue this is “fair use”—a legal doctrine that lets you use copyrighted material without permission if you transform it into something new that doesn’t compete with the original. Courts are starting to weigh in. In June, Anthropic’s training of its AI model Claude on a library of books was ruled fair use because the technology was “exceedingly transformative.”

That same month, Meta scored a similar win, but only because the authors couldn’t show that the company’s literary buffet cut into their paychecks. As copyright battles brew, some creators are cashing in on the feast. In December, Disney signed a splashy deal with OpenAI to let users of Sora, the AI video platform, generate videos featuring more than 200 characters from Disney&#39;s franchises. Meanwhile, governments around the world are rewriting copyright rules for the content-guzzling machines. Is training AI on copyrighted work fair use? As with any billion-dollar legal question, it depends. —Michelle Kim

Just a few short years ago, an entire industry was built around helping websites rank highly in search results (okay, just in Google). Now search engine optimization (SEO), is giving way to GEO—generative engine optimization—as the AI boom forces brands and businesses to scramble to maximize their visibility in AI, whether that’s in AI-enhanced search results like Google’s AI Overviews or within responses from LLMs. It’s no wonder they’re freaked out. We already know that news companies have experienced a colossal drop in search-driven web traffic, and AI companies are working on ways to cut out the middleman and allow their users to visit sites from directly within their platforms. It’s time to adapt or die. —Rhiannon Williams

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight.

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">Tekpon has acquired 100% of the TNW media and events brands, which cover and convene the European technology ecosystem, from the FT.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.
