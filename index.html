            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA’s first astronauts to fly to the Moon in more than 50 years will pay tribute to the lunar and space exploration missions that preceded them, as well as aviation and American history, by taking with them artifacts and mementos representing those past accomplishments.

NASA on Wednesday (Jan. 21) revealed the contents of the Artemis II mission’s Official Flight Kit (OFK), continuing a tradition dating back to the Apollo program of packing a duffel bag-size pouch of symbolic and celebratory items to commemorate the flight and recognize the people behind it. The kit includes more than 2,300 items, including a handful of relics.

“This mission will bring together pieces of our earliest achievements in aviation, defining moments from human spaceflight and symbols of where we’re headed next,” Jared Isaacman, NASA’s administrator, said in a statement. “Historical artifacts flying aboard Artemis II reflect the long arc of American exploration and the generations of innovators who made this moment possible.”

The Artemis II mission, which may launch as soon as early February, is set to take three NASA astronauts—commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, and mission specialist Christina Koch—and a representative of the Canadian Space Agency, mission specialist Jeremy Hansen, on a 10-day flight that takes them farther out into space than any humans have ever traveled before and then return them safely to Earth.

The mission includes a flyby of the Moon, affording the crew an opportunity to see parts of the far side never observed directly by human eyes.

“During America’s 250th anniversary, Orion will carry astronauts around the Moon, while also carrying our history forward into the next chapter beyond Earth,” said Isaacman.

Inside the OFK are numerous flags of different types, including hundreds of US and “America 250” flags for post-flight presentation. The kit also holds two special examples of the stars and stripes, one that is returning to space for its third time, and another that is finally getting its chance to fly.

The “Legacy Flag,” which first flew on STS-1, the inaugural space shuttle mission in 1981, was then launched to the International Space Station on STS-135, the final space shuttle mission, in 2011 and brought back to Earth by the SpaceX Demo-2 crew, the first astronauts to fly into orbit on a US commercial spacecraft in 2020. NASA then pledged to fly the 13×8 inch (33×20 centimeter) American flag yet again on the next crewed flight to the Moon.

A larger, 3×5-foot (0.9×1.5-meter) US flag is also in the Artemis II OFK. It was prepared like at least seven others to be deployed on the lunar surface until its mission, Apollo 18, was canceled due to budget cuts. The banner was instead put on display at NASA Headquarters in Washington until recently, when it was taken off exhibit to make its premiere flight to the Moon on Artemis.

Other flags inside the mission’s OFK include those representing US states and military branches, the United Nations, various schools, and other countries. The European Space Agency (ESA), which provided the service module for the Artemis II Orion spacecraft, has aboard one of its logo flags for display after the mission.

The Artemis I OFK that flew on an uncrewed test flight in 2022 carried tree seeds around the Moon, similar to how Apollo 14 astronaut Stuart Roosa did in 1971. The resulting Artemis Moon trees, like the Apollo Moon trees before them, have since grown to become living reminders of what humanity is capable of achieving.

On Artemis II, NASA is flying soil samples collected from the base of established Artemis Moon trees that were planted at the agency’s 10 centers. The packets of earth represent “the full cycle of exploration: launch, flight, growth and return to space again,” as explained by NASA. The Canadian Space Agency will restart that cycle with tree seeds it is flying on Artemis II to be planted around Canada.

The Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum has loaned a 1×1-inch (2.54×2.54 cm) swatch of muslin fabric that was cut from the right wing of the original Flyer that the Wright Brothers used to make the first powered flight in 1903. The swatch was cut from a larger sample that previously launched on the space shuttle Discovery‘s STS-51D mission in 1985.

After Artemis II, NASA will return the fabric to the museum, which displays the Wright Flyer as well as other space-flown swatches, including pieces that were landed on the Moon by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in 1969.

Before Apollo 11 touched down with the first humans, NASA’s Ranger 7 became the first US mission to successfully make contact with the lunar surface. Artemis II will carry a copy of a 4×5 inch (10×13 cm) negative of a photo from that 1964 robotic mission. The photo represents “a major turning point in the race to the Moon that will be echoed today through the success of Artemis,” according to NASA officials.

Beyond patches, pins, and decals, a few other standout items in the 10 lb (4.5 kg) Artemis II Official Flight Kit include an SD card recorded with the names of 2.9 million (and counting) people who signed up to be on the mission and metal shavings from the construction of the Space Launch System (SLS) core stage, the largest component of the mission’s launch vehicle.

There is also a badge and a “leather back number” from the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, an annual event in “Space City,” home to the Johnson Space Center in Texas.

In addition to the OFK, the astronauts each have their own Personal Preference Kit (PPK), a smaller pouch in which they can carry mementos that have significance to them. As examples, Wiseman said he is flying a notecard to take down his thoughts during the flight; Glover has a Bible, heirlooms for his wife and children, and a collection of inspirational quotes compiled by Apollo 9 astronaut Rusty Schweickart; Koch has handwritten notes from people she loves to serve as a tactile connection between her and them; and Hansen has four Moon pendants that he is taking for his wife and three children.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Meta heads to trial in the state of New Mexico for allegedly failing to protect minors from sexual exploitation, the company is making an aggressive push to have certain information excluded from the court proceedings.

The company has petitioned the judge to exclude certain research studies and articles around social media and youth mental health; any mention of a recent high-profile case involving teen suicide and social media content; and any references to Meta’s financial resources, the personal activities of employees, and Mark Zuckerberg’s time as a student at Harvard University.

Meta’s requests to exclude information, known as motions in limine, are a standard part of pretrial proceedings, in which a party can ask a judge to determine in advance which evidence or arguments are permissible in court. This is to ensure the jury is presented with facts and not irrelevant or prejudicial information and that the defendant is granted a fair trial.

Meta has emphasized in pretrial motions that the only questions the jury should be asked are whether Meta violated New Mexico’s Unfair Practices Act because of how it has allegedly handled child safety and youth mental health, and that other information—such as Meta’s alleged election interference and misinformation, or privacy violations—shouldn’t be factored in.

But some of the requests seem unusually aggressive, two legal scholars tell WIRED, including requests that the court not mention the company’s AI chatbots, and the extensive reputation protection Meta is seeking. WIRED was able to review Meta’s in limine requests through a public records request from the New Mexico courts.

These motions are part of a landmark case brought by New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez in late 2023. The state is alleging that Meta failed to protect minors from online solicitation, human trafficking, and sexual abuse on its platforms. It claims the company proactively served pornographic content to minors on its apps and failed to enact certain child safety measures.

The state complaint details how its investigators were easily able to set up fake Facebook and Instagram accounts posing as underage girls, and how these accounts were soon sent explicit messages and shown algorithmically amplified pornographic content. In another test case cited in the complaint, investigators created a fake account as a mother looking to traffic her young daughter. According to the complaint, Meta did not flag suggestive remarks that other users commented on her posts, nor did it shut down some of the accounts that were reported to be in violation of Meta’s policies.

Meta spokesperson Aaron Simpson told WIRED via email that the company has, for over a decade, listened to parents, experts, and law enforcement, and has conducted in-depth research, to “understand the issues that matter the most,” and to “use these insights to make meaningful changes—like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with tools to manage their teens’ experiences.”

“While New Mexico makes sensationalist, irrelevant and distracting arguments, we’re focused on demonstrating our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,” Simpson said. “We’re proud of the progress we’ve made, and we’re always working to do better.”

In its motions ahead of the New Mexico trial, Meta asked that the court exclude any references to a public advisory published by Vivek Murthy, the former US surgeon general, about social media and youth mental health. It also asked the court to exclude an op-ed article by Murthy and Murthy’s calls for social media to come with a warning label. Meta argues that the former surgeon general’s statements treat social media companies as a monolith and are “irrelevant, inadmissible hearsay, and unduly prejudicial.”

Meta has also insisted that the state of New Mexico should not be able to admit in court any third-party surveys—or Meta’s own internal surveys—that purport to show a high amount of inappropriate content on Meta’s platforms, because the surveys are, in legal terms, hearsay.

The social media giant seems particularly concerned that its CEO’s reputation, the company’s past privacy violations, and its overall dominance in social media could unfairly sway the jury. Meta has asked the court to preclude the state from introducing any argument, testimony, or evidence about Zuckerberg’s college years, saying “any effort by the state to pluck unflattering comments or incidents from when Mr. Zuckerberg (now in his 40s) was a college student would be both unfairly prejudicial and an impermissible use of propensity evidence to attack Mr. Zuckerberg’s and Meta’s character.” (Zuckerberg famously created an attractiveness-rating website in 2003; Meta’s lawyers have also sought to keep this information out of court in a consolidated trial in California that’s set to begin later this month.)

Meta has also requested that any evidence regarding Meta’s finances, “including its financial size, financial condition, market capitalization, revenues, profits, and wealth—as well as the wealth, compensation, and personal activities of its officers and employees,” be precluded.

It asks that the court not refer to former Meta employees or contractors who the state may call as witnesses as “whistleblowers,” insisting the word “whistleblower” is a legal term of art and that inaccurate or misleading references to people who may not qualify as whistleblowers “would serve only to inflame and confuse the jury.” And it has asked the court that any law enforcement officials who appear as witnesses not appear in uniform.

Meta also wants the court to exclude any reference to Molly Russell, a British teenager who died by suicide in 2017 after consuming content on social media that depicted self-harm and suicide. Meta has argued that “evidence about her use of Instagram and material she allegedly saw on Instagram, her tragic death by suicide, and the United Kingdom Coroner’s investigation into her death” bear no connection to New Mexico or Meta’s case there, nor does the testimony of Russell’s father.

And, despite the company’s recent massive investments into and promotions of its artificial intelligence products, Meta has asked the New Mexico court to exclude any mention of its AI chatbots, stating, “This case has never been about AI chatbots,” and that introducing a “new, complex subject—emerging AI chatbot technology—would risk confusing and misleading the jury about the conduct and statements actually at issue.”

Some of these requests, such as withholding references to “previous cases, Meta’s wealth, or Mark Zuckerberg’s college hotness-rating app, seem pretty standard and straightforward,” says Mark Lemley, a partner at litigation firm Lex Lumina and the William H. Neukom professor at Stanford Law School. “But other requests from Meta seem quite aggressive, such as no reference to self-harm, or state-wide harms, or chatbots, for instance.”

“It’s hard to know without being closer to the case whether there is a specific reason for those requests, though,” Lemley added. (Lemley previously defended Meta in a high-profile copyright lawsuit, then parted ways with the company because of what he described as the company’s “descent into toxic masculinity and neo-Nazi madness.”)

Meta’s alleged failures to prevent child exploitation on its apps have been previously reported. Over the past two years the social media company has been sued by more than 40 US states for allegedly harming youth mental health and has come under fire for reportedly halting internal research that showed that people who stopped using Facebook apps were less depressed and anxious.

The New Mexico case is now headed to trial court for jury selection in Santa Fe on February 2; hearings have been ongoing leading up to the trial.

            <h2>Judge orders stop to FBI search of devices seized from Washington Post reporter</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/judge-orders-stop-to-fbi-search-of-devices-seized-from-washington-post-reporter/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A federal judge today ordered the US government to stop searching devices seized from the house of a Washington Post reporter. It may be only a temporary reprieve for the Post and reporter Hannah Natanson, however. Further proceedings will be held on whether the search can resume or whether the government must return the devices.

Natanson herself isn’t the subject of investigation, but the FBI executed a search warrant at her home and seized her work and personal devices last week as part of an investigation into alleged leaks by a Pentagon contractor. The Post filed a motion to force the return of the reporter’s property, and a separate motion for a standstill order that would prevent review of the seized devices until the court rules on whether they must be returned.

“Almost none of the seized data is even potentially responsive to the warrant, which seeks only records received from or relating to a single government contractor,” a Post court filing today said. “The seized data is core First Amendment-protected material, and some is protected by the attorney-client privilege.”

The materials “should be returned because the search and seizure of Natanson’s reporting materials was an unconstitutional prior restraint—government action that blocks expressive activity before it can occur,” the filing said, adding that the “government’s legitimate interests can be satisfied by issuing a subpoena to Natanson and/or The Post for the same items sought by the warrant.” The multi-device seizure has “suppressed The Post and Natanson’s ability to publish stories on completely unrelated topics,” the filing said.

US Magistrate Judge William Porter today granted the motion for a standstill order. “The government must preserve but must not review any of the materials that law enforcement seized pursuant to search warrants the Court issued… until the Court authorizes review of the materials by further order,” the ruling said.

The Post asked for an expedited briefing and hearing schedule. Porter ordered the government to file a reply by January 28 and scheduled oral arguments for February 6.

FBI agents reportedly seized Natanson’s phone, a 1TB portable hard drive, a device for recording interviews, a Garmin watch, a personal laptop, and a laptop issued by The Washington Post. Natanson has said she’s built up a contact list of 1,100 current and former government employees and communicates with them in encrypted Signal chats.

“The day the FBI raided Natanson’s residence, undersigned counsel reached out to the government to advise that the seized items contain materials protected by the First Amendment and the attorney-client privileges,” attorneys for The Washington Post and Natanson told the court. “Undersigned counsel asked the government to refrain from reviewing the documents pending judicial resolution of the dispute, but the government refused.”

The filing said that unless a standstill order is issued, “the government will commence an unrestrained search of a journalist’s work product that violates the First Amendment and the attorney-client privilege, ignores federal statutory safeguards for journalists, and threatens the trust and confidentiality of sources.”

The six devices seized from Natanson “contain essentially her entire professional universe: more than 30,000 Post emails from the last year alone, confidential information from and about sources (including her sources and her colleagues’ sources), recordings of interviews, notes on story concepts and ideas, drafts of potential stories, communications with colleagues about sources and stories, and The Post’s content management system that houses all articles in progress,” the Post said. “The devices also housed Natanson’s encrypted Signal messaging platform that she used to communicate with her more than 1,100 sources. Without her devices, she ‘literally cannot contact’ these sources.”

The devices also contain personal records like medical information, financial information, and details on wedding planning, the Post said. “The government seized this proverbial haystack in an attempt to locate a needle,” the Post said.

The case involves Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator with a top-secret security clearance, who was accused of taking classified intelligence reports home.

“Even the government cannot expect to find many records responsive to the warrant in this ocean of data because its criminal complaint alleges that Perez-Lugones possessed only a small number of documents potentially containing classified or secret information, which he only began collecting three months ago,” the Post said. “Meanwhile, Natanson has thousands of communications across her more than 1,100 sources. And her devices contain years of data about past and current confidential sources and other unpublished materials. At best, the government has a legitimate interest in only an infinitesimal fraction of the data it has seized.”

The Post suggested that instead of poring through all of Natanson’s devices, the government could get a subpoena “for the same items sought by the warrant—communications with Perez-Lugones, or records allegedly received from him.”

The Freedom of the Press Foundation today said the judge was right to temporarily block the review of materials and should block the review permanently after the scheduled hearing.

“The search and seizure of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson’s records is unconstitutional and illegal in its entirety,” said Seth Stern, the group’s chief of advocacy. “But even the Trump administration’s policies require searches of journalists’ materials to be narrow and targeted and that authorities use filter teams and other measures to avoid searching protected records. That the administration wouldn’t follow its own guidelines shows that the raid on Natanson’s home wasn’t about any criminal investigation, and certainly wasn’t about national security. It was a fishing expedition intended to intimidate and retaliate against a journalist who had managed to cultivate sources all over the government.”</div>

            <h2>Millions of people imperiled through sign-in links sent by SMS</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/millions-of-people-imperiled-through-sign-in-links-sent-by-sms/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Websites that authenticate users through links and codes sent in text messages are imperiling the privacy of millions of people, leaving them vulnerable to scams, identity theft, and other crimes, recently published research has found.

The links are sent to people seeking a range of services, including those offering insurance quotes, job listings, and referrals for pet sitters and tutors. To eliminate the hassle of collecting usernames and passwords—and for users to create and enter them—many such services instead require users to provide a cell phone number when signing up for an account. The services then send authentication links or passcodes by SMS when the users want to log in.

A paper published last week has found more than 700 endpoints delivering such texts on behalf of more than 175 services that put user security and privacy at risk. One practice that jeopardizes users is the use of links that are easily enumerated, meaning scammers can guess them by simply modifying the security token, which usually appears at the right of a URL. By incrementing or randomly guessing the token—for instance, by first changing 123 to 124 or ABC to ABD and so on—the researchers were able to access accounts belonging to other users. From there, the researchers could view personal details, such as partially completed insurance applications.

In other cases, the researchers could have transacted sensitive business while masquerading as the other user. Other links used so few possible token combinations that they were easy to brute force. Other examples of shoddy practices were links that allowed attackers who gained unauthorized access to access or modify user data with no other authentication other than clicking on a link sent by SMS. Many of the links provide account access for years after they were sent, further raising the risk of unauthorized access.

“We argue that these attacks are straightforward to test, verify, and execute at scale,” the researchers, from the universities of New Mexico, Arizona, Louisiana, and the firm Circle, wrote. “The threat model can be realized using consumer-grade hardware and only basic to intermediate Web security knowledge.”

SMS messages are sent unencrypted. In past years, researchers have unearthed public databases of previously sent texts that contained authentication links and private details, including people’s names and addresses. One such discovery, from 2019, included millions of stored sent and received text messages over the years between a single business and its customers. It included usernames and passwords, university finance applications, and marketing messages with discount codes and job alerts.

Despite the known insecurity, the practice continues to flourish. For ethical reasons, the researchers behind the study had no way to capture its true scale, because it would require bypassing access controls, however weak they were. As a lens offering only a limited view into the process, the researchers viewed public SMS gateways. These are typically ad-based websites that let people use a temporary number to receive texts without revealing their phone number. Examples of such gateways are here and here.

With such a limited view of SMS-sent authentication messages, the researchers were unable to measure the true scope of the practice and the security and privacy risks it posed. Still, their findings were notable.

The researchers collected 322,949 unique SMS-delivered URLs extracted from over 33 million texts, sent to more than 30,000 phone numbers. The researchers found numerous evidence of security and privacy threats to the people receiving them. Of those, the researchers said, messages originating from 701 endpoints sent on behalf of the 177 services exposed “critical personally identifiable information.” The root cause of the exposure was weak authentication based on tokenized links for verification. Anyone with the link could then obtain users’ personal information—including Social Security numbers, dates of birth, bank account numbers, and credit scores—from these services.

Of the 701 services, 125 allowed “mass enumeration of valid URLs due to low entropy.” Attackers who had received links from the same service could then easily modify the tokens they had to access other people’s accounts.

Because of the limited view into the practice, these numbers likely significantly undercount the true number of services jeopardizing users’ security and privacy by sending such links.

The likely widespread sending of unsafe links in SMS messages means there are few concrete steps most people can take to protect themselves. Stepping back and assessing the weak authentication processes in general, Muhammad Danish, the lead author of the paper, wrote in an email:

The root causes we found are related to service providers and the burden is on them. We can say users should not give sensitive details to untrusted sources, but that suggestion fails in our case as our list includes even well-established service providers with millions of active users. Users can help us by reporting to the service providers or removing their data until fixed if they see any of these issues in a website.

Examples of the offending services can be found in the paper linked above.

The practice is popular because it imposes lower perceived friction on potential customers. Another benefit is that endpoints don’t have to collect and store usernames and passwords, which have proven over and over to be easily stolen by hackers. Another reason they’re used is the false assumption by the people setting up the service that such links will restrict all others than those who sent the text and endpoint misconfigurations or lack of security reviews of them.

Muhammad, like other security professionals, said authentication links sent by SMS or email aren’t automatically unsafe as long as links are short lived, expire after the first login, and have a cryptographically secure token. Privacy-minded sites, including DuckDuckGo and 404 Media, have opted to authenticate users with a “magic link” that’s sent to an account holder’s email address.

“By not creating a password with us you have no risk of it leaking, and we don’t have to deal with the responsibility of keeping it secure, 404 Media editors wrote. “The sign in link is going to your email, which presumably is protected with two-factor authentication, if you have it set up (which you should!).” Many people who object to the use of magic links fail to realize that many services that require a password already fall back to the equivalent of magic links for account recovery.

To be safe, magic links must be time-limited to lessen the chances of them being used by others. 404 Media says that links expire within 24 hours. DuckDuckGo’s authentication email system works differently. It sends a long one-time password. It’s unclear how long the passcode remains valid.

Magic links also aren’t suitable for sites like Gmail, Office365, or banks that store large amounts of user data and must rely on robust account recovery mechanisms.

Another way to strengthen the security of SMS- or email-based authentication is to require a second factor, in addition to the link sent, although a birthdate, zip code, or other low-entropy factor is insufficient. Further, login attempts must be rate-limited to prevent an attacker from making attempt after attempt until arriving at the right one.

For now, people should recognize that many of the SMS-delivered authentication links they receive may be exposing their sensitive data, and this practice isn’t likely to change soon. Of the 150 affected service providers the researchers were able to contact, only 18 responded and only seven have fixed the failure.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/mrna-cancer-vaccine-shows-protection-at-5-year-follow-up-moderna-and-merck-say/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a small clinical trial, customized mRNA vaccines against high-risk skin cancers appeared to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death by nearly 50 percent over five years when compared with standard treatment alone. That’s according to Moderna and Merck, the two pharmaceutical companies that have collaborated on the experimental cancer vaccine, called intismeran autogene (mRNA-4157 or V940).

So far, the companies have only reported the top-line results in a press release this week. However, the results align closely with previous, more detailed analyses from the trial, which examined rates of recurrence and death at earlier time points, specifically at two years and three years after the treatment. More data from the trial—a Phase 2 trial—will soon be presented at a medical conference, the companies said. A Phase 3 trial is also underway, with enrollment complete.

The ongoing Phase 2 trial included 157 patients who were diagnosed with stage 3 or stage 4 melanoma and were at high risk of having it recur after surgical removal. A standard treatment to prevent recurrence after such surgery is immunotherapy, including Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab). This drug essentially enables immune cells, specifically T cells, to attack and kill cancer cells—something they normally do. But, in many types of cancers, including melanoma, cancer cells have the ability to bind to receptors on T cells (called PD-1 receptors), which basically shuts the T cells down. Keytruda works by physically blocking the PD-1 receptors, preventing cancer cells from binding and keeping the T cells activated so they can kill the cancer.

In the trial, all 157 patients received Keytruda, a standard treatment. But they were randomized in a 2:1 ratio so that some would also get the customized mRNA vaccines. These vaccines were tailored specifically to each patient’s melanomas, carrying genetic instructions to build up to 34 unique markers of their mutated cancer cells. Once in the patient, healthy cells produce those markers and use them to train T cells to identify and attack the cancer cells.

Previous data from the trial reported that 107 participants received the mRNA vaccine and Keytruda treatment, while the remaining 50 only received Keytruda. At the two-year follow-up, 24 of the 107 (22 percent) who got the experimental vaccine and Keytruda had recurrence or death, while 20 of 50 (40 percent) treated with just Keytruda had recurrence or death, indicating a 44 percent risk reduction. The companies did not report the breakdown of the two groups in the press release this week for the five-year follow-up, but said the risk reduction was 49 percent, which is also what the companies reported for the three-year follow-up.

As for side effects, the companies reported that little had changed from previous analyses; adverse events were similar between the two groups. The top side effects linked to the vaccine were fatigue, injection site pain, and chills.

The results “highlight the potential of a prolonged benefit” of the vaccine combined with Keytruda in patients with high-risk melanoma,” Kyle Holen, a senior vice president at Moderna, said.

They also “illustrate mRNA’s potential in cancer care,” he said, noting that the company has eight more Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials going for mRNA vaccines against a variety of other cancers, including lung, bladder, and kidney cancers.

Marjorie Green, a senior vice president at Merck, called the five-year follow-up data a “meaningful milestone” and “encouraging.”

“[W]e look forward to late-stage data from the INTerpath clinical development program with Moderna, across a range of tumor types where significant unmet needs remain,” she said.

While the top-line results appear positive, conclusions can’t be drawn until the full data from the trial are published. The vaccines are also being developed amid a political environment hostile to mRNA vaccines. Anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has railed against mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, making false claims about their safety and efficacy. In August, Kennedy unilaterally canceled $500 million in grant funding for the development of mRNA-based vaccines against diseases that pose pandemic threats.</div>

            <h2>Trump FCC threatens to enforce equal-time rule on late-night talk shows</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/trump-fcc-tries-to-get-more-republicans-on-late-night-and-daytime-talk-shows/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Federal Communications Commission today issued a warning to late-night and daytime talk shows, saying these shows may no longer qualify for an exemption to the FCC’s equal-time rule. Because the FCC is chaired by vocal Trump supporter Brendan Carr, changing how the rule is enforced could pressure shows into seeking out more interviews with Republican candidates.

The public notice providing what the FCC calls “guidance on political equal opportunities requirement for broadcast television stations” appears to be part of the Trump administration’s campaign against alleged liberal bias on broadcast TV. Carr, who has eroded the FCC’s historical independence from the White House, previously pressured ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel and threatened ABC’s The View with the equal-time rule.

The Carr FCC’s public notice today said that federal rules “prevent broadcast television stations, which have been given access to a valuable public resource (namely, spectrum), from unfairly putting their thumbs on the scale for one political candidate or set of candidates over another.” These rules come from “the decision by Congress that broadcast television stations have an obligation to operate in the public interest—not in any narrow partisan, political interest,” the Carr FCC said.

While the public notice doesn’t make allegations against any specific station or program, a conservative group that has filed FCC complaints against broadcast stations treated the move as a victory against “left-wing” shows.

“This major announcement from the FCC should stop one-sided left-wing entertainment shows masquerading as ‘bona fide news,&#39;” wrote Daniel Suhr, president of the Center for American Rights. “The abuse of the airwaves by ABC & NBC as DNC-TV must end. FCC is restoring respect for the equal time rules enacted by Congress.” Suhr’s group filed bias complaints against CBS, ABC, and NBC stations that were dismissed during the Biden era, but the group’s complaints were revived by Carr in January 2025.

The equal-time rule, formally known as the Equal Opportunities Rule, applies to radio or TV broadcast stations with FCC licenses to use the public airwaves. When a station gives time to one political candidate, it must provide comparable time and placement to an opposing candidate if an opposing candidate makes a request.

The rule has an exemption for candidate appearances on bona fide news programs. As the FCC explained in 2022, “appearances by legally qualified candidates on bona fide newscasts, interview programs, certain types of news documentaries, and during on-the-spot coverage of bona fide news events are exempt from Equal Opportunities.”

Entertainment talk shows have generally been treated as bona fide news programs for this purpose. But Carr said in September that he’s not sure shows like The View should qualify for the exemption, and today’s public notice suggests the FCC may no longer treat these shows as exempt.

Commissioner Anna Gomez, the only Democrat on the FCC, issued a press release criticizing the FCC for “a misleading announcement suggesting that certain late-night and daytime programs may no longer qualify for the long-standing ‘bona fide news interview’ exemption under the commission’s political broadcasting rules.”

“Nothing has fundamentally changed with respect to our political broadcasting rules,” Gomez said. “The FCC has not adopted any new regulation, interpretation, or commission-level policy altering the long-standing news exemption or equal time framework. For decades, the commission has recognized that bona fide news interviews, late-night programs, and daytime news shows are entitled to editorial discretion based on newsworthiness, not political favoritism. That principle has not been repealed, revised, or voted on by the commission. This announcement therefore does not change the law, but it does represent an escalation in this FCC’s ongoing campaign to censor and control speech.”

The Carr FCC’s public notice said that talk shows aren’t necessarily eligible for the bona fide news exception despite a 2006 decision in which “the FCC’s Media Bureau determined that the interview portion of ‘The Tonight Show with Jay Leno’ qualified for the equal opportunities exemption as a bona fide news interview.”

The notice said, “Concerns have been raised that the industry has taken the Media Bureau’s 2006 staff-level decision to mean that the interview portion of all arguably similar entertainment programs—whether late night or daytime—are exempted from the section 315 equal opportunities requirement under a bona fide news exemption. This is not the case. As noted above, these decisions are fact-specific and the exemptions are limited to the program that was the subject of the request.”

The public notice pointedly said that “the FCC has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late-night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption.” The notice encouraged programs or stations to promptly file petitions with the FCC if they want “formal assurance that the equal opportunities requirement does not apply” to them.

Gomez urged broadcasters to exercise their free speech rights.

“Broadcasters should not feel pressured to water down, sanitize, or avoid critical coverage out of fear of regulatory retaliation,” she said. “Broadcast stations have a constitutional right to carry newsworthy content, even when that content is critical of those in power. That does not change today, it will not change tomorrow, and it will not change simply because of this administration’s desire to silence its critics.”</div>

            <h2>Astronauts Give Crucial Clue About NASA’s Emergency Space Evacuation</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Four astronauts had to cut their mission on board the International Space Station short after a “medical concern” forced NASA to return them to Earth weeks early.

The space agency has been incredibly careful about not revealing too much in an effort to “protect the crew’s medical privacy.” We don’t know which of the four crew members — including NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov — fell ill. We also don’t know anything about what the medical issue actually was.

Now, Fincke has revealed a tantalizing clue about what went down during the first medical evacuation in the space station’s 25 years of continuous occupation. During their first public appearance following the medical evacuation on Wednesday — during which all four members appeared to be doing well enough to field questions — Fincke said that an onboard ultrasound machine “came in super handy” when “we had this emergency.”

“It really helped,” he added. “Of course, we didn’t have other big machines that we have here on planet Earth. We do try to make sure that everybody before we fly are really, really not prone to surprises.”

“But sometimes things happen and surprises happen, and the team was ready,” Fincke said.

“We can handle any kind of difficult situation,” he told reporters. “This is actually very, very good experience for the future of human spaceflight.”

While we now know that identifying the medical issue involves using a portable ultrasound machine, we’re still left guessing, since a litany of diagnoses can involve the versatile gadget.

After splashdown, the team was helicoptered to the Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego via helicopter for a “planned overnight stay at a local medical facility for additional evaluation,” and was “released as expected,” per NASA.

Among other things, ultrasound can be used to identify issues affecting muscles, joints, and tendons. Considering one of the most common types of injuries on board the space station is musculoskeletal in nature — a 2020 report suggests exercise is ironically the number one source of injuries — it’s entirely possible one of the crew members had injured themselves.

Medical professionals also use ultrasound for cancer screening and checking heart valves for leaks and clots, which could certainly make for an extremely serious situation on board the space station that would warrant an evacuation.

To be clear, NASA hasn’t revealed any details about what caused the agency to orchestrate the first-ever medical evacuation. And whether it ever will remains unclear. Before even jumping into questions during Wednesday’s conference, Cardman preempted any probing questions.

“Just to say it upfront, we are not going to be identifying the crew member or talking through the differential or any of the details of the medical situation,” she said. “Thank you so much for respecting our agency.”

Nonetheless, given the stakes involved, this month’s evacuation is a first test in case things were to go wrong during even longer missions into deep space — like NASA’s Artemis 2 mission to the Moon, which is scheduled to launch just over two weeks from now — in a possibility that the agency will have to prepare for no matter what.

“How we handled everything all the way through nominal operations to this unforeseen operation, it really bodes well for future exploration,” Fincke said.

We’re a well-honed machine here at Johnson Space Center and around the world,” he added. “So when we’re getting ready for Artemis, I am very optimistic.”

            <div id="article-text">A new AI startup formed from the cast-offs of some of the industry’s biggest, most ethically dubious players says it’s definitely pursuing building the tech with humanity’s best interests in mind.

Called Humans& — that’s its actual name, not a typo — the outfit’s founders say their vision is to build AI that empowers people instead of trying to replace their jobs, the New York Times reports, such as by building collaboration software that works like an “AI version of an instant messaging app.”

This nonpareil vision, according to the reporting, has helped Humans& to already raise $480 million in seed funding despite launching just three months ago. Powering its $4.48 billion valuation, its investors include Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, and Google Ventures — moral paragons of human empowerment all.

One of the founders is Andi Peng, a research scientist at Anthropic, which builds the chatbot Claude, and whose CEO Dario Amodei casually predicted that the tech he was helping develop would replace over half of all entry-level white collar jobs. At some point, Peng began to no longer see philosophically eye to eye with her former employer.

“Anthropic is training its model to work autonomously. It loved to highlight how its models churned for eight hours, 24 hours, 50 hours by itself to complete a task,” Peng told the NYT. “That was never my motivation. I think of machines and humans as complementary.”

Two others founders, Eric Zelikman and Yuchen He, are from Elon Musk’s xAI, where they helped build Grok, née “MechaHitler,” a chatbot which so regularly thrusts itself into controversy that it somehow barely registered as newsworthy earlier this month when it generated thousands of nonconsensual — and likely illegal — AI nudes of women and children. Now manumitted from the shackles of Musk leadership, Zelikman is imagining an AI beyond such chatbots as Grok.

“AI has enormous potential to allow people to do more together,” Zelikman told the NYT. “The current paradigm — questioning and answering — is not going to get us there.”

Generally, tech companies don’t say they’re building AI to disenfranchise the working human, dressing up what possibly lies ahead with euphemisms like “boosting productivity.” Still, they do acknowledge the tech’s disruptive effects, if only as a qualifier for how awesome AI will be in the long run. Along with Anthropic’s Amodei, OpenAI Sam Altman predicts that AI will wipe out entire categories of labor. Microsoft chief Satya Nadella expresses his anxiety that AI could make his entire company obsolete at the same time he brags about 30 percent of the company’s code being written with AI. Meanwhile, these companies’ customers openly brag about replacing employees with their AI models.

The barely disguised soullessness with which AI leaders operate, perhaps, has provided a window for entrepreneurs to peddle a more humane message, in good faith or not in good faith, naively or cynically.

“There are some pretty clear principles that designers are beginning to take that favor human-centered approaches,” Ben Shneiderman, a computer science professor at the University of Maryland and an advocate of “human centric” AI, told the NYT. “It goes back to the fundamental principle of ensuring human control.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The advent of generative AI has turned much of the internet into an unrecognizable flood plain of mind-numbing slop.

In the latest sign of the times, the Economic Times — the second most widely-read English-language newspaper in the world, as of 2012 — picked the word “Kafkaesque” as its “Word of the Day” earlier this week. But even the briefest glance at the accompanying illustration reveals that the piece involved little, if any, human oversight.

The issue is the image at the top of the piece — which, to be fair, is labeled as being AI-generated — that attempts to write the word on a blackboard. But it clearly struggles to even spell it, settling on mangled characters that spell something like “Kafkaesliue,” which obviously isn’t a word at all.

It’s a particularly galling fumble given the particular word. Trudging through a wasteland of AI slop online does frequently feel like being trapped in one of Franz Kafka’s works, in the sense that it’s a surreal and illogical experience that feels impossible to break out of.

Netizens have been dunking on the screwup all day, but so far the Economic Times has left the butchered image live on the article. The newspaper didn’t respond to a request for comment.

A quick perusal of the paper’s deluge of “Word of the Day” features — it seems to publish far more than one per day, running three on the day of its “Kafkaesliue” flub alone — suggests that the AI error isn’t a one off. A write-up about the word “pensive,” for instance, features an image showing a coffee cup labeled “celffee.”

The blunders highlight how the news industry is desperately trying to reinvent itself as publishers brace against a torrent of bottom-tier AI-generated content. Media executives have been gearing up for AI to deal the journalism industry a fatal blow as the advent of the tech has left devastating holes in web traffic.

A report published last year found that over half of the internet now consists of AI slop. The result might be described as Kafkaesque. Or maybe “Kafkaesliue.”

“In simple terms, Kafkaesque is what happens when reality stops making sense but still insists you comply,” the Economic Times‘ more-than-likely AI-generated copy explains. “The pronunciation of the word as per Merriam-Webster is- käf-kə-ˈesk.”

The cold rehashing of the word certainly invokes the reality we increasingly find ourselves trapped in. Tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have indeed turned our media environment upside down — in an “absurd, oppressive, and strangely unreal” fate, in the words of the Economic Times.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Still think burger flipping is a low-wage job? Think again.

The Indianapolis-based fast food chain Steak ‘n Shake recently announced a new “Bitcoin bonus” for hourly wage earners. According to an announcement on X-formerly-Twitter, “all hourly employees” at corporate locations will receive $0.21 in Bitcoin per hour.

“We take care of our employees; they, in turn, take care of customers; and the results take care of themselves,” the company declared.

Of course, there’s a catch. As the announcement reads, “employees will be able to collect their Bitcoin pay after a two-year vesting period,” meaning workers will have to stay with the company for two full years before they can actually access their “bonus.”

Vesting periods are typical in corporate compensation models, where employees can be payed in part through stock options, RSUs, or 401(k) contributions. But they’re pretty much unheard of for fry cooks, as is the idea of a bonus paid out through crypto.

The magnitude of the bonus is also rather meager. Assuming there are 2,080 working hours in the year, and that the purchasing power of $0.21 in Bitcoin doesn’t collapse, workers can look forward to collecting the equivalent of a whopping $873.60 after two years — minus fees to convert it back into USD or drugs, whichever they might choose.

It’s also worth noting that workers at franchise locations will be ineligible for the paltry bonus. As of June 2025, there roughly 60 percent of all Steak ‘n Shake restaurants were franchised, according to food-industry publication Tasting Table.

It could also be used to excuse stagnating wages as the cost of living soars. We reached out to Steak ‘n Shake to see whether the Bitcoin bonus was taking the place of other compensation bumps, like cost-of-living wage increases or annual bonuses in US dollars.

The announcement comes a day after the fast-food corporation revealed it was holding $10 million worth of the cryptocurrency in its “strategic bitcoin reserve.” Eight months ago, Steak ‘n Shake began accepting Bitcoin as payment for its deep fried slop — another odd choice among fast food companies, but certainly one in keeping with its increasingly libertarian ethos.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What’s the most surefire way to achieve Civil War 2.0 in the United States? According to one wild simulation, it’s exactly what’s happening right now in Minneapolis.

In October 2024, researchers at the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law (CERL) at the University of Pennsylvania conducted an experiment in which a president ordered a widely condemned federal law enforcement operation in the city of brotherly love.

To carry out the operation, the simulated president tried to federalize the Pennsylvania national guard, which the governor resisted. National guard troops who sided with the state followed suit, prompting the fictional president to order acting US military troops to march on Philly.

According to CERL director Claire Finkelstein’s breakdown of the simulation, newly published in the Guardian, the experiment culminated in a “violent confrontation” between state and federal forces in a major US metropolis.

Finkelstein notes that the war gaming exercise included actual government officials and former senior military leaders, none of whom “considered the scenario unrealistic.” The results were based off the assumption that during a rapidly evolving civil emergency like this, courts would be largely ineffective at stopping federal overreach.

Though the early stages of the Philadelphia simulation closely match the brutal events citizens in Minneapolis have experienced at the hands of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, the model diverges from reality in one key way: municipal and state officials don’t seem interested in attacking ICE agents anytime soon.

Though things definitely look hairy in Minnesota, a significant gulf remains between non-cooperation and armed resistance from municipal and state service members. Under a 2025 municipal ordinance, for example, Minneapolis police are prohibited from cooperating with ICE agents, though they’re also not authorized to interfere in federal enforcement activities.

Minnesota governor Tim Walz has likewise urged protestors not to engage in acts of civil disobedience as he moved to mobilize the Minnesota National Guard. Though some saw the move as a preparation to forcibly expel ICE from Minneapolis, there’s no evidence that this was ever the case; as a national guard official told one local news channel, if state troops do get deployed to Minneapolis, it’ll be to direct traffic, keep protests peaceful, and protect private property.

All in all, the prospect of official resistance currently remains the stuff of simulations. In reality, state power remains pointed in the same place since the start of the ICE crackdown: at protesters, not at the federal agents brutalizing their communities.

            <h2>Sam Altman Lets Loose About AI Psychosis</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/sam-altman-ai-psychosis">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As uneasy questions swirl over the safety of large language models, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to social media to go long on the phenomenon that psychiatrists are calling “AI psychosis” — though pointedly without mentioning it by name.

The extended spiel was provoked by his longtime rival Elon Musk, who had a grave warning in response to a post claiming that Altman’s chatbot has now been linked to at least nine deaths: “Don’t let your loved ones use ChatGPT,” Musk tweeted.

Altman hit back with palpable frustration.

“Sometimes you complain about ChatGPT being too restrictive, and then in cases like this you claim it’s too relaxed,” he fumed. “Almost a billion people use it and some of them may be in very fragile mental states.”

He vowed that OpenAI would do its best to balance the bot’s safety and usability, but insinuated that Musk was being opportunistic with his criticism, stating that “these are tragic and complicated situations that deserve to be treated with respect.”

“It is genuinely hard,” Altman reiterated. “We need to protect vulnerable users, while also making sure our guardrails still allow all of our users to benefit from our tools.”

To an extent, you can understand Altman’s exasperation at Musk calling the kettle black. A self-proclaimed free speech absolutist who frequently rails against “woke” ideology, the selling point of Musk’s chatbot Grok is that it’s unfiltered and supposedly censorship free, rarely refusing even the edgiest of requests. This has spawned controversies such as a posting spree in which it praised Nazis and styled itself “MechaHitler,” or more recently when it generated countless nonconsensual nudes of women and children — none of which have resulted in Grok being meaningfully reined in.

Going for the knockout blow, Altman pointed out the numerous deaths linked to Tesla’s self-driving technology, which he called “far from safe.”

“I won’t even start on some of the Grok decisions,” he added.

Still, one could also accuse Altman of not adequately reckoning with the severity of the phenomenon at hand, AI psychosis, in which users become entranced by the sycophantic responses of an AI chatbot and are sent down a delusional and often dangerous mental health spiral, sometimes culminating in suicide or murder. ChatGPT alone has been linked to at least eight deaths in lawsuits filed against OpenAI, and the chatbot maker has acknowledged that somewhere around 500,000 of its users are having conversations that show signs of psychosis every week.

Altman almost waves away these grim tolls as an inevitable consequence of the product’s popularity. And even its own alarming internal figures haven’t spurred the very concerned minds at OpenAI like Altman to pull or at least seriously muzzle their product. In fact, the company has continued to vacillate on its safety commitments, such as promising an smut-friendly “adult mode” after years of resisting the bot being used for more erotic outputs, or restoring access to its notoriously sycophantic GPT-4o model after fans complained GPT-5 was too cold and “lobotomized” — before making GPT-5 more sycophantic, too.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/googles-ai-mode-can-now-tap-into-your-gmail-and-photos-to-provide-tailored-responses/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI Mode, Google’s conversational Search feature for complex questions, is getting more personalized. The tech giant announced on Thursday that it’s bringing “Personal Intelligence” to AI Mode, enabling it to tap into your Gmail and Google Photos to provide more individualized responses.

The company first debuted Personal Intelligence last week in the Gemini app to allow the AI assistant to tailor its responses by connecting across your Google ecosystem, starting with Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history.

The opt-in feature is now starting to roll out to AI Mode to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in English in the U.S.

By bringing Personal Intelligence to Gemini and AI Mode, Google is leveraging the wealth of user data already within its ecosystem. Since users already rely on services like Gmail and Photos, Google can deliver more personalized experiences that rivals can’t easily match. Of course, not everyone wants AI looking at their photos and emails, so you can turn Personal Intelligence on or off at any time.

“With Personal Intelligence, recommendations don’t just match your interests — they fit seamlessly into your life,” Robby Stein, VP of Product, Google Search, explained in a blog post. “You don’t have to constantly explain your preferences or existing plans, it selects recommendations just for you, right from the start.”

Say you’re planning a vacation and searching for things to do and places to eat that everyone in your family will enjoy. With Personal Intelligence, AI Mode can draw on your hotel booking in Gmail and past travel memories in Google Photos to suggest a tailored itinerary with something for everyone. For example, you might see recommendations like an old-timey ice cream parlor based on the many ice cream selfies stored in Google Photos.

Google notes that AI Mode won’t just give you a generic list of restaurants and activities; it instead provides a personalized starting point for planning.

“Personal Intelligence can also be particularly helpful for shopping, because AI Mode considers the types of items you buy and where you shop,” Stein wrote. “If you need a new coat for your upcoming trip, AI Mode could automatically take into account the brands you prefer, as well as your flight confirmation in Gmail to identify the destination and timing (Chicago in March). You’ll get suggestions for windproof, versatile coats that fit the weather and your preferred look. It’s like a personal shopper who already knows your itinerary and the vibe you’re going for.”

Google says other questions you could ask are: “Make a scavenger hunt for [partner’s name] to celebrate our anniversary. For each location, include a hint about us,” or “I’m decorating [child’s name ]’s bedroom, give me ideas for a theme and suggestions for decor.”

The company notes that AI Mode doesn’t train directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library. Instead, it trains on specific prompts and the model’s responses.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government.

As a result, U.S. users have often found themselves caught in the middle of this tension. Last year, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store in February.

A number of investors competed to purchase the app, and after Trump extended the TikTok ban deadline for the fourth time, the battle is finally over. As of December, TikTok officially signed a deal to divest a portion of its U.S. entity to a group of American investors. And now the deal is set to close this week, Semafor reported on Thursday.

This comes nearly three months after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that approves the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to an American investor group.

A week prior, President Trump announced that President Xi Jinping of China had given his approval of a TikTok deal, which would allow a consortium of U.S. investors to control the platform. ByteDance stated publicly that it would ensure the platform remains available to American users.

According to a memo viewed by TechCrunch, the investor group consists of Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and investment firm MGX. Collectively, they will hold 45% of the U.S. operation, with ByteDance keeping nearly a 20% stake. Axios first reported the news, citing sources who estimate TikTok U.S. is valued at approximately $14 billion — a figure also mentioned by Vice President JD Vance.

In September, a report indicated that a “framework” deal was established between the U.S. and China, with a consortium of investors — including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz — overseeing TikTok’s U.S. operations. These investors were expected to hold an 80% stake, and the remaining shares would belong to Chinese stakeholders.

The newly formed “TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC” will oversee the app’s operations, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance.

Oracle will serve as the trusted security partner, responsible for auditing and ensuring compliance with National Security Terms, according to the memo. The company already provides cloud services for TikTok and manages user data in the U.S. Notably, Oracle previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020.

A White House official previously said Oracle would replicate and secure a new U.S. version of the algorithm, and the U.S.-based TikTok owners could lease the algorithm from ByteDance, which Oracle will then retrain.

ByteDance will not have access to information about TikTok’s U.S. users or any influence over the U.S. algorithm.

​The deal was scheduled to close on January 22, 2026, so hopefully we’ll learn more soon.

Reports from Bloomberg indicate that when the deal is finalized, the TikTok app will be discontinued in the U.S. and users will need to transition to a new platform. However, the specifics of this platform remain largely unclear, including its features and how it will differ from the original app.

To fully understand this high-stakes drama, we’ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok’s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.

The drama first began in August 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.

A month later, Trump’s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.

Things began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. After the Senate passed the bill against TikTok, President Joe Biden signed it.

In response, TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.

Fast-forward to 2024: Trump had a change of heart since his first term and is trying to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.

There have been several contenders, including The People’s Bid for TikTok , a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt. This group has the support of investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Supporters include Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, TV personality and investor Kevin O’Leary, inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, and senior research scientist David Clark.

Another group, called the American Investor Consortium, is led by Employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley and includes Roblox co-founder David Baszucki, Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley, and famous YouTuber MrBeast.

Others in the running included Amazon, AppLovin, Microsoft, Perplexity AI, Rumble, Walmart, Zoop, former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Clothing and fitness data company Under Armour said it is investigating claims of a data breach after a cybercriminal posted millions of customer records to a hacker forum.

The seller told TechCrunch that the data was taken in a November data breach, which the Everest ransomware gang claimed responsibility for in a post on its dark web leak site at the time.

News of the data theft became more widely known this week after breach notification site Have I Been Pwned obtained a copy of the stolen data, and notified 72 million individuals by email that their information had been compromised.

Have I Been Pwned said the stolen Under Armour dataset included names, email addresses, genders, dates of birth, and customers’ approximate location based on postcode or ZIP code. The data also included information relating to purchases.

The seller provided TechCrunch with a sample of the stolen data, which appears to contain millions of records of Under Armour customer purchases and matched the types of data that Have I Been Pwned had reported. The stolen data contains reams of email addresses belonging to Under Armour employees.

When reached for comment, Under Armour spokesperson Matt Dornic told TechCrunch that the company is “aware of claims that an unauthorized third party obtained certain data.”

“Our investigation of this issue, with the assistance of external cybersecurity experts, is ongoing. Importantly, at this time, there’s no evidence to suggest this issue affected UA.com or systems used to process payments or store customer passwords,” the spokesperson added.

“What we know at this time is the number of affected customers with any sort of information that could be considered sensitive is a very small percentage,” said Dornic.

The spokesperson did not immediately respond to a follow-up email asking what types of customers’ information Under Armour considers “sensitive” information, nor did he provide an accurate figure of how many customers are affected by the breach.

“Any implication that sensitive personal information of tens of millions of customers has been compromised is unfounded,” the spokesperson said.

Under Armour did not say if it planned to notify customers whose information was compromised. It did not say if it had received any correspondence from the hackers, such as a demand for ransom.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The top talent behind yet another promising AI startup has been gobbled up by an incumbent. As part of a new licensing agreement, Google DeepMind is bringing on the CEO and several of the top engineers at voice AI startup Hume AI, reports Wired.

What’s left of Hume AI will continue to supply its technology to other AI firms. No financial details of the deal were shared.

TechCrunch has reached out to Google and Hume AI to confirm the news.

CEO Alan Cowen and about seven other engineers will work with DeepMind to improve Gemini’s voice features, according to Wired.

The Hume acquihire is the latest example of a leading AI firm scooping top talent off the market and skirting regulatory scrutiny by acquiring a startup’s team rather than the company outright. Last year, Google acquired viral AI coding startup Windsurf’s CEO and other top researchers, and OpenAI has acquired several startup teams in recent months, including Covogo and Roi. The Federal Trade Commission recently said that it would take a closer look at such deals.

The deal also shows that voice is becoming the next frontier in AI.

Hume AI’s secret sauce is its model’s ability to understand a user’s emotions and mood based on their voice. In 2024, the startup launched its Empathetic Voice Interface, a conversational AI with emotional intelligence. Hume AI has raised close to $80 million to date according to PitchBook, and expects to bring in $100 million in revenue this year, per Wired.

But Hume AI isn’t the only company working on voice-focused models. Google has been steadily improving its Gemini Live feature, which allows a user to have conversations with the chatbot. Last month, Google released a new native audio model for the Live API that improved the model’s ability to “handle complex workflows,” per the Gemini API release notes.

Others in the industry are investing big into voice capabilities as well. OpenAI is reportedly preparing to overhaul its audio models in preparation for its audio-first personal device, created with Jonny Ive’s io, to launch this year. Recent leaks suggest the device could be a form of earbuds.

Last year, Meta also accelerated its AI audio push by acquiring startup Play AI. The Facebook-maker’s Ray-Ban smart glasses are increasingly relying on voice and audio capabilities for tasks like helping you hear conversations in noisy rooms and enabling hands-free control for calls, texts, music, and photos.

“Voice is the only acceptable input mode for wearables,” investor Vanessa Larco told TechCrunch. “This acquisition will only accelerate the need for voice apps.”

Demand continues to increase for voice capabilities. Earlier this month, ElevenLabs, the AI voice generation startup, said it crossed $330 million in annual recurring revenue.

            <h2>From invisibility cloaks to AI chips: Neurophos raises $110M to build tiny optical processors for inferencing</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/from-invisibility-cloaks-to-ai-chips-neurophos-raises-110m-to-build-tiny-optical-processors-for-inferencing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Twenty years ago, a Duke University professor, David R. Smith, used artificial composite materials called “metamaterials” to make a real-life invisibility cloak. While this cloak didn’t really work like Harry Potter’s, exhibiting limited ability to conceal objects from the light of a single microwave length, those advances in material science did eventually trickle down to electromagnetism research.

Today, Austin-based Neurophos, a photonics startup spun out of Duke University and Metacept (an incubator run by Smith), is taking that research further to solve what may be the biggest problem facing AI labs and hyperscalers: how to scale computing power while keeping power consumption in check.

The startup has come up with a “metasurface modulator” with optical properties that enable it to serve as a tensor core processor for doing matrix vector multiplication — math that is at the heart of a lot of AI work (particularly inferencing), currently performed by specialized GPUs and TPUs that use traditional silicon gates and transistors. By fitting thousands of these modulators on a chip, Neurophos claims, its “optical processing unit” is significantly faster than the silicon GPUs currently used en masse at AI data centers, and far more efficient at inferencing (running trained models), which can be a fairly expensive task.

To fund the development of its chips, Neurophos has just raised $110 million in a Series A round led by Gates Frontier (Bill Gates’ venture firm), with participation from Microsoft’s M12, Carbon Direct, Aramco Ventures, Bosch Ventures, Tectonic Ventures, Space Capital, and others.

Now, photonic chips are nothing new. In theory, photonic chips offer higher performance than traditional silicon because light produces less heat than electricity, it can travel faster, and is far less susceptible to changes in temperature and electromagnetic fields.

But optical components tend to be much larger than their silicon counterparts, and can be difficult to mass-produce. And they also need converters to transform data from digital to analog and back, which can be large and take up a lot of power.

Neurophos, however, posits that the metasurface it has developed can solve all of those problems in one swoop because it is about “10,000 times” smaller than traditional optical transistors. The small size, the startup claims, enables it to fit thousands of units on a chip, which results in far more efficiency than traditional silicon because the chip can do many more calculations at once.

“When you shrink the optical transistor, you can do way more math in the optics domain before you have to do that conversion back to the electronics domain,” Dr. Patrick Bowen, CEO and co-founder of Neurophos, told TechCrunch. “If you want to go fast, you have to solve the energy efficiency problem first. Because if you’re going to take a chip and make it 100 times faster, it burns 100 times more power. So you get the privilege of going fast after you solve the energy efficiency problem.”

The result, Neurophos claims, is an optical processing unit that can wildly outperform Nvidia’s B200 AI GPU. The startup says its chip can run at 56 GHz, yielding a peak 235 Peta Operations per Second (POPS) and consuming 675 watts, compared to the B200, which can deliver 9 POPS at 1,000 watts.

Bowen says Neurophos has already signed multiple customers (though he declined to name any), and companies including Microsoft are “looking very closely” at the startup’s products.

Still, the startup is entering a crowded market that’s dominated by Nvidia, the world’s most valuable public company, whose products have more or less underpinned the entire AI boom. There are also other companies working on photonics, though some, like Lighmatter, have pivoted to focusing on interconnects. And Neurophos is still a few years away from production, expecting its first chips to hit the market by mid-2028.

But Bowen is confident the performance and efficiency advances provided by its metasurface modulators will prove a sufficient moat.

“What everyone else is doing is, and this includes Nvidia, in terms of the fundamental physics of the silicon, it’s really evolutionary rather than revolutionary, and it’s tied to the progress of TSMC. If you look at the improvement of TSMC nodes, on average, they improve in energy efficiency about 15%, and that takes a couple years,” he said.

“Even if we chart out Nvidia’s improvement in architecture over the years, by the time we come out in 2028, we still have massive advantages over everyone else in the market because we’re starting with a 50x over Blackwell in both energy efficiency and raw speed.”

And to address the mass-manufacturing issues optical chips have traditionally faced, Neurophos says its chips can be made with standard silicon foundry materials, tools, and processes.

The fresh funding will be used for the development of the company’s first integrated photonic compute system, including datacenter-ready OPU modules, a full software stack, and early-access developer hardware. The company is also opening a San Francisco engineering site and expanding its HQ in Austin, Texas.

“Modern AI inference demands monumental amounts of power and compute,” Dr. Marc Tremblay, corporate vice president and technical fellow of core AI infrastructure at Microsoft, said in a statement. “We need a breakthrough in compute on par with the leaps we’ve seen in AI models themselves, which is what Neurophos’ technology and high-talent density team is developing.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since 2024, Anthropic’s performance optimization team has given job applicants a take-home test to make sure they know their stuff. But as AI coding tools have gotten better, the test has had to change a lot to stay ahead of AI-assisted cheating.

Team lead Tristan Hume described the history of the challenge in a blog post on Wednesday. “Each new Claude model has forced us to redesign the test,” Hume writes. “When given the same time limit, Claude Opus 4 outperformed most human applicants. That still allowed us to distinguish the strongest candidates — but then, Claude Opus 4.5 matched even those.”

The result is a serious candidate-assessment problem. Without in-person proctoring, there’s no way to ensure someone isn’t using AI to cheat on the test — and if they do, they’ll quickly rise to the top. “Under the constraints of the take-home test, we no longer had a way to distinguish between the output of our top candidates and our most capable model,” Hume writes.

The issue of AI cheating is already wreaking havoc at schools and universities around the world, so ironic that AI labs are having to deal with it too. But Anthropic is also uniquely well-equipped to deal with the problem.

In the end, Hume designed a new test that had less to do with optimizing hardware, making it sufficiently novel to stump contemporary AI tools. But as part of the post, he shared the original test to see if anyone reading could come up with a better solution.

“If you can best Opus 4.5,” the post reads, “we’d love to hear from you.”

            <h2>George Saunders Has a New Mantra</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/george-saunders-on-his-new-book-vigil/685698/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anyone who loves George Saunders’s writing can tell you about his wicked imagination: luminous, dark, wholly original, and quite frequently supernatural. Saunders is, after all, the man who gave us Lincoln in the Bardo, about a grieving president and the chorus of ghosts he meets in the graveyard; “Escape From Spiderhead,” a Huxley-esque vision of criminal justice and personal responsibility; and “Fox 8,” about a fox who begins to understand human language by eavesdropping on people’s bedtime stories.

The twin currents that run through these and all of his works, including his newest novel, Vigil, about a spirit tending to a dying oil executive, is large-heartedness paired with unsparing wit. Saunders is funny. Hilarious even. (See also: his short story “The Moron Factory,” published in this magazine last year.) I recently spoke with him about how his ideas come to him, karma, and fiction as a source of truth. Our conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

Adrienne LaFrance: Set the scene for me: Where are you doing your writing? What tools are around you? What do you see on your desk as you write?

George Saunders: Honestly, it doesn’t matter that much to me. I have a really low threshold for vibe. Just whatever. There’s something that happens, I think neurologically, where I’m just like, Okay, this is serious now. I can be on a bus or on a plane, and it’s just like some walls go up where I’m like, Okay, we’re not going outside of this sacred space. I do think of it as sacred. But you could probably say a little more honestly that it’s just where it has to happen, this space where I made my bread and butter.

So it doesn’t really matter. But I do have these little ritual objects. Like I have a quote from Ed Ruscha: Every artist wants to make a picture that will open the gates to heaven. And then there’s a picture that our daughter took of a restaurant in New York that had—I think the restaurant was called America—and it had an inverted American flag [where the stars and stripes have switched spots]. That excites me a little bit, like, Oh yeah, that’s what I’m trying to do.

LaFrance: You’ve said before that sometimes a line of prose will come to you almost in a dream. Do you actually wake up with a sentence or character that has come to you fully formed, or does it flow to you in pieces as you’re walking around?

Saunders: This is a really good writer-talking-to-another-writer question. It’s the interview I would conduct, too! The truth is, it comes so many different ways. And I think the skill that I’ve developed over the years is that, no matter how it comes, I can vet it pretty quickly. Like, I can feel something in the quality of the idea—if it’s a bullshit idea, or one of the ideas that you think about writing but probably should never touch. And then there’s another feeling like, Yeah, maybe. Come back tomorrow. And if it comes back a few times, then I start to take it seriously. Sometimes a little fragment will appear within the wrong story and I’ll move it out. But for me, there is something about the low-intention feeling, where I’m not looking for a story, I’m not hoping to find a way to embed a theme or something. I’m just pretty much an idiot walking through the woods and something goes, Hey, I am delightful!

Read: ‘The Moron Factory,’ a short story by George Saunders

LaFrance: For Vigil, did you start with a character or an idea?

Saunders: It was the idea that there was a generation of people—mostly men—who had spent the best years of their lives refuting climate change when they had pretty good reason to know that it was true. I was doing some reading. And I realized that those men were getting old now. And it was also during a period—one of those almost comical periods—where the weather was going completely haywire. You know, a different disaster every week. And I thought, I wonder if a person like that, if they’re watching the weather, do they go, Oooh, shit? And then that seemed to resonate with other works of literature—of course A Christmas Carol and a lot of Tolstoy—but also it was something that I’m going through as an older person. Just like: How did you do? And how would you decide how you did? Could a person ever arrive at a place where certain truths that seemed undeniable in their youth had been overturned? I mean, I look at my own taste in music.

Saunders: I won’t name bands, but I was so much into that real baroque art rock. Or with reading. I was a big Ayn Rand fan when I was in college. Seemed great to me! It’s lovely that your experience with your life can undermine those earlier ideas, and change them. For most of us, I would imagine those changes are kind of fun and maybe not so bad. But I was thinking, what about for people who started a war? Or delayed action on climate change for 20 or 30 years? Does that truth ever settle on them? Obviously, some people look back and just go, Nope. That’s not a good book. But could someone dislodge them? That is the question.

LaFrance: Dwelling in that mental space—How did I do?, as you put it—how did that affect how you think about your own life?

Saunders: It did something I didn’t expect. It made me resolve to, as regrets come up, just face them. Admit it. That has become a new inner mantra: Admit it. And on so many levels. If you’re reading your work and it’s not quite working, admit it.

We’ve found this with our daughters. They’re such wonderful people. And as they got older, we would have talks with them where we’d say, You know, we kind of messed that up. Sorry. And it’s amazing how that kind of just takes the wind out of any negative sails, to just admit it.

So that’s what this guy in the book can’t do at all. And it’s tragic. It was kind of fun to be him, you know, like, I’m not listening to you. But it was also sad because you keep thinking, Oh, come on, you could give a little bit here. And he’s like, If I give a little bit, I have to give all the way. It also started to make me think a little about various political positions that are very built around denial—the denial of other people’s experience, the denial of the other 50 percent of the population. Ultimately, that’s a terrible, hellish fix to get in, where part of your mind knows that you messed up and would love to repent, and the other part is too frightened. And, of course, the problem is that that combination makes people quite aggressive.

LaFrance: I think what you’re describing—both in your book and in reality—is also this culture of extreme certainty and of doubling down no matter what.

LaFrance: And that takes a toll on everyone, including the people perpetuating it.

Saunders: Yes, 100 percent. I would say it’s karmic in the sense of cause and effect. If you are denying something and you know that it’s true, that’s costing you something every minute in terms of your attention to the rest of the world and your ability to respond to it.

LaFrance: You alluded to getting at the truth in your writing. I’ve talked to a lot of journalists who sometimes find themselves wondering, is the work we’re doing enough? Is it enough to just keep telling the truth? Of course I believe the answer is yes. But I also find myself turning to the arts for truth in a world where reality seems ever shakier. Do you think of the work you’re doing as truth-seeking at its core, or is it all just creative expression?

Saunders: I think they’re the same, actually. As a writer of fiction, you’re seeking truth, but that sounds a little lofty. For me—I’m trying to compel you to come in closer as a reader. How do I do that? Truth is a pretty good way. For example, let’s say I was writing a character, your age, and I got it just right about what high school was like—the smell and the feel of the high-school hallway. You’re leaning in. That’s a technique that writers have always used, but it’s also a form of intimacy, or honesty, to say I know you. We have the same basic brain structure. So if I talk to you about fresh-cut grass on a summer day, I’m going, You know that? And you go, Yeah. And even in times like this, if I try to become the most alert version of myself in that, and I hand it to you, and it lights up your brain, then we’ve just reassured ourselves that that’s a real thing. To reach across time and space and say, You’re not alone. And I don’t mean that in a mushy greeting-card way. You’re not alone. I’m just you on a different day.

I don’t know if you feel this, but I have felt sometimes, reading different magazines and newspapers, that in a certain way, we’re like a very polite older gentleman who’s used to talking in a certain way. And then some thug comes along and knocks him over. And he’s like, I say! It’s like our modes of fairness are getting outlapped by this ridiculousness. But in my work, what I think I’m doing is imagining all these readers who are as frustrated—and maybe even as agitated and scared—as I am, and saying, Okay, let’s resist, but let us not lose ourselves. And one way we can continue to be ourselves is to reassure ourselves that truth and love are still operative. Of course they’re still operative! Cause and effect, still operative. Sometimes I feel like I’m painting the baseboards in a house in which the roof is collapsing. But then maybe somebody would go, Oh, it’s raining in here, but nice baseboards!

LaFrance: But then the sunlight’s coming in where the roof used to be—and did you see those baseboards with all that beautiful sunlight on them?

LaFrance: I’m curious what you’re reading now.

Saunders: I’m reading The Power Broker. It’s really humbling. Just the detail. And then the other thing I read before that, I read Nabokov’s Speak, Memory, which I also hadn’t read. And then I read—I found, in Santa Monica, they had these boxes where people put out their old books, and I found a 1960 combined edition of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. And it was mind-blowing! It was so funny. And deeply political without being political at all—I loved that.

LaFrance: Which books have you reread most over the years?

Saunders: I reread Chekhov. And I read Dead Souls [by Nikolai Gogol] often.

LaFrance: It’s very funny. It’s also Mel Brooks’s favorite book, and I always want to read and watch everything he ever loved.

Saunders: I love that fact. That’s amazing. And, yeah, of course. It makes sense.

LaFrance: This is funny to me because there’s a quality that I ascribe to his work that I also see in yours—this insistent lightness, or even playfulness, in spite of everything else. People don’t necessarily think of Chekhov or Gogol as funny—but they really were. And your books and stories explore the darkest themes while also retaining that light.

Saunders: I do think that’s a comic view of the world. In those moments when we lose control of our lives—which thankfully don’t happen that often, but they do happen. It’s kind of like there’s this action—and this is total Gogol—that produces a reaction, but it’s off. It’s off, and then somebody reacts to the reaction and that’s off. Like life is a pool table but the billiard balls are all weighted in a funny way. That for me is the root of comedy, or at least one root of comedy.

The other one is for somebody to kind of vault over the conventional way of approaching something because those conventional truths sometimes protect power. If you vault over that, say the true thing, and the person laughs? Boom, you’ve made a connection. But maybe the simpler answer here is: I’ve always been a person who jokes.

Saunders: My first girlfriend broke up with me in front of the locker room at the high school and she said, You just make too many jokes. You’re always joking.

Saunders: Yeah! And then I made a joke! And she walked off.

LaFrance: Do you remember what the joke was?

Saunders: I don’t. I know I said something funny, but I don’t remember what it could possibly have been. I think for me it’s a reflex. And sometimes it’s kind of a place to hide, you know?

LaFrance: Of course. Humor as deflection.

Saunders: But in the exact same flavor, it is when I’m feeling things the most deeply that some form of humor comes out. With Lincoln in the Bardo, I realized that humor is actually a subcategory of the thing we just might call wit. And wit is basically the alertness of the writer—being aware of where the reader might be, and then responding to that. So we’re in a really close dance. Sometimes it’s funny, but other times it can be a whole bunch of other different nuanced things where I see where you are, I move you slightly left, you know.

Read: George Saunders on Chekhov’s different visions of happiness

LaFrance: As you’re writing, how are you assessing what’s working or not? How much are you thinking about this dance with the reader in the moment of writing?

Saunders: You know, this is the funny thing. I’m never thinking about it, actually. What it reminds me of most is when I was in high school, I could sometimes be a good class clown. And I had one teacher who really didn’t particularly like you interrupting in class. With her, if you got it right, her face would do this thing where she just would look at you like, All right.

Saunders: So I think about that still. It’s all about when you pull the switch. As a joke comes into your head, if it stays there just a second too long and then you say it, it doesn’t land. There’s an optimal launching point. When I’m typing something fresh, I’m in that mindset. And it’s the same when I’m revising.

LaFrance: The timing, the rhythm, all of it. Though comedians develop their sense over time by experiencing the audience react. With other forms of writing, it’s so solitary, but you still develop this instinct without any feedback from the audience.

Saunders: That’s right. Junot Díaz, I heard him say once that a writer is just somebody who realized rather early that language is power. That’s true of a lot of stand-up or even just comedic riffing—where if you could do it well, you could stay with the grown-ups.

LaFrance: I’ve been thinking so much about the power of language lately, with regard to artificial intelligence—just the degree to which it will change us, having machines that people assume can converse like humans, even though anybody can discern pretty quickly that these models are sycophantic fabulists. But what does it mean to have machines mimicking us in this way?

Saunders: It’s fun, on some level. It’s a fascinating thing. And I think it’s one of those moments where it’s actually as simple as it appears, at least in terms of writing: You should do it yourself. It’s honorable to do it yourself. And when you do it yourself, you put things in there that a machine doesn’t know about you or anything else, things that you learned, you know? So of course you can have a pretty good simulation, but why? What’s the value? I hear people say, Oh, but I really struggle with personal writing. And I’m like, then struggle.

When I pick up a book by anybody, I want that person’s life filtered through that particular art form to come and land on me with my particular experience of both life and the form. So I don’t see what all the fuss is. The only reason I’m afraid is—you know, if you put somebody in a world where they only heard Muzak, their aesthetics would change. Their discernment would change. And then if they listened to Mozart, it would just bother them; they wouldn’t get it. So I do worry about that. And anybody who’s been moved by a novel knows that that’s a big sacrifice. To give up your ability to be moved by a work of prose is a big loss for you.

Read: The elite college students who can’t read books

LaFrance: I’m an optimistic person generally, but I really do believe that despite what you hear about people not wanting to read anymore and not knowing how to read anymore—the power of the written word is undisputed. Maybe it’s not for everyone. But for the people it is for? A few weekends ago, I went to this marathon reading of Moby-Dick at the New Bedford Whaling Museum. It takes place over the course of 30 hours. I loved it so much. One of the most beautiful aspects was that as the hours went on, more and more people started showing up in the hallways, just sitting there reading Moby-Dick silently together. I left thinking, As long as people continue to gather around literature this way, humans are going to be fine. We’re going to be great.

Saunders: That’s true. You know, I do this Substack Story Club. If anyone wants to be encouraged, just look at the comments. Because people are so humane and so smart and so generous with each other. I’ve been thinking about this, that maybe the way we judge how we’re doing is wrong. Because if there’s a core of dedicated readers like there was in the hallways at the museum, they have a disproportionate influence in the world. One, because they themselves are powerful, but also because the way that the light comes to them—through a work of prose—is so much more exquisite. But I do have to say, I feel that part of our political mess has to do with cognitive degradation. The things that people say, the way they say them, the way we accept it.

LaFrance: The informational environment is a mess.

Saunders: It’s a big mess. I was thinking recently about the story about the poison well. How there’s a kingdom, and it has only one well, and if you drink from it, it makes you insane. And then the king, who has his own well, has a decision to make: Should he drink from the poison well and rule his people? Now here’s where the metaphor gets a little messy, because what I think we have to do is protect the clean well. Even if it’s just a little bit of flame in your hand, don’t let the flame go out. In the ’60s, they would talk about the silent majority. Now I think there is a silent majority—or maybe a silent semi-majority—of literary, literate people. So I take some encouragement in that.

LaFrance: Did you ever read that Carl Sagan book from the 1990s, The Demon-Haunted World?

LaFrance: You should take a look at it. He was extraordinarily prescient and always humane and sort of romantic in the way that some of your work is. He was very worried then about a lot of what actually has come to pass. Hearing you talk about the poison well makes me think of him—and how that little flame in our hands is not just about believing in literature but believing in empiricism and the Enlightenment, beauty and truth.

Saunders: Essentially, we’re set up to be selfish. And all those things that you just listed—beauty, truth, empiricism—if a person abides in hardship long enough, they’ll see that all those things you just mentioned are quantifiable goods. The way that they can escape from misery is to be alert to truth. I mean, if you’re in the jungle, you’d better be alert to truth, because otherwise you’ll die. And so if we see literature as just a rarefied version of truth, any sensible person would eventually gravitate toward it because it is life-enhancing, sometimes lifesaving. So it’s not like we’re trying to sell them a lofty, lacy-filigree thing. It’s like, do you want to be in touch with reality or not?

            <h2>Science Is Drowning in AI Slop</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2026/01/ai-slop-science-publishing/685704/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On a frigid Norwegian afternoon earlier this month, Dan Quintana, a psychology professor at the University of Oslo, decided to stay in and complete a tedious task that he had been putting off for weeks. An editor from a well-known journal in his field had asked him to review a paper that they were considering for publication. It seemed like a straightforward piece of science. Nothing set off any alarm bells, until Quintana looked at the references and saw his own name. The citation of his work looked correct—it contained a plausible title and included authors whom he’d worked with in the past—but the paper it referred to did not exist.

Every day, on Bluesky and LinkedIn, Quintana had seen academics posting about finding these “phantom citations” in scientific papers. (The initial version of the Trump administration’s “MAHA Report” on children’s health, released last spring, contained more than half a dozen of them.) But until Quintana found a fake “Quintana” paper cited in a journal he was refereeing, he’d figured that the problem was limited to publications with lower standards. “When it happens at a journal that you respect, you realize how widespread this problem is,” he told me.

For more than a century, scientific journals have been the pipes through which knowledge of the natural world flows into our culture. Now they’re being clogged with AI slop.

Scientific publishing has always had its plumbing problems. Even before ChatGPT, journal editors struggled to control the quantity and quality of submitted work. Alex Csiszar, a historian of science at Harvard, told me that he has found letters from editors going all the way back to the early 19th century in which they complain about receiving unmanageable volumes of manuscripts. This glut was part of the reason that peer review arose in the first place. Editors would ease their workload by sending articles to outside experts. When journals proliferated during the Cold War spike in science funding, this practice first became widespread. Today it’s nearly universal.

But the editors and unpaid reviewers who act as guardians of the scientific literature are newly besieged. Almost immediately after large language models went mainstream, manuscripts started pouring into journal inboxes in unprecedented numbers. Some portion of this effect can be chalked up to AI’s ability to juice productivity, especially among non-English-speaking scientists who need help presenting their research. But ChatGPT and its ilk are also being used to give fraudulent or shoddy work a new veneer of plausibility, according to Mandy Hill, the managing director of academic publishing at Cambridge University Press & Assessment. That makes the task of sorting wheat from chaff much more time-consuming for editors and referees, and also more technically difficult. “From here on, it’s going to be a constant arms race,” Hill told me.

Adam Day runs a company in the United Kingdom called Clear Skies that uses AI to help scientific publishers stay ahead of scammers. He told me that he has a considerable advantage over investigators of, say, financial fraud because the people he’s after publish the evidence of their wrongdoing where lots of people can see it. Day knows that individual scientists might go rogue and have ChatGPT generate a paper or two, but he’s not that interested in these cases. Like a narcotics detective who wants to take down a cartel, he focuses on companies that engage in industrialized cheating by selling papers in large quantities to scientist customers.

These “paper mills” have to do their work at scale, and so they tend to recycle their own materials, even to the point of putting out multiple papers with closely matching text. Day told me that he finds these templates by looking through the papers flagged as being fraudulent by scientific publishers. When he sees a high rate of retractions on a particular template, he trains his tool to look for other, unflagged papers that might have been produced the same way.

Some scientific disciplines have become hotbeds for slop. Publishers are sharing intelligence about the most egregious ones, according to Jennifer Wright, the head of research integrity and publication ethics at Cambridge University Press. Unfortunately, many are fields that society would very much like to be populated with genuinely qualified scientists—cancer research, for one. The mills have hit on a very effective template for a cancer paper, Day told me. Someone can claim to have tested the interactions between a tumor cell and just one protein of the many thousands that exist, and as long as they aren’t reporting a dramatic finding, no one will have much reason to replicate their results.

AI can also generate the images for a fake paper. A now-retracted 2024 review paper in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology featured an AI-generated illustration of a rat with hilariously disproportionate testicles, which not only passed peer review but was published before anyone noticed. As embarrassing as this was for the journal, little harm was done. Much more worrying is the ability of generative AI to conjure up convincing pictures of thinly sliced tissue, microscopic fields, or electrophoresis gels that are commonly used as evidence in biomedical research.

Day told me that waves of LLM-assisted fraud have recently hit faddish tech-related fields in academia, including blockchain research. Now, somewhat ironically, the problem is affecting AI research itself. It’s easy to see why: The job market for people who can credibly claim to have published original research in machine learning or robotics is as strong, if not stronger, than the one for cancer biologists. There’s also a fraud template for AI researchers: All they have to do is claim to have run a machine-learning algorithm on some kind of data, and say that it produced an interesting outcome. Again, so long as the outcome isn’t too interesting, few people, if any, will bother to vet it.

Conference proceedings are the main publishing venue for articles in AI and other computer sciences, and in recent years they’ve been overrun with submissions. NeurIPS, one of the top AI conferences, has seen them double in five years. ICLR, the leading conference for deep learning, has also experienced an increase, and it appears to include a fair amount of slop: An LLM-detection start-up analyzed submissions for its upcoming meeting in Brazil and found more than 50 that included hallucinated citations. Most had not been caught during peer review.

That might be because many of the peer reviews were themselves done by AI. Pangram Labs recently analyzed thousands of peer reviews that were submitted to ICLR, and found that more than half of them were written with help from an LLM, and about a fifth of them were wholly AI-generated. Across the academic sciences, paper authors have even started using tiny white fonts to embed secret messages to LLM reviewers. They urge the AIs to rave about the paper they’re reading, to describe it as “groundbreaking” and “transformative,” and to save them the trouble of a tough revision by suggesting only easy fixes.

AI science slop has spread beyond the journals now, and is also overrunning other venues for disseminating research. In 1991, Paul Ginsparg, who was then a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, set up a special server where his colleagues could upload their forthcoming papers right after they finished writing them. That way, they could get immediate feedback on these “preprints” while the notoriously slow peer-review process played out. The arXiv, as the server came to be called, grew quickly, and spawned sister sites in other disciplines. Together, they now form the fastest-moving firehose of new scientific knowledge that has ever existed. But in the months after ChatGPT was released, preprint servers experienced the same spike in submissions that journals did.

Ginsparg, who is now a professor of information science at Cornell, told me he hoped that this would be a short-lived trend, but the rate of submissions continues to rise. Every arXiv preprint now gets at least a brief glance by a scientist before it’s posted, to make sure it’s at least a plausible piece of science, but the models are getting better at clearing this hurdle. In 2025, Ginsparg collaborated with several colleagues on an analysis of submissions that had recently been posted to the arXiv. They found that scientists who appeared to be using LLMs were posting about 33 percent more papers than researchers who didn’t.

A similar influx of AI-assisted submissions has hit bioRxiv and medRxiv, the preprint servers for biology and medicine. Richard Sever, the chief science and strategy officer at the nonprofit organization that runs them, told me that in 2024 and 2025, he saw examples of researchers who had never once submitted a paper sending in 50 in a year. Research communities have always had to sift out some junk on preprint servers, but this practice makes sense only when the signal-to-noise ratio is high. “That won’t be the case if 99 out of 100 papers are manufactured or fake,” Sever said. “It’s potentially an existential crisis.”

Given that it’s so easy to publish on preprint servers, they may be the places where AI slop has its most powerful diluting effect on scientific discourse. At scientific journals, especially the top ones, peer reviewers like Quintana will look at papers carefully. But this sort of work was already burdensome for scientists, even before they had to face the glut of chatbot-made submissions, and the AIs themselves are improving, too. Easy giveaways, such as the false citation that Quintana found, may disappear completely. Automated slop-detectors may also fail. If the tools become too good, all of scientific publishing could be upended.

When I called A. J. Boston, a professor at Murray State University who has written about this issue, he asked me if I’d heard of the dead-internet conspiracy theory. Its adherents believe that on social media and in other online spaces, only a few real people create posts, comments, and images. The rest are generated and amplified by competing networks of bots. Boston said that in the worst-case scenario, the scientific literature might come to look something like that. AIs would write most papers, and review most of them, too. This empty back-and-forth would be used to train newer AI models. Fraudulent images and phantom citations would embed themselves deeper and deeper in our systems of knowledge. They’d become a permanent epistemological pollution that could never be filtered out.</div>

            <h2>Gavin Newsom’s Record Is a Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/gavin-newsom-record-democrat-california/685423/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Gavin Newsom is currently in the lead for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028. Newsom’s early advantage is especially impressive for the way that it puts him well ahead of candidates with better name recognition, including Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Every other Democrat who hasn’t already run for president is stuck polling in the single digits.

A key source of Newsom’s appeal is the belief that he’s electable. It’s easy to see why the party’s voters have such a favorable view of his political skills. The California governor has combined an ideological flexibility—lately embracing both the “abundance agenda” and dialogues with conservatives—with a relentless mockery of President Trump. His new persona as a fighting moderate, a Democrat in tune with the country’s shifting desires and ruthless toward the man at the top, deftly speaks to the needs of a party desperate to regain the White House.

But Newsom has a problem: He has been a California politician for decades, and has held the state’s governorship since 2019. During his tenure, the state has been a laboratory for some of the Democratic Party’s most politically fraught policies and instincts, which has left it less affordable and more culturally radical than it used to be. His record not only raises pressing questions about how effectively he could govern as president; it also provides opponents an endless buffet of vulnerabilities across social and economic issues.

Indeed, many of Newsom’s positions read as if they were reverse-engineered from Republican attack ads. California has spent billions of dollars offering Medicaid to undocumented immigrants, and millions more on providing transgender surgeries for prisoners, some of them on death row. But because these policies either command majority support among Democratic voters or matter enormously to progressive interest groups, Newsom could very well make it through a primary despite a record that would repulse swing voters come November 2028. Just about everything people don’t like about the Democratic Party has come true in Newsom’s California.

Democrats have turned affordability into their most effective cudgel against the Trump administration. Should he run for president, Newsom’s record in California would seriously compromise this message.

The state’s long-standing aversion to new construction has made housing notoriously expensive. Its median home price is nearly $1 million, and building multifamily housing costs more than twice as much in California as it does in Texas, and 50 percent more than it does in Colorado. This is one reason that California is among only seven states to have lost residents since 2020.

The state’s high home prices have also driven a surge in homelessness, which has risen by more than 20 percent since Newsom took office. In the absence of shelters and other arrangements, California has allowed public spaces to host homeless encampments. The ubiquity of the state’s homelessness has become one of its most distinctive traits—a haunting tableau of its unaffordability and social disorder. If Newsom wins the nomination, Republican attack ads will inevitably roll the tape of children walking home from school past unsheltered people using drugs in public.

Newsom doesn’t deserve all of the blame. The most serious barriers to housing predate his tenure, and California’s temperate weather makes it easy for homeless people to gather and sleep outside, rather than finding shelter somewhere. He has also lately endorsed policies designed to permit more and cheaper housing, such as a bill he signed in 2021 that ended single-family zoning in the state and legalized building up to four units on every lot. But these changes have yet to move the needle on housing supply in the state. In the first 10 months of 2025, Florida issued permits for three times as many new housing units than California did for every 1,000 residents.

Any welcome, belated moves that Newsom has made to lower costs must also be weighed against other steps he’s made to raise them. Newsom has sought to phase out gas-powered cars, banning their sale by 2035 and their use after 2045. This past spring, Congress stepped in to revoke the waivers that allow California to set such rules, a move that was backed by 35 House Democrats, which Trump signed into law in June. Newsom responded with an executive order doubling down on his aggressive emissions standards.

California has the most expensive gas in the continental United States. It has the highest state-excise tax in the country, at 61 cents a gallon; imposes a sales tax of 10 cents a gallon; and charges another 54 cents a gallon to cover the costs of complying with the state’s environmental regulations. Newsom opposed a repeal of the gas tax in 2018.

There are sound reasons to tax gasoline. But the politics of it are awful. That the state has made gasoline-powered cars more expensive without providing affordable alternatives hardly helps. A grand scheme to link Los Angeles and San Francisco with a high-speed train has already consumed $14 billion in tax revenues and has gone nowhere. The plan now is to build a line connecting Gilroy (80 miles from San Francisco) and Palmdale (more than 60 miles from L.A.) by 2038, at a cost of $87 billion—though both the price and the timeline should be taken with bulldozers of salt. The costs and challenges of building infrastructure may be a national problem, but California’s case is the most embarrassing white elephant.

California’s affordability problems are dire, but Newsom’s greatest vulnerabilities may be cultural issues. His tenure has seen the state fall hard for faddish progressive policies on immigration, education, and crime that either didn’t work, violated the intuitions of most Americans, or both.

In a recent podcast interview with Ezra Klein, Newsom acknowledged some of his political vulnerabilities. He admitted that the state has bungled illegal immigration. (“We failed on the border. We need to own up to that. Largest border crossing in the Western Hemisphere, in my state.”) Unlike Texas and Arizona, which anticipated a surge of migrants in response to the Biden administration’s policies, and deployed state troops to fend them off, California greeted arriving migrants with a “safe and welcoming border,” according to 2023 praise from Newsom.

Jonathan Chait: The coming Democratic civil war

Newsom’s record on immigration will not be helped by his move to expand Medicaid to cover those who entered the country illegally. On Klein’s podcast, Newsom defended this on moral grounds: “I believe in universal health care. Others may say it—I did it.” He did not talk about how the policy may have contributed to the border surge, or acknowledge that allowing people who break the laws to get the same benefits as those who follow them undermines the point of laws.

Newsom also failed to mention just how unpopular the policy is, at least outside of California. When the Democratic polling firm Blue Rose Research asked half a million Americans to rank their support for 190 Republican and Democratic policies, they found that providing free health care to undocumented immigrants placed 187th, making it a touch more popular than abolishing prisons and abolishing the police. Newsom also declined to note that the state, at his direction, is suspending Medicaid enrollment for new undocumented applicants this year due to budget shortfalls.

Under Newsom, California’s schools de-emphasized academic rigor and embraced left-wing pedagogy. In 2021, he signed a bill mandating an Ethnic Studies course about power, identity, and social justice for all high-school students. The model curriculum, which in its first draft taught “cisheteropatriarchy” and “hxrstory,” and likened capitalism to white supremacy and racism as a form of power and oppression, sparked concerns and revisions. Newsom quietly defunded the measure in the latest budget just before it was meant to take effect this year. He did not explain why.

During Newsom’s tenure, the state has flirted with various misguided education reforms in the spirit of increasing equity. The governor-appointed University of California Board of Regents committed in 2021 to ending the use of test scores in evaluating applications, in a bid to diversify the student body—despite research suggesting that test scores are perhaps the least biased part of a college application, compared with grades and personal essays. Predictably, the UC San Diego campus—one of the system’s most exclusive—has seen a 30-fold increase in students requiring remedial math instruction since 2020. About 70 percent of those students do not meet even middle-school math standards. If only there were a way of measuring their math abilities before accepting them into what was once one of America’s finest public universities.

Newsom has thrown himself behind progressive stances on affirmative action, crime, and reparations, having recently signed a bill to create an agency that will deliver restitution to the descendants of slaves. These positions put him in lockstep with progressive interest groups but are well to the left of most Democrats, to say nothing of swing voters. In 2022 he signed a law that bars police from arresting anyone for loitering with intent to engage in prostitution, which has left corridors in L.A. teeming with prostitutes. A tough-on-crime ballot measure—opposed by the likes of the ACLU and other progressive groups—passed overwhelmingly in 2024, despite his opposition.

Newsom seems to have recognized that appeasing California’s Democrats puts him out of step with the country. He began tacking toward the center as early as 2023, when he vetoed labor-backed measures to give unemployment benefits to striking workers and extend workplace-safety standards to domestic workers such as nannies.

Conor Friedersdorf: Gavin Newsom is not governing

Following Joe Biden’s political collapse and Trump’s victory, Newsom has more plainly been playing to a wider audience. He recently announced that he was working behind the scenes to stop a union-proposed wealth tax on billionaires. He has expressed his discomfort with policies allowing trans girls and women to compete in women’s sports—something that California currently and controversially allows—and he launched a podcast in early 2025, on which he swiftly hosted Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. He signed a measure in September increasing oil drilling in the state and has spent much of the past year crudely trolling the president online, signaling a breakup with the hall-monitor elements of the left.

Newsom has capably sensed what Democrats want right now, and is delivering it with a roguish charisma. The trouble is that before this awkwardly recent pivot, the governor spent years trying to satisfy every Democratic whim in a state where there was little incentive to appeal to anybody who would even consider voting for Trump.

In political terms, 2028 is ages away. Any Democratic nominee could very well face a Republican candidate so discredited by Trump’s governing failures that their own vulnerabilities pale by comparison. But Newsom’s own missteps are considerable enough that, in a close race, they might well prove decisive.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Updated at 10:14 a.m. ET on January 22, 2026

“The object of the Museum is to acquire power,” announces a crusty old archaeologist in Penelope Fitzgerald’s 1977 satire, The Golden Child. It isn’t a goal he respects. He wants the museum where he’s settled into semiretirement to genuinely devote itself to educating its visitors. Instead, he correctly charges, its curators act like a pack of Gollums, hoarding “the art and treasures of the earth” for their own self-aggrandizement and pleasure.

Fitzgerald never names the museum The Golden Child is about, but it’s a massive state-run one in London: It’s not hard to guess that it’s the British Museum. If she had been writing in the United States, she’d surely have targeted one of the 21 museums that make up the Smithsonian, an institution that has its own struggle with hoarding—and with the public’s idea that it hoards. Its reputation as the “nation’s attic” is entrenched enough that the National Museum of American History winked at it with an exhibit by that name in 1980.

But the Smithsonian has long sought a higher mission than national storage. George Brown Goode, who ran the Smithsonian in the late 19th century and set its intellectual course, swore that it would be not a “cemetery of bric-a-brac” but a “nursery of living thoughts.” He wanted it to consist of “museums of record”—cultural institutions that tell canonical stories about the history of the nation—and today, it does. Its museums do far more than any privately funded ones to shape and crystallize our country’s narrative.

That’s not to say that the individual objects housed in the Smithsonian’s collections aren’t themselves consequential. I recently asked Laura Schiavo, an associate professor of museum studies at George Washington University, why the country needs the Smithsonian, and she told me it was because “we have an obligation to the objects” it owns.

But Americans argue about the Smithsonian far more than we would if only its possessions mattered. When our museums of record tell us a story, that story matters enormously. Maybe that’s why outside efforts to influence the Smithsonian’s viewpoint are part of the institution’s history. Take the Enola Gay. In the early ’90s, the National Air and Space Museum began designing an exhibition that would coincide with the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, focusing on the bomber itself. Initially, curators, working with academic historians, planned a show that would call attention to Japanese civilians’ suffering and question the use of nuclear force.

When the Air Force Association found out, it was furious. Its public response sparked a massive controversy. Newt Gingrich, newly House speaker, protested that the “Smithsonian is a treasure that belongs to the American people and it should not become a plaything for left-wing ideologies.” By the time the Enola Gay went on display in 1995, the show had been stripped not only of critique but also of context. The mess showed that the stories the Smithsonian chooses to tell are even stronger than the Smithsonian itself. Why else would one of the most influential members of Congress, which provides roughly two-thirds of the institution’s funding, treat the Air and Space Museum as a potential political threat?

The current White House seems to share Gingrich’s perspective. In August, the Trump administration announced that it would comprehensively review many of the Smithsonian museums to ensure that they promote American exceptionalism and use “unifying” and “constructive” language in their exhibits and materials. Evidently, this precludes the National Portrait Gallery mentioning Donald Trump’s impeachments in the wall text beside his photograph. (The museum has called it a routine change.)

Read: Take a close look at Trump’s portrait

In a perverse way, such encroachments make sense. If the Smithsonian’s framing of history didn’t matter, nobody in or out of government would care about the language it chose. But if storytelling is the most important of its roles, then it stands to reason that in a moment of profoundly contested national narratives, the Smithsonian is a newly contested institution. By arguing about it, we can argue about ourselves.

Little has been as contested as the debate over what to do with the nation’s Confederate monuments, the subject of an exhibit currently on view at Los Angeles’s Museum of Contemporary Art and the Brick, far from what S. Dillon Ripley, a former secretary of the Smithsonian, called the “vast monumental marble” palaces on the National Mall. In 2015, the white supremacist Dylann Roof murdered nine worshippers at Charleston’s historically Black Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. He had posed online with a Confederate flag, and public reaction to the killings included a push to eliminate Confederate iconography—flags and statues of leaders such as Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Generals Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee—from civic space.

At the time, the U.S. had more than 1,500 of these monuments, which overwhelmingly presented their secessionist subjects as heroes. Most remain standing today, but roughly 200 have come down. After their decommissioning, these statues met fates varied enough to indicate an ongoing lack of consensus about whether these monuments should be seen or preserved. Some went into storage or got moved to Civil War cemeteries, and Charlottesville, Virginia, had its statue of Lee melted down. This monument was especially controversial: The campaign to remove it attracted the attention of the far right and led to the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally at which a counterprotester named Heather Heyer was killed. The tragedy made plain that although Lee, Jackson, and the soldiers they led are long gone, arguments about their memory still have mortal stakes.

The bronze ingots that were made from Charlottesville’s melted-down Lee statue form part of MOCA and the Brick’s “Monuments,” a show that uses the techniques of art, not history, to contextualize these relics of the Confederacy. At MOCA, each decommissioned statue is shown as it came: covered in gruesome red paint; touched only by corrosion; or, in the case of a Jefferson Davis sculpture, pink-streaked and laying on its side. Defaced plinths line the entryway to the exhibit.

The effect is that of an existential demotion: The monuments, which once dominated parks or plazas, seem inert, especially in comparison with the contemporary artworks that surround and react to them. I overheard a woman asking her companion if an enormous statue of Lee and Jackson on horseback was a “real sculpture,” meaning one that once stood in public—a question that demonstrates the museum’s ability to sap the monuments of their historical power.

And yet “Monuments” arguably contains more commentary on the present than claims of any kind of victory over the past. Its paint-bombed Davis shares a gallery with a series of huge Andres Serrano photographs of Klansmen. Serrano’s images are confrontational: His subjects’ eyes communicate their sense of authority, even impunity. Yes, they seem to say, the Confederacy was toppled, but so what? We’re here.

Five miles east, at the Brick, is a more complicated confrontation. When Charlottesville decommissioned its monuments, it gave a bronze statue of Jackson on his horse, Little Sorrel, to the artist Kara Walker, perhaps best known for her cut-paper silhouettes of the antebellum South and the enormous sugar-coated Sphinx that she installed in a defunct factory in 2014 as an homage to the enslaved workers who long powered the sugarcane trade. For “Monuments,” she transformed the Jackson statue into Unmanned Drone, a sculpture made from severed and rearranged hunks of horse and man. Little Sorrel’s head hangs between its legs, and its rear end rides in the saddle. Human limbs dangle. It’s an oddly forlorn vision, an eternal wanderer who seems to have been punished. It is also the most resonant object—art or monument—in “Monuments.” Unmanned Drone encapsulates the show’s message: These statues may no longer be powerful, but they remain with us, as metal or as headless ghosts.

Clint Smith: Those who try to erase history will fail

An exhibit as opinionated as “Monuments” would likely be impossible at the Smithsonian under any presidency. As the Enola Gay debacle demonstrated, politicians and other stakeholders—including the donors who provide a decent amount of exhibition funding—tend to want the institution to tell uplifting stories. Plenty of visitors would like the same thing. Not everyone is prepared to feel haunted by the nation’s past; it’s easier to imagine the nation’s attic as full of treasures than of ghosts.

Meanwhile, the Smithsonian’s status as an arbiter of national stories also makes some visitors wrongly assume that it celebrates whatever it shows. Robert C. Post, a Smithsonian curator emeritus, writes in his 2013 book, Who Owns America’s Past?, that in the 1980s, the National Museum of American History got critiqued for overlooking the country’s failures as it was striving to do the contrary. Even wall text that explicitly described the Seminole Wars as an “all-out campaign of extermination” could not stand up to “the assumption that anything on display was being affirmed simply by virtue of being there.”

Many of the Smithsonian’s recent troubles revolve around the misapprehension that its museums praise—and should praise—anything they show. The Trump administration seems animated by the conviction that Smithsonian museums use this power to advance a “divisive, race-centered ideology.” Perhaps for this reason, last year’s White House budget contained no funding for the not-yet-built Museum of the American Latino or for the Anacostia Community Museum, which is the Smithsonian’s only museum dedicated to the city it calls home. The latter is housed in a small, inviting building—there’s free coffee in the lobby—in a residential Black neighborhood a few Metro stations from the National Mall. It costs far less than most of its counterparts to run, making the threat to defund it read as hostility to the thought that ordinary Washingtonians deserve inclusion in the Smithsonian and, by extension, in the American story.

I visited the Anacostia Community Museum recently to see “A Bold and Beautiful Vision: A Century of Black Arts Education in Washington, D.C., 1900–2000.” D.C. is the home of the country’s oldest Black high school—Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, founded 84 years before Brown v. Board of Education began the process of school desegregation—and the exhibit traces its teachers’ and graduates’ influence on generations of nationally significant Black artists. One is Hank Willis Thomas, whose work I’d just seen at MOCA; another is Sam Gilliam, a Color School painter whose enormous, beautiful draped canvas Relative I’ve often visited in the National Gallery of Art, where it occupies 13.5 feet of wall. Its installment there is a statement of historical importance: It’s next to Helen Frankenthaler’s Mountains and Sea, generally considered one of the most influential Abstract Expressionist works to come after Jackson Pollock’s drip paintings. By pairing them, the National Gallery’s curators seem to be arguing that Gilliam’s art, which has never received the same attention as Frankenthaler’s, matters just as much.

At the Anacostia Community Museum, Gilliam’s work tells another story entirely. “A Bold and Beautiful Vision” contains three of his paintings, presented not as grand works but as approachable examples of a former D.C. public-school art teacher’s achievement. Museumgoers’ drawings hang near them, suggesting continuity between Gilliam, who died in 2022, and the young artists of today’s D.C. Whereas the National Gallery includes Gilliam in a narrative formerly dominated by white painters, the Anacostia Community Museum uses him to include its visitors in the sweep of American art.

Only the Smithsonian could so powerfully reframe Gilliam’s story. Such is its unique power. No wonder the country argues about it. If anything, we should argue about it more. The White House’s push to suppress the Smithsonian’s programming is part of an attempt to strong-arm influential cultural institutions and, in turn, culture itself. More broadly, though, it seems fruitful for Americans to discuss and debate the stories that our national museums tell. It might even be a sign of trouble not to have some public wrangling about the Smithsonian, especially in the lead-up to the country’s 250th anniversary.

But the gravity of these conversations slows them down, even as it raises the stakes of their outcomes. If the Smithsonian’s potency comes not from its objects but from its ability to shape and record the nation’s history, then, in some ways, it has succeeded too fully. At least right now, what the Smithsonian says has become too meaningful for its own good—which is why, as important as the Smithsonian’s autonomy is, it’s just as vital that the country has other museums, too.

One worker joined the FBI and made a career in counterintelligence, sniffing out Chinese spies. Another developed a strong stomach around blood and guts, inspecting slaughterhouses and processing plants to make sure that the food we all eat was safe. A third worked on the Human Genome Project, bringing “biology’s equivalent of the moonshot” into everyday medicine.

All were fired or left after Donald Trump’s assault on the civil service, along with roughly 300,000 other federal workers. “We want to put them in trauma,” Trump’s Office of Management and Budget director famously said. “We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.”

When Franklin Foer spoke with dozens of former federal workers for our February issue, he found other layers of feeling. Yes, they were traumatized, but also relieved to talk, in detail, about work they had considered something of a mission.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk to Foer about the surprising things that he, a native Washingtonian, learned about the nuances of the federal bureaucracy. We also hear from some of those civil servants about the jobs they loved, and we take stock of what they—and the rest of the country—lost in the mass purge.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Ryan Hippenstiel: ​I always tell people to kind of picture their cellphone and navigating somewhere you’ve never been.

Hippenstiel: My name is Ryan Hippenstiel.

Rosin: And he’s explaining to me how the work that he and his colleagues do helps a person like me, who has no sense of direction, get around—or, I should probably say, he and his former colleagues.

Hippenstiel: First, your cellphone is using GPS technology. Then you have all these layers, right? It might be a layer of restaurants so you can find a new pizza joint.

All of those layers need to be on top of each other in the right place for your car and your iPhone, or whatever it might be, to know what road it’s on.

Rosin: The Earth is not a perfect sphere. It turns out that it’s constantly shifting, in subtle ways.

Hippenstiel: You have subsidence. You have uplift. You have the gravity field underneath the earth changing. You have oscillating poles. So we’re all very blessed with modern technology that can navigate us around an extremely complex environment that’s changing, not realizing that the work’s never done because the Earth truly is changing.

Rosin: Hippenstiel’s work was keeping up with all this complexity so that the maps would remain precise. It’s a field called geodesy.

Hippenstiel: Geodesy is kind of the size and shape of the Earth, right? It’s the sciences behind the size and shape of the Earth, and what changes that the Earth is undergoing at all times.

Rosin: Hippenstiel did this work for the federal government.

Hippenstiel: I was the field operations branch chief for the National Geodetic Survey.

Rosin: Before I talked to Hippenstiel, I was not aware that my getting around depended on the work of the National Geodetic Survey—so do other way more critical things, like precision farming; disaster relief; ships knowing how deep or shallow the shoreline is in real time; even, Hippenstiel says, weapons firing accurately.

The work that he and his colleagues did was invisible, but critical. It kept the ground under my feet stable.

I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. And this week, one year since Donald Trump was re-inaugurated, we’re talking about the federal-government workforce that was.

Manu Raju (on CNN): President Trump is only ramping up his unprecedented push to effectively take a wrecking ball to the federal government, laying off thousands.

Rosin: Last April, Hippenstiel accepted a voluntary-resignation package. He joined a mass exodus of federal workers.

In Trump’s first year back, over 300,000 Americans left the government—

President Donald Trump: We’re removing all of the unnecessary, incompetent, and corrupt bureaucrats from the federal workforce.

Trump: If they don’t report for work, we’re firing them. In other words, you have to go to office. (Cheers and applause.)

Rosin: —pressured to unceremoniously leave—

Kate Bolduan (on CNN): An offer or a threat? This morning, millions of federal workers are faced with a choice: Stay in their jobs with an uncertain future, or leave the government, leave their jobs, with a buyout from the Trump administration.

Rosin: —careers ended in capricious, even cruel ways.

David Muir (on ABC): The new threat from President Trump now suggesting that some of the 750,000 furloughed government workers told to stay home during this shutdown may not get paid for time lost.

The president said today, “Some people really don’t deserve to be taken care of.”

Rosin: Today, we’re looking back at those careers to take stock of who and what we’ve lost.

Frank Foer: I felt like I, personally, let alone people I talked to out there, even in Washington, were struggling to wrap their minds around the enormity of what has happened to our government.

Rosin: This is Atlantic staff writer Franklin Foer.

Foer: And I felt like we needed to do something that was both intimate and that humanized the loss to government, but that it also had some sense of scale that captured the way in which there’s no department, agency, national park that really has gone untouched in the process of the Trump administration’s effort to collapse large chunks of the American government.

Rosin: Frank spent months tapping into the network. He called one fired worker, who led him to another worker who felt pressured to resign, and so on, until the bigger picture became clearer.

Foer: When I started to talk to these bureaucrats, I would find people who were doing things that I didn’t even know existed. I’ve studied politics and policy my entire life. I had no idea that the government did so many of these things and that they were kind of essential parts of an ecosystem and that, if you remove one of those things, it has rippling effects through the economy, through our science, through our health, through our national defense.

Rosin: Frank’s interviews are compiled in the February issue of the magazine. You’ll hear some of their voices throughout the episode.

Rosin (in interview): You talked to how many people?

Foer: I lost count, but let’s call it, like, 75, 80.

Rosin: Okay, so you talked to 75, 80 people—I’m sure there are themes that emerged.

Foer: There were so many people who took on government service because they had either been veterans themselves, or they’d grown up in military families, or they’d grown up in families where government service was some sort of a tradition. And we think of the military as totally divorced from the civilian part of government, but I think that there’s a lot of the ethos that’s not quite the same, but the same spirit.

The level of satisfaction that, I think, government workers experience is different than most careers. You think of government bureaucrats as being so gray, but what I experienced as I talked to these people were people who couldn’t wait to go into the office in the morning and people who generally thought that they were doing something transcendently important.

Now, there’s a downside to that, right? If you have all of this power, and you consider yourself on this profound mission, you can become arrogant; you can become abusive. But these were people who love their jobs.

Foer: That’s not a cliché, and I think that that explains a lot of the hurt that they felt when they were kicked to the curb in such an undignified sort of way.

Now, I admit this all sounds kind of gauzy as I’m presenting it, but I think that the gauziness of it was kind of part of the surprise for me in the course of doing this, that I felt like I would be meeting people who were more bitter.

And I was very self-conscious about saying, We’re gonna talk about the end at the end of this conversation, but really, most of the conversation is about what you did. I wanna hear about your job. And I think that there was something almost cathartic for a lot of the people to be able to kind of get past the sad part of the story and to talk about the thing that they were most enthusiastic about.

Elizabeth Poole: I actually think that there’s nothing more patriotic that you can do but to work in public service, whether that’s—truly, I thought I was gonna retire from this job. I thought this was it; I’d found the thing I was gonna do forever.

Rosin: This is Elizabeth Poole, one of the people Frank spoke with.

Poole: I worked for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Region 5—that’s the Chicago office, the Great Lakes office—and my job was the children’s environmental-health coordinator. I helped people not just at the agency, but our partners across the six states we served, figure out ways to make better decisions on behalf of children.

I’m from Kentucky, grew up in Kentucky, and so I’ve spent a lot of time in coal country. And so seeing the devastation that coal mining can do on Appalachia, that sort of drove me into wanting to work in the environmental field.

The children’s health role was absolutely my dream job. As soon as I found out it even existed at EPA, it was something I knew I wanted to do. We got to help families make better decisions to keep a healthier home. We got to help schools reduce exposures. We got to do really amazing things to help children.

They experience environmental exposures differently, both from a physiological standpoint, but also a behavioral standpoint, and so we need to make sure that we’re being as protective as possible to vulnerable populations.

Rosin: In early 2025, Milwaukee discovered that lead paint had poisoned at least four students in its public schools. Poole was ready to descend with tests and guidance, but the Trump administration forbade her team from working on the crisis, an allegation that the EPA disputes.

Poole: So it truly was my dream job. I had no plans on leaving until the change in administration, when I just knew they weren’t gonna let us do it the right way; they weren’t gonna let us really protect children in a meaningful, scientifically sound way. We could see the writing on the wall coming from miles away.

So my position was not backfilled. I don’t know if it ever will be backfilled. I try not to talk to my former colleagues about what’s going on, because I can’t imagine how stressful it is for them. Russell Vought said he wanted to traumatize the federal workforce. They’re also being traumatized on a daily basis.

Foer: Part of, I think, our cultural inclination as Americans, kind of the innate libertarianism that’s baked into all of us, and the fact that we’ve had kind of distrust of government and the sense of its inefficiency hammered into us for so long, we’re not inclined to think of bureaucrats charitably.

But when you actually think about what they do, and you learn about their jobs, you see that it’s not just an academic exercise. It’s not just a bunch of paper pushers, that there was a reason that Congress decided to create these jobs, that there was some good, some essential service that they were providing.

Rosin: So think back to when you started the project. What did you expect going into it?

Foer: I wanted to get a portrait of the government in its entirety, across hierarchies. But I entered in a way where I was pretty confident—I was like, I am a native Washingtonian. I’ve grown up in the city. I’ve grown up around bureaucrats. I feel like I’ve written about politics for my entire adult career. I felt like I knew what the U.S. government was, and I actually was pretty surprised over the course of doing this that there were parts of the government that I didn’t know existed.

Rosin: So what surprised you going through this?

Foer: I didn’t understand the way in which the government was constantly making investments in human capital. You can’t walk in off the street and know how to do a lot of government jobs, because they’re esoteric or they’re filling a void. And so the government has all of these improvised processes for helping people get better at what they do.

And so, as I was thinking about this, this simple fact kind of dawned on me, that when you’re pushing somebody out of the government, or you’re firing them, or you’re forcing them to retire, you’re not just losing an expert; you’re losing all this investment that the taxpayer had made in the development of that expertise.

Michael Feinberg: The government invested an immense amount of human capital in terms of getting me to the point where I was when I was forced out.

Rosin: This is Michael Feinberg. He worked at the FBI for 16 years.

Feinberg: My job, for the entirety of my career, was to figure out who in the United States was spying on behalf of the People’s Republic of China, and then figure out ways to either stop them from doing it and arresting them and prosecuting them or, more ideally, actually recruiting them to covertly work for the U.S. government while they were still ostensibly in the service of the Chinese.

Rosin:  Feinberg decided to be an FBI agent after he was at his grandfather’s 90th birthday and he overheard him talking to his younger brother.

Feinberg: They were discussing how they enlisted in the military almost immediately after Pearl Harbor, and it caused me to reflect that 9/11 had not really changed my career path at all. And in all candor, I felt a little bit ashamed that I, who had many more advantages than they ever did growing up, did nothing to help the country that made that possible, while they immediately answered a call to service. So shortly after overhearing that conversation, I applied to the FBI.

Rosin: Feinberg joined the FBI, and his career was a perfect example of what Frank discovered about the investment in human capital.

Feinberg:  The mere application process takes 12 to 24 months.

Rosin: Legal training, lessons on how to interrogate people—

Feinberg: —hand-to-hand combat and firearms and tactics.

The bureau sent me to summers of immersion training in Mandarin.

Rosin: He went from speaking not a word of the language to being able to conduct interviews and interrogations.

Feinberg: There is a myth among many people who have not worked for the intelligence community or law-enforcement agencies before that personnel are fungible, that you can easily force somebody out of retirement age and just have them replaced by a new recruit.  In reality, every year that somebody spends in the community, they are providing more value than they did the year beforehand, simply because they have more expertise and better judgment. It’s not just a question of the millions of dollars that the government spends training us. It is, more importantly, a question of what we learn over time that cannot be taught through any manner other than experience.

Rosin: For the government, the investments in Feinberg were paying off. He was on a path to becoming the FBI’s top Chinese-counterintelligence investigator.

He’d already worked on high-profile cases, the biggest one, which you might have heard of, was against the Chinese telecom company Huawei.

Feinberg: One of the real ironies of how my career ended—I was forced out by the second Trump administration when the Huawei indictments were one of their signal accomplishments against the Chinese government during the first Trump administration.

Rosin: The end for Feinberg came on May 31 in a way that’s become a pattern for this administration: a loyalty test.

Feinberg: I received a phone call from my special agent in charge that Dan Bongino had discovered I was friends with Pete Strzok, who was a former FBI official who gained some notoriety for his criticisms of Trump, and it was made clear to me that my career was over. I would not be getting a promotion for which I was being considered. I would, in fact, be getting demoted. And at the very least, I would be investigated over the nature of my friendship.

Not wanting to put my family through the inevitable hell that all that would entail, I made a decision in about 12 hours that the best thing to do was leave of my own accord and walk away with my dignity and not give them the satisfaction of ruining my life.

Feinberg: Even now, remembering leaving the FBI has been the defining heartbreak of my life. I loved being of use to my community and country, and I’m forced to re-reconcile myself to the fact that that’s something I’m not allowed to do anymore.

For a public servant who has not just dedicated their life, but often risked that life on behalf of his fellow Americans to have that privilege ripped from him for a petty and political reason is, at times, frankly, too much to bear.

Rosin: After the break, we talk to two more federal workers. One reminds us of why the civil service existed in the first place and the other of the civil service in its heyday.

John F. Kennedy: (Applause.) We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.

Rosin: After the Civil War, the federal government’s footprint expanded, and the civil service began to change. Some of that was thanks to universities. They were shifting from being more or less finishing schools for aristocrats to places that produced scientists, engineers, and other professionals. And this expertise made its way to D.C.

Foer: We stop hiring friends of the party in power to do the work of government, and we start seeking out people who are actually equipped to do these problems. We get rid of the patronage system.

And the civil service starts to grow, and it starts to hire all these experts, whether they are economists or lawyers or scientists, and they start to do these things that make American life less harmful. They start to make sure that drugs aren’t toxic, that we’re actually measuring things in an accurate sort of way so we can make good predictions about the weather or about the future of the labor market.

And all of these things help America expand as a country and help us become an economic power. We don’t think of the government as a pillar of our national strength, but we were only able to break through in this sort of way that we broke through as a country in the 20th century because we had a government that had capacity and that people trusted. The world likes to deposit its money in the American banking system because they trust the people who regulate that banking system.

Paula Soldner: My name is Paula Soldner. I became a federal employee in 1987 and was that ’til September 30 of 2025.

Rosin: Soldner exemplifies the federal government in its most elemental form. She spent years regulating products that Americans use and consume every day.

Soldner: I was a food inspector and consumer-safety inspector. We inspected the meat and poultry products that you’ll see in the grocery store. I’m also the National Joint Council chairwoman for the union AFGE presently, even though I am retired from the federal sector.

Rosin: When you think of regulations, you think of someone behind a desk, in D.C. But that is the wrong image for Soldner and her work.

Soldner: An inspector has to have a very strong tolerance for blood. You’ve got to be able to have that strong stomach to endure the blood, to endure the guts, all those internal organs that surgeons on a daily basis see.

Whether it is a hot dog, whether it is a bratwurst, whether it’s a summer sausage, the gamut of what happens on a week could go from slaughtering, to deboning the animal, to watching all the processes to get to that final finished product, and that’s where having the knowledge of somebody getting trained that has been around for years, that’s lost. It’s completely lost.

The other experiences of what we, as the veteran inspectors, did is long gone. You can be as book-smart as you want to be until you step into the reality, onto that slaughter floor.

Rosin: In April, Paula accepted the Trump administration’s offer of early retirement. Many of her colleagues did the same.

Soldner: I dread the long-term effects, when there is life that is lost because of food-safety issues that are not getting corrected. I think losing the experience and the training of these inspectors out there is so critical. And now that it is lost, are we ever gonna get it back?

Rosin: Frank, you talked about the early evolution of the federal workforce after the Civil War: turning away from the patronage system, hiring experts, regulating drugs and keeping things safe. So that was the beginning of the modern federal government. What was its heyday? What was the peak of its growth?

Foer: I think that it really starts in the earliest decades of the 20th century, where these concepts are starting to get embedded. And then, of course, it kind of explodes, ultimately, during the wars that we fight, and especially World War II, and then the aftermath of World War II, when we had the Cold War and the extension of a lot of government.

Kennedy: (Applause.) We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills; because that challenge is one that we’re willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win.

Rosin: When people think of the federal government at its most ambitious, they often think of the Apollo program.

Eric Green: I remember as a child watching everything unfold on a black-and-white television. It was pretty incredible.

Green: I am a physician-scientist who worked at the National Human Genome Research Institute at the U.S. National Institutes of Health for 31 years and even served as the director of the institute for the last 15 years I was there.

Rosin: Green’s work is often referred to as the Human Genome Project.

Green: It’s sort of biology’s equivalent of the moonshot. Instead of putting a person on a moon, what the Human Genome Project did was to read out, for the very first time, the exact order of the building blocks—and there’s 3 billion such building blocks—in all human DNA.

When I get competitive with the moonshot, I sometimes point out that the goal of the Apollo mission and the moonshot was to put a person on the moon. And that’s now been repeated a handful of times—not in the dozens, but a handful of times, we’ve put a person back on the moon. The goal, the signature goal of the Human Genome Project was to read out all the letters in the human genome. That has now been repeated millions and millions of times.

Rosin: The project’s version of the moon landing happened in April 2003, with the first nearly complete sequence declared finished.

Green: When the genome project ended, our institute pivoted to begin to use genomics as part of medicine, basically using genomic information about individual patients to improve their medical management. Genomics has just infused its way into all areas of life sciences, everything from agriculture to ecology to evolutionary studies.

And 22 years ago, there was minimal that we could do in terms of getting insights about a patient’s DNA. And now it’s routine, whether it’s prenatal screening to look for chromosomal and DNA abnormalities in unborn children or in cancer, which is a disease of the genome—the way we deal with cancer now is completely different because of genomics—or with rare genetic diseases. And I just wanna stress that it’s just the earliest days.

The return on investment for the genome project was phenomenal. And I think it continues to be leveraged even up to the present time.

Foer: There was no private-equity, venture-capital firm in the world that was ever gonna put up the $3 billion that was required to do this project that involved cooperation around the world, that was coordinated by the United States but that involved scientists everywhere, in this project that was done “for all mankind,” to use the NASA phrase, and that has all sorts of implications that also require government to open up, to take this $3 billion thing, and then to turn it into something that’s actually—the everyday patient has the ability to access to understand the tumor in their body or to understand the rare disease that their toddler has been afflicted with, and to design therapies that could actually treat these esoteric diseases. That is something only government could do. No private start-up is going to address esoteric diseases. You need the government to unlock that.

Rosin: On March 17, the Trump administration forced Green from his job, the first of five NIH-institute directors it removed.

A Health and Human Services official told The Atlantic that “under a new administration, we have the right to remove individuals who do not align with the agency’s priorities.”

Green: I think of the physicians. I think of the Ph.D. scientists. I think of the technicians, the computer scientists. We did this and my staff who’s still there continue to do this because they really believe in the mission; they believe in public service. But they also, now, have been traumatized by the destructive forces that they’ve witnessed.

Green: I worry about, when it comes time to rebuild the NIH or to rebuild the government, will people think twice that it is worth the risk? Because the way people were laid off was not kind and gentle; it was pretty brutal, and it was not done in a fashion where there was any sensitivity associated with it. In fact, I would describe it as cruel. And I worry that the next generation may think twice about wanting to work in the government, for fearful that an administration could come in and be as destructive as this one has been.

Rosin: To hear from more federal workers, check out Frank’s article online. It’s called “The Purged.” He talks to civil servants who worked on disaster relief, humanitarian aid, at the IRS, the Centers for Disease Control—so much knowledge and so much experience lost.

            <h2>Doomsday-Prepping for Trump’s Third Term</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/dmitri-mehlhorn-trump-third-term/685693/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Betting money puts the odds of constitutional collapse in the United States at about one in 25. Anyone can wager three or four cents on Polymarket, Kalshi, or PredictIt that will pay out $1 if Donald Trump wins a third term in the 2028 election—an impossibility, according to the plain text of the Twenty-Second Amendment: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”

Dmitri Mehlhorn, a former Democratic strategist, thinks that the chance of political apocalypse is about 20 times higher—and that Americans need to start preparing now. He recently secured dual citizenship for his family on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts and is obsessively thinking through how people should respond if Trump tries to maintain power with the threat of force. He styles himself a doomsday philosopher of this worst-case scenario.

On a Tuesday last month, this effort brought him to a co-working space in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood to play a war game of sorts with about 15 finance professionals, nonprofit leaders, technology executives, and former Democratic-campaign advisers—and me.

“Let’s just use fiction to just imagine things so that we’re not all bogged down in prose,” Mehlhorn told the assembled players as the first glasses of wine were poured. The end of the enlightened order, it turns out, is best contemplated with libations and crudités. “Just imagine a world where certain assumptions are true.”

The assumptions were these: It is December 2025, and a term-limited U.S. president is rapidly consolidating control over the military and law enforcement, and pardoning criminal allies. To win, “President Buzz Windrip” and his team must increase their own wealth and maintain power or secure legal amnesty through 2030. They are competing against two other teams: one representing the business community, which seeks to protect and grow its capital and avoid prison, and one representing the defenders of the U.S. constitutional system and the rule of law. The game plays out over several 30-minute rounds, as players submit their actions so that AI agents—the game masters—can calculate the impact of each move and present new challenges. The premise of the game, like a round of Dungeons & Dragons, encourages players to check their personal politics and morality at the door—and to try to think more radically.

“​​You have a man who breaks the law, and that man is the strongman. Which bends, the man or the law? That’s the question,” Mehlhorn told me when we first met to discuss his project. “If the president has proven in his first term that he will ignore subpoenas and ignore congressional budget authorizations and pardon anybody who also does, then suddenly, there’s no power. What are the remaining checks? Every check is gone.”

Mehlhorn’s ideas exist well outside the Democratic mainstream, which remains focused on the midterms and 2028 election—contests that he believes will have little meaning. He assumes that federal law enforcement will operate at Trump’s whims and that Democrat-run states need to build deterrence—threats of federal-tax boycotts, an expansive embrace of states’ rights, a new understanding of the importance of gun ownership, to name a few. His defenders see him as a colorful provocateur who is forcing uncomfortable conversations. His critics in Democratic politics consider his obsessions dangerous distractions, built on fanciful thinking, from the difficult work of winning elections and regaining power.

The game—held in a neighborhood better known for $5,000 handbags than fantastical End Times—is a test of Mehlhorn’s most outlandish ideas. The three teams prepared to split up and move into separate conference rooms to plot their strategy. “It can be zero or one or two winners,” Mehlhorn announced, “but it cannot be three winners.” He didn’t say what soon became clear: The zero-winner scenario means that the nation has collapsed into civil war.

If Mehlhorn is inclined to imagine a president discarding settled norms and restraints, perhaps it’s because he’s so often done so himself. He experienced Trump’s 2016 victory as a century-defining challenge to the American experiment. He responded by transforming himself from a venture capitalist into an iconoclastic Democratic strategist. His ticket was a friendship with Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, whom Mehlhorn told me he knows from their time together at Stanford. As Hoffman’s donor-adviser, Mehlhorn helped direct more than $1 billion in anti-Trump spending from 2017 to 2024, particularly by rallying other wealthy liberals who had ties to Silicon Valley.

Their projects were often unconventional and frequently controversial. They backed prescient planning in 2020 for the possibility that Trump would resist the peaceful transfer of power, and two years later, they warned that “MAGA leaders intend to use 2022 midterm wins to install Trump in 2024 regardless of the vote.” They spoke openly of their efforts to dampen voter enthusiasm in Republican communities, the sort of vote suppression that other Democrats have long tried to combat.

Once it became clear that Trump would run for president again in 2024, Mehlhorn said that he and Hoffman helped fund the failed challenge to Trump’s candidacy under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits federal officials who have “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” from holding office again. (The Colorado Supreme Court ruled in their favor, only to have the decision overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.) They helped pay the legal bills of E. Jean Carroll, a writer who successfully won a civil judgment against Trump for sexual abuse and defamation. They supported the Republican candidacy of former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley during the 2024 primaries, in an effort to weaken Trump. They were early backers of anti-Trump groups such as the Courier Newsroom and Republican Voters Against Trump, and of efforts aimed at turning out young urban voters through giveaways and parties. Frustrated with Democrats’ dependence on television advertising, they funded apolitical Facebook communities that were designed to attract audiences of less likely Democratic voters, who would find themselves bombarded with get-out-the-vote messages.

“The people who had been funding elections through 2016 were extremely conservative and cautious tactically,” Michael Podhorzer, a former strategist for the AFL-CIO who worked with Mehlhorn during the 2020 election cycle, told me. “What he brought from a Silicon Valley perspective was the idea, as he put it, that he would be happy if he funded 10 things and nine failed.”

Mehlhorn was also the rare political operative who did not mind making enemies—or opposing liberal causes, such as voting-rights reform in 2021, which he fought because he thought that it would distract from economic issues important to voters and lacked a path to becoming law. I spoke with one of Mehlhorn’s admiring colleagues, who requested anonymity to speak frankly and described him as “an asshole to a bunch of people who never have people tell them hard things.” Other Democratic strategists who know Mehlhorn were less admiring. Several declined to comment, because they did not share his eagerness to fight with allies. Others remain scarred by public and private feuds with him over strategy, experiences that Mehlhorn acknowledges as “bullying my own allies.”

In 2017, Mehlhorn secretly helped fund a deceptive social-media botnet campaign, which mimicked foreign-interference tactics and was designed to hurt a Republican Senate candidate. The backlash was swift. Hoffman later apologized for how his money had been used, saying that he had not been aware of the project. Mehlhorn said that he would no longer fund such efforts.

Then, in the summer of 2024, Mehlhorn crossed an even brighter line, suggesting in an email to a small network of politicos that the assassination attempt against Trump could have been a false-flag attack in the tradition of authoritarian regimes, such as the one run by Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I know I am prone to bias on this, but this is a classic Putin play and given the facts seems more plausible,” Mehlhorn wrote. “Look at the actual shot. Look at the staging. Look at how ready Trump is to rally.” He pressed recipients to investigate whether the shooting might have been staged so that Trump could benefit from the photos and the backlash.

When the conspiratorial email was published by Semafor, it ignited bipartisan outrage. Mehlhorn apologized. Within a week, Hoffman cut ties. Even as many Democrats distanced themselves, Mehlhorn quickly launched his own effort to support Kamala Harris’s bid for the presidency. But after Trump won, he announced that he was done with electoral politics. Mehlhorn didn’t think that Trump intended to allow free and fair elections again anyway. “This moment demands recalibration, resilience, and resolve,” he wrote to friends weeks after the election. “Even as authoritarian forces ascend, history shows that ingenuity and collaboration can prevail.”

He set about reinventing himself again, this time as a political thinker. He was, he said, no longer fighting the war but working “in the war college.” When we first met for this story, he gave me a list of 30 authors who have shaped his thinking, including the philosophers John Locke, Karl Popper, and Hannah Arendt; the astronomer Carl Sagan; and the retired federal judge J. Michael Luttig. But he felt that the world had already spun beyond the bounds of what traditional white papers could anticipate. So he decided to start working in fiction.

Mehlhorn has written a science-fiction book imagining America’s collapse into autocracy, and he programmed an AI to create a set of fictional Substack authors who write about parts of his political vision. Mehlhorn also founded a new group called the Atoll Society, named for the ring of islands that forms after an underwater volcanic eruption. In this metaphor, Mehlhorn casts the United States as we know it as the exploded volcano, a void. The surrounding islands—a national and an international “archipelago of light”—will have to form the new resistance.

In any role-playing game, the rules shape reality. Players are given win conditions that define their motives, and the game masters are given the ability to throw any obstacle in their way. As the cheese plates arrived in SoHo, the three teams found themselves in uncharted territory. (To get the full, immersive experience, I participated in the game as one of five players on the fictional president’s team. As a condition of my joining, I agreed not to identify or quote the other participants.)

The AI game masters told the players that an Oregon sheriff had started organizing local law enforcement in support of the Constitution and against the president’s consolidation of federal forces. The president’s team moved quickly to prosecute the sheriff for treason. The business community bought up national-media properties in the hope of increasing its leverage with the administration. The constitutional defenders began recruiting retired generals to counteract the president’s consolidation of power. Both the president’s team and the rule-of-law defenders launched back-channel negotiations with the capitalists.

Conditions deteriorated rapidly. The National Guard in blue states began to defect after being federalized by the president, loosening his hold on the military. Wary of the economic instability, the business community tried to relocate money outside the country, prompting the federal government to seize $600 billion. Then the president’s team launched a false-flag cyberattack on electricity infrastructure and pinned it on North Korea.

The exercise quickly descended into the realm of dystopian fiction, as the players wrestled with the same ideas that Mehlhorn has been developing. The constitutional defenders, operating through Democratic state leaders, found themselves leaning into the “states’ rights” powers of the Tenth Amendment. By the later rounds, the blue states had launched a tax boycott, worked to win over the military, embraced the Oregon sheriff as a champion of liberty, and abandoned the long-standing liberal aversion to guns.

“There are a lot of people with guns and military experience in this country. A lot of them. The Democratic Party does not have relationships with them at all,” Mehlhorn said. “You start to have alliances built around the Bill of Rights and start having a notion that the tax, the golden goose of all this wealth creation, is not just going to keep on paying if the federal Constitution is clearly in breach. That set of conversations can create a set of incentives where you actually deter the far-worse outcomes.”

Listening to Mehlhorn, I found it hard not to wonder how he would react if a similar exercise were conducted by Trump supporters—gaming out how to combat a dastardly Democratic power grab by rallying an armed coalition to stop it. Many in the president’s coalition are already warning about a wave of what the White House adviser Stephen Miller calls “domestic terrorism” to obstruct federal authority—a catchall term that Trump aides use sometimes to describe activity protected by the First Amendment, and sometimes to describe the physical obstruction of law-enforcement efforts. Meanwhile, Trump supporters, such as the lawyer Alan Dershowitz and the former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, have been busily preparing their own outlandish scenarios for the president’s indefinite rule. In important ways, the political debate has begun to shift away from what is happening to focus on the darkest visions of what might happen next.

Trump started selling Trump 2028 hats three months after taking office last year. Eight months in, he gathered military leadership to focus on the “war from within.” When Democratic lawmakers released a video reaffirming that the military code does not permit carrying out illegal orders, Trump accused them of seditious behavior “punishable by DEATH.”

Trump has been, for many of his most devoted supporters, delightfully ambiguous about whether he will actually try to run again in 2028. Trump said in March that “there are methods” for getting around the Constitution’s third-term prohibitions. When asked in August, he said that he would “probably not” seek another term but then added, “I’d like to.” He told reporters in October that the Constitution is “pretty clear” that he’s “not allowed to run,” only to have a White House spokesperson say last month that the nation would be “lucky” for such a thing to happen. His chief of staff, Susie Wiles, told Vanity Fair that he would not run again. “But he sure is having fun with it,” she added. “When you think of it, we shouldn’t even have an election,” Trump told Reuters about the 2026 midterms last week. (The White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson provided a statement attacking The Atlantic when she was asked about Trump’s plans.)

Dershowitz, a Harvard Law professor who has worked for both Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, told The Wall Street Journal last month that he had given Trump a draft of a book he wrote that includes suggestions for working around the Twenty-Second Amendment. In one such scenario, Dershowitz told the Journal, he suggests that Republican electors representing Trump, if he were to win, would decline to cast a vote in the Electoral College, which would pitch the decision to Congress, which would then appoint Trump. “They then select, and not elect, the president,” Dershowitz told the Journal, adding that he does not think Trump will pursue this path.

Mehlhorn believes that the most likely scenario is simpler: Trump would announce his candidacy for president late, leading the Republican Party to easily nominate him. The Supreme Court then would either split on the question of whether this is legal or rule against Trump with no effect. (J. D. Vance has repeatedly endorsed the idea of the president defying Supreme Court rulings.) As the votes are being counted, Mehlhorn imagines, Trump and federal law enforcement would declare rampant fraud in urban centers and move to disqualify residents of those districts’ votes. In January 2029, Vance would do what Mike Pence did not do in 2021: use his power to throw the election to Trump. If there is resistance, another a pro-Trump mob—including many who have already been pardoned for the January 6, 2021, attack—could provide backup.

“As president, who stops him?” Mehlhorn asked me as he described the scenario. “Who prevents that from happening? What person? What combination of people?”

Even if you accept the premise that Trump would take such radical steps to achieve a third term, though, there are several answers to this question. The first is that Trump will turn 82 before the 2028 election, making him older than Joe Biden was in 2024. (Mehlhorn agrees that health could be a factor.) The strongest internal check might be the American electorate, which would still have the ability to vote Trump’s allies out of office, splintering his coalition and potentially providing the votes for his impeachment and conviction. A recent Economist/YouGov poll found that 68 percent of the country, including 45 percent of Trump voters in 2024, did not want him to serve a third term. Trump’s recent pivot to try to reverse his falling approval numbers on the economy are an indication, if nothing else, of how much this year’s midterm elections will matter in determining whether he can hold together his coalition.

Then there are other parts of the executive branch, including military leaders, Trump’s inner circle in the West Wing, and the national party. Many people now view his consolidation of power as a necessary shift, but their support is based on the belief that these changes are happening within the constitutional framework. If Trump defies the Supreme Court, cancels urban votes en masse, or outwardly defies the Twenty-Second Amendment’s plain text, even some of his top advisers might defect. Investigations into the January 6 attack have revealed that many Trump aides, including ones who continue to work for him, were appalled at what happened that day, and some tried to intervene.

Mehlhorn welcomes the debate, in part because he is hoping that he is wrong. And after spending time with him, I realized that he is interested less in the most likely outcome of any situation than in the most dangerous plausible outcome. Bill Kristol, an anti-Trump activist who previously edited the conservative Weekly Standard, estimates that the chance that Trump runs for a third term is about one in four—much lower than Mehlhorn’s prediction but higher than the betting markets’. He told me that the scenarios raised by Mehlhorn have value.

“I do think there is just a consistent underestimation of the problem or the challenge of how alarmed we should all be,” Kristol said. “I think someone like Dmitri is useful in leaning against the overconfidence.”

Within an hour of the game’s completion, the AI game masters produced a 10-page verdict on the winners and losers, summarizing what had happened and why. In the final round of the game, the business community turned on the president—by a vote of 3 to 2 in their conference room—using their media empire to expose his role in the false-flag attack on U.S. infrastructure. The president eventually fled on a military aircraft to Hungary. The Oregon sheriff was sworn in as the president at the California state capitol instead of in Washington, D.C., a sign of how fragile the nation had become.

As with the first time the game was played, in Washington, there were two winners: the business community and the defenders of the prior constitutional system. The country as a whole, however, did poorly, falling into a recession. “The Republic held. Barely,” the AI game engine concluded. “And only because enough people, across enough fractures, chose to hold it.”

Mehlhorn said he’d programmed conditions that would allow the president’s team to win two-thirds of the time. But at both events where he has staged the game so far, the president’s team has been the only loser. In his view, this may reflect a design flaw that he can address ahead of future gatherings, including one planned in Midtown Manhattan this month and events scheduled later this year in Paris and Berlin. Business interests in real life would likely not move as a single block. Maybe his assumptions are simply wrong, and American democracy is more robust than he fears.

But Mehlhorn also suggested that the president’s team in both game runs may have been too timid—that the elite groups of players he had gathered lacked imaginative cruelty. “Perhaps participants from rule-of-law cultures instinctively hesitated to deploy violence,” he wrote to the players in a follow-up email, “even in simulation.”</div>

Most &quot;creative&quot; works nowadays are built upon years of influence from other existing work. What an LLM is doing isn&#39;t all that different really.

True!  And not just that: one of the claims of AI advocates, like Mark Cuban, was that AI would take over all the drudgery and repetitive work that humans do, and the only thing humans will have to be is become more creative.  Not only are most humans not creative: AI does a pretty good job of its own in the creative realm.  I&#39;ve watched quite a few AI videos, and was pretty impressed

Also, what if less talented humans use AI to create music?  Will they get the same recognition as normal musicians, who use

The point on terms and the subversion of them stands, but I&#39;d like to nitpick a bit - most of the process of conversion of copyright and other temporary monopolies to the &quot;intellectual property&quot; fiction and to extending it until forever isn&#39;t artists&#39; doing, but the doing of their hungry lawyers.

I don&#39;t think you understood what I wrote based on your reply. I said it was for corporations.

Stealing isn&#39;t innovation, which is why we shouldn&#39;t respect the modern term of copyright. Its original limit&#39;s intent was to allow The People to have control of their cultural identity. Those terms have been extended again and again specifically to prevent that for the purpose of guaranteeing profit not for creators, but for corporations.The natural limitation on copying is no limit. Copyright was supposed to be a limited time thing, not for longer than the typical creator&#39;s lifetime. Copying is a natural right.I&#39;d like to see copyright go back to a reasonable time limit, like author&#39;s lifetime, or even less. But I really don&#39;t like the trend of folks decrying copyright as a concept at all right when it&#39;s convenient for the corporations who have traditionally supported extended copyright to abolish copyright outright so they have the right to outright steal all creative works from the moment of inception. Copyright of reasonable limits? Yes. Abolish it outright right now? Fuck no. Let those fucking tech companies

The problem for most writers and movie-makers is not people stealing their work but people finding their work. Copyright primarily exists to keep Disney and other big media companies in business.

And big business has mostly worked around it in recent decades by bribing politicians to keep extending the duration.

&quot;I&#39;d like to see copyright go back to a reasonable time limit, like author&#39;s lifetime, or even less.&quot;

Copyright in the US was originally 14 years, renewable once for another period of 14 years if the copyright holder was still alive.

Training AI models isn&#39;t &quot;stealing&quot; or &quot;theft&quot;, nor is that training claimed to be the &quot;innovation&quot;.

Current intellectual property laws simply don&#39;t work, making dishonest claims about that law doesn&#39;t work either.  We need new law, billionaires won&#39;t allow it except to protect their wealth and power.

...exactly the same as training a human mindAll of science, engineering, art and music builds on what came before

It is interesting how Copyright provisions change from law that has to be followed to suggestion when they conflict with large corporations innovating.Somehow the dialog shifts away from compliance towards competitive pressure vs China.

My thought on the matter:  We should amend our laws to just allow all LLM training on any works:  By everyone,  so large corporations and individuals are on equal footing.

However, 75% of any revenue from LLM output should go to owners of works used,  Until the model owner can

It is interesting how Copyright provisions change from law that has to be followed to suggestion when they conflict with large corporations innovating.There has long been copyright exemptions for &#39;fair use&#39; - in particular &#39;transformative&#39; applications where the end result doesn&#39;t resemble the source material. Essentially the fair use exemption for &#39;transformative&#39; exactly matches this sort of scenario and should be a slam dunk win for the model creators.

At least the Slashdot moderators waited 3 days before reposting it this time. I&#39;ve been recent posts where there were two identical stories posted right next to each other by different moderators.

If Meta bought all the books they trained their AI on, it seems to me they should be allowed to do that. If you&#39;ve purchased a copy of a book, you&#39;re allowed to analyze it with a computer.

That&#39;s insane. You have a right NOT to sell your IP.Under current law, you are correct. However, previous discussions on Slashdot raised questions about what benefit there is in letting government continue to enforce the copyright owner&#39;s right to withdraw a work from publication. These contrasted Disney&#39;s &quot;vault&quot; (sales moratorium) practice with Valve head Gabe Newell&#39;s framing of mass infringement as &quot;almost always a service problem&quot; on publishers&#39; behalf.

Anna&#39;s Archive will be prosecuted, Nvidia will be allowed to use what ever it wants and won&#39;t have to face any consequences.

I doubt it. If there&#39;s evidence of knowingly using something that is illegally acquired that makes you liable to be a party to the suit. If the story is correct, NVIDIA is in a world of legal hurt.

There are perfectly good OSS CRMs, there&#39;s competition for every product Adobe sells, and not having to deal with Adobe is reason enough to consider it.

That is true, but it does not support the claim that &quot;most of what Adobe does is shit.&quot;  Adobe is an industry leader in a number of areas, Photoshop is definitely NOT shit.

Taking TurboTax as an example. Lets say I use it to fill out my tax return - it&#39;s entirely conceivable that I could create an app that does that one task perfectly adequately. If you believe the hype, I could create such a thing by vibe-coding it in a weekend. Thus, TurboTax has no utility for all those customers who just use it to fill out their tax returns (it still has value to those who maybe do other tax related things with it though).

&quot;Many buysiders see no reasons to own software no matter how cheap or beaten down the stocks get&quot;

I had to click into the article, and then into a link FROM that article, to find out the name of this &quot;new AI tool&quot;

Obviously, the software giants out there like Adobe and Microsoft aren&#39;t going away. They provide so many entrenched software apps/tools that do tasks people need in the business world, and that employees are actually trained in/familiar with using.

But increasingly, the code they&#39;re cranking out is underwhelming and not exciting NEW users to adopt any of it.

I don&#39;t see how any of them can achieve much growth without developing compelling, brand new applications first?  This is like Pepsi or Coca Cola at thi

Sadly, many people are just moving to phones.I seem a gamedev once complain that half of the kids didn&#39;t knew how to use a keyboard, mouse OR controller anymore.It&#39;s a pretty terrible future.

Sure, most people can probably get their photo editing/touch ups done with a simple AI tool.  But letting AI help you fill out your taxes?!  Unless people are using TurboTax to fill out their 1040EZ forms (and dear God, I hope not) it&#39;s hubris to let AI do their taxes with the complexity of the tax code, let alone the HUMAN interaction of the IRS shifting rules interpretation at whim.

Somebody can train an AI engine solely on tax code and offer that as a solution.  But then you have something like TurboTax A

Don&#39;t most of the proprietary companies already claim their customers don&#39;t own the copies of software that they &quot;purchased?&quot;

By their standards, software ownership isn&#39;t changing one iota.

From the article...The findings of the new analysis, he added, &quot;underscore the growing importance of this kind of rigorous evidence in efforts to determine accountability for climate-related losses.&quot;

Don&#39;t make us say &quot;stop&quot; or we&#39;ll say &quot;stop&quot; again.

So all the carbon emissions are from the production of gasoline, diesel, etc, not the actual consumption of that gasoline, diesel, etc, right? Whew, that&#39;s a relief - I thought I might have to give up my ICE automobiles, but since the issue is Exxon Mobil, not the countless millions of people that burn Exxon Mobil products every day, there&#39;s no need for me to change my behavior!

I guess that takes me off the hook, since I only burn gasoline driving around town - the problem is the greedy oil companies that keep restocking the local gas station for me? Great! Guess it&#39;s not my fault...

As long as we&#39;re mobilizing resources to fix concentrated problem causers, shall we also dispense with the performative virtue-signal nonsense re banning plastic straws and drink-stirrers in the relatively well-behaved EU and North America to instead focus our efforts on the actual sources?

It&#39;s not the folks driving the ICE automobiles, the tractor-trailer trucks, or running ocean cargo ships that are causing the carbon emissions, it&#39;s the folks that sell them the gasoline, diesel fuel, and bunker oil? Interesting.

By the same logic are hostess bakeries responsible for the obesity crisis in America, not the consumers that eat their products?

I think AI is going to be the end of the open web. There is already an arms race between slop makers and legitimate content curators, but the odds are in favor of the former - they have incentive, time and automated tools that can generate an endless pile of sometimes believable junk at their disposal. On the other side, limited human time and capital, and difficulty that will increase to distinguish between slop and actual content.

This will kill open collaboration on the internet, also killing most projects on which AI tools rely for model learning. AI slop makers will happily kill the golden egg&#39;s goose for short-term profit. Well, capitalism as usual, I guess.

You are absolutely right. Not just the open web, but everything on the web with any kind of incentive. If there is anything to be gained, people will launch a barrage of slop in the quest to gain it.

I think this is true. The future is with human curator of AI content. Because non-curated AI content will always be slop.

To say it will always be slop it to mistake the current status for a permanent condition.  Even now, compared to last year, the average quality is better, and some people (probably those &quot;skilled in the art&quot;) are reporting significant gains.

OTOH, it will probably be true of pure LLMs forever.  To avoid slop will require interaction with the universe.

This really highlights the complex, nuanced ecosystem of the modern digital landscape we’re all navigating together.

While it’s true that AI-generated content is rapidly scaling at an unprecedented rate, we should also remember that innovation has always disrupted traditional systems — and history shows us that humanity adapts!

At the end of the day, the open web is more than just content — it’s a vibe, a community, and a shared journey. Authentic voices will naturally rise to

Always the same crap with the human race.

IQ is a lousy measure of intelligence.  The actual intelligence of people is pretty much invariant.  It can be changed by raising them in an environment with insufficient stimulus or nutrition, but that&#39;s really rare these days.  So unless you suppose something like systematic poisoning (as tetraethyllead did), you should assume that actual intelligence is constant.  (Systematic poisoning is not *that* improbable.  Perhaps microplastics are doing it.)

What IQ measures is largely the ability to focus on langu

If you&#39;re a moth that contrasts too much with the tree&#39;s bark, birds will announce that they&#39;ve spotted you, by eating you.

OTOH if you&#39;re a moth who blends in, then the birds&#39; continuous canary announcement that they have not spotted and eaten you yet, provides encouragement to reproduce.

Soon, AI use will be all-but-undetectable if you just look at the output.

Authors/publishers with good reputations or with reputable organizations to vouch for them might be believed when they say &quot;I made this without AI input&quot; but nobody else will.  At least not in cases where it matters, like news reports.

There was no mention of either false positives or false negatives in the links provided (that I could find). That is, a false positive is that the article is AI when it isn&#39;t and a false negative is that it&#39;s a human written article when it isn&#39;t. In any case, consider the case of a false positive with some given variables in a Bayesian framework to consider how difficult it would be to actually determine if an article is written by a human or not.

Let&#39;s assume that 4% of all articles in a given sample train

In this member-exclusive episode, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discuss the Supreme Court’s fact-free foray into Trump v. Cook, a case that economists warn could crater the economy. President Donald Trump spent the first weeks of his second stint in the White House firing a lot of people from government agencies. For the most part, the High Court’s conservative justices let it slide, in line with their general “he’s the President, let him do it” posture. But Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook was different. In August, Trump fired off a post on Truth Social, then sacked Cook a few days later, leaving a huge question mark hanging over the independence of the Fed. Turns out, that’s a very big deal for anyone who wants to avoid hyperinflation and economic disaster. During Wednesday’s arguments, it was clear that even Trump’s hand-picked justices felt as though they would like to avoid such catastrophes. What ensued was more about feelings, fear, and frustration than law, but that may be the best we can hope for.

The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday in Trump v. Cook, a monumental case testing Donald Trump’s ability to fire members of the Federal Reserve. In August, the president sought to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, a Democrat, over dubious allegations of mortgage fraud. The lower courts reinstated Cook after she sued, which prompted the administration to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court in September. Instead of acting immediately, the justices scheduled the case for oral argument, letting Cook keep her job in the meantime. Now a majority seems prepared to rule in her favor, though it is not clear exactly how it will do so.

In a special bonus episode of Amicus for Slate Plus members, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the twists and turns of Wednesday’s two-hour showdown between Solicitor General John Sauer and Cook’s attorney, Paul Clement (who is usually an advocate for conservative causes). A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This is the part that’s going to be painful for both of us, but we have to praise Brett Kavanaugh. He laid out very clearly what he was worried about, and what comes next if Trump wins. He told Solicitor General Sauer: “If this were set as a precedent, it seems to me, just thinking big picture, what goes around comes around. All of the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on Jan. 20, 2029, if there’s a Democratic president. … Once these tools are unleashed, they are used by both sides and usually more the second time around.” And he mentioned the dangers of the government deciding: “Let’s find something, anything, about this person” to accuse them of a crime.

Justice Kavanaugh is essentially saying: Wait a minute, we’re going to give the president unbridled power to go after anyone on the basis of any fishing expedition with the lowest standards? Let’s cop to the fact that it is weird for both of us to laud Kavanaugh being the calm, prescient voice of reason.

Mark Joseph Stern: It is weird, but it’s not surprising, because this has been something of a passion project for Kavanaugh since well before he joined the Supreme Court. He has long tried to craft a theory that the president could purge every other independent agency of holdovers from his predecessors—but that the Federal Reserve was special, so the president cannot fire its members willy-nilly. He acknowledged that this was partly because the Federal Reserve needs independence to perform its duties as a central bank that fights inflation and seeks full employment. And he was almost as honest about that on Wednesday as he had been earlier in his career. He hasn’t changed his tune. I guess he gets points for consistency here.

It was interesting how Kavanaugh didn’t bother all that much with the finer points of law. Instead, he kept asking the solicitor general: Do you want to destroy the Federal Reserve? What do you think is going to happen if you do? He pressed Sauer to say why the Fed’s independence was important, but Sauer wouldn’t bite. So Kavanaugh did it for him and laid out this nightmare vision of what happens with the next president, and how this does not stop with Trump. He said, in very stark terms: This is how you destabilize the Fed and ensure that we no longer have stable monetary policy. And that leads to inflation and recessions in endless cycles.

I was really surprised by one particular thing that he said: “What goes around comes around.” I thought I’d heard those words from Kavanaugh before, and it turns out I have: That’s what he said during his confirmation hearing when he responded to Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual abuse. In fact, during that hearing, he spoke in similar terms about the cycle of retribution in politics, about how you sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. I wonder if Kavanaugh empathizes with Lisa Cook, because he thinks that he, too, was the victim of a fishing expedition to smear his character and disqualify him from public office.

I think that’s exactly right. And it goes to this deeper point that we have clocked many a time on this show. Sometimes the justices can’t imagine what it’s like to be hauled out of the car for a traffic stop when you’re brown. But Brett Kavanaugh can certainly imagine what it’s like when some state actor says: Let’s find something bad about this person. It sounded like Kavanaugh thinking: Hey, this could happen to me, because it did happen to me. But this goes beyond Kavanaugh. The justices have had mortgages. They can imagine how one mistake—out of hundreds of pages of a mortgage application—could be turned against them.

We need to talk about these facts for a minute. Sauer led with a very strange opening about Lisa Cook’s Bonnie-and-Clyde-like criminal enterprise, painting her as a danger to humankind because of one accidental misrepresentation on hundreds of pages of forms. Several justices seemed keen to send this case back down for a hearing to determine what Cook actually did, or did not, do. But Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to think there’d be no point. In the end, does it matter what the facts of this case are?

We don’t really know, because there are several ways the court could decide the case in Cook’s favor, and a few of them don’t require resolution of the facts. Some justices, including the liberals, were pushing this idea of notice and a hearing—that Cook needed to be properly informed of this allegation, then given an opportunity to contest it. Kavanaugh also seemed to support the idea that Cook should have a real opportunity to respond, asking Sauer: “What’s the fear of more process here?” There seemed to be a real hunger for some sense of justice for Cook, who did not defraud anyone.

Roberts, by contrast, wanted to set aside this whole question of a hearing because that gets into complicated questions about due process. The chief seemed eager to say: Let’s accept that these are the facts. If they’re true, that’s not sufficient cause to remove Cook from the Fed. He was persistently pushing toward the idea that the facts don’t need “airing” out. We know what they are, and they do not rise to “cause” for Cook’s removal. That’s a clean solution, and the liberal justices will probably sign on if it’s necessary to reach five votes. But it would be a little bit unfortunate to deny Cook a true opportunity to rebut these allegations, because it deprives her of that ability to show, in a formal hearing, that she is not a criminal. And without that, there may be a cloud hanging over her continued service on the Federal Reserve Board. That would be pretty tragic.

How else do they resolve this case against Trump if they don’t want to go down that rabbit hole?

Well, we sense they’re going to rule against Trump, but we truly don’t know how it’ll happen. This is the one-in-a-million case in which it really would have made sense to just deny the emergency application without explanation in an unsigned order on the shadow docket, then let the lower courts hash it out. It’s the rare instance in which I wish they would not explain themselves, but now they may feel obligated to. So maybe we’ll get a majority for something clear and straightforward like Roberts wants, or order a hearing for Cook. Or maybe they’re just going to make a mess of the law and Trump will try to exploit the ambiguities to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell next.

It seemed to me, throughout this argument, the vibe from the court was: Yes, Donald Trump, we gave you this red Batphone. You’ve used it to call us every time you don’t get what you want and say it’s an emergency. And we’ve answered you and said yes. But the vibe today from the court was: Why are you calling us on the Batphone? The justices seemed mad that Trump was following the exact directive they laid out, which was to label everything an emergency, go to them with your hurt feelings, and ask them to fix it. It felt a little bit like the tariffs argument: Why are you bringing this to us? Well, because you taught him to. This felt like a room in which the howling winds of nothing were totally emblematic of where we are in the law right now.

On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney gave a speech on the need for “middle-sized” countries to now form their own alliances, breaking away from the destructive dominance of great powers, including the United States.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump gave a speech that unintentionally confirmed Carney’s message and heightened its urgency.

Both speeches were delivered at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, an annual confab of the globe’s political and financial leaders that usually sparks little interest outside its walls. But this year’s session is worth all of our attention—it’s marking the pivot to a whole new world.

Trump’s speech, lasting an hour and 12 minutes, was full of his familiar ramble of lies, ignorance, and insults. The difference was that almost everyone in this audience saw through the nonsense and wasn’t amused. (Laughs were few; applause was tepid.)

The only newsworthy moment came when the president said that he wouldn’t use military force to acquire Greenland, prompting a sigh of relief from Europeans and a halt to Tuesday’s tanking of the stock market. But then he doubled down on his insistence that the U.S. had once owned the icy island (untrue) and needs to reacquire it for national security (also untrue).

Otherwise, it was a litany of false boasts (ending “eight-plus wars,” lowering food and gas prices, opening hundreds of steel plants across America) and baseless grievances. The latter included the “stolen” 2020 election, the ingratitude of everyone he has helped, and a NATO alliance in which the U.S. does everything and Europe does nothing. (He neglected, among other things, that the allies came to our aid after the 9/11 attacks, invoking the treaty’s Article 5 for the first time, and subsequently lost about 900 of their troops during the war in Afghanistan.)

It was a rude speech, maybe the rudest by a national leader in Davos history. Partly for that reason, it was also a remarkably unimportant speech—because it failed to address, in any serious way, the Canadian leader’s speech, which is being widely recognized as setting the agenda for our time. (Trump briefly scoffed at Carney’s address, suggesting that he had heard it.)

The prime minister’s main message was that the “rules-based international order,” which has shaped world politics since the end of World War II, is dead—and not likely to be revived. He noted that it was always a bit of a myth anyway, and that America’s allies pretended to embrace it because, for much of this time but especially during the Cold War, bowing to U.S. dominance was an acceptable cost of enjoying U.S. economic favors and security guarantees.

Now, under Trump, the benefits of this arrangement have been reduced, if not eliminated. Though Carney was careful to not utter Trump’s name or even draw too explicit a contrast with previous presidents, his point was clear:

Over the past two decades, a series of crises in finance, health, energy, and geopolitics have laid bare the risks of extreme global integration. But more recently, great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited. You cannot live within the lie of mutual benefit through integration when integration becomes the source of your subordination.

In response to these changes, he said, middle powers, such as Canada, must engage in “principled pragmatism” and band together. He elaborated:

This is not naïve multilateralism. … It’s building coalitions that work issue by issue with partners who share enough common ground to act together … creating a dense web of connections across trade, investment, culture on which we can draw for future challenges and opportunities. Our view is, the middle powers must act together, because if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu.

Unwittingly, in his speech the next day, Trump confirmed the point, bellowing the many ways that he could eat the middle countries for breakfast, bombing and tariffing them into oblivion if he so chose.

It’s not the first time he’s made such bellicose boasts. In an interview this month with the New York Times, a conversation that Carney and everyone else at Davos no doubt read closely, the president said he feels limited in his actions not by international law but only by “my own morality, my own mind—it’s the only thing that can stop me.” Observing his morality and mind on unvarnished display at Davos, the leaders of middle-sized countries could conclude only that Carney’s was the most plausible path to not just peace and prosperity but, perhaps, survival.

It is a path strewn with risk. Carney noted the need for middle countries to spend more on defense, as Canada and others are already doing to some extent. He sidestepped the fact that, at least presently, neither NATO nor any other alliance can organize, much less mount, an effective defense against a determined aggressor without American leadership. I’ve asked defense experts in Berlin and London how long it would take for, say, the European Union to build a cohesive, truly independent defense force if they started right now with the necessary budgets. They have all answered with the same estimate: about 10 years.

This is the craw that sticks in the throats of mindful Europeans who talk about “strategic autonomy.” This is why they have kowtowed to Trump, praised his wisdom, pretended that their compliments stem from respect and not, as is really the case, from fear of abandonment. The new thing in trans-Atlantic (and trans-Pacific) relations—which this session of Davos has highlighted in the wake of Trump’s vindictive tariffs and imperial threats toward Greenland—is that the pretense can no longer be sustained. As Carney put it, the “bargain,” which the middle countries have observed with their protector all these decades, “no longer works. … We participated in the rituals, and we largely avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality,” but now, Carney noted, the gaps have grown too large. “We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.”

It’s clear the prime minister understands that ruptures are harder to navigate than transitions, especially when it comes to national security and defense.

This has been a season of newly prominent leaders quoting great radical thinkers. New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, began his victory speech by quoting Eugene Debs. Carney’s Davos speech drew a great deal from Vaclav Havel’s writings on the “power of the powerless.” In this spirit, I will close, a bit soberly, with a famous line from the Italian Communist Antonio Gramsci’s Prison Notebooks: “The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born; now is the time of monsters.”

Carney laid out a vision of the new world, where “from the fracture we can build something bigger, better, stronger, more just.” But the tense drama of the next few months and years may be in how they—and all of us—deal with the monsters.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">FortiGate firewalls are getting quietly reconfigured and stripped down by miscreants who&#39;ve figured out how to sidestep SSO protections and grab sensitive settings right out of the box.

That&#39;s according to a warning from security shop Arctic Wolf, which says it has spotted a wave of automated malicious activity starting January 15 that&#39;s targeting Fortinet&#39;s FortiGate appliances via compromised SSO accounts, flipping firewall settings, creating backdoor admin users, and exfiltrating configuration files.

Arctic Wolf says that the attackers aren&#39;t just poking around: intruders create new admin accounts, adjust VPN and firewall rules, and export the full configuration. Those configs often include sensitive credentials and internal network details, effectively handing attackers a map of what to hit next.

&quot;All of the above events took place within seconds of each other, indicating the possibility of automated activity,&quot; Arctic Wolf said.

What Arctic Wolf hasn&#39;t confirmed is a new vulnerability. Instead, the behavior lines up uncomfortably well with exploitation. This activity stemmed from two critical authentication bypass bugs (CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719) that let attackers bypass SSO login checks via specially crafted SAML responses. Patches for those were shipped last December, but Arctic Wolf&#39;s advisory follows a growing wave of reports from administrators who believe attackers are exploiting a patch bypass for CVE-2025-59718 to compromise firewalls that were already thought to be fixed.

On Reddit, affected admins say Fortinet has privately acknowledged that FortiOS 7.4.10 does not fully remediate the SSO authentication bypass, despite the issue being flagged as patched with the release of FortiOS 7.4.9 in early December. Several customers report seeing intrusions on fully updated systems.

Fortinet is now said to be preparing additional releases – FortiOS 7.4.11, 7.6.6, and 8.0.0 – over the coming days to fully address CVE-2025-59718.

Logs shared by affected customers show attackers logging in via SSO from the address cloud-init@mail.io, originating from IP address 104.28.244.114, before creating new admin users. Those indicators match the same activity that Arctic Wolf observed while analyzing the current FortiGate attacks, as well as similar exploitation attempts back in December.

Arctic Wolf is urging organizations to audit FortiGate admin accounts, review recent configuration changes, rotate credentials, and keep a close eye on SSO activity until Fortinet&#39;s next round of fixes lands. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/22/us_gov_gets_broadcom_discount/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US General Services Administration is flogging discounts of up to 64 percent under a OneGov Agreement covering Broadcom&#39;s VMware portfolio – though the actual hypervisor that made VMware famous isn&#39;t included.

The framework covers VMware Tanzu Platform, Tanzu Data Intelligence, Avi Load Balancer, vDefend, and the Tanzu AI Starter Kit. Notably absent: VMware vSphere Foundation, the virtualization platform most agencies actually use.

&quot;This agreement represents another major milestone under the OneGov initiative and advances President Trump&#39;s call to accelerate AI adoption across government,&quot; said Josh Gruenbaum, Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner.

Broadcom framed the deal as helping agencies extract more value from existing investments in its private cloud platform while &quot;achieving zero trust through multi-layer defense-in-depth.&quot;

Those existing investments are considerable. The US Army and other agencies signed a reportedly $477 million blanket purchase agreement for VMware licenses in 2024, while the Navy inked a $173 million deal. Last year, the Defense Information Systems Agency signed a contract pegged at nearly $1 billion, delivered via Carahsoft.

The discounts secured by the GSA expire in May 2027, giving Federal tech teams limited time to decide whether to hitch their container, security, or AI strategies to Broadcom&#39;s wagon.

Broadcom&#39;s acquisition of VMware continues generating some customer fallout, with license and product changes prompting customers large and small to reconsider their commitment to the platform.

These include UK supermarket giant Tesco, which sued Broadcom and one of Europe&#39;s largest resellers Computacenter &quot;for not honoring a contract that gave the supermarket giant the option to acquire software at pre-determined prices and ongoing software support services.&quot;

Computacenter in turn filed a claim against Broadcom and Dell, arguing that the companies – software supplier and distributor respectively – had not fulfilled their contractual obligations to the reseller.

Other upset customers included AT&T, Siemens, and the Dutch Government.

None of that has deflected Broadcom from its strategy of disruption and focusing on the biggest customers. Just last month it yanked its VMware vSphere Foundation bundle in parts of EMEA, a decision that could particularly hurt smaller customers. ®

            <h2>EU's Digital Networks Act sets telcos squabbling before the ink is dry</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/22/eu_digital_networks/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Commission&#39;s proposed Digital Networks Act (DNA) to harmonize telecoms regulation is drawing criticism from industry bodies who either say it oversteps the mark or doesn&#39;t go far enough to galvanize the sector.

The legislation, published Wednesday, aims to create a single market for telecoms across the whole EU. This, it hopes, will stimulate investment in modern networks, an area where Europe is lagging other regions.

To achieve this, the EC says it is necessary to establish an EU-level spectrum authorization framework, rather than leaving this at national level. It also wants to make mandatory a Europe-wide phase out of copper networks in favor of fiber, with a deadline between 2030 and 2035.

Likewise, it wants to implement a single authorization for satellite services to support the rollout of direct-to-device satellite phone communications.

By modernizing the regulatory framework, the EC says it will reduce the administrative burden on companies so they can focus resources on investment instead.

It also proposes a voluntary cooperation mechanism between connectivity providers and other players such as content, application, and cloud providers to &quot;facilitate dialogue on technical and commercial arrangements.&quot;

The latter has aroused the ire of the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), which accuses the EC of implementing a backdoor policy to allow telcos to charge network access fees.

This issue caused some controversy a few years back, when the EC was mulling whether cloud providers and social media firms should pay fees to the network operators to help fund infrastructure, with the reason being that they generate a considerable and growing amount of the traffic flowing through those networks.

However, the idea was quietly shelved following a consultation in 2023.

Now the CCIA claims the proposed voluntary conciliation procedure &quot;could turn into a binding IP dispute-resolution system, effectively resurrecting the widely rejected network fees.&quot; This would allow telcos to extract unjustified revenues from popular online services, harming consumers and undermining net neutrality, it says.

The CCIA&#39;s membership comprises giant American tech firms such as Amazon, Google, Meta, Cloudflare, Ebay, Pinterest, and Apple, so it is only to be expected that they oppose any kind of European regulations which might affect them.

The GSMA, which represents mobile network operators, says the DNA proposals don&#39;t do enough to address the lack of investment holding back telecoms across Europe.

&quot;Aside from far-reaching proposals on radio spectrum policy, it is now clear that many of the reforms originally promised have unfortunately been left on the table, and that the DNA proposal represents regulatory evolution where revolution is required,&quot; the GSMA said in a statement sent to The Register.

We are almost seven years into the 5G era, yet deployment of this technology across Europe continues to trail other major regions such as the US and China, which the GSMA claims is the result of an unfavorable investment environment resulting from regulatory complexity.

&quot;While Europe&#39;s mobile operators continue to invest heavily in critical digital infrastructure, they do so with ever-diminishing returns... at present, they are not able to invest enough to ensure Europe&#39;s digital capabilities catch up and keep pace with other major territories,&quot; it states.

The DNA proposal now begins its legislative journey through the European Parliament and Council for approval. If accepted, it will replace the 2018 EU Electronic Communications Code.

&quot;Our goal is a digital environment where new technologies are readily available, affordable, and grounded in fair trustworthy rules that benefit people,&quot; said Henna Virkkunen, the EC&#39;s EVP for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy. ®

            <div id="article-text">Microsoft is meddling with Notepad again, this time adding a &quot;What&#39;s New&quot; screen so users know the latest indignities heaped on the once-humble text editor.

The &quot;What&#39;s New&quot; first-run experience will appear during startup to guide users through the app&#39;s latest features. According to Microsoft, &quot;this dialog provides a quick overview of what&#39;s possible in Notepad and serves as a helpful starting point for both new and returning users.&quot; It can be closed and reopened by clicking a megaphone icon in the top-right of the toolbar.

As for &quot;What&#39;s New&quot; in version 11.2512.10.0, there are some more formatting options and the inevitable AI updates. Markdown support in the editor arrived last June, and Microsoft added tables in November 2025. This time around, the company has shoehorned in more markdown features, including strikethrough formatting and nested lists.

Support for AI streaming features is also expanded in the latest Notepad release. Microsoft wrote: &quot;Whether generated locally or in the cloud, results for Write, Rewrite, and Summarize will start to appear quicker without the need to wait for the full response, providing a preview sooner that you can interact with.&quot;

Assuming, of course, you&#39;ve signed in with a Microsoft account.

The Register asked Microsoft if it could share the user feedback that had demanded these enhancements to its text editor. A spokesperson told us that they would reply if there was anything to share. They did not.

The company has also continued to add tweaks to its former simple bitmap editor, Paint. One, &quot;Coloring book,&quot; is an AI feature that turns the user&#39;s text into a coloring book page (we can&#39;t imagine it being used to produce a picture of &quot;a user faced with relentless AI slop&quot; for a crayon-wielding toddler to improve). The other is a tolerance slider for the fill tool.

The Coloring book option applies only to Copilot+ PCs and requires a user to sign in with a Microsoft account.

Both Notepad and Paint have evolved far beyond their simple origins, but in doing so, have become intermediate tools that leave behind users who just want to edit text or flip a few pixels without add-ons getting in the way.

Still, as users reflect glumly on the latest set of bugs afflicting Windows following an update, it&#39;s good to know that Microsoft has found time to add more AI features to Notepad. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/22/europes_gdpr_cops_dished_out/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">GDPR fines pushed past the £1 billion (€1.2 billion) mark in 2025 as Europe&#39;s regulators were deluged with more than 400 data breach notifications a day, according to a new survey that suggests the post-plateau era of enforcement has well and truly arrived.

The figures come from the latest GDPR Fines and Data Breach Survey published by DLA Piper, which puts total fines issued across Europe last year at roughly £1 billion (€1.2 billion), up from £996 million in 2024. While that year-on-year increase is modest, regulators have now handed down €7.1 billion (£6.2 billion) in penalties since GDPR came into force in May 2018.

The fines may look familiar, but breach reporting does not. From 28 January 2025 to the present, Europe&#39;s data protection authorities received an average of 443 personal data breach notifications a day. That&#39;s up 22 percent on the year before, and marks the first time daily reports have pushed past 400 since the regulation came into force.

The firm avoids pointing to a single root cause. Rather than offering a neat explanation, the survey describes several things going wrong at once: geopolitics, repeated cyber incidents, and attack tooling that&#39;s now easy to obtain, with regulatory overload sitting in the background. Organizations are now juggling GDPR alongside a widening set of incident reporting regimes under laws such as NIS2 and DORA, which have raised the baseline for what needs to be disclosed – and how quickly.

Ross McKean, chair of DLA Piper&#39;s UK data, privacy, and cybersecurity practice, said that the numbers should be read as a warning, not just another set of stats. &quot;Confirmation of such a significant increase in personal data breach notifications in black and white is, for me, the quieting canary,&quot; he said.

&quot;Coupled with the slew of new cybersecurity laws impacting business, some of which impose personal liability on members of management bodies, our report underscores the urgency and need for organizations to optimize cyber defences and operational resilience.&quot;

On the enforcement side, the familiar names remain at the top of the leaderboard. Ireland once again dominates the tables, with aggregate fines issued by the Irish Data Protection Commission now reaching €4.04 billion since GDPR began, accounting for well over half of all fines issued across Europe during that period. France and Luxembourg are next in line, but a long way back, showing how much of GDPR enforcement is being driven by a small number of regulators.

Ireland also handed down the biggest single penalty of 2025, a €530 million fine against TikTok over unlawful international data transfers. That still wasn&#39;t enough to unseat the current record, set two years earlier when regulators hit Meta with a €1.2 billion sanction. Big tech remains the favorite target, with DLA Piper noting that nine of the ten largest GDPR fines on the books have landed there.

Seven years in, and GDPR appears to be finding its stride. The penalties are routine, the breach reports are back on the rise, and the paperwork is as relentless as ever. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Concerned about the orgs that safeguard your money? The UK&#39;s annual cybersecurity review for 2025 suggests you should be. Despite years of regulation, financial organizations continue to miss basic cybersecurity safeguards.

The latest findings come from the CBEST report, which was co-authored by representatives from the Prudential Regulation Authority, Financial Conduct Authority, and Bank of England.

Taking 2025&#39;s most prominent findings from 13 CBEST assessments and regulator-backed pentests for finance businesses, BoE found weaknesses like poor access controls and passwords were common among businesses and financial management infrastructures (FMIs).

From a technical perspective, misconfigured and inconsistently patched systems were highlighted as recurring issues, as were mechanisms for detecting potential intrusions and vulnerabilities.

The report noted: &quot;Given the sophistication of some attackers, it is important that firms and FMIs are prepared to handle breaches effectively, rather than relying solely on protective controls.

&quot;In addition to technical measures, we continue to observe challenges in staff culture, awareness, and training, highlighting that technical measures alone are not sufficient.&quot;

CBEST assessments revealed that criminals using social engineering tactics could bypass controls when targeting organizations with a poor security culture. Assessors believe that phishing could be successful in some cases, and that staff revealing sensitive information through social media and job descriptions was a realistic possibility.

FMIs that did not have strict protocols for their helpdesks, such as verifying the identity of callers, were also vulnerable to attackers who fraudulently accessed legitimate credentials.

The NCSC weighed in on this matter, saying these kinds of attacks are the bread and butter of groups like Scattered Spider. The group is thought to be comprised of native English speakers and cyber-cops speculate it is behind at least some of the high profile attacks on British businesses last year.

&quot;They are known to use phishing and spear phishing to leverage established trust in organizations,&quot; said the NCSC. &quot;Therefore, it is important to ensure that all individuals in an organization are aware of potential tricks and methods to counter these attempts.&quot;

Social engineering attacks were one of the few areas of focus for CBEST assessments in 2025, which are required to simulate the most severe and plausible threats to FMIs.

Other types of attack that regulated financial organizations were tested against included those from sophisticated and state-sponsored groups, compromised third parties and supply chains, and malicious insiders.

All four of these themes were observed frequently in real-world attacks throughout the year. The orgs said regulated entities needed to improve their resilience against them.

Comparing the results of the 2025 assessments with previous years makes for interesting, if unsurprising reading.

Many of the key weaknesses highlighted by the assessments over the past 12 months were the primary issues of yesteryear too.

Weak configurations, overly permissive access controls, ineffective network and vulnerability monitoring, and staff who were susceptible to social engineering and phishing were all features of the BoE&#39;s reports from 2023 and 2024.

It&#39;s not all bad, though. CBEST assessors found that organizations and FMIs &quot;demonstrated a range of maturities across cyber threat intelligence (CTI) management domains.&quot;

They judged most of the assessed orgs to have &quot;relatively effective foundations&quot; across CTI operating models, although the report said the intelligence was not often well-integrated across the business.

Plus, despite many of the main weaknesses identified in previous years remaining unaddressed in 2025, improvements can be seen, such as with MFA.

Per the 2023 and 2024 reports, organizations were struggling to roll out effective MFA programs, but the control was not mentioned alongside the primary failures in the most recent annual review.

The purpose of CBEST assessments is not to introduce new regulatory requirements on those in the financial sector, which are already among the most heavily regulated for cybersecurity.

The BoE says the assessments serve as guides for all regulated entities to understand the most common security gaps that are likely to lead to a successful cyberattack, and potentially damaging consequences resulting from one. ®

The opt-in Personal Intelligence update aims to automatically tailor AI Mode responses to your interests.﻿

Google is helping AI Mode to provide more personalized responses in Search by allowing the chatbot to analyze your Gmail and Google Photos accounts. After launching for Gemini AI last week, “Personal Intelligence” is now coming to tailor AI Mode search results to your interests and daily life by gathering information from your emails and photos, instead of requiring you to manually create and adjust your preferences.

For example, Google says Personal Intelligence allows AI Mode to suggest travel itineraries by referencing hotel bookings in your Gmail and holiday snaps in Photos. If you take a lot of selfies with ice cream, then it could curate recommendations for ice cream parlors. When using AI Mode to shop online, it can prioritize products from brands you wear or have purchased before.

Eligible Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers can opt in to the Gmail and Google Photos connections for AI Mode starting today. The update is rolling out in the US as a feature in Google Labs and is only available for personal Google accounts. This rollout follows Personal Intelligence being introduced to Gemini AI, which can also tap into Search and YouTube history alongside Gmail and Photos.

“Built with privacy in mind, AI Mode uses our most intelligent model, Gemini 3, and doesn’t train directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library,” Google Search VP Robby Stein said in the announcement. “Training is contained to limited info, like specific prompts in AI Mode and the model’s responses, to improve functionality over time.”

Stein says that while Personal Intelligence can be helpful, internal testing shows that “mistakes can happen.” AI Mode users can correct any unsuitable recommendations and provide feedback by giving a follow-up response or giving it a “thumbs down.”

The company is expanding its Magic Bay magnetic accessories to more laptops and opening the system to third parties.

Two years ago, Lenovo introduced a collection of modular Magic Bay accessories for its ThinkBook 16p. They attached to a magnetic pin connector at the top of the laptop’s display and added functionality like an improved 4K webcam, or LTE connectivity. The company has since expanded Magic Bay compatibility to more of its laptops and demonstrated concepts for additional accessories, but it’s now opening the system to third-party accessory makers, as spotted by VideoCardz.com.

According to an update a Lenovo product manager shared to the Chinese social media platform Weibo, Lenovo has “opened up support for third-party accessories.” There’s no mention of specific companies that have expressed interest or signed on to create Magic Bay accessories, or what kind of hardware they may release, but the move could potentially help further popularize the feature if there are more options available.

The manager also says the new ThinkBook 14 Plus and 16 Plus will support Magic Bay accessories, expanding availability beyond the company’s more premium laptop offerings.

The 9850X3D has a faster boost clock than the popular 9800X3D chip.

AMD announced an improved version of its popular Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor at CES earlier this month, and it’s now confirming a release date and pricing today. The new Ryzen 7 9850X3D will debut on January 29th, priced at $499.

That’s $20 more than the initial retail pricing of the 9800X3D, and this faster 9850X3D will feature the same 8-core / 16-thread CPU running at faster boost clocks. The boost clock on the 9850X3D is 400MHz higher than the standard 9800X3D, and it maintains the same 120-watt TDP. It’s essentially a better-binned version of the 9800X3D.

It’s still not clear exactly how much these higher boost clocks will help with PC games, and AMD has admitted that most of the benefits will be found in frequency-sensitive titles like esports games. Still, at least you won’t have to pay much more for a faster chip — that’s if you can find the 9850X3D at its retail price later this month.

A ‘Humanizer’ skill for Claude removes phrases and patterns based on a guide that Wikipedians use to spot AI-generated text.

A new tool aims to help AI chatbots generate more human-sounding text — with the help of Wikipedia’s guide for detecting AI, as reported by Ars Technica. Developer Siqi Chen says he created the tool, called Humanizer, by feeding Anthropic’s Claude the list of tells that Wikipedia’s volunteer editors put together as part of an initiative to combat “poorly written AI-generated content.”

Wikipedia’s guide contains a list of signs that text may be AI-generated, including vague attributions, promotional language like describing something as “breathtaking,” and collaborative phrases, such as “I hope this helps!” Humanizer, which is a custom skill for Claude Code, is supposed to help the AI assistant avoid detection by removing these “signs of AI-generated writing from text, making it sound more natural and human,” according to its GitHub page.

The GitHub page provides some examples on how Humanizer might help Claude detect some of these tells, including by changing a sentence that described a location as “nestled within the breathtaking region” to “a town in the Gonder region,” as well as adjusting a vague attribution, like “Experts believe it plays a crucial role” to “according to a 2019 survey by…” Chen says the tool will “automatically push updates” when Wikipedia’s AI-detecting guide is updated.

It’s only a matter of time before the AI companies themselves start adjusting their chatbots against some of these tells, too, as OpenAI has already addressed ChatGPT’s overuse of em dashes, which has become an indicator of AI content.

﻿The interactive toy will be available for preorder today and launches on March 12th.

After sharing a brief look at its new Talking Flower toy during a Nintendo Direct showcase last September that generated more questions than answers, Nintendo has finally revealed more details about what the interactive toy actually does. It shares some functionality with Nintendo’s Alarmo alarm clock, but the Talking Flower seems more like a talkative companion for fans of Super Mario Bros. Wonder.

First and foremost, as the name implies, the Talking Flower will just randomly speak a couple of times every hour when left alone with phrases like “sometimes it’s nice to space out,” and “is it weird for flowers to talk?” A single button on the toy can be pressed to trigger random thoughts on demand, or you can press and hold the button to silence the Talking Flower for a while. There’s music, too, and at launch it will support 11 different languages including English, Italian, and Japanese.

You can also set the Talking Flower to speak at specific times of day, such as greeting you in the morning or saying good night as you head to bed, and some of its random phrases are only triggered at specific times of the day. It’s got a built-in sensor so it can comment on the temperature in the room, and instead of using LEDs or a screen, the Talking Flower will just tell you when its batteries are running low. The toy will be available for preorder today through the My Nintendo Store and other retailers, and is expected to release on March 12th, 2026.

Surprisingly, this wasn’t the only flower-related news from Nintendo today. The company also released an overview trailer for the upcoming Switch 2 update for Mario Wonder, and it includes a new power-up called the “bellabel flower.” That update is out on March 26th.

1Password will warn users when it detects an unrecognized website that could be part of a phishing attack.

A successful phishing attack can cost a business an average of $4.8 million, according to research from IBM. To help reduce the risk of one succeeding, either at work or at home, 1Password is introducing a new phishing prevention feature that will watch for telltale signs of an attack, such as a website URL that’s slightly misspelled.

When a 1Password user clicks a link and opens a website with a URL that doesn’t match the one they have saved alongside login details, the 1Password browser extension will do two things. It won’t autofill their login credentials, and it will display a pop-up warning explaining that the current website’s URL “isn’t linked to a login in 1Password.”

The feature isn’t a foolproof way to stop phishing attacks from succeeding. Users can still choose to manually copy and paste their credentials into a suspicious website. But it will make them aware that they’re potentially dealing with a phishing scam with the hope that they will think twice and exercise more caution before proceeding.

The new phishing prevention feature is being rolled out to users starting today, but it could take several weeks for it to be available to everyone. For individual and family plan users, 1Password is enabling this feature by default once it’s available. For businesses it will need to be manually enabled by 1Password Admins.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Yann LeCun is a Turing Award recipient and a top AI researcher, but he has long been a contrarian figure in the tech world. He believes that the industry’s current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems.

Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company&#39;s influential research lab that he founded.

LeCun sat down with MIT Technology Review in an exclusive online interview from his Paris apartment to discuss his new venture, life after Meta, the future of artificial intelligence, and why he thinks the industry is chasing the wrong ideas. Read the full interview.

In 2026, I’m going to be closely watching the price of lithium.

If you’re not in the habit of obsessively tracking commodity markets, I certainly don’t blame you. (Though the news lately definitely makes the case that minerals can have major implications for global politics and the economy.)

But lithium is worthy of a close look right now. The metal is crucial for lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage arrays on the grid.

Cement hides in plain sight—it’s used to build everything from roads and buildings to dams and basement floors. But it’s also a climate threat. Cement production accounts for more than 7% of global carbon dioxide emissions—more than sectors like aviation, shipping, or landfills.

One solution to this climate catastrophe might be coursing through the pipes at Sublime Systems. The startup is developing an entirely new way to make cement. Instead of heating crushed-up rocks in lava-hot kilns, Sublime’s technology zaps them in water with electricity, kicking off chemical reactions that form the main ingredients in its cement.

But it faces huge challenges: competing with established industry players, and persuading builders to use its materials in the first place. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">In 2026, I’m going to be closely watching the price of lithium.

If you’re not in the habit of obsessively tracking commodity markets, I certainly don’t blame you. (Though the news lately definitely makes the case that minerals can have major implications for global politics and the economy.)

But lithium is worthy of a close look right now.

The metal is crucial for lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage arrays on the grid. Prices have been on quite the roller coaster over the last few years, and they’re ticking up again after a low period. What happens next could have big implications for mining and battery technology.

Before we look ahead, let’s take a quick trip down memory lane. In 2020, global EV sales started to really take off, driving up demand for the lithium used in their batteries. Because of that growing demand and a limited supply, prices shot up dramatically, with lithium carbonate going from under $10 per kilogram to a high of roughly $70 per kilogram in just two years.

And the tech world took notice. During those high points, there was a ton of interest in developing alternative batteries that didn’t rely on lithium. I was writing about sodium-based batteries, iron-air batteries, and even experimental ones that were made with plastic.

Researchers and startups were also hunting for alternative ways to get lithium, including battery recycling and processing methods like direct lithium extraction (more on this in a moment).

But soon, prices crashed back down to earth. We saw lower-than-expected demand for EVs in the US, and developers ramped up mining and processing to meet demand. Through late 2024 and 2025, lithium carbonate was back around $10 a kilogram again. Avoiding lithium or finding new ways to get it suddenly looked a lot less crucial.

That brings us to today: lithium prices are ticking up again. So far, it’s nowhere close to the dramatic rise we saw a few years ago, but analysts are watching closely. Strong EV growth in China is playing a major role—EVs still make up about 75% of battery demand today. But growth in stationary storage, batteries for the grid, is also contributing to rising demand for lithium in both China and the US.

Higher prices could create new opportunities. The possibilities include alternative battery chemistries, specifically sodium-ion batteries, says Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technologies and supply chains at BloombergNEF. (I’ll note here that we recently named sodium-ion batteries to our 2026 list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies.)

It’s not just batteries, though. Another industry that could see big changes from a lithium price swing: extraction.

Today, most lithium is mined from rocks, largely in Australia, before being shipped to China for processing. There’s a growing effort to process the mineral in other places, though, as countries try to create their own lithium supply chains. Tesla recently confirmed that it’s started production at its lithium refinery in Texas, which broke ground in 2023. We could see more investment in processing plants outside China if prices continue to climb.

This could also be a key year for direct lithium extraction, as Katie Brigham wrote in a recent story for Heatmap. That technology uses chemical or electrochemical processes to extract lithium from brine (salty water that’s usually sourced from salt lakes or underground reservoirs), quickly and cheaply. Companies including Lilac Solutions, Standard Lithium, and Rio Tinto are all making plans or starting construction on commercial facilities this year in the US and Argentina.

If there’s anything I’ve learned about following batteries and minerals over the past few years, it’s that predicting the future is impossible. But if you’re looking for tea leaves to read, lithium prices deserve a look.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <div id="article-text">Yann LeCun is a Turing Award recipient and a top AI researcher, but he has long been a contrarian figure in the tech world. He believes that the industry’s current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems.

Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. He is also a staunch advocate for open-source AI and criticizes the closed approach of frontier labs like OpenAI and Anthropic.

Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company&#39;s influential research lab that he founded. Meta has struggled to gain much traction with its open-source AI model Llama and has seen internal shake-ups, including the controversial acquisition of ScaleAI.

LeCun sat down with MIT Technology Review in an exclusive online interview from his Paris apartment to discuss his new venture, life after Meta, the future of artificial intelligence, and why he thinks the industry is chasing the wrong ideas.

Both the questions and answers below have been edited for clarity and brevity.

You’ve just announced a new company, Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI).  Tell me about the big ideas behind it.

It is going to be a global company, but headquartered in Paris. You pronounce it “ami”—it means “friend” in French. I am excited. There is a very high concentration of talent in Europe, but it is not always given a proper environment to flourish. And there is certainly a huge demand from the industry and governments for a credible frontier AI company that is neither Chinese nor American. I think that is going to be to our advantage.

So an ambitious alternative to the US-China binary we currently have. What made you want to pursue that third path?

Well, there are sovereignty issues for a lot of countries, and they want some control over AI. What I’m advocating is that AI is going to become a platform, and most platforms tend to become open-source. Unfortunately, that’s not really the direction the American industry is taking. Right? As the competition increases, they feel like they have to be secretive. I think that is a strategic mistake.

It’s certainly true for OpenAI, which went from very open to very closed, and Anthropic has always been closed. Google was sort of a little open. And then Meta, we’ll see. My sense is that it’s not going in a positive direction at this moment.

Simultaneously, China has completely embraced this open approach. So all leading open-source AI platforms are Chinese, and the result is that academia and startups, outside of the US, have basically embraced Chinese models. There’s nothing wrong with that—you know, Chinese models are good. Chinese engineers and scientists are great. But you know, if there is a future in which all of our information diet is being mediated by AI assistance, and the choice is either English-speaking models produced by proprietary companies always close to the US or Chinese models which may be open-source but need to be fine-tuned so that they answer questions about Tiananmen Square in 1989—you know, it’s not a very pleasant and engaging future.

They [the future models] should be able to be fine-tuned by anyone and produce a very high diversity of AI assistance, with different linguistic abilities and value systems and political biases and centers of interests. You need high diversity of assistance for the same reason that you need high diversity of press.

That is certainly a compelling pitch. How are investors buying that idea so far?

They really like it. A lot of venture capitalists are very much in favor of this idea of open-source, because they know for a lot of small startups, they really rely on open-source models. They don’t have the means to train their own model, and it’s kind of dangerous for them strategically to embrace a proprietary model.

You recently left Meta. What’s your view on the company and Mark Zuckerberg’s leadership? There’s a perception that Meta has fumbled its AI advantage.

I think FAIR [LeCun’s lab at Meta] was extremely successful in the research part. Where Meta was less successful is in picking up on that research and pushing it into practical technology and products. Mark made some choices that he thought were the best for the company. I may not have agreed with all of them. For example, the robotics group at FAIR was let go, which I think was a strategic mistake. But I’m not the director of FAIR. People make decisions rationally, and there’s no reason to be upset.

So, no bad blood? Could Meta be a future client for AMI?

Meta might be our first client! We’ll see. The work we are doing is not in direct competition. Our focus on world models for the physical world is very different from their focus on generative AI and LLMs.

You were working on AI long before LLMs became a mainstream approach. But since ChatGPT broke out, LLMs have become almost synonymous with AI.

Yes, and we are going to change that. The public face of AI, perhaps, is mostly LLMs and chatbots of various types. But the latest ones of those are not pure LLMs. They are LLM plus a lot of things, like perception systems and code that solves particular problems. So we are going to see LLMs as kind of the orchestrator in systems, a little bit.

Beyond LLMs, there is a lot of AI that is behind the scenes that runs a big chunk of our society. There are assistance driving programs in a car, quick-turn MRI images, algorithms that drive social media—that’s all AI.

You have been vocal in arguing that LLMs can only get us so far. Do you think LLMs are overhyped these days? Can you summarize to our readers why you believe that LLMs are not enough?

There is a sense in which they have not been overhyped, which is that they are extremely useful to a lot of people, particularly if you write text, do research, or write code. LLMs manipulate language really well. But people have had this illusion, or delusion, that it is a matter of time until we can scale them up to having human-level intelligence, and that is simply false.

The truly difficult part is understanding the real world. This is the Moravec Paradox (a phenomenon observed by the computer scientist Hans Moravec in 1988): What’s easy for us, like perception and navigation, is hard for computers, and vice versa. LLMs are limited to the discrete world of text. They can’t truly reason or plan, because they lack a model of the world. They can’t predict the consequences of their actions. This is why we don’t have a domestic robot that is as agile as a house cat, or a truly autonomous car.

We are going to have AI systems that have humanlike and human-level intelligence, but they’re  not going to be built on LLMs, and it’s not going to happen next year or two years from now. It’s going to take a while. There are major conceptual breakthroughs that have to happen before we have AI systems that have human-level intelligence. And that is what I’ve been working on. And this company, AMI Labs, is focusing on the next generation.

And your solution is world models and JEPA architecture (JEPA, or “joint embedding predictive architecture,” is a learning framework that trains AI models to understand the world, created by LeCun while he was at Meta). What’s the elevator pitch?

The world is unpredictable. If you try to build a generative model that predicts every detail of the future, it will fail.  JEPA is not generative AI. It is a system that learns to represent videos really well. The key is to learn an abstract representation of the world and make predictions in that abstract space, ignoring the details you can’t predict. That’s what JEPA does. It learns the underlying rules of the world from observation, like a baby learning about gravity. This is the foundation for common sense, and it’s the key to building truly intelligent systems that can reason and plan in the real world. The most exciting work so far on this is coming from academia, not the big industrial labs stuck in the LLM world.

The lack of non-text data has been a problem in taking AI systems further in understanding the physical world. JEPA is trained on videos. What other kinds of data will you be using?

Our systems will be trained on video, audio, and sensor data of all kinds—not just text. We are working with various modalities, from the position of a robot arm to lidar data to audio. I’m also involved in a project using JEPA to model complex physical and clinical phenomena.

What are some of the concrete, real-world applications you envision for world models?

The applications are vast. Think about complex industrial processes where you have thousands of sensors, like in a jet engine, a steel mill, or a chemical factory. There is no technique right now to build a complete, holistic model of these systems. A world model could learn this from the sensor data and predict how the system will behave. Or think of smart glasses that can watch what you’re doing, identify your actions, and then predict what you’re going to do next to assist you. This is what will finally make agentic systems reliable. An agentic system that is supposed to take actions in the world cannot work reliably unless it has a world model to predict the consequences of its actions. Without it, the system will inevitably make mistakes. This is the key to unlocking everything from truly useful domestic robots to Level 5 autonomous driving.

Humanoid robots are all the rage recently, especially ones built by companies from China. What’s your take?

There are all these brute-force ways to get around the limitations of learning systems, which require inordinate amounts of training data to do anything. So the secret of all the companies getting robots to do kung fu or dance is they are all planned in advance. But frankly, nobody—absolutely nobody—knows how to make those robots smart enough to be useful. Take my word for it.

You need an enormous amount of tele-operation training data for every single task, and when the environment changes a little bit, it doesn’t generalize very well. What this tells us is we are missing something very big. The reason why a 17-year-old can learn to drive in 20 hours is because they already know a lot about how the world behaves. If we want a generally useful domestic robot, we need systems to have a kind of good understanding of the physical world. That’s not going to happen until we have good world models and planning.

There’s a growing sentiment that it’s becoming harder to do foundational AI research in academia because of the massive computing resources required. Do you think the most important innovations will now come from industry?

No. LLMs are now technology development, not research. It’s true that it’s very difficult for academics to play an important role there because of the requirements for computation, data access, and engineering support. But it’s a product now. It’s not something academia should even be interested in. It’s like speech recognition in the early 2010s—it was a solved problem, and the progress was in the hands of industry.

What academia should be working on is long-term objectives that go beyond the capabilities of current systems. That’s why I tell people in universities: Don’t work on LLMs. There is no point. You’re not going to be able to rival what’s going on in industry. Work on something else. Invent new techniques. The breakthroughs are not going to come from scaling up LLMs. The most exciting work on world models is coming from academia, not the big industrial labs. The whole idea of using attention circuits in neural nets came out of the University of Montreal. That research paper started the whole revolution. Now that the big companies are closing up, the breakthroughs are going to slow down. Academia needs access to computing resources, but they should be focused on the next big thing, not on refining the last one.

You wear many hats: professor, researcher, educator, public thinker … Now you just took on a new one. What is that going to look like for you?

I am going to be the executive chairman of the company, and Alex LeBrun [a former colleague from Meta AI] will be the CEO. It’s going to be LeCun and LeBrun—it’s nice if you pronounce it the French way.

I am going to keep my position at NYU. I teach one class per year, I have PhD students and postdocs, so I am going to be kept based in New York. But I go to Paris pretty often because of my lab.

Does that mean that you won’t be very hands-on?

Well, there&#39;s two ways to be hands-on. One is to manage people day to day, and another is to actually get your hands dirty in research projects, right?

I can do management, but I don&#39;t like doing it. This is not my mission in life. It’s really to make science and technology progress as far as we can, inspire other people to work on things that are interesting, and then contribute to those things. So that has been my role at Meta for the last seven years. I founded FAIR and led it for four to five years. I kind of hated being a director. I am not good at this career management thing. I&#39;m much more visionary and a scientist.

Alex is a serial entrepreneur; he’s built three successful AI companies. The first he sold to Microsoft; the second to Facebook, where he was head of the engineering division of FAIR in Paris. He then left to create Nabla, a very successful company in the health-care space. When I offered him the chance to join me in this effort, he accepted almost immediately. He has the experience to build the company, allowing me to focus on science and technology.

You’re headquartered in Paris. Where else do you plan to have offices?

We are a global company. There’s going to be an office in North America.

New York is great. That’s where I am, right? And it’s not Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley is a bit of a monoculture.

What about Asia? I’m guessing Singapore, too?

We don’t have any issue recruiting. There are a lot of people in the AI research community who think the future of AI is in world models. Those people, regardless of pay package, will be motivated to come work for us because they believe in the technological future we are building. We’ve already recruited people from places like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and xAI.

I heard that Saining Xie, a prominent researcher from NYU and Google DeepMind, might be joining you as chief scientist. Any comments?

Saining is a brilliant researcher. I have a lot of admiration for him. I hired him twice already. I hired him at FAIR, and I convinced my colleagues at NYU that we should hire him there. Let’s just say I have a lot of respect for him.

When will you be ready to share more details about AMI Labs, like financial backing or other core members?

Soon—in February, maybe. I’ll let you know.

            <h2>Rethinking AI’s future in an augmented workplace</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/21/1131366/rethinking-ais-future-in-an-augmented-workplace/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are many paths AI evolution could take. On one end of the spectrum, AI is dismissed as a marginal fad, another bubble fueled by notoriety and misallocated capital. On the other end, it’s cast as a dystopian force, destined to eliminate jobs on a large scale and destabilize economies. Markets oscillate between skepticism and the fear of missing out, while the technology itself evolves quickly and investment dollars flow at a rate not seen in decades.

All the while, many of today’s financial and economic thought leaders hold to the consensus that the financial landscape will stay the same as it has been for the last several years. Two years ago, Joseph Davis, global chief economist at Vanguard, and his team felt the same but wanted to develop their perspective on AI technology with a deeper foundation built on history and data. Based on a proprietary data set covering the last 130 years, Davis and his team developed a new framework, The Vanguard Megatrends Model, from research that suggested a more nuanced path than hype extremes: that AI has the potential to be a general purpose technology that lifts productivity, reshapes industries, and augments human work rather than displaces it. In short, AI will be neither marginal nor dystopian.

“Our findings suggest that the continuation of the status quo, the basic expectation of most economists, is actually the least likely outcome,” Davis says. “We project that AI will have an even greater effect on productivity than the personal computer did. And we project that a scenario where AI transforms the economy is far more likely than one where AI disappoints and fiscal deficits dominate. The latter would likely lead to slower economic growth, higher inflation, and increased interest rates.”

Davis does not sugar-coat it, however. Although AI promises economic growth and productivity, it will be disruptive, especially for business leaders and workers in knowledge sectors. “AI is likely to be the most disruptive technology to alter the nature of our work since the personal computer,” says Davis. “Those of a certain age might recall how the broad availability of PCs remade many jobs. It didn’t eliminate jobs as much as it allowed people to focus on higher value activities.”

The team’s framework allowed them to examine AI automation risks to over 800 different occupations. The research indicated that while the potential for job loss exists in upwards of 20% of occupations as a result of AI-driven automation, the majority of jobs—likely four out of five—will result in a mixture of innovation and automation. Workers’ time will increasingly shift to higher value and uniquely human tasks.

This introduces the idea that AI could serve as a copilot to various roles, performing repetitive tasks and generally assisting with responsibilities. Davis argues that traditional economic models often underestimate the potential of AI because they fail to examine the deeper structural effects of technological change. “Most approaches for thinking about future growth, such as GDP, don’t adequately account for AI,” he explains. “They fail to link short-term variations in productivity with the three dimensions of technological change: automation, augmentation, and the emergence of new industries.” Automation enhances worker productivity by handling routine tasks; augmentation allows technology to act as a copilot, amplifying human skills; and the creation of new industries creates new sources of growth.

Ironically, Davis’s research suggests that a reason for the relatively low productivity growth in recent years may be a lack of automation. Despite a decade of rapid innovation in digital and automation technologies, productivity growth has lagged since the 2008 financial crisis, hitting 50-year lows. This appears to support the view that AI’s impact will be marginal. But Davis believes that automation has been adopted in the wrong places. “What surprised me most was how little automation there has been in services like finance, health care, and education,” he says. “Outside of manufacturing, automation has been very limited. That’s been holding back growth for at least two decades.” The services sector accounts for more than 60% of US GDP and 80% of the workforce and has experienced some of the lowest productivity growth. It is here, Davis argues, that AI will make the biggest difference.

One of the biggest challenges facing the economy is demographics, as the Baby Boomer generation retires, immigration slows, and birth rates decline. These demographic headwinds reinforce the need for technological acceleration. “There are concerns about AI being dystopian and causing massive job loss, but we’ll soon have too few workers, not too many,” Davis says. “Economies like the US, Japan, China, and those across Europe will need to step up function in automation as their populations age.”

For example, consider nursing, a profession in which empathy and human presence are irreplaceable. AI has already shown the potential to augment rather than automate in this field, streamlining data entry in electronic health records and helping nurses reclaim time for patient care. Davis estimates that these tools could increase nursing productivity by as much as 20% by 2035, a crucial gain as health-care systems adapt to ageing populations and rising demand. “In our most likely scenario, AI will offset demographic pressures. Within five to seven years, AI’s ability to automate portions of work will be roughly equivalent to adding 16 million to 17 million workers to the US labor force,” Davis says. “That’s essentially the same as if everyone turning 65 over the next five years decided not to retire.” He projects that more than 60% of occupations, including nurses, family physicians, high school teachers, pharmacists, human resource managers, and insurance sales agents, will benefit from AI as an augmentation tool.

As AI technology spreads, the strongest performers in the stock market won’t be its producers, but its users. “That makes sense, because general-purpose technologies enhance productivity, efficiency, and profitability across entire sectors,” says Davis. This adoption of AI is creating flexibility for investment options, which means diversifying beyond technology stocks might be appropriate as reflected in Vanguard’s Economic and Market Outlook for 2026. “As that happens, the benefits move beyond places like Silicon Valley or Boston and into industries that apply the technology in transformative ways.” And history shows that early adopters of new technologies reap the greatest productivity rewards. “We’re clearly in the experimentation phase of learning by doing,” says Davis. “Those companies that encourage and reward experimentation will capture the most value from AI.”

Looking globally, Davis sees the United States and China as significantly ahead in the AI race. “It’s a virtual dead heat,” he says. “That tells me the competition between the two will remain intense.” But other economies, especially those with low automation rates and large service sectors, like Japan, Europe, and Canada, could also see significant benefits. “If AI is truly going to be transformative, three sectors stand out: health care, education, and finance,” says Davis. “For AI to live up to its potential, it must fundamentally reshape these industries, which face high costs and rising demand for better, faster, more personalized services.”

However, Davis says Vanguard is more bullish on AI’s potential to transform the economy than it was just a year ago. Especially since that transformation requires application beyond Silicon Valley. “When I speak to business leaders, I remind them that this transformation hasn’t happened yet,” says Davis. “It’s their investment and innovation that will determine whether it does.”

            <div id="article-text">Governments plan to pour $1.3 trillion into AI infrastructure by 2030 to invest in “sovereign AI,” with the premise being that countries should be in control of their own AI capabilities. The funds include financing for domestic data centers, locally trained models, independent supply chains, and national talent pipelines. This is a response to real shocks: covid-era supply chain breakdowns, rising geopolitical tensions, and the war in Ukraine.

But the pursuit of absolute autonomy is running into reality. AI supply chains are irreducibly global: Chips are designed in the US and manufactured in East Asia; models are trained on data sets drawn from multiple countries; applications are deployed across dozens of jurisdictions.

If sovereignty is to remain meaningful, it must shift from a defensive model of self-reliance to a vision that emphasizes the concept of orchestration, balancing national autonomy with strategic partnership.

Why infrastructure-first strategies hit walls

A November survey by Accenture found that 62% of European organizations are now seeking sovereign AI solutions, driven primarily by geopolitical anxiety rather than technical necessity. That figure rises to 80% in Denmark and 72% in Germany. The European Union has appointed its first Commissioner for Tech Sovereignty.

This year, $475 billion is flowing into AI data centers globally. In the United States, AI data centers accounted for roughly one-fifth of GDP growth in the second quarter of 2025. But the obstacle for other nations hoping to follow suit isn’t just money. It’s energy and physics. Global data center capacity is projected to hit 130 gigawatts by 2030, and for every $1 billion spent on these facilities, $125 million is needed for electricity networks. More than $750 billion in planned investment is already facing grid delays.

And it’s also talent. Researchers and entrepreneurs are mobile, drawn to ecosystems with access to capital, competitive wages, and rapid innovation cycles. Infrastructure alone won’t attract or retain world-class talent.

What nations need isn’t sovereignty through isolation but through specialization and orchestration. This means choosing which capabilities you build, which you pursue through partnership, and where you can genuinely lead in shaping the global AI landscape.

The most successful AI strategies don’t try to replicate Silicon Valley; they identify specific advantages and build partnerships around them.

Singapore offers a model. Rather than seeking to duplicate massive infrastructure, it invested in governance frameworks, digital-identity platforms, and applications of AI in logistics and finance, areas where it can realistically compete.

Israel shows a different path. Its strength lies in a dense network of startups and military-adjacent research institutions delivering outsize influence despite the country’s small size.

South Korea is instructive too. While it has national champions like Samsung and Naver, these firms still partner with Microsoft and Nvidia on infrastructure. That’s deliberate collaboration reflecting strategic oversight, not dependence.

Even China, despite its scale and ambition, cannot secure full-stack autonomy. Its reliance on global research networks and on foreign lithography equipment, such as extreme ultraviolet systems needed to manufacture advanced chips and GPU architectures, shows the limits of techno-nationalism.

The pattern is clear: Nations that specialize and partner strategically can outperform those trying to do everything alone.

Three ways to align ambition with reality

Sovereignty isn’t how many petaflops you own. It’s how many lives you improve and how fast the economy grows. Real sovereignty is the ability to innovate in support of national priorities such as productivity, resilience, and sustainability while maintaining freedom to shape governance and standards.

Nations should track the use of AI in health care and monitor how the technology’s adoption correlates with manufacturing productivity, patent citations, and international research collaborations. The goal is to ensure that AI ecosystems generate inclusive and lasting economic and social value.

2. Cultivate a strong AI innovation ecosystem.

Build infrastructure, but also build the ecosystem around it: research institutions, technical education, entrepreneurship support, and public-private talent development. Infrastructure without skilled talent and vibrant networks cannot deliver a lasting competitive advantage.

Strategic partnerships enable nations to pool resources, lower infrastructure costs, and access complementary expertise. Singapore’s work with global cloud providers and the EU’s collaborative research programs show how nations advance capabilities faster through partnership than through isolation. Rather than competing to set dominant standards, nations should collaborate on interoperable frameworks for transparency, safety, and accountability.

Overinvesting in independence fragments markets and slows cross-border innovation, which is the foundation of AI progress. When strategies focus too narrowly on control, they sacrifice the agility needed to compete.

The cost of getting this wrong isn’t just wasted capital—it’s a decade of falling behind. Nations that double down on infrastructure-first strategies risk ending up with expensive data centers running yesterday’s models, while competitors that choose strategic partnerships iterate faster, attract better talent, and shape the standards that matter.

The winners will be those who define sovereignty not as separation, but as participation plus leadership—choosing who they depend on, where they build, and which global rules they shape. Strategic interdependence may feel less satisfying than independence, but it’s real, it is achievable, and it will separate the leaders from the followers over the next decade.

The age of intelligent systems demands intelligent strategies—ones that measure success not by infrastructure owned, but by problems solved. Nations that embrace this shift won’t just participate in the AI economy; they’ll shape it. That’s sovereignty worth pursuing.

            <div id="article-text">As Europe races into the AI era, its policymakers are laying new pipes for the continent’s digital future. The European Commission’s proposed Digital Networks Act (DNA) promises to rewire the EU’s telecom landscape, with big implications for artificial intelligence infrastructure, connectivity equity, and the startup ecosystem.

Exposed as part of a broader push to make Europe “fit for the Digital Age,” the draft law aims to modernize how networks are built and regulated, from 5G towers in rural villages to fiber links between data centers.

I have to say it’s a bold vision of a more connected, innovative Europe, but one that must navigate a thicket of competing interests and unanswered questions.

For years, EU leaders have urged the creation of a true single market for digital services. The DNA is a centerpiece of that strategy, aligning with Europe’s Digital Decade goals for universal high-speed internet by 2030.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

How can we translate this? Well, I think Brussels wants to turn the patchwork of 27 national telecom systems into one seamless network. The Act’s core objective is to “harmonise the EU connectivity sector by addressing delays, inconsistencies, and fragmentation”, removing barriers to cross-border operations and stimulating investment in very high-capacity networks.

This mirrors the logic behind earlier EU tech regulations;  just as the Digital Markets Act tackled Big Tech gatekeepers, the Digital Networks Act targets the digital plumbing beneath them.

This reform doesn’t come out of the blue.

A Commission white paper in 2024 warned that without cutting-edge digital infrastructure, Europe’s digital economy would stall. It painted vivid scenarios: doctors unable to perform remote surgery, smart farms and self-driving cars hamstrung by slow connections.

Secure and sustainable networks are one of the “cardinal points” of the EU’s 2030 digital agenda.

The DNA is Brussels’ attempt to meet those needs by boosting investment, standardizing rules, and making sure that every corner of Europe can plug into the opportunities of the digital age.

At its core, the Act hands telecom operators some long-sought gifts. One headline measure would grant carriers unlimited radio-spectrum licenses, ending the era of auctions that force telcos to periodically renew their rights.

For Europe’s big mobile providers, this change offers certainty: they can invest in 5G and future 6G networks without fearing their spectrum will expire.

Regulators argue this will “increase investment predictability” and accelerate network roll-out.

In theory, more cell towers could now reach remote areas, and companies might more freely trade or lease unused frequencies to new players.

The DNA couples permanent licenses with “use-it-or-share-it” obligations to prevent hoarding. If an incumbent isn’t using its spectrum in, say, a rural region, it could be forced to share it or lose it,  allowing a competitor or community network to serve that area.

It’s a nod to connectivity equity: Europe doesn’t want scarce wireless spectrum lying fallow while some communities remain underserved.

Broadband for all is the mantra, and long license tenures will come with accountability to deliver on coverage.

Another provision tightens the oversight of dominant firms. Under current plans, if a telecom operator holds significant market power (SMP) in one market (for example, fixed broadband), regulators could extend that designation to a closely related market (like mobile services).

In practice, this means big incumbents might face extra obligations, from transparency to price controls, across their range of services. The idea is to prevent giants from leveraging their dominance in one domain to squelch competition in another.

That could open space for smaller internet providers or innovative ISPs to compete, a boon for consumer choice and startup entrants.

A cohort of six member states,  including France, Germany and Italy, has pushed back, urging Brussels not to centralize control over frequencies and mergers.

Spectrum auctions have long been jealously guarded as national turf (they can fill state coffers, after all), and capitals are wary of one-size-fits-all rules emanating from the EU.

These governments also worry that encouraging pan-European telecom mergers (another idea floated in the reform) could reduce competition at home. In their joint memo, they caution that while a level playing field between telecoms and tech firms is a laudable goal, “this does not necessarily imply the same regulations should apply”to both sectors.

It’s a reminder that the DNA, for all its single-market ideals, must reckon with political realities: Europe’s telecom revolution won’t happen without consensus among very different national markets.

Perhaps the most contentious debate surrounding the Digital Networks Act has been over who pays for the next-generation networks. Telecom giants have spent years lobbying for a “fair share” contribution from Big Tech, arguing that bandwidth-hungry services like Netflix, YouTube, and cloud platforms should chip in to finance the infrastructure that carries their content.

The draft Act steers clear of any direct “network usage fee” on content providers. Instead, it reaffirms Europe’s commitment to net neutrality, the principle that all internet traffic must be treated equally by providers.

Any cooperation with Big Tech will rely on voluntary “best practice” discussions moderated by EU regulators, not on legally mandated payments.

This decision followed intense pushback from many sides. Over the summer, consumer groups and tech industry alliances publicly warned against reviving the “fair share” idea under any guise, noting it had been “clearly rejected in previous consultations” for threatening consumers, competition and innovation.

Even a U.S.–EU trade agreement in late 2025 extracted a pledge from Brussels “not [to] adopt or maintain network usage fees”, highlighting the geopolitical stakes of singling out mostly American tech firms.

On the other hand, startups and digital rights advocates breathed a sigh of relief at the Commission’s stance. Allied for Startups, a coalition of European entrepreneurs, argued that net neutrality is essential for startup growth, preventing a two-tier internet that would “favour dominant players” and raise barriers for newcomers.

In their view, a “traffic tax” isn’t just about Google or Amazon’s bottom line, it would set a harmful precedent that could box out the little guys who rely on affordable, equal-access bandwidth to innovate.

By keeping the DNA free of explicit network fees, Europe is signaling that the open internet won’t be collateral damage in the drive for better infrastructure.

Beyond telecom boardrooms and Silicon Valley balance sheets, the Digital Networks Act is ultimately about the kind of digital society Europe wants to build.

A major motivation is preparing for a future where artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and IoT devices are ubiquitous, and will demand unprecedented bandwidth and low latency.

The Commission’s own analysis stresses that only with the “highest performance” networks will transformative technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, remote health care, and smart grids reach their potential.

In simple terms: if data is the new oil, Europe needs better pipes to pump it.

The Digital Networks Act sits alongside Europe’s broader tech push by focusing on the infrastructure AI needs to scale. Beyond regulating AI, the EU is investing in next-generation networks, from fiber to 5G and 6G, through initiatives such as the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.

Faster rollout of these networks would underpin everything from AI-driven industry to cloud services, all of which depend on high-capacity, cross-border connectivity.

The Act also addresses connectivity equity. While Europe’s digital goals assume universal gigabit access and widespread 5G, large parts of the continent still lag behind.

The proposal combines simpler deployment rules with tougher coverage obligations, while allowing flexibility where older networks cannot yet be switched off. The aim is to expand access without letting rigid deadlines slow progress.

Whether this works will depend on execution. Investment still favors dense urban markets, and rural coverage remains a challenge. If the Act can meaningfully lift fiber and 5G reach across Europe, it could help ensure the AI economy extends beyond major tech hubs to the rest of the continent.

From the perspective of Europe’s startups and innovators, the DNA is a double-edged sword that tilts promisingly toward opportunity. On one side, the Act’s push to harmonize telecom rules could tear down barriers that have long frustrated young companies.

Today, a cloud services startup or an IoT device maker in Europe must navigate a maze of national regulations when scaling up, from differing network standards to separate certification hoops in each country.

By creating a more unified framework (for instance, common rules on spectrum and infrastructure access), the DNA could make it easier for a startup in Portugal to expand its services to Poland or Finland without running into 27 different regulatory roadblocks.

Startups rely on an open and predictable internet, and on this front the Commission’s approach offers some reassurance. By preserving net neutrality and rejecting new network tolls, the Act allows young companies to reach users on equal terms, without the risk that deeper-pocketed rivals can buy preferential treatment.

For small fintech or AI startups, avoiding additional network costs matters, and under the current proposal they won’t be asked to shoulder them.

At the same time, founders are reading the fine print carefully. Proposals around a “level playing field” raise concerns that telecom-style regulation could spill over onto digital services, including smaller platforms.

The balance remains fragile: regulate too little and dominant players squeeze out challengers; regulate too broadly and compliance costs can smother the next generation of European tech companies.

As an ambitious blueprint for Europe’s digital infrastructure, the Digital Networks Act embodies a careful balancing act. It must entice telecom operators to spend the billions needed to upgrade networks for an AI-driven future, yet not at the expense of the open internet or new challengers.

It seeks to unify Europe’s connectivity market while respecting that one size may not fit all in a Union of 27. In the coming months, EU lawmakers and member states will debate and tweak the proposal, and the stakes are high.

The outcome will shape not just who foots the bill for Europe’s next-gen networks, but also who can innovate on those networks in the years ahead.

There will be bumps on this road, resistance from powerful telecom lobbies, wrangling between capitals and Brussels, and possibly even transatlantic frictions.

In the end, the Digital Networks Act is about Europe’s place in the digital world. A continent that pioneered GSM mobile standards and championed data privacy now wants to set the standard for equitable, innovation-friendly networks.

Striking a balance between investment and fairness, between scale and competition, won’t be easy. But it’s essential. If the EU succeeds, the reward could be a resilient digital backbone capable of supporting AI breakthroughs and economic growth across all its regions, without leaving its core values behind.

If it stumbles, Europe risks buffering on the sidelines while others surge ahead.

The coming debate will reveal whether Europe can indeed reshape its digital DNA for the better, or if old divides will slow down this grand connectivity project.

Either way, the world will be watching the EU’s next move in this high-stakes telecom reboot.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Berlin’s energy transition sector got a defining boost today as Cloover, a climate fintech based in Berlin, announced it has secured more than $1.2 billion in total capital commitments, combining Series A equity and a substantial debt facility to accelerate the rollout of its software and financing platform across Europe.

The financing package includes €18.8 million (approximately $22 million) in Series A equity, led by MMC Ventures and QED Investors, with participation from Lowercarbon Capital, BNVT Capital, Bosch Ventures, Centrotec, and Earthshot Ventures.

Alongside that, a €1.02 billion debt facility provided by a major European bank will be deployed directly as customer and installer financing through Cloover’s platform, backed by a €300 million guarantee from the European Investment Fund to support scalable, low-cost lending for clean energy projects.

For a company that only a few years ago was in seed-stage fundraising, the scale of these commitments marks a striking shift. The debt element is operational capital designed to help manufacturers, installers, and homeowners finance solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and other distributed energy technologies under a single unified system.

Cloover was founded in 2023 by Jodok Betschart, Peder Broms, and Valentin Gönczy, who arrived at the idea after interviewing hundreds of installers across Europe and hearing the same frustrations: fragmented software stacks, manual processes, and limited access to project financing. They saw a structural gap in the energy transition; demand for decentralised power had surged, but the financing and platform infrastructure to scale it weren’t keeping pace.

That gap is what Cloover’s platform intends to close. At its core is an integrated operating system that combines workflow management, procurement, financing, energy optimisation, and risk analytics into one environment that serves all parts of the distributed energy value chain. Installers can offer financing at the point of sale, streamline operations, and reduce administrative drag.

Homeowners, in turn, gain access to installations with lower upfront costs and financing terms linked to projected energy savings rather than traditional credit scoring.

Some investors now call Cloover the “Shopify for energy”, a digital backbone that supports the entire process of deploying distributed energy systems at scale. The model is built around scalable capital deployment combined with end-to-end software automation, including AI-driven tools for underwriting and operations.
The timing of this financing is noteworthy.

Across Europe, demand for residential solar and decentralised energy solutions is accelerating as regulatory pressure, rising electricity prices, and broader electrification trends push households and businesses toward clean alternatives. Yet installers often struggle with financing bottlenecks. Cloover’s platform embeds capital directly into the sales workflow, turning financing from a hurdle into a built-in feature.

In a statement, CEO Jodok Betschart framed the new financing as a way to enable energy independence without the friction of upfront costs or complex loan applications, noting that the company’s AI operating system connects stakeholders across the value chain.

For European climate tech and energy markets, the scale of Cloover’s backing is remarkable. Few startups in this space have bridged software infrastructure and finance at this magnitude, and the size of the debt commitment signals deep lender confidence in distributed energy as a growth asset class.

It sets a potential precedent for how renewable energy projects can be financed and adopted more quickly across the region, something both policymakers and industry leaders have identified as essential to meeting the EU’s climate goals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To many readers, this may sound like a paradox: how can knowledge ever become invaluable?

In this article, I want to explore how corporate knowledge, when poorly structured and rigidly transferred, can slowly transform from an asset into a disadvantage. Not only for companies, but especially for employees. And over time, that disadvantage compounds.

The journey usually looks familiar. You apply for a job, speak with a recruiter, send your CV, go through interviews, and eventually receive the green-light email: “Congratulations, you’re hired.”

This moment takes us directly to the real turning point: the onboarding process.

Those first one, two, sometimes even three months when you are introduced to the people, the tools, the workflows, the strategies, and the “way things are done.” On paper, onboarding exists to accelerate integration and performance. In reality, in many corporations, it quietly becomes an indoctrination phase.

Relatable to anyone who has worked in large organizations, onboarding often shifts from enabling understanding to enforcing conformity. New hires are not only taught what the company knows, but also what the company no longer questions.

This is where corporate knowledge starts becoming invaluable.

Because instead of acting as a foundation to build on, it becomes a ceiling.

It tells you what to do, how to do it, and more importantly, what not to rethink. Over time, this “do according to the manual” culture doesn’t just standardize execution. It standardizes thinking. And standardized thinking is the natural enemy of innovation.

History shows us a consistent pattern: breakthroughs rarely come from the center of an industry. They come from the edges.

Elon Musk was not an automotive executive. He treated cars as computers on wheels and energy systems. The result? An entire industry forced to reset its assumptions.

Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp were not transportation insiders. They were technologists. They saw GPS-enabled phones, invisible payments, and drivers that didn’t need to be owned. They reframed taxis not as a fleet problem, but as a software and trust problem. And the taxi industry, as it existed, effectively ended.

These examples point to a simple truth: transformative ideas usually emerge from new mental models, not from perfected manuals.

Yet most onboarding processes are designed to remove new mental models as quickly as possible.

They don’t ask: “What do you see that we no longer notice?”
 They ask: “How fast can you adapt to how we already work?”

Most programs teach tools, not systems. New hires learn where to click, not how to think. They are trained on CRMs, scripts, workflows, and reporting routines, but not on AI-assisted decision-making, signal-based prospecting, or how to design work alongside automated agents.

As a result, organizations scale activity instead of intelligence.

Even worse, onboarding still assumes that humans should work like software: following rigid processes, filling manual reports, executing predefined sequences. Instead of being taught how to orchestrate software, delegate to AI, and concentrate on judgment, creativity, and relationships.

Over time, this creates a paradoxical outcome: the more “knowledge” an organization accumulates, the harder it becomes for new ideas to survive inside it.

And when knowledge can no longer be challenged, recombined, or re-imagined, it stops being knowledge.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a Davos dominated by talk of tariffs, subsidies, and geopolitical risk, Europe used the stage to question its own economic limits. At the World Economic Forum, Ursula von der Leyen put forward one of the clearest signals yet that the European Union is preparing a structural shift in how it treats business, competitiveness, and economic power.

The phrase that stuck, “Europe Inc”, is not the name of a regulation, nor a new Brussels invention ready to roll out. It is a political framing for a shift that the European Commission wants to accelerate.

What Europe Inc actually refers to is an idea long discussed in EU policy circles and now pushed into the spotlight: the so-called 28th regime. An optional, EU-wide corporate framework that would sit alongside national systems and allow companies to operate across the bloc under a single legal structure.

The problem it is meant to solve is real and well-documented. Europe has a single market in theory, but in practice, companies still face 27 different company laws, registration processes, capital requirements, and administrative timelines. Startups incorporate in one country, then struggle to expand. Scaleups hit legal friction. Many leave.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The Commission’s answer is simplification through centralisation. Under the proposed 28th regime, entrepreneurs would be able to set up a company digitally, once and use that structure across the EU. One registration, one legal form, one set of rules. The ambition presented at Davos goes further: company creation within 48 hours, fully online.

That figure matters. It is also where political ambition risks being read as immediate reality.

The 48-hour setup is not in force. It is a target attached to a proposal that still needs to be formally drafted, negotiated, and approved by both the European Parliament and member states. Nothing in current EU law allows this yet. What exists is intent, not implementation.

Von der Leyen was explicit about why this push is happening now. Global conditions have hardened. Trade is increasingly weaponised. Industrial policy has returned, unapologetically, in the US and China.

Supply chain shocks and energy crises exposed Europe’s vulnerabilities. In that environment, regulatory fragmentation stops being a technical issue and becomes a strategic one.

Europe Inc is Brussels admitting that rules alone do not build power. Scale does. There is also a political recalibration underway. The EU has traditionally defined itself as a regulator first, a market shaper second.

The message from Davos suggests a change in emphasis: competitiveness, capital mobilisation, and strategic autonomy are moving closer to the centre of EU policymaking.

Still, limits remain. The 28th regime, as currently described, would be optional. It would not harmonise taxation overnight. Labour law, insolvency rules, and social policy remain largely national domains. Europe Inc would coexist with national systems, not replace them.

That coexistence is both its strength and its risk. Optional frameworks can attract fast-growing companies, but they can also deepen a two-speed Europe if not carefully designed. This tension is not resolved yet.

What Davos revealed is not a finished Europe Inc, but a Commission willing to say openly that Europe’s economic model, as it stands, is too slow for the world it operates in. Whether Europe Inc becomes a meaningful tool or another unrealised promise will depend less on slogans and more on legislation, compromise, and political courage across 27 capitals.

For now, Europe Inc is best understood as a warning shot. Europe intends to compete as a bloc, not as a collection of administrative borders. The clock, as von der Leyen implied, is already running.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian business software company Odoo, also a unicorn, has reached a fresh milestone. Growth investor General Atlantic has increased its stake in the firm, buying additional shares from regional backer Wallonie Entreprendre and pushing Odoo’s valuation to roughly €7 billion.

This move isn’t a typical funding round where a company raises new capital. Instead, it’s a secondary transaction: General Atlantic bought existing shares that were previously held by Wallonie Entreprendre, the investment arm of Belgium’s Walloon region. After the deal, Wallonie Entreprendre still holds about 3 % of the company.

Odoo was founded in 2002 in Belgium and has grown steadily from a small project into a global software platform. It offers an integrated suite of business applications used by small and medium-sized enterprises for everything from finance and sales to HR and marketing.

The software is built on an open-core model that encourages developers around the world to build add-on apps, creating a vast ecosystem of nearly 40,000 extensions.

Today, Odoo counts more than 170,000 paying customers in around 180 countries. That global footprint and the steady revenue growth it has delivered helped convince General Atlantic to deepen its involvement.

Since first investing in the company in 2023, the firm has supported Odoo’s expansion into new markets and helped refine its commercial strategy.

Part of what makes this update noteworthy is how Odoo has expanded its product offerings. Its newest versions include AI-infused features and automation tools that make the suite more attractive to businesses looking to replace outdated, fragmented systems with a single, unified digital platform.

For the European tech scene, this development highlights a shift in how successful software companies grow and attract capital. Rather than chasing quick exits or IPOs, some founders are choosing secondary share deals to let early investors realise gains while keeping strategic control.

That path can make it easier for companies to stay private longer and focus on building value over time.

I don’t know what is happening in Belgium or what they are having for breakfast, but the country itself has quietly become a place where software businesses can scale internationally.

Odoo is one of its standout success stories, showing that strong product focus, community-driven development, and global reach can win serious backing from major growth investors.

            <div id="article-text">For a long time, tech events were built around scale. The bigger the crowd, the stronger the perception of success. Attendance numbers became a proxy for impact, and festivals grew year after year because that was what the industry expected.

That model no longer fits how tech leaders work today.

Over the past years, I have spent time in conversations with founders, executives, and operators who carry real responsibility inside their organizations. As a community builder, I often speak with them before they commit to attending events. Their questions are direct. They want to know who will be in the room, how discussions are structured, and whether the environment allows honest exchange.

Almost none of them ask how many people will attend.

This is a meaningful signal. Leaders who run companies do not optimize for visibility. They already have it. They want rooms where time leads to insight, clarity, and decisions.

As CEO of Tekpon AI Summit, I have had a front row seat to how decision makers actually want to engage today. I have watched what happens on large stages. I have also watched what happens when ten relevant people sit around one table with no audience and no agenda beyond honest discussion.

The difference in outcome is hard to ignore. In small rooms, people speak openly. They share challenges they would never publish. They explore partnerships without formalities. They make decisions faster because trust forms naturally when everyone present has earned their place in the conversation.

In larger settings, the dynamic changes. Conversations stay cautious. Stories become polished. The real questions are postponed, usually for later. Later often disappears into busy schedules.

Large conferences still play a role. They introduce new voices to the ecosystem. They create energy. They give exposure to early-stage founders. That contribution remains valuable.

But they are no longer where serious business gets done.

The work that shapes companies happens in environments where attention is protected and trust forms quickly. Where people can speak without performing. Where context is shared. Where participants know that what is said in the room stays in the room. These conditions are difficult to build at a mass scale and natural in small, curated settings.

This has already changed how senior decision makers allocate their time. Many are reducing their presence at large events. They are choosing closed discussions, private dinners, and carefully selected gatherings where every participant has a reason to be there. They are not rejecting conferences. They are rejecting formats that do not respect their attention.

The industry is slow to react to this shift. Event strategies still chase attendance growth, sponsorship volume, and social media reach. Meanwhile, the people shaping companies are quietly changing their behavior. They are voting with their calendars.

This gap will continue to widen. Events that optimize for volume will struggle to attract senior leaders. Once you see this up close, it becomes hard to unsee. The criteria for choosing where to meet have changed. Not loudly, not publicly, but consistently.

Some will still chase scale. Others will keep building large festivals and broad platforms. There is nothing wrong with that. But the people shaping companies are already making different choices. They are selecting rooms where conversations move faster, trust forms naturally, and time feels respected.

That is where tech leaders now choose to meet.
