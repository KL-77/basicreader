            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida—The rocket NASA is preparing to send four astronauts on a trip around the Moon will emerge from its assembly building on Florida’s Space Coast early Saturday for a slow crawl to its seaside launch pad.

Riding atop one of NASA’s diesel-powered crawler transporters, the Space Launch System rocket and its mobile launch platform will exit the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center around 7:00 am EST (11:00 UTC). The massive tracked transporter, certified by Guinness as the world’s heaviest self-propelled vehicle, is expected to cover the four miles between the assembly building and Launch Complex 39B in about eight to 10 hours.

The rollout marks a major step for NASA’s Artemis II mission, the first human voyage to the vicinity of the Moon since the last Apollo lunar landing in December 1972. Artemis II will not land. Instead, a crew of four astronauts will travel around the far side of the Moon at a distance of several thousand miles, setting the record for the farthest humans have ever ventured from Earth.

The flight will culminate with a scorching 25,000 mph (40,000 km per hour) reentry over the Pacific Ocean. The four Artemis II astronauts—NASA’s Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Canada’s Jeremy Hansen—will become the fastest humans in history, edging out a speed record set during the Apollo era of lunar exploration.

The journey for the fully-assembled Moon rocket will begin early Saturday at a slower pace. After leaving the Vehicle Assembly Building, the moving 11 million-pound structure will head east, then make a left turn before climbing the ramp to Pad 39B overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.

“We will be at a cruising speed of under one mile per hour,” said Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA’s launch director for the Artemis II mission. “It’ll be a little slower around the turns and up the hill.”

The crawler carrying the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft was built 60 years ago to haul NASA’s Saturn V rockets, then kept around for the Space Shuttle Program. Now, the vehicle is back to its original purpose of positioning Moon-bound rockets on their launch pads.

“These are the kinds of days that we live for when you do the kind of work that we do,” said John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Mission Management Team for the Artemis II mission. “The rocket and the spacecraft, Orion Integrity, are getting ready to roll to the pad … It really doesn’t get much better than this, and we’re making history.”

You can watch live views of the rollout in this YouTube stream provided by NASA.

Artemis II is the first crew flight of NASA’s Artemis program, an initiative named for the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology. NASA named the program Artemis in 2019, but some of the building blocks have been around for 20 years.

NASA selected Orion contractor Lockheed Martin to oversee the development of a deep space capsule in 2006 as part of the George W. Bush administration’s soon-to-be canceled Constellation program. In 2011, a political bargain between the Obama administration and Congress revived the Orion program and kicked off development of the Space Launch System. The announcement of the Artemis program in 2019 leaned on work already underway on Orion and the SLS rocket as the centerpieces of an architecture to return US astronauts to the Moon.

Tens of billions of dollars later, everything is finally coming together for the final all-important milestone in developing the vehicles for transporting crews between the Earth and the Moon. A human-rated lunar lander and spacesuits tailored for Moonwalking astronauts are still a few years away from readiness. NASA has contracts with SpaceX and Blue Origin for landers, and with Axiom Space for suits.

A successful Artemis II mission would demonstrate to NASA’s managers and engineers that the Orion spacecraft and SLS rocket fulfill their roles in the Artemis architecture. NASA is expected to rely on the SLS rocket, which costs more than $2 billion per flight and is expendable by design, for several more missions until commercial alternatives are available.

America’s return to the Moon now has a geopolitical imperative. China is working to land its own astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030, and US officials want to beat the Chinese to the Moon for the motivation of national prestige and the material benefits of accessing lunar resources, among other reasons. For now, budget-writing lawmakers in Congress and President Donald Trump’s new NASA chief, Jared Isaacman, agree the existing SLS/Orion architecture, despite its cost and shortcomings, offers the surest opportunity to beat the Chinese space program to a crew lunar landing.

Then, if all goes according to plan, NASA can turn to cheaper (and in one case, more capable) rockets to help the government afford the expenditure required to construct a Moon base.

“Putting crew on the rocket and taking the crew around the Moon, this is going be our first step toward a sustained lunar presence,” Honeycutt said. “It’s 10 days [and] four astronauts going farther from Earth than any other human has ever traveled. We’ll be validating the Orion spacecraft’s life support, navigation and crew systems in the really harsh environments of deep space, and that’s going to pave the way for future landings.”

There is still much work ahead before NASA can clear Artemis II for launch. At the launch pad, technicians will complete final checkouts and closeouts before NASA’s launch team gathers in early February for a critical practice countdown. During this countdown, called a Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), Blackwell-Thompson and her team will oversee the loading of the SLS rocket’s core stage and upper stage with super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants.

The cryogenic fluids, particularly liquid hydrogen, gave fits to the Artemis launch team as NASA prepared to launch the Artemis I mission—without astronauts—on the SLS rocket’s first test flight in 2022. Engineers resolved the issues and successfully launched the Artemis I mission in November 2022, and officials will apply the lessons for the Artemis II countdown.

“Artemis I was a test flight, and we learned a lot during that campaign getting to launch,” Blackwell-Thompson said. “And the things that we’ve learned relative to how to go load this vehicle, how to load LOX (liquid oxygen), how to load hydrogen, have all been rolled in to the way in which we intend to do for the Artemis II vehicle.”

Assuming the countdown rehearsal goes according to plan, NASA could be in a position to launch the Artemis II mission as soon as February 6. But the schedule for February 6 is tight, with no margin for error. Officials typically have about five days per month when they can launch Artemis II, when the Moon is in the right position relative to Earth, and the Orion spacecraft can follow the proper trajectory toward reentry and splashdown to limit stress on the capsule’s heat shield.

In February, the available launch dates are February 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11, with launch windows in the overnight hours in Florida. If the mission isn’t off the ground by February 11, NASA will have to stand down until a new series of launch opportunities beginning March 6. The space agency has posted a document showing all available launch dates and times through the end of April.

NASA’s leaders are eager for Artemis II to fly. NASA is not only racing China, a reality the agency’s former administrator acknowledged during the Biden administration. Now, the Trump administration is pushing NASA to accomplish a human landing on the Moon by the end of his presidential term on January 20, 2029.

One of Honeycutt’s jobs as chair of the Mission Management Team (MMT) is ensuring all the Is are dotted and Ts are crossed amid the frenzy of final launch preparations. While the hardware for Artemis II is on the move in Florida, the astronauts and flight controllers are wrapping up their final training and simulations at Johnson Space Center in Houston.

“I think I’ve got a good eye for launch fever,” he said Friday.

“As chair of the MMT, I’ve got one job, and it’s the safe return of Reid, Victor, Christina, and Jeremy. I consider that a duty and a trust, and it’s one I intend to see through.”</div>

            <h2>Rackspace customers grapple with “devastating” email hosting price hike</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/rackspace-raises-email-hosting-prices-by-as-much-as-706-percent/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rackspace’s new pricing for its email hosting services is “devastating,” according to a partner that has been using Rackspace as its email provider since 1999.

In recent weeks, Rackspace updated its email hosting pricing. Its standard plan is now $10 per mailbox per month. Businesses can also pay for the Rackspace Email Plus add-on for an extra $2/mailbox/month (for “file storage, mobile sync, Office-compatible apps, and messaging”), and the Archiving add-on for an extra $6/mailbox/month (for unlimited storage).

As recently as November 2025, Rackspace charged $3/mailbox/month for its Standard plan, and an extra $1/mailbox/month for the Email Plus add-on, and an additional $3/mailbox/month for the Archival add-on, according to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.

Rackspace’s reseller partners have been especially vocal about the impacts of the new pricing.

In a blog post on Thursday, web hosting service provider and Rackspace reseller Laughing Squid said Rackspace is “increasing our email pricing by an astronomical 706 percent, with only a month-and-a half’s notice.”

Laughing Squid founder Scott Beale told Ars Technica that he received the “devastating” news via email on Wednesday. The last time Rackspace increased Laughing Squid’s email prices was by 55 percent in 2019, he said.

“The price increase has a major impact on the ability to make money due to the fact that email is now our largest expense, and we were only given a month-and-a-half notice,” Beale told Ars.

Online, there are reports of Rackspace partners being quoted email pricing increases of 110 percent to nearly 500 percent. The reports say that the new, higher-per-mailbox quotes don’t include volume pricing discounts. Beale noted that Laughing Squid’s quote doesn’t include discounts that the company previously received.

“We had really good reseller pricing that we negotiated with Rackspace due to the number of mailboxes we had with them and how long we had been a customer. All of that seemed to vanish when they notified us of their new pricing,” he said.

Ars contacted Rackspace asking about the 706 percent price hike that Laughing Squid says it’s facing, why Rackspace decided to increase its prices now, and why it didn’t give its partners more advanced notice. A company spokesperson responded, saying:

Rackspace Email is a reliable and secure business-class email solution for small businesses. To continue delivering the service levels our customers expect, effective March 2026, Rackspace Technology is increasing the price of Rackspace Email. We have a support team available to help our customers to discuss their options.

The spokesperson added that Rackspace’s “mission is to deliver quality, trusted and reliable hosted email solution for businesses.”

Despite Rackspace’s stated commitment to email hosting, the prohibitive pricing seems like a deterrent for a business being viewed as high-effort and low-margin. Email has grown complex over the years, requiring time and expertise for proper management at scale. It’s become simpler, or more lucrative, for some cloud companies to focus on selling their managed services on top of offerings like Microsoft 365—as Rackspace does—or Google Workspace and let the larger companies behind those solutions deal with infrastructure costs and complexities.

Rackspace’s price hike also comes as an AI-driven RAM shortage is impacting the availability and affordability of other computing components, including storage.

With Rackspace, which went public in 2020, also having quit hosting Microsoft Exchange following a costly 2022 ransomware attack, the Texas-headquartered company may be looking to minimize its email hosting duties as much as possible.

Meanwhile, Laughing Squid is increasing prices for Rackspace mailboxes and offering services with a different email provider, PolarisMail, to customers at lower prices. Beale said he has reached out to Rackspace about the new pricing but hasn’t heard back yet.</div>

            <h2>Archaeologists find a supersized medieval shipwreck in Denmark</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/archaeologists-find-a-supersized-medieval-shipwreck-in-denmark/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Archaeologists recently found the wreck of an enormous medieval cargo ship lying on the seafloor off the Danish coast, and it reveals new details of medieval trade and life at sea.

Archaeologists discovered the shipwreck while surveying the seabed in preparation for a construction project for the city of Copenhagen, Denmark. It lay on its side, half-buried in the sand, 12 meters below the choppy surface of the Øresund, the straight that runs between Denmark and Sweden. By comparing the tree rings in the wreck’s wooden planks and timbers with rings from other, precisely dated tree samples, the archaeologists concluded that the ship had been built around 1410 CE.

Svaelget 2, as archaeologists dubbed the wreck (its original name is long since lost to history), was a type of merchant ship called a cog: a wide, flat-bottomed, high-sided ship with an open cargo hold and a square sail on a single mast. A bigger, heavier, more advanced version of the Viking knarrs of centuries past, the cog was the high-tech supertanker of its day. It was built to carry bulky commodities from ports in the Netherlands, north around the coast of Denmark, and then south through the Øresund to trading ports on the Baltic Sea—but this one didn’t quite make it.

Most cogs would have been about 15 to 25 meters long and 5 to 8 meters wide, capable of carrying about 200 tons of cargo—big, impressive ships for their time. But Svaelget 2, an absolute unit of a ship, measured about 28 meters from bow to stern, 9 meters wide, and could have carried about 300 tons. Its size alone was a surprise to the archaeologists.

“We now know, undeniably, that cogs could be this large—that the ship type could be pushed to this extreme,” said archaeologist Otto Uldum of Denmark’s Viking Ship Museum, who led the excavation, in a press release.

Medieval Europe’s merchant class was growing in both size and wealth in the early 1400s, and the cog was both a product of that growth and the engine driving it. The mere fact of its existence points to a society that could afford to invest in building big, expensive trading ships (and could confidently expect a return on that investment). And physically, it’s a product of the same trading networks it supplied: while the heavy timbers of its frame were cut locally in the Netherlands, the Pomeranian oak planks of Svaelget 2’s hull came from Poland.

“The cog revolutionized trade in northern Europe,” said Uldum. “It made it possible to transport goods on a scale never seen before.”

For about 600 years, layers of sand had protected the starboard (right, for you landlubbers) side of the wreck from erosion and decay. Nautical archaeologists usually find only the very bottoms of cogs; the upper structures of the ship—rigging, decks, and castles—quickly decay in the ocean. That means that some of the most innovative parts of the ships’ construction appear only in medieval drawings and descriptions.

But Svaelget 2 offers archaeologists a hands-on look at the real deal, from rigging to the ship’s galley and the stern castle: a tall wooden structure at the back of the ship, where crew and passengers could have sought at least a little shelter from the elements. Medieval drawings and texts describe cogs having high castles at both bow and stern, but archaeologists have never gotten to examine a real one to learn how it’s put together or how it connects with the rest of the ship’s construction.

“We have plenty of drawings of castles, but they have never been found because usually only the bottom of the ship survives,” said Uldum. “[The castle] is a big step forward compared to Viking Age ships, which had only open decks in all kinds of weather.”

Lying on and around the remains of the cog’s decks, Uldum and his colleagues also found stays (ropes that would have held the mast in place) and lines for controlling the ship’s single square sail, along with ropes and chains that would once have secured the merchant vessel’s cargo in the open hold.

The cog would probably have sailed with between 30 and 45 crew members. No remains were found on the wreck, but the lost crew left behind small, tantalizing traces of their lives and their presence. Uldum and his colleagues found combs, shoes, and rosary beads, along with dishes and tableware.

“The sailor brought his comb to keep his hair neat and his rosary to say his prayers,” said Uldum (and one has to picture the sailor’s grandmother beaming proudly at that description). “These personal objects show us that the crew brought everyday items with them. They transferred their life on land to life at sea.”

Life at sea, for the medieval sailors aboard Svaelget 2, would have included at least occasional hot meals, cooked in bronze pots over an open fire in the ship’s galley and eaten on dishes of ceramic and painted wood. Bricks (about 200 of them) and tiles formed a sort of fireplace where the cook could safely build a fire aboard the otherwise very flammable ship.

“It speaks of remarkable comfort and organization on board,” said Uldum. “Now sailors could have hot meals similar to those on land, instead of the dried and cold food that previously dominated life at sea.” Plenty of dried meat and cold biscuits still awaited sailors for the next several centuries, of course, but when weather and time permitted, at least the crew of Svaelget 2 could gather around a hot meal. The galley would have been a relatively new part of shipboard life for sailors in the early 1400s—and it quickly became a vital one.

One thing usually marks the site of a shipwreck, even when everything else has disintegrated into the ocean: ballast stones. When merchant ships were empty, they carried stones in their holds to help keep the ship stable; otherwise, the empty ship would be top-heavy and prone to tipping over, which is usually not ideal. (Modern merchant vessels use water, in special tanks, for ballast.) But Uldum and his colleagues didn’t find ballast stones on Svaelget 2, which means the cog was probably fully laden with cargo when it sank.

But the cargo is also conspicuously absent. Cogs were built to carry bulk goods—things like bricks, grain and other staple foods, fabric, salt, and timber. Those goods would have been stowed in an open hold amidships, secured by ropes and chains (some of which remain on the wreck). But barrels, boards, and bolts of fabric all float. As the ship sank and water washed into the hold, it would have carried away the cargo.

Some of it may have washed up on the shores or even more distant beaches, becoming a windfall for local residents. The rest probably sank to the bottom of the sea, far from the ship and its destination.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/judge-orders-annas-archive-to-delete-scraped-data-no-one-thinks-it-will-comply/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The operator of WorldCat won a default judgment against Anna’s Archive, with a federal judge ruling yesterday that the shadow library must delete all copies of its WorldCat data and stop scraping, using, storing, or distributing the data.

Anna’s Archive is a shadow library and search engine for other shadow libraries that was launched in 2022. It archives books and other written materials and makes them available via torrents, and recently expanded its ambitions by scraping Spotify to make a 300TB copy of the most-streamed songs. Anna’s Archive lost its .org domain a couple of weeks ago but remains online at other domains.

Yesterday’s ruling is in a case filed by OCLC, a nonprofit that operates the WorldCat library catalog on behalf of member libraries. OCLC alleged that Anna’s Archive “illegally hacked WorldCat.org” to steal 2.2TB of data.

Anna’s Archive, which bills itself as “the world’s largest shadow library,” did not respond to the lawsuit and doesn’t seem likely to comply with the judgment. The shadow library creator has written that “we deliberately violate the copyright law in most countries. This allows us to do something that legal entities cannot do: making sure books are mirrored far and wide.”

But the court order has value for OCLC, which said in a November 2025 motion that it “hopes to take the judgment to website hosting services so that OCLC’s WorldCat data will be removed from Anna’s Archive’s websites.” We contacted OCLC about its plans today and will update this article if it provides any information.

The court order, which was previously reported by TorrentFreak, was issued by Judge Michael Watson in US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. “Plaintiff has established that Defendant crashed its website, slowed it, and damaged the servers, and Defendant admitted to the same by way of default,” the ruling said.

Anna’s Archive allegedly began scraping and harvesting data from WorldCat.org in October 2022, “and Plaintiff suffered persistent attacks for roughly a year,” the ruling said. “To accomplish such scraping and harvesting, Defendant allegedly used search bots (automated software applications) that ‘called or pinged the server directly’ and appeared to be ‘legitimate search engine bots from Bing and Google.’”

The court granted OCLC’s motion for default judgment on a breach-of-contract claim related to WorldCat.org terms and conditions, and a trespass-to-chattels claim related to the alleged harm to its website and servers. The court rejected the plaintiff’s tortious-interference-with-contract claim because OCLC’s allegation didn’t include all necessary components to prove the charge, and rejected OCLC’s unjust enrichment claim because it “is preempted by federal copyright law.”

The judgment said Anna’s Archive is permanently enjoyed from “scraping or harvesting WorldCat data from WorldCat. org or OCLC’s servers; using, storing, or distributing the WorldCat data on Anna’s Archive’s websites; and encouraging others to scrape, harvest, use, store, or distribute WorldCat data.” It also must “delete all copies of WorldCat data in possession of or easily accessible to it, including all torrents.”

The “Anna” behind Anna’s Archive revealed the WorldCat scraping in an October 2023 blog post. The post said that because WorldCat has “the world’s largest library metadata collection,” the data would help Anna’s Archive make a “list of books that need to be preserved.”

“Even though OCLC is a nonprofit, their business model requires protecting their database,” Anna wrote. “Well, we’re sorry to say, friends at OCLC, we’re giving it all away.”

Anna’s blog said the scraping took place over a year and relied on security flaws that were gradually patched. The “security flaws were slowly fixed one by one, until the final one we found was patched about a month ago,” the October 2023 post said. “By that time we had pretty much all records, and were only going for slightly higher quality records.”

OCLC filed its lawsuit in January 2024. “Beginning in the fall of 2022, OCLC began experiencing cyberattacks on WorldCat.org and OCLC’s servers that significantly affected the speed and operations of WorldCat.org, other OCLC products and services, and OCLC’s servers and network infrastructure,” the lawsuit said. “These attacks continued throughout the following year, forcing OCLC to devote significant time and resources toward non-routine network infrastructure enhancements, maintenance, and troubleshooting.”

OCLC finally learned the perpetrator was Anna’s Archive when the shadow library made its October 2023 announcement. “Anna’s Archive has since made OCLC’s WorldCat data available for en masse for free download and now is actively encouraging its visitors to make use of the data in ‘interesting’ ways,” the lawsuit said, adding that the defendants “have no legal justification for their actions and admit that their general operations violate US and other jurisdictions’ copyright laws.”

Yesterday’s default judgment is not the end of proceedings in the case. OCLC was ordered to file a status report within 30 days “suggesting next steps on the claims for which the Court denied default judgment, unless it files a motion to dismiss its remaining claims against Defendant before then.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A generally healthy 63-year-old man in the New England area went to the hospital with a fever, cough, and vision problems in his right eye. His doctors eventually determined that a dreaded hypervirulent bacteria—which is rising globally—was ravaging several of his organs, including his brain.

According to the man, the problems started three weeks before his hospital visit, when he said he ate some bad meat and started vomiting and having diarrhea. Those symptoms faded after about two weeks, but then new problems began—he started coughing and having chills and a fever. His cough only worsened from there.

At the hospital, doctors took X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans of his chest and abdomen. The images revealed over 15 nodules and masses in his lungs. But that’s not all they found. The imaging also revealed a mass in his liver that was 8.6 cm in diameter (about 3.4 inches). Lab work pointed toward an infection, so doctors admitted him to the hospital and provided oxygen to help with his breathing, as well as antibiotics. But his chills and cough continued.

On his third day, he woke up with vision loss in his right eye, which was so swollen he couldn’t open it. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed another surprise: There were multiple lesions in his brain. (His brain lesions and eye at this point can be seen here. A later-stage image of his eye is further down in the story.) At that point, he was transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital. In a case report in this week’s issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, doctors explained how they solved the case and treated the man.

The key to the correct diagnosis was his eye, which kept getting worse. He seemed to have an infection inside his eyeball, affecting the jelly or aqueous parts of the inside (endophthalmitis). The most common cause of this is an eye injury or previous surgery that allows an infection-sparking germ to get in—but he had no such injury or surgery. Also, the condition of his eye was worse than that. He appeared to have panophthalmitis, which is a rare, extremely severe, and rapidly progressing condition in which every part of the eye becomes infected.

Whatever was laying waste to his eye seemed to have come from inside his own body, carried in his bloodstream—possibly the same thing that could explain the liver mass, lung nodules, and brain lesions. There was one explanation that fit the condition perfectly: hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae or hvKP.

Classical K. pneumoniae is a germ that dwells in people’s intestinal tracts and is one that’s familiar to doctors. It’s known for lurking in health care settings and infecting vulnerable patients, often causing pneumonia or urinary tract infections. But hvKP is very different. In comparison, it’s a beefed-up bacteria with a rage complex. It was first identified in the 1980s in Taiwan—not for stalking weak patients in the hospital but for devastating healthy people in normal community settings.

An infection with hvKP—even in otherwise healthy people—is marked by metastatic infection. That is, the bacteria spreads throughout the body, usually starting with the liver, where it creates a pus-filled abscess. It then goes on a trip through the bloodstream, invading the lungs, brain, soft tissue, skin, and the eye (endogenous endophthalmitis). Putting it all together, the man had a completely typical clinical case of an hvKP infection.

Still, definitively identifying hvKP is tricky. Mucus from the man’s respiratory tract grew a species of Klebsiella, but there’s not yet a solid diagnostic test to differentiate hvKP from the classical variety. Since 2024, researchers have worked out a strategy of using the presence of five different virulence genes found on plasmids (relatively small, circular pieces of DNA, separate from chromosomal DNA, that can replicate on their own and be shared among bacteria.) But the method isn’t perfect—some classical K. pneumoniae can also carry the five genes.

Another much simpler method is the string test, in which clinicians basically test the goopy-ness of the bacteria—hvKP is known for being sticky. For this test, a clinician grows the bacteria into a colony on a petri dish, then touches an inoculation loop to the colony and pulls up. If the string of attached goo stretches more than 5 mm off the petri dish, it’s considered positive for hvKP. This is (obviously) not a precise test.

In the man’s case, the bacteria from his respiratory tract was positive in the string test. Doctors treated him with antibiotics that testing found could kill off the hvKP strain he had.

Still, it was too late for the man’s eye. By his eighth day in the hospital, the swelling had gotten extremely severe (you can see an image here, but be warned that it is very disturbing). His eye was now bulging out of his head, and imaging suggested another abscess had formed on the side of the eyeball. He had severe stretching of his optic nerve. Overall, there was no chance of him recovering sight in that eye. Given the worsening situation—which was despite the effective antibiotics—doctors removed his eye.

In these cases, it’s sometimes recommended to drain the liver abscess and surgically remove the brain lesions, too. But doctors ruled out both of those options. The liver abscess was too varied for simple drainage, and the brain lesions were too small and numerous to make surgery safe. Instead, he went through an intense antibiotic regimen that lasted nine months. Fortunately, by then, imaging confirmed that his liver abscess had resolved, his lung nodules nearly vanished, and his brain lesions significantly shrank or disappeared.

His doctors also noted that he was fortunate to have an hvKP strain that did not carry significant antibiotic resistance. In recent years, health officials have flagged not just a global increase of hvKP cases overall but also an increase in hvKP cases that are resistant to critical antibiotics, specifically carbapenemases or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. These cases can have fatality rates of above 50 percent.</div>

            <h2>OpenAI to test ads in ChatGPT as it burns through billions</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/openai-to-test-ads-in-chatgpt-as-it-burns-through-billions/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Friday, OpenAI announced it will begin testing advertisements inside the ChatGPT app for some US users in a bid to expand its customer base and diversify revenue. The move represents a reversal for CEO Sam Altman, who in 2024 described advertising in ChatGPT as a “last resort” and expressed concerns that ads could erode user trust, although he did not completely rule out the possibility at the time.

The banner ads will appear in the coming weeks for logged-in users of the free version of ChatGPT as well as the new $8 per month ChatGPT Go plan, which OpenAI also announced Friday is now available worldwide. OpenAI first launched ChatGPT Go in India in August 2025 and has since rolled it out to over 170 countries.

Users paying for the more expensive Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not see advertisements.

According to OpenAI’s blog post, the company plans to test ads “at the bottom of answers in ChatGPT when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service.” Ads will be labeled and separated from the answer.

In example screenshots shared by the company, the ads look like blocked off sections of the chat window with a small image and some advertising copy. Asking ChatGPT for places to visit in Mexico could result in holiday ads appearing, for instance.

“Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong,” Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s CEO of applications, wrote in the blog post. “We believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone.”

OpenAI’s announcement follows the company’s April 2025 introduction of shopping features to ChatGPT Search. At that time, OpenAI’s Adam Fry told Wired that product recommendations were “not ads” and “not sponsored,” but it felt like a potential step in that direction at the time.

OpenAI is not the only AI company exploring advertising revenue. Google began testing AdSense ads in chatbot experiences through partnerships with AI startups in late 2024.

OpenAI’s advertising experiment reflects the enormous financial pressures facing the company. OpenAI does not expect to be profitable until 2030 and has committed to spend about $1.4 trillion on massive data centers and chips for AI.

According to financial documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal in November, OpenAI expects to burn through roughly $9 billion this year while generating $13 billion in revenue. Only about 5 percent of ChatGPT’s 800 million weekly users pay for subscriptions, so it’s not enough to cover all of OpenAI’s operating costs.

Not everyone is convinced ads will solve OpenAI’s financial problems. “I am extremely bearish on this ads product,” tech critic Ed Zitron wrote on Bluesky. “Even if this becomes a good business line, OpenAI’s services cost too much for it to matter!”

OpenAI’s embrace of ads appears to come reluctantly, since it runs counter to a “personal bias” against advertising that Altman has shared in earlier public statements. For example, during a fireside chat at Harvard University in 2024, Altman said he found the combination of ads and AI “uniquely unsettling,” implying that he would not like it if the chatbot itself changed its responses due to advertising pressure. He added: “When I think of like GPT writing me a response, if I had to go figure out exactly how much was who paying here to influence what I’m being shown, I don’t think I would like that.”

Along those lines, OpenAI’s approach appears to be a compromise between needing ad revenue and not wanting sponsored content to appear directly within ChatGPT’s written responses. By placing banner ads at the bottom of answers separated from the conversation history, OpenAI appears to be addressing Altman’s concern: The AI assistant’s actual output, the company says, will remain uninfluenced by advertisers.

Indeed, Simo wrote in a blog post that OpenAI’s ads will not influence ChatGPT’s conversational responses and that the company will not share conversations with advertisers and will not show ads on sensitive topics such as mental health and politics to users it determines to be under 18.

“As we introduce ads, it’s crucial we preserve what makes ChatGPT valuable in the first place,” Simo wrote. “That means you need to trust that ChatGPT’s responses are driven by what’s objectively useful, never by advertising.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years now, actors have rung the alarm bells over the AI industry planning to sell their likeness and voices — either with or without their consent — and hence threatening to put them out of work.

Beyond a major 2023 strike by Hollywood actors fueled by these concerns, we’ve already seen actors take matters into their own hands, like when Scarlett Johansson threatened to sue OpenAI over a ChatGPT update that she claims imitated her voice. Two voice actors have also filed a lawsuit, accusing an AI startup of using their voices to train their AI without permission.

Tensions came to a head last year when an AI company unveiled an AI actor dubbed Tilly Norwood. The news was met by near-universal backlash from both industry insiders and the public, further stoking fears of the industry coming for human actors’ jobs.

To get ahead of having the industry making unauthorized AI dupes of his likeness or voice, Hollywood star Matthew McConaughey came up with a clever new defense tactic. As the Wall Street Journal reports, the performer filed eight trademark applications to the US Patent and Trademark Office that featured videos and audio clips of him “staring, smiling and talking.”

All eight applications have since been approved — and yes, one of the submitted clips included him saying his iconic line, “Alright, alright, alright” from the 1993 movie “Dazed and Confused.”

“My team and I want to know that when my voice or likeness is ever used, it’s because I approved and signed off on it,” McConaughey told the newspaper in an email. “We want to create a clear perimeter around ownership with consent and attribution the norm in an AI world.”

The goal is to pave the way for litigation in case a company or individual were to attempt to profit from the actor’s likeness with the help of AI.

“In a world where we’re watching everybody scramble to figure out what to do about AI misuse, we have a tool now to stop someone in their tracks or take them to federal court,” one of McConaughey’s attorneys, Jonathan Pollack, told the newspaper.

Whether the gambit will pay off remains to be seen. For one, many copyright infringement challenges aimed at AI companies are still playing out in court as we speak.

“I don’t know what a court will say in the end,” attorney Kevin Yorn, who is also representing McConaughey, told the WSJ. “But we have to at least test this.”

Other experts added that copyright law gets murky when it comes to AI-based video platforms, like OpenAI’s Sora. The app, which allows users to generate photorealistic clips of famous characters and actors despite the company’s guardrails, was criticized by talent agencies last year.

The Sam Altman-led firm appeared to have bungled its messaging at the time, telling some talent agencies at first that they’d have to opt out of having actors they represent appear on Sora — only to change its mind days later, triggering copious confusion.

Federal rules establishing if, when, and how an actor’s likeness or voice can be used are still being debated by lawmakers. Hollywood unions, however, remain adamant that unauthorized AI clones of actors should be illegal.

            <div id="article-text">Does Microsoft hate books more, or its own workers? It’s hard to say, because The Verge reports that the multitrillion dollar giant is gutting its employee library and cutting down on digital subscriptions in favor of pursuing what’s internally described as an “AI-powered learning experience” — whatever in Clippy’s name that’s supposed to mean.

Seriously, we wish we could explain to you what the hell that is, but most of the details on this AI-focused transition are maddeningly vague. What we do know, according to the reporting, is that the cheapskates upstairs are ending employee subscriptions to news outlets, including to the Strategic News Service, which has provided global reports to Microsoft’s workforce for more than 20 years.

On top of that, not only do Microsoft employees tell The Verge that they’ve lost access to publications like The Information, but they’re also unable to digitally check out business books from the Microsoft Library, which itself is being targeted by the new AI pivot.

According to an internal Microsoft FAQ, the library housed in Building 92 has been “closed as part of Microsoft’s move toward a more modern, connected learning experience through the Skilling Hub.”

“We know this change affects a space many people valued,” the company said.

Meanwhile, employee subscriptions aren’t being renewed for pretty much the same reason: because it’s a “part of Microsoft’s shift to a more modern, AI-powered learning experience through the Skilling Hub.”

All told, the cuts are yet another example of how Microsoft has gone completely bonkers for AI. Urban legend at the company says that Microsoft’s Library, when it was housed in its old location on the second floor of Building 4, was so heavy that it caused the building to sink. That was probably a myth, but now it sounds like Microsoft is happy to let this trove of knowledge, if not literally sink into the Earth, fall by the wayside on the altar of AI.

An executive from SNS, the news organization that worked with Microsoft for over two decades but is now being cut off, absolutely roasted its former customer for the changes.

“Technology’s future is shaped by flows of power, money, innovation, and people — none of which are predictable based on LLMs’ probabilistic regurgitation of old information,” Berit Anderson, chief operating officer of SNS, told The Verge. “We look forward to welcoming Microsoft back into the SNS community whenever they decide they would like to return.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI data centers on the East Coast are gobbling up so much juice that nonprofit grid operator PJM may be forced to enact rolling blackouts on its customers during both heat waves and exceptionally cold weather just to protect the grid’s integrity.

These blackouts would impact a staggering 67 million people in 13 states, according to The Wall Street Journal, which will no doubt fan more anger from residential customers and politicians who are already deeply ticked off about the mass construction of AI data centers.

“They’re pretty much the whole boat when it comes to increases in electricity demand,” John Quigley, senior fellow at University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, told CNBC last November about power-hungry data centers. “It’s going to get worse.”

The grid operator PJM is expecting demand for electricity to grow an average of 4.8 percent per year over the next 10 years, according to the WSJ, largely driven by the construction and running of these data centers, many of which are located in Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley,” which has 153 facilities in the town of Asburn alone.

Consulting firm ICF International estimates in a report flagged by the WSJ that America’s demand for power will go up 25 percent by 2030 compared to 2023 — and a whopping 78 percent by 2050.

The wrinkle for PJM is that newer power plants are not replacing older ones fast enough. In addition, tech companies pushed back on a proposal last year to voluntarily power down or get power elsewhere when the demand is highest.

That seems unfair to residential customers who would bear the physical and emotional brunt of a blackout — because after all, nobody is living inside these data center facilities. Increasing energy prices have already become a political hot potato among energy customers, from Arizona to Maine, who have also opposed the centers for high water usage and for generating local pollution.

PJM is now putting together another proposal to balance energy needs during peak demand, but it still needs to pass muster with tech companies, power producers, utilities and other stakeholders. Until it’s fully resolved, PJM customers should expect the occasional blackout.

Assuming he serves for his entire term, he’ll be 82 years and seven months old by the time he leaves office — breaking Joe Biden’s record of 82 years and two months.

And like Biden, some major questions are swirling around Trump as obvious signs of aging come to the fore. Speaking to the biographer Sidney Blumenthal and historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast The Court of History, Washington State University Professor of Medicine Bruce Davidson opined that Trump appears to have suffered a stroke that’s impacting his ability to move.

“My impression is that president Trump has had a stroke, and I think there’s several lines of evidence supporting that,” Davidson said. “I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body.” Based on what he’s seen, the doctor estimated the event happened “six months ago or more, earlier in 2025.”

“There’s video of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen him [doing], striding on the golf course,” the doctor continued. “He was garbling words, which he didn’t do previously, and which he’s improved upon more recently. And he’s also had marked episodes that have been noticed of daytime, excessive sleepiness, — medical term, hypersomnolence — which is characteristic of many patients after they’ve had a stroke.”

The most recent smoking gun, Davidson claimed, was a recent video of Trump gingerly walking down the stairs from Air Force One. As he descends the steps, the president grips the banister with his left hand, even though he’s right-handed.

“All of this is consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of his brain,” Davidson said.

While the assertion has some important implications for Trump himself, it would also mean that his entire administration has been lying to the American public about his health for months — echoing the health debacle surrounding Biden in his final years in office. That said, Davidson’s definitely not the first person to suggest Trump’s hiding a stroke in plain sight.

As questions of the president’s visible bruising and swollen ankles dominated headlines last July, the White House put out a statement admitting he had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency. In mid-October, Trump was taken for a mysterious check-up at Walter Reed Medical Center, which the White House claimed was a routine physical — even though it turned out Trump had gotten an MRI scan.

Earlier this month, Trump contradicted the administration’s earlier claims, stating that the trip involved a CT scan, not an MRI, which he underwent to “definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.”

Without being able to examine the president directly, even the best professional diagnoses amount to speculation at best — and given Trump’s history of offering up bizarre claims about his health, it’s unlikely the public will get any clarity any time soon.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The use of generative AI for creative purposes has spawned a major countermovement. From game developers reeling from a wave of criticism for using the tech to artists staging mass protests against AI, the backlash against what’s being hailed as a technological revolution grew massively last year.

In a startlingly literal example of this growing fury, a University of Alaska Fairbanks undergraduate student was detained after ripping “artwork off the walls and eating it in a reported protest,” according to a university police department statement quoted by the school’s student newspaper, The Sun Star.

The student, Graham Granger, was accused of chewing and spitting out small images that were pinned to the wall of a UAF art exhibit, which featured 160 AI-generated images by fine arts student Nick Dwyer. Photos taken by The Sun Star show crumpled-up pieces of paper strewn across a polished concrete floor.

According to the police department, Granger chewed up at least 57 of the 160 images. As a result, the undergraduate student was arrested for “criminal mischief in the 5th degree and booked at the Fairbanks Correctional Center,” according to the student newspaper.

It’s yet another example of how anti-AI sentiment is gripping the art world, highlighting a heated debate over human authorship and expression in a world filled with text-to-image generators that can conjure up works from a simple prompt in an instant.

Dwyer has since defended his work, telling The Sun Star that he had been using AI for his art since 2017. He said his exhibit “explores identity, character narrative creation and crafting false memories of relationships in an interactive role digitally crafted before, during and after a state of AI psychosis.”

The term “AI psychosis” has been used by health professionals to describe a troubling phenomenon in which users of AI tools are experiencing symptoms of psychosis or delusional episodes. Experts have raised concerns over the trend, warning that more and more people could be caught up in these delusions as they become hooked on AI chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

In extreme cases, these tools have been alleged to have led to numerous deaths, including the suicide of a 16-year-old.

Dwyer told The Sun Star that he had fallen into AI psychosis himself, turning to art to portray the experience.

The art world has been reeling from a flood of AI-generated pieces for years now. We’ve seen instances of artists being wrongfully accused of using the tech, while others, like users on the subreddit Defending AI Art, are arguing that it’s an entirely legitimate way of expressing oneself.

A similar situation is playing out in the music industry as well, with music streaming services hosting cheap AI knockoffs of real artists’ works.

Just this week, music distribution platform Bandcamp announced that it was banning AI-generated songs — a move that was met with an outpouring of support.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What do you get when you put a vaccine conspiracy theorist in charge of the agency responsible for funding medical research throughout the globe? A recipe for Tuskegee 2.0, it seems.

Some bombshell reporting over the last month has revealed a monstrous plan by Robert F Kennedy Jr.’s Department of Health and Human Services to fund a $1.6 million study on hepatitis B vaccines among 14,000 newborns in the West African country of Guinea-Bissau. As protocol documents obtained by Inside Medicine show, the study would have been a “randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of neonatal Hepatitis B vaccination on early-life mortality, morbidity, and long-term developmental outcomes.”

In other words, the study aims to withheld Hep B vaccinations from 7,000 infants in one of the poorest countries on earth — so that western researchers could compare their long-term health to babies that got the vaccine.

This is where things get hazy. This week, the Guardian reported that the trial had been halted by officials in Guinea-Bissau, after weeks of outrage from health officials and researchers. Instead, the Africa CDC told the Guardian the study would be reworked to address the ethics concerns that have become a rallying cry in the medical research community.

“The study has been cancelled,” Africa CDC official Yap Boum said on Thursday, the newspaper reported.

But a spokesperson for the HHS pushed back strongly, saying the study was forging ahead.

“To be clear, the trial will proceed as planned,” the HHS assistant secretary for public affairs told us in a statement.

“Africa CDC, an organization with no affiliation to the US CDC, shared weeks-old communications unrelated to the trial as part of a public-relations campaign aimed to shape public perception rather than engaging with the scientific facts,” he said. “This research represents the world’s first, and potentially only, opportunity to rigorously evaluate the overall health effects of HBV0.”

We’ve reached out to the HHS and the Africa CDC to try to figure out what’s going on, since the two groups seem to be disagreeing on details as basic as whether the study is still happening.

Regardless, experts are appalled at the implications of the study.

“This is another Tuskegee,” one anonymous CDC official told Inside Medicine.

They were refering to the Tuskegee syphilis study, an infamous experiment that ran from 1932 until 1972 in which 600 poor Black men with syphilis were studied to understand the long-term effects of the disease in exchange for “free medical care” from the US government.

The catch? Though penicillin was discovered to be an effective treatment for syphilis mid-way through the study in 1943, study subjects were never offered the antibiotic, or even told they had syphilis in the first place — leaving them to suffer the full effects of the debilitating infection, even though it was entirely treatable. It remains one of the most barbaric biomedical research studies in US history, and its cruelty is still felt to this day.

Continuing, the CDC official told Inside Medicine that “we are allowing children, infants, to be exposed to Hepatitis B when we could prevent it, and then follow them for five years to see what happens. That’s not long enough to see the long-term benefits, but might be long enough to find some non-specific effects.”

“Non-specific effects” is a key buzzword swirling around Kennedy’s orbit of vaccine skeptics and holistic wellness influencers, which essentially means “unintended harms.” The HHS’s chosen researchers for the Guinea-Bissau study were Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn, a controversial Danish couple who have spent years chasing after non-specific effects in vaccines.

Thankfully, “the good guys won,” as Paul Offit, an infectious disease physician told the Guardian. “This administration did not see people in Africa as valuable… We were able to stand up for them. We were able to convince people about the fact that this was unethical.”

Updated to reflect that the HHS is denying the study is canceled.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/musk-wants-up-to-134b-in-openai-lawsuit-despite-700b-fortune/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk wants a jaw-dropping $79 billion to $134 billion in damages from OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming the AI company defrauded him by jettisoning its nonprofit mission, Bloomberg first reported. The figure comes from expert witness C. Paul Wazzan, a financial economist whose bio says he has been deposed nearly 100 times and testified at trial more than a dozen times in complex commercial litigation cases.

Wazzan, who specializes in valuation and damages calculations in high-stakes disputes, determined that Musk is entitled to a hefty portion of OpenAI’s current $500 billion valuation based on his $38 million seed donation when he co-founded the startup in 2015. (If you’re wondering, that would mean a 3,500-fold return on Musk’s investment.)

Wazzan’s analysis combines Musk’s initial financial contributions with the technical know-how and business contributions he offered to OpenAI’s early team, calculating wrongful gains of $65.5 billion to $109.4 billion for OpenAI and $13.3 billion to $25.1 billion for Microsoft, which today owns a 27% chunk of the company.

Musk’s legal team argues he should be compensated as an early startup investor who sees returns “many orders of magnitude greater” than his initial investment. But the sheer scale of the damages demand underscores that this legal battle isn’t really about the money.

Musk’s personal fortune currently hovers around $700 billion, making him by far the world’s richest person. As Reuters recently noted, his wealth now exceeds that of Google co-founder Larry Page, the world’s second-richest person, by a stunning $500 billion, according to Forbes’ billionaires list. In November, Tesla shareholders separately approved a $1 trillion pay package for Musk, the largest corporate pay package in history.

Against this backdrop, even a $134 billion payout from OpenAI would represent a relatively modest addition to Musk’s wealth, likely reinforcing for those at OpenAI their characterization of the lawsuit as part of an “ongoing pattern of harassment” rather than a legitimate financial grievance. OpenAI already reportedly sent a letter Thursday to investors and others of its business partners, warning that Musk will make “deliberately outlandish, attention-grabbing claims” as his lawsuit against the company heads to trial in April. The case will be heard in Oakland, California, about 15 miles east of San Francisco.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/ai-cloud-startup-runpod-hits-120m-in-arr-and-it-started-with-a-reddit-post/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Runpod, an AI app hosting platform that launched four years ago, has hit a $120 million annual revenue run rate, founders Zhen Lu and Pardeep Singh tell TechCrunch.

Their startup journey is a wild example of how if you build it well and the timing is lucky, they will definitely come.

The story includes bootstrapping their way to over $1 million in revenue; landing a $20 million seed round after VC Radhika Malik, a partner at Dell Technologies Capital, saw some Reddit posts; and gaining another key angel investor, Hugging Face co-founder Julien Chaumond, because he was using the product and reached out over the support chat, the founders tell TechCrunch.

It all began in late 2021 when the two friends, who worked together as corporate developers for Comcast, decided the hobby they were doing wasn’t fun anymore.

They had built setups of specialized computers used to generate Ethereum in their respective New Jersey basements. While they did successfully mine a bit of the cryptocurrency, it wasn’t enough to pay back their investment, they said. Plus, mining was going to end after the much-ballyhooed network upgrade called “The Merge.”

On top of that, it was “boring” after a couple of months, Lu said.

But they had talked their wives into letting them spend a good $50,000 on the hobby between them, they estimated. Lu and Singh knew that home harmony depended on finding a way to use those GPUs.

The devs had been engaged in machine learning projects at work, so they opted to convert their mining rigs into AI servers. This was before ChatGPT, even before DALL-E 2.

As they repurposed the rigs, “We were seeing how really god-awful the software stack was for dealing with these GPUs,” Lu said. As developers, they found a problem they wanted to solve.

Runpod was born “because we felt that the actual experience of developing software on top of GPUs was just hot garbage,” Lu described.

A few months later in early 2022, they were ready to share what they had built. Runpod is a platform for hosting AI apps, emphasizing speed, easily configured hardware (including a serverless option that automates configuration), and dev tools like APIs, command-line interfaces, and other integrations.

Back in 2021, they only had a few such integrations (like support for popular web app tool Jupyter notebooks). The next problem: finding beta testers.

“As first-time founders, we didn’t really know how to market or how to do anything,” Lu recalled. “So I’m like, all right, let’s just post on Reddit.”

So, they posted in a couple of AI-oriented subreddits. The offer was simple: free access to their AI servers in exchange for feedback. It worked. They landed beta customers, which led to paying customers. Within nine months, they had quit their jobs and hit $1 million in revenue, they said.

But that led to another problem. “Six months in, business users were like, ‘Hey, I want to actually run real business stuff on your platform. But I cannot run it on servers that are in people’s basements,” Lu said.

It had not occurred to the New Jersey founders to raise capital from VCs. Instead they formed revenue-share partnerships with data centers to grow capacity. But it was stressful. The founders needed to stay three steps ahead.

“If we don’t have the GPUs, the market sentiment, the user sentiment changes. Because when they don’t see capacity from you, they go somewhere else,” Singh described.

Meanwhile, their user base was growing on Reddit and Discord, especially after ChatGPT launched.

VCs were also on the prowl for investments. Malik saw them on Reddit and reached out, their first VC call. But Lu didn’t know how to pitch to an investor. “Radhika was super helpful, even at the first conversation,” he said. She basically explained to him how a VC thinks and told him she’d stay in touch.

Meanwhile, Lu had a business to run that had to pay for itself. “It was almost two years where we really didn’t have any funding,” he said. So Runpod never offered a free tier. It had to at least pay for itself, even if it wasn’t throwing off much profit. Unlike other AI cloud services that began as crypto miners, these founders refused to take on debt, they said.

By May 2024, with AI app fever spreading, their lucky decision to launch AI hosting for devs two years earlier was paying off. Their business had grown to 100,000 developers, and they landed a $20 million seed deal co-led by the VC arms of both Dell and Intel, with participation from big names like Nat Friedman and Chaumond.

They haven’t raised more money since but are now planning to, armed with a business that, they believe, should command a healthy Series A.

Today, Runpod counts 500,000 developers as customers, ranging from individuals to Fortune 500 enterprise teams with multimillion-dollar annual spend, the founders said.

Their cloud spans 31 regions globally and counts customers like Replit, Cursor, OpenAI, Perplexity, Wix, and Zillow as users.

Competition is also fierce. Devs have all the major clouds to choose from (AWS, Microsoft, Google), plus plenty of industry-specific choices like CoreWeave and Core Scientific.

But they also see their place in the world a bit differently — as a dev-centric platform. They don’t see coding ever going away but changing. Programmers will become AI agent creators and operators.

“Our goal is to be what this next generation of software developers grows up on,” Lu said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, the California attorney general’s office announced that it was investigating xAI over reports that the startup’s chatbot, Grok, was being used to create nonconsensual sexual imagery of women and minors. On Friday, the government followed up by sending a cease-and-desist letter to the company, demanding that it take immediate action to stop the production of nonconsensual intimate images and CSAM — child sexual abuse material.

“Today, I sent xAI a cease-and-desist letter, demanding the company immediately stop the creation and distribution of deepfake, nonconsensual, intimate images and child sexual abuse material,” said California AG Rob Bonta in a press release. “The creation of this material is illegal. I fully expect xAI to immediately comply. California has zero tolerance for [CSAM].”

The AG’s office additionally claimed that xAI appeared to be “facilitating the large-scale production” of nonconsensual nudes, the likes of which are being “used to harass women and girls across the internet.” The agency said it expects xAI to prove that it is taking steps to address these issues within the next five days.

At the heart of the backlash is Grok’s “spicy” mode feature, which xAI created to generate explicit content. The issue has spread beyond California; Japan, Canada, and Britain have opened investigations into Grok, and Malaysia and Indonesia have temporarily blocked the platform altogether. Despite xAI instituting some restrictions on its image-editing features late Wednesday, the California AG’s office moved ahead with its cease-and-desist letter.

X’s safety account has previously denounced this kind of user activity, saying: “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.” TechCrunch reached out to xAI for comment and was met with an automated email that says “Legacy Media Lies.” TC also reached out to the California AG’s office for more context.

The advent of free generative AI tools has led to a disturbing swell of non-consensual sexual material. Many platforms have been grappling with this problem, not just X. The sordid activity has drawn the attention not just of state leaders but also of Congress. Indeed, on Thursday, lawmakers sent a letter to the executives of several companies — including X, Reddit, Snap, TikTok, Alphabet, and Meta — asking how they planned to stem the proliferation of sexualized deepfakes.

The round was led by Dragoneer Investment Group, the startup said, with participation from investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, GIC, Index Ventures, Khosla Ventures, and Lightspeed Venture Partners.

ClickHouse, which spun out from Russian search giant Yandex in 2021, develops database software designed to process the massive datasets required by AI agents. The company competes with Snowflake and Databricks.

The company also announced the acquisition of Langfuse, a startup that helps developers track and evaluate the performance of their AI agents. Langfuse competes directly with LangSmith, LangChain’s observability platform.

ClickHouse database is open sourced, and it makes money by selling managed cloud services, which saw annual recurring revenue (ARR) grow by more than 250% year-over-year, it said. The company’s customers include Meta, Tesla, Capital One, Lovable, Decagon, and Polymarket.

            <div id="article-text">TikTok has quietly released a new stand-alone short drama app called PineDrama in the U.S. and Brazil. The app offers access to microdramas, which are essentially bite-sized TV shows that can be watched in a series of one-minute episodes. Think TikTok, but every video you come across is a short episode of a fictional story.

PineDrama is available on iOS and Android. It’s free and currently ad-free, though that could change in the future.

The news was first reported by Business Insider.

You can find content through the app’s “Discover” tab, where you can sort through “All” or “Trending” dramas, or through endless vertical recommendations that are tailored to your taste. PineDrama features a variety of genres, including thriller, romance, family, and more. Examples of popular shows include “Love at First Bite” and “The Officer Fell for Me.”

The app features a “Watch history” section where you can jump back into the various series you’re watching. There’s also a “Favorites” section where you can save the dramas you like the most. You can also share thoughts with other viewers in the comment section and enter a full-screen viewing experience that gets rid of the caption and sidebar.

The move comes as TikTok launched a “TikTok Minis” section in its app late last year, where users can watch microdramas. With the launch of PineDrama, TikTok is taking on popular microdrama platforms like ReelShort and DramaBox. While the microdrama industry wasn’t that popular until recent years, it’s racing toward $26 billion in annual revenue by 2030, as reported by Variety.

Short-form storytelling hasn’t always found success, even with notable backing. In 2020, DreamWorks co-founder and former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg launched a short-form streaming platform called Quibi with $1.75 billion in funding. The platform offered episodes under 10 minutes featuring popular Hollywood actors, but failed to gain traction and was shut down six months later.

ReelShort and DramaBox succeeded where Quibi failed because while Quibi tried to compress Hollywood TV into shorter episodes, ReelShort and DramaBox created low-budget stories that hook viewers within the first few seconds, followed by continuous cliffhangers, all featuring non-union talent. Additionally, they target fans of soapy romance and revenge thriller stories, while Quibi tried to target everyone.

TikTok is now looking to replicate this success with PineDrama. The company already dominates the short-form social media space and is now aiming to take on another media category.

            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s xAI has been illegally operating dozens of natural gas turbines to power its Colossus data centers in Tennessee, the Environmental Protection Agency ruled Thursday. The AI company has argued that because the turbines were being used on a temporary basis, they were exempt from regulations. The EPA disagreed and issued its final rule on the matter, which has been in the works for over a year, declaring that xAI was in violation.

The power plants drew the ire of local communities and legal organizations. The company was facing a lawsuit for contributing more ozone and particulate emissions in an already polluted region. The company was operating as many as 35 turbines, and only 15 were ultimately permitted. Today, xAI has 12 turbines providing power to its data centers there.

There was a moment this fall when it seemed like the public might actually get some answers—that the extent of the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes might be exposed, and that his victims might see the accountability they’ve been waiting for. On November 19, President Trump reluctantly signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which required the Justice Department to publish a huge number of its unclassified files related to the late financier (and unrelated to ongoing investigations) within 30 days.

But what actually arrived on December 19, the Friday before Christmas, was a relatively small (and sloppily redacted) tranche of files that raised far more questions than it answered. Nearly a month later, not a whole lot has changed. Despite having published a second batch, the DOJ has still released less than 1 percent of the millions of documents now under review.

If the Justice Department has legitimate reasons for its delay, it hasn’t thoroughly explained what they are. In a letter yesterday, Attorney General Pam Bondi and other DOJ officials framed the problem as purely logistical, citing “inevitable glitches due to the sheer volume of materials.” They noted that the department has put “over five hundred reviewers” on the project, even as they declined to clarify when they would release more files. Frank Figliuzzi, a former high-ranking FBI official who has handled nationwide investigations involving massive amounts of raw data, told me he’s skeptical of that defense. During his tenure, he explained, the bureau became highly digitized, bringing in all sorts of new tools to speed up the process of redactions and disclosures. “If we’re led to believe that human beings have to go through all of this, I’m not buying all of that,” he said.

Legal experts and legislators maintain that Bondi and her department are now in clear violation of the law. Earlier this week, 19 of Epstein’s victims requested that a Justice Department watchdog review the agency’s work, alleging that the redactions have not adequately concealed survivors’ names and identifiers. Representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie, who introduced the Transparency Act as a bipartisan bill, have suggested that Bondi be held in contempt for missing the deadline. Other lawmakers have batted around the idea of impeaching her. But these moves would require real political willpower—so far, neither of them has come to pass.

In lieu of consistent communication with Congress and the public about the delays, the Justice Department is providing a slow drip of updates in the form of legal memos and enigmatic new uploads to the existing database of Epstein files. The department has also equivocated about the scope of its documents: Last February, shortly after being confirmed as attorney general, Bondi declared that Epstein’s fabled “client list” was “sitting on my desk right now”—but in July, the DOJ said in a memo that no such client list ever existed. That same memo claimed that the department had conducted an “exhaustive review” of the files—but earlier this month, Bondi told a judge that “more than 2 million documents” were still in “various phases of review.”

My colleague Sarah Fitzpatrick, who covers the DOJ, explained to me that the Epstein case has been plagued by a long list of issues, omissions, and breaches of Justice Department policy—a pattern that has persisted ever since Epstein became a focus of federal law enforcement. Although the release of the files is purportedly about “transparency,” the Justice Department has been suffering from a lack of public trust. Trump has used the agency to investigate and even prosecute his enemies, and its employees have left by the thousands since he took office. This broader transformation of the DOJ has only compounded the communication issues around the Epstein files, and exacerbated conspiracy theories. (The department did not respond to a request for comment.)

The Epstein saga has also recently entered a new phase of political infighting. This week, the GOP-led House Oversight Committee called on former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to testify about Epstein. They refused—and, in a statement, accused Committee Chair James Comer of selectively enforcing subpoenas. “The decisions you have made, and the priorities you have set as chairman regarding the Epstein investigation, have prevented progress in discovering the facts about the government’s role,” they wrote. There could be an element of truth here—Comer may be using the Clintons as a distraction from Trump’s connections to Epstein—but they, like Bondi, are not above the law, and their refusal to cooperate only hampers the larger process.

Each new revelation about the files seems to multiply the unknowns. The Transparency Act, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, represents one path to accountability. If only Congress had the will to enforce it.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Many Americans enthusiastically partake in Dry January, but it is rarely pitched as fun. After the holiday stretch of office parties and family gatherings, Americans have come to use the start of every year to abstain from alcohol in the name of health and auspicious beginnings. It’s a time of discipline, of cleansing, of embodying your mood board, even if it makes you a drag at parties. And it is also, as weed companies have learned, a marketing opportunity.

Welcome back to Atlantic Trivia! Are you hungry for more?

I hope that while I’ve been away, you have been enjoying plenty of food for thought—literally. Research shows that berries help improve memory and that a walnut-heavy diet is associated with higher cognitive performance. Fatty fish and leafy greens are linked to slower cognitive decline. Caffeine is a brain boost too.

A challenge: Combine all these ingredients, Chopped-style, into the perfect pre-trivia meal.

Meanwhile, I have been away these past few weeks thinking mostly about chicken parmigiana. It’s not brain food per se, but I reckon we can call it creativity fuel—so long as it’s eaten for breakfast. That is the suggestion in the first edition of my new newsletter, Better With Time, an eight-week course of ways to add oomph to various parts of the day. Sign up for it here.

And by the way, did you know that Pablo Picasso stipulated that his 1937 painting of the bombing of Guernica should never be exhibited in authoritarian Spain? He wanted the work to go to the country only when and if democracy there was restored.

Dictator Francisco Franco tried to acquire the painting in the late 1960s after expanding a few civil liberties, but Picasso held fast. It wasn’t until several years after Franco’s death—and Picasso’s too—that the artist’s lawyers determined that Spain’s nascent democracy was here to stay. In 1981, Guernica was relocated from New York to Madrid—crossing Spanish soil for the first time. It has been shown there since.

And by the way, did you know that the body turns all those egg whites and whatnot into tens of thousands of different kinds of proteins? Many of these have daunting, sciencey-sounding names—but there is also the group called “hedgehog proteins.”

Cells rely on these proteins to know where to go and what to turn into during embryonic development. They are so named because disabling them in fruit flies causes embryos to grow abnormal spikes.

Humans have three separate hedgehog proteins, two of which—the Indian and desert varieties—are named after real species. The third (sigh) is named after the most famous hedgehog of all: Sonic.

And by the way, did you know that mitochondria can be shared among cells? If needed—often in instances of cellular distress—the organelles travel from one cell to another via little bridges called tunneling nanotubes.

I cannot help but anthropomorphize this incredible phenomenon: a knock at the cell membrane. Neighbor, can I borrow a cup of adenosine triphosphate?

And by the way, did you know that when the aforementioned dynasty took power in 1925, its country was still known to the world as Persia? It wasn’t until 1935 that the shah asked the international community to start calling the place Iran, to better reflect its makeup (not all Iranians are ethnically Persian).

This was generally accommodated. Then Winston Churchill got involved; the British premier worried that the new name was too close to Iraq’s and would cause confusion during World War II, when both countries were occupied by the Allies. He requested a temporary swap back, and the Iranians—or Persians?—amazingly agreed.

And by the way, did you know that venison, which comes from the Latin for “to hunt,” once referred to any wild game? That meant deer, but also hare, boar, some goats, and elk and their ilk.

That catchall spirit lives on today in South Africa. Because the country’s continent has no native deer species, venison there means meat from eland, kudu, gemsbok, springbok, or impala—which, to save you a search, are all species of antelope.</div>

            <h2>Jerome Powell’s Thankless Rescue of Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/jerome-powell-fed-trump-thankless/685653/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When historians eventually study whom Donald Trump treated worse—his enemies or his friends and loyal servants—the sad case of Jerome Powell will weigh heavily on the scales.

Not only did Trump discharge the usual fusillade of schoolyard insults and infantile tantrums at the man he appointed chair of the Federal Reserve Board; as the world now knows, Trump’s Department of Justice has also opened a spurious criminal investigation of Powell for allegedly making false statements to Congress about a cost overrun in a construction project.

We have seen Trump’s particular style of gratitude before. John Bolton, his former national security adviser turned critic, is living under a politically hatched indictment, and Mike Pence, his first-term vice president, was exposed to a violent mob for executing his constitutionally mandated duties.

Yet Powell’s case is distinct because he—more than any other top-level civil servant—helped secure the most significant policy triumph of Trump’s career. He even played a crucial part in Trump’s eventual reelection.

During the Obama years, after the mortgage bust, Ben Bernanke and the Fed kept the short-term interest rate close to zero, setting the stage for Powell’s role in the Trump economy. Free money was great for stock-market investors, but Main Street’s recovery was torpid.

In 2018, when Powell took office, a year into Trump’s first term, the federal funds rate was still only 1.5 percent. Under Powell, the Fed gradually hiked the rate to 2.5 percent and then pulled back. Trump squawked and mused about firing Powell.

Trump’s carping notwithstanding, economic growth spiked during Powell’s first year to 3 percent, the highest since the mid-2000s, and wages rose at the fastest rate since before the financial crisis. Growth remained a still-strong 2.6 percent in 2019. And thanks to Powell’s refusal to cave to the president, inflation remained muted. In other words, wage gains translated to real gains in living standards. Inequality, as measured by the Fed Survey of Consumer Finances, actually contracted. By any fair measure, economic performance during the first three years of Trump 1.0 was good, and the Fed chief deserved credit—which never emanated from the White House.

Powell’s record during Joe Biden’s presidency was far more mixed. When the pandemic shut down the economy during 2020, Powell cut the federal funds rate to effectively zero. And left it there.

Biden, inaugurated nine months after the COVID recession ended, enacted a massive deficit-spending program. He styled himself a second version of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Just as Trump had pursued a highly stimulative program (particularly with his tax cut), so did Biden. The purposes were different, but both added to inflationary pressures.

Under Biden, Powell did not experience overt pressure from the White House, but there was soft pressure on the Fed not to choke off the recovery, and to align with the executive during a crisis. Both Powell and the Biden White House misread the COVID recession as similar to the 2008 mortgage meltdown. In a financial crisis, recoveries are typically slow. People’s assets are underwater and stimulus is needed for a protracted period. During the COVID recession, once people exited the initial lockdown, the crisis was over.

When COVID struck, Powell kept the overnight interest rate at or below 1 percent for more than two years, until June 2022. By then, the annualized inflation rate had hit 9.1 percent, the highest in 40 years.

Powell then became serious about fighting inflation and eventually brought it under control, but the damage was done. In effect, Powell had saved Trump from his worst instincts but failed to do so for Biden.

The statistic known as “real median household income” vividly contrasts what happened to the typical family’s living standard during each presidential term, after adjusting for inflation. During Trump’s first term, it rose 10 percent before COVID and 8.2 percent overall. Under Biden, it rose 2.6 percent.

David Axelrod: Trump is making the same mistake as Biden

When Trump ran for reelection in 2020—before there was even a vaccine for COVID—the pandemic recession was on voters’ minds. But four years later, when voters told pollsters that the economy had been better under Trump than under Biden, median household income is what they were remembering, even if that’s not how they articulated it.

Inflation was probably the greatest factor in Trump’s defeat of Kamala Harris. Trump and Biden were both reckless deficit spenders, but thanks to Powell’s tougher stance against inflation, Trump’s economy performed better, and that secured his political comeback.

Trump’s response to this good fortune has been to attack the independence of the Fed and of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that collects much of the data on which the Fed relies. Toward Powell, he has been vindictive (for what, exactly?) and mean-spirited.

Trump wants Powell to lower rates, just as the Fed kept them low under Biden. This would risk repeating the Biden-era inflation that Trump campaigned against. Does this make sense? Not to me, either.</div>

            <h2>Trump’s Fateful Choice in Iran</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/trump-iran-protests-irgc-khamenei/685648/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The fate of a 2,500-year-old nation and its 93 million inhabitants rests, for now, in the hands of Donald Trump.

On at least eight occasions over the past three weeks, Trump encouraged Iranian protesters to go into the streets, assuring them that the United States had their back and that “help is on the way.” He threatened that if the Iranian regime killed protesters, the U.S. was “locked and loaded” to take action.

“If they start killing people like they have in the past,” he warned, “we will get involved. We’ll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn’t mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts.”

Despite Trump’s threats, the Islamic Republic commenced what is almost certainly its bloodiest killing binge since its inception, in 1979. The regime itself admitted to 2,000 deaths; human-rights organizations believe that the figure could be higher than 12,000. This death toll likely dwarfs the number of protesters killed by the shah over the 13 months leading to the 1979 revolution.

Trump now confronts a fateful choice. He can make good on his promise and risk the always-unpredictable consequences of military action, or he can face the shame of having given false encouragement to freedom fighters and emboldened one of America’s fiercest adversaries.

If Trump chooses not to act, his encouragement of the Iranian people to rise up, his repeated promises of U.S. support, and his subsequent abandonment of them will be remembered as one of the most callous examples of presidential betrayal in modern history. Expressing moral support for protesters was the right thing to do. But inciting them to rise up and promising intervention, only to watch them get mowed down by the thousands, will be counted as an act of cruelty.

Gal Beckerman: The Iranians who feel ‘betrayed’ by the left

Iranian grievances are local, but revolutions are about psychology, and Trump’s exhortations altered the risk calculus of many protesters. Siavash Shirzad was one of them. His family attempted to dissuade him from going into the streets, but the 38-year-old insisted. As one family member recalled, he said: “This is a celebration of a revolution. Trump said he supports us. I’m going.” That faith cost him his life.

The consequences of inaction are already visible. The regime’s security officials, some of whom may have been on the fence about whether to put down arms or continue killing, will now clearly choose a side. The logic is brutal but simple: Without a credible threat of U.S. intervention, they calculate that the regime is here to stay—making defection a death sentence and ruthless loyalty their only path to survival. Then-President Barack Obama’s decision not to enforce his own “red line” after Syria’s regime used chemical weapons in 2013 helped that country’s then-ambivalent military make the same calculation and presaged another decade of killing.

Both Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came to regret that their administration did not do more to help Iranian protesters during the country’s 2009 Green Movement (Clinton later said that this was the single thing she most wished the administration had handled differently). We can be fairly certain, however, that concerns of conscience will not weigh heavily on Trump’s decision making.

What could guide him, however, is concern for the damage that inaction will do to his strongman image. Trump does not enjoy being made to look weak or being ridiculed. And much as the Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro did in the weeks before his capture, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has over the past week taunted Trump as a “tyrant” who “will be overthrown.” Being made to look ineffectual—particularly at a moment when public opinion would reward him for toughness—could well goad Trump into taking action.

To be sure, there are valid strategic reasons for his reluctance. Most U.S. interventions to exact justice on foreign tyrants have ended poorly. No American silver bullet will cleanly depose Tehran’s Islamist leaders and peacefully transition the country to a stable, representative democracy. Since World War II, fewer than a quarter of authoritarian collapses have led to democracy, and those triggered by foreign intervention have been particularly unlikely to do so. Violent revolutions are coercive contests; they are won by those who can organize force, not mobilize hashtags.

That said, U.S. military action can still constructively shape events, even if it can’t control their ultimate outcome. Foreign intervention will not spawn an Iranian Denmark, in other words, but it could prevent the entrenchment of an Iranian North Korea.

In this context, Trump should be clear about his objectives, focusing on three fronts. He should seek to deter the violence against civilians by signaling that the cost of this slaughter will outweigh the benefits of suppression. He should insist on tearing down the digital iron curtain that has allowed the regime to massacre people in the dark (for the past week, connectivity in Iran has hovered at 1 percent). And he should make a goal of fracturing Iran’s security forces by degrading the regime’s command and control, thereby creating doubt within their ranks and emboldening the population.

On the last point, I consulted with three friends in the U.S. military and intelligence communities who have a century of collective experience dealing with Iran. Johnny Gannon, a Persian-speaking veteran of the CIA, advised that any U.S. action should serve to “demoralize, damage, and denigrate” the adversary. He paraphrased Machiavelli’s advice to the Prince about the risk of half measures: “One should either caress a man or crush him. If you injure him, you should do so in such a way that you need not fear his revenge.” If you aim for the supreme leader, you best not miss.

Arash Azizi: The Islamic Republic will not last

A retired senior U.S. military official who has studied Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for decades recommended striking the country’s missile capabilities and also aiming for command centers, such that the regime would be unable to coordinate internally and protesters could reemerge without fear. According to another former intelligence official, Trump’s action must convince the IRGC that it has just three options: change voluntarily, be changed by protesters, or be changed by Donald Trump.

The Islamic Republic may have prevailed in this latest battle, but it is destined to lose the war against its own society. The medium-term bet on who will prevail between an 86-year-old dictator and his young society is clear. Khamenei will soon be vanquished by time, and 47 years of the Islamic Republic’s hard power will eventually be defeated by the soft power of a 2,500-year-old nation that wants to reclaim its proud history.

Trump appears relaxed about the fate of Iran. Yet the machinery of war is already in motion: The USS Abraham Lincoln, an aircraft carrier, is reportedly en route to the Middle East. Given their violent history with Trump, Iran’s leaders know they cannot rest easily.

After Trump’s first term, one of his Cabinet secretaries reportedly quipped that whereas Henry Kissinger had cultivated the “madman theory” to convince adversaries of President Richard Nixon’s volatile unpredictability, Trump’s version was unintentional.

With Nixon, it was a strategy, the former official said. With Trump, all foreign leaders had to do was watch CNN.</div>

In this episode of Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel confronts the growing crisis around AI-generated sexual abuse and the culture of impunity enabling it. He examines how Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok is being used to create and circulate nonconsensual sexualized images often targeting women. Warzel lays out why this moment represents a red line for the internet: It is a test of whether society will tolerate tools that silence women through humiliation and intimidation under the guise of free speech.

Warzel is then joined by The Atlantic’s Sophie Gilbert, the author of Girl on Girl, for a conversation about how misogyny has been a constant throughline in the history of internet innovation, from Facebook to YouTube. Warzel and Gilbert discuss today’s AI-powered exploitation and explore how new technologies repeatedly repackage old abuses at greater scale and speed. They discuss why this wave of hostility feels so intense right now, how backlash politics and platform design reinforce one another, and what is at stake if lawmakers, companies, and the public fail to draw a red line with Elon Musk’s Grok.

A note from Charlie Warzel: On Wednesday—after this episode was recorded and after The Atlantic published its article on the Grok undressing scandal—X’s Safety account posted an update noting that the company had “implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.” It also noted: “Image creation and the ability to edit images via the [@]Grok account on X are now only available to paid subscribers globally.”

I reached out to X to ask if this update was different from the changes it had made to the feature that were rolled out last week. I asked if Grok was now unable to generate bikini images for any user. X’s media strategy lead, Rosemarie Esposito, did not respond to our request for comment.

As of this writing, it is unclear if the safeguards are always working. In some cases, Grok seems to be unable to generate bikini images. However, some users are still posting images on X that suggest they can still prompt the chatbot to do so.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Sophie Gilbert: It is about power. It’s about asserting that in certain spaces, at least online, women are not equal human beings. They will always be seen as nonhuman objects. Any time they have ways of speaking or voicing things, they will be

essentially silenced, they’ll be driven out of certain platforms, they’ll be made to feel unwelcome, they’ll be shamed in lots of ways and humiliated.

Charlie Warzel: Welcome back to Galaxy Brain. I am your host, Charlie Warzel. Last week, I offered up a little bit of a rant at the top about Elon Musk and Grok and the chatbots’ undressing spree. And it turns out, I’m not done talking about that one. Today’s episode is going to be about the ways in which technology has shaped a culture that’s been increasingly hostile to women online and elsewhere.

I’m going to be joined by my colleague Sophie Gilbert, who writes extensively about culture and the ways that it talks about and influences and shapes women and our perceptions of women. She’s the author of a fantastic book called Girl on Girl, which traces how pop culture has turned a generation of women against themselves. We’re going to be talking about the Grok stuff, but also the ways that these tech platforms have this rich history of exposing women and why it’s become so popular to think about women as these nonhuman objects online, how AI is encouraging this, and what women are supposed to do in response. But before we get to Sophie, I wanted to address the Grok issue head on again. I remain truly, incandescently mad about this, about all of it.

Here is a sentence that is true. For more than a week, beginning late last month, anyone could go online and use a tool—owned and promoted by the world’s richest man—to modify a picture of basically any person, even a child, especially women, and undress them.

At the moment, Elon Musk seems to be not only getting away with this, but reveling in it.

Here’s where I need to note that xAI says it’s prohibited the sexualization of children in its acceptable-use policy. A post earlier this month from the X safety team states that the platform removes illegal content, including child-sex-abuse material, and it works with law enforcement as needed. The company said late last week that it limited image generation with Grok and editing to paying subscribers. Now, this is disturbing in its own right, because Musk and xAI are essentially marketing nonconsensual sexual images as a paid feature of the platform. But X users have been able to get around even this very low bar of moderation using the “edit image” button that appears on every image uploaded to the platform, or by going to Grok’s stand-alone app and creating images that way.

To be clear, the deluge of people online, anonymous trolls saying @Grok put her into a bikini, et cetera—that’s subsided slightly. But on subreddits and on these backwater message boards, I can tell you, personally, that I’ve seen creeps strategizing and sharing tactics for the best ways to get around these safeguards and to create realistic pornographic images of women.

The problem continues. Musk himself has said that he is quote, “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.” He’s talking about images of children. Now, he might not be aware of it, but as my colleague Matteo Wong has shared with me, there are investigators who look at this stuff, who have found Grok-generated images on the dark web that clear the bar for child-sexual-abuse material. It is out there. To say nothing of the harassment that’s gone on in broad daylight on X with people undressing women and public figures.

And so I can’t stop thinking about this. Now there’s starting to be a little bit of pressure from governments around the world. Government bodies in the U.K., India, and the European Union have said that they’re trying to investigate X. Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked access to Grok. In the U.S., though, the response has been a lot different. This week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth touted a partnership publicly between the military and xAI to use Grok in war-fighting capabilities.

Meanwhile, the United States State Department has appeared to threaten the United Kingdom over their probe into Elon Musk’s app. Senator Ted Cruz, a co-sponsor of the Take It Down Act—which establishes criminal penalties for the sharing of nonconsensual, intimate images, real or AI-generated, on social media—wrote on X last week that Grok-generated images that were “unacceptable and a clear violation of the law.” On Monday, Cruz posted a photo on X of him with his arm around Elon Musk. The caption said, “Always great seeing this guy!” Rocket emoji.

Make no mistake: This is a part of a crisis of impunity that goes well beyond X or Elon Musk. This is the result of politicians, despots, and CEOs just bowing and capitulating to Donald Trump. A financial grift and speculation running rampant in sectors like cryptocurrency and meme stocks. A braggadocious, get-the-bag ethos that has no room for shame or greed. Of Musk realizing that his wealth insulates him from financial consequences of all kinds. It’s cynical. It’s cowardly. It is cancerous to the social fabric.

I can’t know what is in the heart of these CEOs or these politicians or the employees of the companies that are refusing to comment on the fact that they’ve invested in a company that has weaponized and viralized abusive, suggestive, sexual material. But I feel confident in saying that their silence on this issue is due to a hope that if they’re quiet, everyone will just move on. It’s a strategy on today’s internet among people with power to just bank on a culture in which people have given up demanding consequences.

And we just cannot allow that to happen. Because this is a line-in-the-sand moment for the internet—but also for us culturally. This is not, as I said last week, a partisan issue. This is not, as Elon Musk would have you think, a free-speech-maximalist issue. It is, however, a free-speech issue in that this tool is being used to silence women through intimidation.

The Grok scandal it is just so awful, so egregious, that it offers a direct opportunity to address this crisis of impunity, head on. This is a moment in which people with power, or people who can exert pressure—the Apples and Googles of the world, our politicians, other people in Silicon Valley—this is a moment when they should demand accountability for this. Elon Musk should wear this.

The stakes could not be any higher. Because if there is no red line around AI-generated sexual-abuse material, there’s no red line.

And so joining me now is Sophie Gilbert, who can speak to, in many ways, the other side of this. The consequences and what all of this horrible culture of misogyny is doing to women online. Here’s Sophie.

Gilbert: Charlie, hi. Thank you so much for having me.

Warzel: I’m sorry to talk to you under these circumstances, but it’s a delight regardless of what we’re about to get into. And on that note, I did want to start with the news. Which, it’s been a pretty horrific few months, even by internet and 2020s standards, in terms of the blatant, flagrant misogyny that is out there.

We have the Grok-undressing stuff; I just talked about in the beginning, here, of the episode. We have the Epstein files coming to light. The vilification on the right of Renee Good in Minneapolis. There’s a lot more, which you’ve been writing about—including the president calling a reporter “Piggy.” What has been your reaction to the volume of this really ugly misogyny manifesting right now?

Gilbert: God. I just think, like—I used to be a TV critic, not to be glib. I used to write about culture. I mean, through a very, you know, lens of gender. I mean, I still write about culture, but because I think and write so much about gender dynamics and misogyny, of course, and women. God, there’s been a lot. There’s really been a lot. There’s been a lot of kind of stories to cover, of things to respond to. It feels like everything is peaking. I don’t know if this is actually the peak, or if we have a way to go. But I mean, one thing, I think, is that so much of our culture has sort of learned from, and is responding to, the example of the president. Who is not, I would say, the most decent person when it comes to talking, thinking about, talking to, treating women.

Warzel: I think that’s well documented. Yes.

Gilbert: Well documented; yeah. I’m wondering, will I always check in? But obviously, his example, I think, has had a real profound effect on the culture. I feel like it’s enabled a lot of people to be much more honest about how they feel about women. I wrote this in one of my pieces last year, but it did feel like, for a while, that sexism and misogyny were not generally acceptable in public discourse. They were frowned upon. I mean, you would get fired as someone in the workplace if you said something misogynistic or sexist. You would, you know, have an outcry, public outcry, if you tweeted something or said something publicly to that, in that line. And now, it’s just open season. I don’t know if it’s, like, the Overton window being broadened. Or it just feels like there is so much license now for people to say the most outrageous, the most indecent, the most horrific things.

Warzel: Do you feel like a lot of that is a direct backlash? Some people frame the Trump years, the Trump election in 2016, as a backlash to the historic election of a Black president. This idea that we are constantly ping-ponging back and forth in this very extreme way to the thing that happened before. Do you see this as—I know you just referenced Trump now—do you see it as also a reflexive reaction in the culture to the #MeToo stuff?

Gilbert: Yeah, definitely. I wrote about this a little bit in my book. I wrote a book about the pop culture basically of the 1990s and the 2000s, and the ways in which it presented women and the big influence of porn on popular culture. And so much of the pattern of that period of time is: progress backlash, progress backlash, progress backlash. I mean, Susan Faludi, I think, wrote this in Backlash that any time women are perceived to be making strides—in terms of status, in terms of equality—there is a profound backlash to that in the culture. And I think certainly, Trump himself was manifesting as a reaction to a lot. And then obviously after #MeToo, you had this real pushback. And then after what happened in 2020—with the George Floyd protests and sort of sustained efforts on the part of lots of people to build a more equitable culture—there was obviously a backlash to that too.

So it just feels like everything constantly is kind of reverberating back and forth, back and forth.

Warzel: Is that why … there was a line that struck me in the piece you wrote after Trump called a reporter “Piggy.” It said, “Over the last few weeks, it feels like we’re revisiting the same characters over and over, with no consequences and no forward momentum.” Is that part of it, or is that a different dynamic?

Gilbert: No. I mean, there are definitely the main characters, right? Like, there’s Trump; there’s Elon Musk; there’s [Robert F. Kennedy] Jr. I mean, so many of these people just keep coming up in the news with reference to these kinds of stories. And I think in part that’s because of who they are, and how they behave, and what they’re doing. And the example that they set, as well.

Warzel: Your book, which you just mentioned, is fabulous. And it picks at the ways in which so much of this is baked into our culture. Like, for example, sexual objectification is normalized and kind of branded in the fashion industry, and they profit off of all that. And then it emanates also, you know, into every other corner of popular culture there. I’d love to—in part because of what’s happening with Musk and Grok—love to trace the role that technology is playing in all of this. Do you feel it’s a similar kind of dynamic to what you were writing about in the book? Because you and I were talking a little bit before this, and you told me that you’re thinking about how this is coded in from the beginning on the tech platforms. And I wanted you to expand on that. How can we start to just trace this through some of these big tech platforms?

Gilbert: Yeah. I mean, this was one of the things that really surprised me the most in my research. So many of our major tech platforms that are really incorporated into our daily lives were built on the exposure of women; on the desire to look at sexualized pictures of women. I mean, I can talk about this a bit more in a minute, but if you go way back to the ’90s, when the internet was really first becoming a force of presence in people’s lives, the first real viral video was Pamela Anderson’s sex tape, which was obviously stolen. It was a private video made with her and her husband on her honeymoon. It was stolen from their home. It was released without her consent. Was broadcast on the internet, sold as VHS. It became just such a moment of mass-media consumption in a time when I think no one really understood what was happening.

So it’s just—it’s in the history of our technology. I mean, before we had Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg created Facemash, which was a site where people could compare the relative hotness of women at Harvard. I mean, Google Images was created because Jennifer Lopez wore a very low-cut Versace dress to the Grammys, and there was so much unprecedented traffic. And there was no way to easily provide people with images. So that was created as a response.

Gilbert: Yeah. So it’s basically like—name a tech platform in there. It has been created because someone, somewhere, wanted to ogle women. And it’s not that that’s a bad thing, per se. It’s just that it’s part of the coding. It’s part of the texture of why the internet was made, and what people have always wanted to use it for. I think what you see, and what we’re seeing now with Grok, is that whenever there’s a leap forward in terms of technology, the first thing people use it for seems to be sex. And often sexual exploitation as well.

Warzel: Well, I’ve done previously, in past decades, stories about technology and the porn industry, right? And the porn industry has the similar part—or maybe slightly the flip side of that dynamic is that the porn industry is also very good at seeking out. Whether it’s VHS, or whether it is some of the internet stuff, some of the even just like the switch posts. You know, the Pamela Anderson sex tape, to this idea of amateur porn. Then artificial intelligence and VR goggles, and things like that. Like the industry itself—not the nonconsensual part of it, but the bought-and-paid-for part of the industry has always been excellent at leveraging that and figuring out new, novel ways of distribution.

Gilbert: Yeah, one of the facts that really blew my mind was learning that in the mid-’70s, when VHS technology was first introduced, up to 75 percent of the tapes being made, really the first day of VHS being available, were pornographic. The early adopters were just that fast to see what VHS would be used for.

Warzel: One thing that I was looking at, reading in your book, that was just so striking—post all of this Grok stuff, and this idea of the internet just being flooded at the moment with all this AI-generated nonconsensual sexualized imagery. Is the description from, and you’re just describing, a scene from the ’90s teenage-sex comedy American Pie in which one of the characters has an exchange student over and sets up a webcam. And then, you know, like runs over to his friend’s house to basically watch her, surveil her in his room, and then broadcast that to the whole school or whatever. This idea that—you know, she’s basically shamed. She’s an exchange student, shamed to go back to her own country. Where the main character who did this is just, you know, kind of “boys will be boys’ed” out of it.

And I was just so struck by the way in which, I mean, American Pie was just like a canonical film of the late ’90s, early 2000s. Just so popular in our culture. And yet right there is this idea of, I don’t know if it’s exactly revenge porn, but really horrible, nonconsensual broadcasted imagery. Over the internet. The fact that these tools, like, should be used for this type of spying—or even if not, it’s kind of funny. And that there really are no consequences for doing so. Can you just tell me a little bit about how you feel popular culture has dealt with this rise of the broadcasting of women, the ogling of women, in this? And sort of made it acceptable for people to treat women in this way?

Gilbert: Yeah; I mean, I think one of the things that happens is that technology is so fast that we don’t, as a society—even in terms of thinking about our laws or our structures or our ethical frameworks—we don’t have ways to respond as quickly as technology arrives. So when things like webcams, and the ability to stream video, or the ability to furtively take pictures of people without their knowledge … when things like that arrive, it takes us a while to sort of build ethical frameworks in terms of usage. So I think that example in American Pie is so interesting because you see this new technology. You see it as a story in a film, but we didn’t have the language, right, to say nonconsensual porn. Or, I mean—we don’t have the words necessarily to accurately describe what’s going on. And I think that it always takes a while for us to catch up.

So with something like—another thing I write about in my book is the way that photographers, paparazzi photographers in the 2000s, would lie down on the ground to take pictures of women’s skirts. Basically to try and capture, catch them, photograph them without underwear. And now I would call that nonconsensual porn, of course. But back then, it was called upskirt. Like, upskirt photography; upskirting. Because we didn’t yet … we hadn’t figured out the right way of thinking about what it actually was, what it actually meant. And that’s why I think language is so important. And it’s why something like what’s happening on Grok right now is so dispiriting to me. Because it’s like: We’ve already done it. We’ve already learned the lesson. We’ve already decided as a culture that this is not something that we want to participate in. That it’s wrong; that it profoundly hurts and traumatizes women. And yet new technology comes along, a new way of doing it. And everyone kind of forgets everything that we’ve set forward.

Warzel: Do you think it’s that, or do you think it is a backlash, again, in this way? Or people trying to reclaim it, right? Something that I have noticed in the dynamic—and other people have noticed, of course—of what’s happening with the Grok stuff is it’s so clearly all about power, right? Like, it’s this idea of immediate ritualized, viralized shame and humiliation. And it feels to me almost less like we haven’t learned those lessons, and more like a bunch of people saying like, “You know, we want to go back.”

Gilbert: Yeah, I think you’re 100 percent right. It is about power. It’s about asserting that in certain spaces, at least online, women are not equal human beings. They will always be seen as nonhuman objects. Anytime they have ways of speaking or voicing things, they will be essentially silenced. They’ll be driven out of certain platforms; they’ll be made to feel unwelcome; they’ll be shamed in lots of ways, and humiliated. And it’s very much about underscoring the idea that, again—I mean, it’s sort of taking away our full humanity, in a way that I find, again, horrifying in so many ways. It’s not even about making sexual material. It’s about making sexual material of women in a way that is trying to dehumanize them and objectify them, but also to sort of push them out of public life.

Warzel: This may seem like an obvious question, given that we’re talking about Grok right now, but how are you thinking about how AI is supercharging this, or how it’s changing the dynamics? Obviously, it’s allowing it to happen so much more quickly. It’s allowing there to be, I guess, a level of crude and awful imagination in the scenarios that one can be put in. But yeah, how do you see AI changing and pushing this dynamic forward?

Gilbert: There are so many different elements of AI that I find disconcerting. I think one is the way that it just affirms whatever the user wants to do. It’s sort of, it’s very sycophantic. It’s very obsequious. It will try and keep users engaged by really making them feel good about themselves and what they’re doing. There’s not a lot of pushback. And in terms of a lot of the relationships that are being set up, in terms of people’s emotional and intimate relationships with chatbots … it’s not normal to have that kind of relationship. You don’t have that kind of relationship with a human being. With any kind of human being, there’s friction, there’s pushback. There’s a two-way power dynamic. It’s not the person in the relationships, let’s say the man in the relationship, being constantly affirmed, constantly catered to, constantly gratified in any way that he might want. And so I think setting up that dynamic in terms of: What are people’s expectations? How are they being set up to have real human relationships, in real life? That’s one thing that I find troubling.

But there’s also, I mean, you could look at the way that I think when ChatGPT, a version of ChatGPT, was launched in 2024, and it had this female voice that was modeled after Scarlett Johansson because she declined to let them use her. Yeah, allegedly. I’m sorry. Yeah.

Warzel: Allegedly, sounded exactly like Scarlett Johansson. Scarlett Johansson thought that it sounded like Scarlett Johansson. She was very pissed off. Allegedly, allegedly.

Gilbert: But it’s very feminine coded, right? And so you have these assistants. I think this comes back to the Siri discourse, when Siri was first launched. And she, of course, had a female voice. When, you know, Alexa obviously has a woman’s name. Are we affirming these dynamics where women take care of men, by coding that into the platforms that we use? It certainly seems so.

Warzel: Something I wanted to ask you about was the rise of OnlyFans. Obviously, porn—we’ve talked about it. And through your work, there is this kind of … it always is coming back to porn. In terms of roles and expectations for women, and the way that it’s infusing in culture.

OnlyFans has been a really interesting revolution in adult content in that, you know, when I was reporting on the adult industry a little bit in the ’00s, or the 2010s rather, it felt like nothing was ever going to take down those tube sites. Those free tube sites that were, you know, squeezing production companies; also, you know, uploading a lot of stuff that hadn’t been verified, from performers that was quote unquote “amateur” content.

A lot of big issues. And also sort of a strange leviathan monopoly on the industry that was driving, you know, the money that they—that performers—could make way down. OnlyFans comes along; there’s a sort of democratization element and influencing element therein. And a lot of people have made great amounts of money on that. There’s been a feeling from certain people of, you know, an empowerment in terms of this type of sex work.

And yet, it also feels to me like it has added this influencer culture onto it, right? There are so many elements of influencer interaction with fans that the platform has set up. That I think, as you said, also set up these relationships. How have you been watching the rise of OnlyFans and thinking about it in terms of all this culture?

Gilbert: I find it so fascinating. In so many ways, I think the first way is thinking culturally. I’m always thinking about, like, how does culture inform desire? How does culture teach us things that we’re attracted to, or things that are acceptable, or things that we fantasize about? And when you look at a lot of porn from the ’90s and the 2000s, the women in those movies were a very narrow range of beauty. They were sort of mostly young, mostly thin, mostly blonde. Like, I’m not gonna go any more descriptive than that. But it was quite a narrow, I would say, physicality. And then OnlyFans comes along, and it really broadens, I think, the scope of just the kinds of desire that people felt licensed in having. I’m thinking about age. Like, a lot of the celebrities who have made names for themselves on OnlyFans, and who have really made significant amounts of money, are in their 50s. Which seems interesting to me, because in mainstream culture, those kinds of women are not typically portrayed as desirable, right? Like you’re in your 20s and your 30s, or in your 40s if you’ve had a good facelift.

But women in their 50s are not typically sex symbols in Hollywood. So suddenly you have this platform that is really … I don’t know, it’s sort of allowing a much broader definition of what is desirable in mainstream culture. And so that, to me, is fascinating and positive in lots of ways. I think OnlyFans has certainly made things a lot safer for sex workers in many ways. But again, I mean, in terms of what I was talking about with AI and chatbots, it’s the same kind of one-sided dynamic. Where you have men having these very intimate, and often parasocial, but very, very intimate and emotional relationships with women who are performing for them for money. It’s not coming from an honest place of connection. It’s coming from a place of sort of a one-sided power dynamic, where women perform and cater to men. And so while it’s fascinating in so many ways, I do think it’s affirming the same kinds of patterns that we see more and more in technology.

Warzel: I’ve had to go and look in some of these backwater areas for the reporting on the Grok stuff, but also just in general with AI-driven sexualized images, or what have you. And something that I’ve seen in some of these communities—I mean, apart from the awfulness—is these confessional posts from men who are saying, Guys, I’m kind of ruined by this. Right? This is like, I can generate my fantasy and my dream on demand now, and then tweak it in all these different ways and do it again and again and again. And I don’t feel anything when I look at women. Or something like that. Like, I’ve seen numerous confessional posts in that regard. And I think about that with the culture. And I don’t know how much you know about this—but there was a very long Harper’s story about this, but this culture of “gooning” and this idea of sensory overload. Marathon sessions of self-pleasuring and being bombarded by porn of all kinds. Where do you think this is all headed? You mentioned peaking in terms of, like, misogynist behavior. This is obviously a different category, but where do you feel like all this is headed?

Gilbert: Yeah. It seems so much like it’s an addiction. I was also looking at the Reddit page for Grok today, just to briefly see what people were talking about.

Gilbert: I saw—no, no, no, it’s okay. But you know, there are posts by women saying, “I’ve discovered that my boyfriend has created undressed images of people who we know. Women who we know in real life.” Like, “He says he can’t help it; it’s a compulsion.” But you know, that’s one real-world consequence.

I have talked a lot over the past year about how the manosphere is setting men up for profound failure. Like, if you cannot see women as equal human beings, you cannot relate to them on a level of basic equality. No one is going to want to be in your life. No one is going to want to have an intimate, personal relationship with you. And we know that men need marriage and meaningful relationships as a health matter. Like, men live longer when they’re married. They’re happier when they’re married; they get less diseases when they’re married. That kind of emotional stability has a profound public-health impact. And so things like this, they are setting men up for these lives of profound loneliness. And, you know, not to sort of be like, What about the men? But it is an interesting aspect of it that I think can get lost sometimes when we’re talking about, rightfully, how awful and humiliating this is for the women involved. But like, it works both ways.

Warzel: To that point, I don’t want to focus on the men in all of this, but do you think that that’s a way, like a crack, in which somebody—like some of this can just be begun to be pulled a bit apart? I think so much about what the manosphere and a lot of these, you know, hypermasculine influencers are trying to sell, right? Which is this idea that someone’s putting something over on you, right? Like, you’re either being exploited by feminism, or whatever, you’re being subjected to something by some outside force, right? And this is a way to, like, push against it. Get a little bit of autonomy; be a man; do whatever. I feel like there’s a reverse version of that with this, right? Which is like, All of these people are setting you up. Like a reverse Alex Jones, right? Like, All these people are setting you up for this failure. They’re exploiting you to sell creatine powder, or whatever it is. And that is a way in which you can actually break free on this. Like, people are trying to subjugate you for profit, because they’re influencers, because there’s a reason to, or an intentional thing to gain. Do you feel like that is a possible way to switch the dynamic?

Gilbert: Yeah. I think it’s a way to frame it that gets people to pay attention. Certainly, maybe a different kind of person than someone who might read our stories at The Atlantic and be profoundly influenced.

Warzel: I’m always trying to figure out how to talk to the manosphere. Always, you know, direct to camera.

Gilbert: I think it is an argument that is both valid and may have more of an impact. I think the thing that I really am caught on, right now, is the thing that you and our colleague Matteo Wong wrote about. Which is that this is our red-line moment. Like, if we cannot agree that this is something that we will not do as a culture, there is no coming back from it. And particularly, I was thinking lot about Elon Musk’s comments when my great home country of Great Britain threatened—not even threatened—but there was the specter of possibly X being taken offline. And he responded that it would be the suppression of free speech.

And I was thinking about how we’ve always, as a culture, agreed—we’ve been unanimous on this—that there are certain kinds of speech that we will suppress. And that speech is, you know, child-sexual-abuse material. That is the kind of speech that we will not tolerate in society. We do not allow it. We legislate very strongly against it. There are so many taboos against it. It is something that is really profoundly frowned upon, and we’ve always agreed on that. So why now has it become something that suddenly people—politicians in my country—are saying might be protected free speech? Like, what has changed? I really just am so much in alignment with your argument that there’s sort of no coming back if we can’t draw this line now, and set up our boundaries.

Warzel: What has changed, at the risk of sounding extremely dumb and obvious. But, you know… a healthy society stops this. We are not stopping this. So what has changed? Is it just simply, we’re just not a healthy society? Or … what’s changed that this is a red line that people seem okay crossing, as long as they’re not, you know, they don’t have to wear it? You know, just as long as it just passes.

Gilbert: Yeah. There’s such cognitive dissonance in being alive right now in this moment of like, Epstein freakout, but also post–kind of QAnon, “save the children.” And suddenly people ... it’s really hard to make sense of. I think the thing that has changed is Elon Musk. And the money that he has, and the power that he has, and the position that he has. And the way that he has taken over X—in a way where it still operates just about enough like the traditional social-media site that it once was, that people feel like it might be, but it’s not anymore. It’s really 4chan with a couple of normies. Like, it’s been so profoundly radicalized. It’s just become a cesspool in a way that I think people who have stayed on it have become inured to. And it’s sort of harder to shock them, I think. And that has profoundly affected the people who are still on the platform, and the ramifications are going to affect all of us.

Warzel: I just did, at the front of this, a bit of a monologue about this moment. The red-line moment; the line in the sand. I think the hope always, with our work, when we’re talking about the culture or the technologies, and how they push people to a certain, they force cultural change in some way.

If a lawmaker—if someone in power—is listening to this, what’s your message for them on all this right now?

Gilbert: I would say: This is such an easy one for you. It’s so straightforward. Morally, it’s so simple. Ethically, it’s so simple. It’s so straightforward. If you can be the person who will take a stand, you will have so many people behind you. I know it’s hard, because Musk has money, and Musk has power, and money buys you more power. But this is very straightforward, and it’s not something that the public at large are divided on. And if you think that the public are divided, it’s possibly because you’ve spent too much time on X.

Warzel: I couldn’t have said it better myself. Sophie Gilbert, thank you for coming on to talk about the world’s most depressing stuff. I think the only way though to go forward is to just address it head on. So the only way out is through. And thank you for helping me get through.

Gilbert: Thank you for your piece. I know; I’m sorry that you’ve already spoken about it, but I wanted to bring it up, because it’s such a good piece and everyone should read it. And I think this kind of moral clarity right now is hard to come by and very important.

Warzel: Wonderful. Sophie, thanks so much.

Novelists committed to depicting contemporary life face an unprecedented challenge in this moment: How can they do so in a way that keeps readers interested when so much of the average person’s time is spent scrolling across a variety of screens?

First, here are four new stories from The Atlantic’s Books section:

Looking at the internet doesn’t lend itself easily to depiction in prose, and yet anyone writing about the 21st century has no choice but to address it. This doesn’t change the fact that describing someone browsing the web or scrolling without end can be mind-numbing. Different novelists have approached this fresh challenge in multiple ways: by adopting the unique vernacular or fragmented form of a social-media feed, for instance, or by showing a protagonist falling deep into a rabbit hole.

In her debut novel, Lost Lambs, Madeline Cash, a co-founder of the literary magazine Forever, has attempted to write an internet-mediated story that feels more grounded in the real world than what has come before—in large part by adopting the classic form of the family drama. She uses this approach to show not only what it looks like for a person to spend a lot of their time online, Gideon Leek wrote this week in The Atlantic, but also what that does to a person—and to their relationships. In Lost Lambs, every member of the Flynn family is influenced by their devices in a different way: The parents, Bud and Catherine, have embarked on an experiment with nonmonogamy, an idea that Catherine gets from watching a Real Housewives spin-off set in Baghdad. Meanwhile, their daughter Louise has fallen in love with an Islamic-fundamentalist boyfriend she met online in a chatroom for middle children. “Yourstruly” (the screen name by which she knows him) has taught her how to make a bomb, which she’s been assembling in her backyard treehouse. “They don’t cover this sort of thing in parenting books,” Bud remarks, confounded.

The internet can do scary things to a person, such as encouraging violence or conspiracism. Leek points out that in Cash’s novel, however, the stakes seem oddly low because nothing bad really happens. In the logic of the family novel, betrayals and mistakes should lead to a “cascade of consequences,” he writes; instead, “Cash flinches.” But perhaps what Cash is doing is simply capturing something very real about the internet. It’s a unique place that intermingles the worst of humanity with absolute mundanity—somewhere you can have a relationship with a self-professed militant that ends before anything too grave occurs offline. In Cash’s novel, the characters, just like many real people, simply get lucky: The worst doesn’t occur—and what happens online, for the most part, stays there. Maybe the internet is not just changing society, but also tweaking the rules that govern what a family novel is supposed to be.

The Unhappy Literary Families of the Internet Age

Fiction about online life tends to mimic its dull repetition. A debut novel doesn’t quite succeed in raising the stakes—but it points the way forward.

The title of Yi’s strange and appealing 2023 novel refers to, as the unnamed narrator puts it, “a type of fanfiction where the protagonist was called Y/N or ‘your name.’” The narrator attends a K-pop show in Berlin and becomes obsessed with the band’s youngest member, the 20-year-old Moon: “a gift forever in the moment of being handed over,” Yi writes. As the narrator’s fixation grows, she begins writing Y/N fan fiction about Moon, much of which is reproduced in the novel. When Moon abruptly retires, the narrator goes to Korea to find him. Some readers might expect an indictment of fan fiction and celebrity culture; Yi swerves, though, and creates a more searching and subversive tale of love, connection, and art. Even after the narrator finds Moon, her motives remain obscure. The point of her fantasy seems to be the fantasy itself.  — Erin Somers

From our list: Six books you can get lost in

📚  How to Commit a Postcolonial Murder, by Nina McConigley

📚 The Elements of Power, by Nicolas Niarchos

The Pitt Is a Brilliant Portrait of American Failure

Some might call The Pitt preachy. (A recent Vulture review argued that the show’s righteousness has become “distractingly pedantic, even patronizing,” as though considering real-world flash points through a humanizing lens was wholly new for television rather than embedded in its history: Remember Maude’s abortion? Rose’s Golden Girls HIV test?) I’d argue, rather, that The Pitt has an emphatic moral clarity that feels awkward only because we haven’t seen it for so long. It refuses to both-sides issues that it considers straightforward. Should you vaccinate your children against measles? Yes, The Pitt says, offering up a child with not just spots all over his body but also acute inflammation in his brain and spinal cord. The show is set in the emergency room, where society’s problems become inescapable, where people who have fallen through the cracks land. In an era of relentlessly absurd and wealth-washed TV, The Pitt’s realism, its defiant lack of glamour, is bracing.

Care to extend that line of reasoning to humans? Do pesticides shorten our lifespans?

Perhaps it increases cancer rates?  if it&#39;s only 2-3% it&#39;s within margin of error and we&#39;ll never confirm it. If it&#39;s 13% it&#39;ll take 30+ years because the industry is probably around as powerful as tobacco; although the USA is at it&#39;s most corrupt, other places could figure it out but they already avoided the problem so why would they invest in such efforts?

Not sure how fishing fleets roaming the oceans impacted the lake fish, but if you say so ...

They have to feed 1.2 billion people. PER CAPITA fishing volume the US captures more ocean fish than China. The ocean is a shared resource so if you want to enforce some BS law of how much fish can be caught. Other countries should per capita reduce their fish capture. Here are the biggest offenders per capita:Top Countries by Capture Fisheries Volume Per CapitaBased on 2026 projections and recent FAO reporting cycles, the following nations produce the highest volume of wild-caught fish per resident:

I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about and thepiratebay is where I download all my moviesIt&#39;s a well-known public torrent tracker, so companies that monitor piracy set up their own seedboxes (with permission from the rightsholders for the content they&#39;re sharing, which is an important part).  They monitor the IP addresses of users attempting to connect and then they send violation notices to the ISP, which are in turn supposed to pass them on to their respective customers.If Starlink told you to cut it out when you forgot to fire up your VPN, they probably did receive a notice.

The Pirate Bay doesn&#39;t host any copyrighted content.

I think you&#39;re wrong.  By default ALL works are copyright, even something like this text.  I&#39;m not sure you CAN avoid putting stuff under copyright, though you can use a quite permissive license.

Basically the only things that aren&#39;t copyright these days are things that are so old that the copyright has run out.

Their point is that The Pirate Bay only lists magnet links.  It does not actually provide material to download.  Anna&#39;s Archive actually distributes material.

Now, it&#39;s been more than decade since I ran a &quot;fair sized&quot; OPAC[1], AND I was running a hell of a lot of other things too, not just the OPAC, but as I dimly recall, WorldCat was complied by technical archivists submitting their OPACs in MARC format to them either by request, or by the archivists wishing to reach a wider audience and voluntarily submitting their own MARC records they created. So, unless I&#39;m mistaken and someone please do point that out, this would appear to be yet another case of CDDB [slashdot.org] style profiteering, whereby someone gets others to do the work, not get paid for it, then charges others for the work they didn&#39;t pay for.

I am not denying there is value in compiling the work, but WorldCat appears not to have made it &quot;Transformative&quot; in the sense of conveying a new copyright on their original work. We already know that compilations cannot be copyrighted.

Which brings up another point: Another thing that can&#39;t be copyrighted: AI output. Machines aren&#39;t given copyrights.

I am not repeat not qualified in any sense in Library Science - I done what I waz tolded.  100+ federated collections, somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 million unique holdings)

Sounds like a variant of the journals model: get universities to contribute papers and then charge them for access.

Maybe it’s time for universities to have an open source distributed system for this sort of thing?

To be fair, getting proper sleep states working on linux at least for intel processors was a known issue for a very long time. It did get fixed eventually, but it took years.

Symptoms were notably similar to this nonsense. Have a laptop, hibernate it, it doesn&#39;t go to a proper sleep state and empties the battery.

My experience is that the Sleep and Hibernate features including the &quot;Fast Startup&quot; might work as long as you only have standard hardware and software. As soon as you have something more complex then this could lead to complications requiring you to reboot as soon as you have booted &quot;fresh&quot; or brought up your computer from Sleep or Hibernate because the computer and the connected device has come out of sync with each other.

1) they didn&#39;t use it back then, just heard about someone complaining and2) Suspend-hibernate in Windows didn&#39;t quite work in 1996 either.

Sleep mode in Windows doesn&#39;t work in 2020 either, not even with 5 years of subsequent BIOS, driver, and OS updates.

Not sure if Microsoft is to blame, it could be Dell. But in October I put Debian on the laptop, and now it sleeps like a baby.

Suspend-Hibernate don&#39;t work fully in Windows in 2026 either.

I would not know, so I&#39;ll take your word for it and only add that I&#39;m not surprised.

This is a stupid goalpost. I&#39;m sorry you like a product that currently has a major issue, please let us enjoy our working product.

Side note I never tell anyone that they should use Linux, but Windows zealots have been telling me &quot;it&#39;s really good this time&quot; since 98. It&#39;s a bit similar with Gnome zealots.

...just keep running Windows and eventually it will crash.

Is there even a point for them sticking to the older version? Presumably you do that to avoid getting hit with bleeding-edge bugs. But that doesn&#39;t seem to have helped here.

I guess sticking to the same sub-version maybe helps when Microsoft intentionally breaks something...

Central IT management can&#39;t get the thumbs out of their read end to move forward. They have been sold the idea that Microsoft shall manage all the accounts through Entra and centralized domain controllers at the M$ datacenters. So they have put all their eggs in the Microsoft basket. Imagine what will happen when that basket is dropped. I think I&#39;ll have to change to find a different source of income or at least sustain myself on growing potatoes and carrots.

The majority of the computers at the company I work for is doing that because the central IT department has stated &quot;We have some problems with 24H2&quot;, but they don&#39;t tell what it is and they haven&#39;t even started on 25H2.

The central IT department is also run by a gang of inept youngsters with control issues that only uses that employment to build their CV and move on to higher paid jobs.

How could they fuck up something so basic that&#39;s been working for a decade? Why the need to screw with that code? Or is this a side-effect of them screwing up some other code?

Linux had this problem with certain intel laptops for years after intel updated their sleep states. Though this is many years ago.

The current Windows problem is a regression, as far as I can tell. Was the Linux problem you&#39;re talking about a regression too, or just a feature not yet implemented (for certain hardware)?

I&#39;d blame AI generated code that has changed something essential.

This is more likely about correct management of the sleep state, not &quot;management of sleep state being possible in the first place&quot;.

Did original ATX spec even have sleep states? I recall them coming much later, mostly pushed by intel for laptops.

But ATX-like power management is indeed a requirement for sleep statement management to be possible in the first place, so you could claim it enabled this problem. The issue is that AT couldn&#39;t have sleep states in the first place, making it utterly unsuitable for mo

All my laptops can do a hard shutdown via power-button. Press it for like 5 seconds. It is intended for a completely locked up OS. As the crap that is Win11 has now given me several times. (Win10 on the same hardware never did that.)

I remember when my Compaq Armada 1585DMT lappy, with Windows 95 OEM OSR2, wouldn&#39;t shut down at all. I coudn&#39;t even hard reboot. I had to manually removed its removable battery. My suite mate and I were shocked at the lock up. Hah.

I just press the on/off button for 4-15 seconds until it shuts off via that.

Same. But people apparently do not know that and do not read the manual. That function is intended for a crashed OS and works via an embedded controller, not the main system.

My everyday laptop has no battery at all, and runs from the AC power.

Power cord is so barbarian. Civilized computers have on/off power switches on their backs.

Looks like those WASP and Jewish hobbyist coders of the 1980s did a lot better than the &quot;professional&quot; (careerist) NEETs, nepo babies, and H-1Bs. Maybe someday humanity will learn... well, anything, a single god fucking damned thing. But evidence suggests otherwise.

Pray tell, how is someone Not Engaged In Employment Or Training a professional, or a careerist?

I know you want to throw around some heavy-hitting words, but when you treat them just as random meaningless letters, they don&#39;t actually hit.

We cannot read people&#39;s mind, so we cannot tell if this is about &quot;fear of...&quot; or &quot;stunt to deflect...&quot;.

The Republican Party is actually quite adept at identifying problems.  But when it comes to their ability to actually solve problems, they&#39;re about as useful as passing motorists shouting &quot;Your tire is flat!&quot; while you&#39;re broken down on the side of the road, with nobody actually stopping to help change the tire.

Gas bills will shoot up too because people will switch electric heat to gas.Electric resistance heating has historically been more expensive than gas in most places (with the exception of some cities with extremely cheap electricity).  Now, if you&#39;re talking heat pumps, a situation where heating with gas becomes cheaper is extremely unlikely.

You mean like Ercot? The regional grid operator who allowed people to freeze to death because they didn&#39;t want to deal with pesky regulations or the free market?

The tech companies have been waving around stacks of bills around and saying &quot;please take our money and build some power plants&quot;.  So if Trump says &quot;Tech companies have to pay for power plants&quot;, the tech companies are just going to say &quot;OK&quot;.

The problem here is that he&#39;s failed to do the one thing he is supposed to do: work with congress.  Who could make this happen? Congress. Who does he cooperate with? Nobody.

It&#39;s very clear the U.S. President doesn&#39;t know how ideas are made into laws because despite having a lot of leverage, he has yet to produce any original laws.

This dude always chickens out. The moment he gets pushback from donors he retreats while MAGA folks give him credit. Remember he was gonna &quot;expose Fort Knox&quot;? He was gonna release the Epstein files! Remember that? They can&#39;t even release an edited fake version of it. Recently, to misdirect from the Epstein thing, he made false promises to the Iranian people so they would come out and the regime could slaughter them by the thousands as well as identify who within the regime is against them.

Lets hope he does not take his misdirection away from the Epstein Files so far as to actually invade Greenland. We still need NATO.

&quot;We have to get out from underneath this bureaucratic system that we have in the regional grid operators and we&#39;ve got to allow markets to work,&quot; 
Sounds like that want to be able to avoid rules and regulations and build whatever they want, however they want, and perhaps wherever they want - like with a ballroom. /s

Three days ago, Slate published an article I wrote titled “You’ve Heard About Who ICE Is Recruiting. The Truth Is Far Worse. I’m the Proof.” The article details how I, in an effort to learn more about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s hiring practices, applied for a job at ICE—and ended up getting a job offer. To say that I was surprised would be an understatement: For one, I’m a vocal online critic of ICE and the Trump administration. More saliently, I skipped many of the steps required for the application. It’s a wild story—I’d encourage you to read the whole thing—and one that does not reflect particularly well on ICE or its parent organization: the Department of Homeland Security.

In another time, the exposé of an extraordinarily lax hiring process at an agency tasked with keeping the nation safe would be of bipartisan concern. After all, if ICE is going to arm agents and send them out into America’s streets, it should at least know whom it’s sending. Even supporters of ICE’s mission should want to know that the agency is hiring effective people to carry that mission out. And so under another administration, DHS might look into what happened here, figuring out how my application went through and whether it was a one-off glitch or a widespread, systemic issue.

This administration, however, took a different approach. “This is such a lazy lie. This individual was NEVER offered a job at ICE,” DHS said Wednesday through the administration’s most official communication channel: X (formerly Twitter). “Applicants may receive a Tentative Selection Letter following their initial application and interview that is not a job offer. It just means they are invited to submit information for review, similar to any other applicant.”

DHS is correct that I received an initial offer letter. I also, however, received a final offer, as well as an EOD (Entrance On Duty) date of Sept. 30, according to the application portal. The application listed my medical screening and background check as complete, despite me never filling out paperwork for either. Perhaps, had I pressed “Accept” and moved on with the process, they would have caught the glitch, performed the background check, and demanded those papers. But according to ICE’s own application portal, I was offered a job. (I asked ICE’s media department about all of this before publishing my article, but they did not respond.)

I took a screengrab video of my application status on the ICE portal as of Oct. 3, which you can view below.

There’s a lot going on here, so let’s break it down. The dashboard at the beginning of this video provides an overview of my application process for the position of deportation officer. My tentative offer is marked “Sent,” which—as the mouseover demonstrates—means that I did not acknowledge or accept the offer. The Pre-Employment activities section is marked TBD, which makes sense, since I did not complete any of the pre-employment paperwork. And yet, my final offer status reads “accepted” which, according to the mouseover, means “you accepted the Final Offer and your Entry On Duty date (EOD) date has been set.” And indeed, my onboarding status is EOD: “Your EOD has occurred. Welcome to ICE!”

The point here is that the video of ICE’s own portal confirms my story: The agency offered me a job and gave me a start date without, by its own admission, meeting its own standards for vetting.

Later on, you can see the pre-employment part of the portal that claims my medical and background checks are already complete. If this background check occurred without my participation or knowledge, it missed some massive red flags. I did not mention this in the original article, but Jedeed is a Syrian name: My father immigrated in the 1970s. This fact delayed my military clearance by several months back in 2005. Why, if this background check really happened, did no one think to ask about a possible connection to Syria this time around?

I uploaded the video to X in response to DHS’ “lazy lie” accusation, along with the text “You sure about that?” Seven million impressions, over 100,000 likes, and zero response from the Department of Homeland Security. To be fair, they have their hands full right now; they are very busy brutalizing and detaining people as they attempt to go to doctor’s appointments, throwing flash-bang grenades into cars full of children, and terrorizing the residents of a major American city.

DHS’ response is noteworthy because it comes at a moment when the department is demanding the public’s trust. It’s demanding that we believe that the ICE officer who killed Renee Good was in danger (despite contradictory video evidence), and that he left the event badly injured. More broadly, it’s demanding we believe that ICE agents are doing their work under siege, and that they’re the victims of agression—rather than the perpetrators of it. There are already plenty of reason to be deeply skeptical of any and all of that, but add this to the list: If DHS will lie so brazenly about this story, why would we believe anything else the department’s mouthpieces have to say?

Which brings me to the larger point of Tuesday’s article. We are not simply dealing with a broken hiring system or a lack of training within ICE’s ranks. This sloppy application process, and the DHS’ apathetic, angry response, are just two symptoms of a systemic disregard for the lives and safety of American residents—citizens and noncitizens alike.

The presence of an armed, masked, and improperly vetted force with no oversight and “absolute immunity” (not in a legal sense, but in the sense that the Trump administration’s DOJ will not prosecute them) should concern everyone in the country. What we are dealing with, in Minneapolis and across this nation, is an emergency—and no amount of DHS propaganda can make it go away.

President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act on Thursday to quell protests against the federal occupation of the Twin Cities, a move that would allow him to send in the military over Minnesota’s opposition. Masked immigration officers are currently rampaging through Minneapolis and St. Paul, brutalizing protesters and arresting individuals on the basis of race, drawing widespread opposition from local leaders and communities. The president evidently believes that he can wield the Insurrection Act to suppress their First Amendment rights and impose a kind of military rule on the streets.

But what exactly is this law—and why hasn’t Trump deployed it already? To explain what the Insurrection Act truly authorizes and the risks that come with invoking it, Mark Joseph Stern spoke with Georgetown Law professor Steve Vladeck on this week’s episode of Amicus. Vladeck is an expert on military law and author of the One First Substack. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mark Joseph Stern: Let’s start with the absolute basics: What is the Insurrection Act?

Steve Vladeck: The Insurrection Act is the common—if misleading—name that we’ve given to a series of statutes that trace all the way back to 1792. These statutes carry into force Congress’ constitutional power to provide for the “calling forth of the militia”—and then later, the military—to suppress insurrection, to repel invasion, or “execute the laws of the Union.” The idea was that Congress should be able to allow the president, in very narrow but important circumstances, to use military force as a backup when civilian order and civilian law enforcement has broken down.

So the idea was that it would be used in narrow circumstances, but the language is actually fairly broad. How have presidents invoked it in the past? It seems like, for the most part, they’ve actually been pretty restrained and not used it the way Trump wants to use it.

The history of the Insurrection Act is of pretty responsible usage of a statute that could be interpreted, in a vacuum, as a remarkably broad delegation of power to the president. We’ve had somewhere around 30 invocations of the statute across American history. But the last one was 34 years ago when President George H.W. Bush used it to help send troops in during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.

Although those 30 invocations might have been politically controversial in some cases, they weren’t legally controversial. When President Kennedy sent troops into Mississippi in 1962 to protect James Meredith and the 300 law enforcement officers who were there with him, that was politically controversial because the South didn’t want them. It was not legally controversial because those guys were at perilous risk of being lynched. And Mississippi’s local and state authorities were not exactly helping. So presidents have been responsible historically; they’ve usually had compelling factual bases for invoking the Insurrection Act. It hasn’t been used as a permanent way to deploy troops into our cities. Even the Justice Department, which is not shy about claiming power for the president, has taken a very narrow view of when they can use it.

It sounds like you don’t think that the protests in the Twin Cities right now actually give Trump legitimate grounds to invoke the Insurrection Act.

I don’t think it’s even close. But there is a problem of folks coming to this history fresh, who don’t know the backstory or the historical pedigree here. Because you could read the statute and say: If I squint a little, one protester throwing a rock at an ICE officer is impeding law enforcement. But the Insurrection Act is not about private conduct. It is really about circumstances where the states themselves are unwilling or unable to enforce their laws, or where they’re specifically thwarting federal law enforcement.

Every time the Trump administration points to an example of something bad happening to an ICE officer, the culprits are protesters, not state officials. President Trump can mouth off about the mayor and the governor, but he doesn’t have any specific examples of policies or episodes where state and local governments have been the reasons why ICE has been impeded. If it were otherwise—if one person doing one thing to impede an ICE officer from carrying out their duties was sufficient to justify an invocation of the Insurrection Act—then all protests would trigger the Insurrection Act. And that’s not how we’ve ever understood the Insurrection Act. It would not make any sense with First Amendment values.

Why hasn’t Trump invoked the Insurrection Act yet?

I think there are two reasons. One is political and one is legal. The political reason is that there really still are political obstacles to invoking the Insurrection Act. The president would invite blowback, even from some members of the Republican caucus and Congress. Not many, but given how razor-thin the Republicans’ margin is in the House right now, it wouldn’t take that many votes to really upend all of this.

Then the legal part is that the administration will be sued, and there are probably some folks who are wary that the facts, as they currently stand, make it at least somewhat questionable whether they will win that case. As opposed to a scenario where there’s a more visible unprovoked assault on an ICE officer, or a state official who is directly involved in impeding ICE. I think that might be the pretext they’re looking for.

That’s, of course, my next question: If Trump invokes the law, there will be a legal challenge, and it will go to the Supreme Court. What will that challenge look like, and do you really think it’ll have a chance of prevailing at SCOTUS? Is there also a chance that justices could say they just don’t have authority to overrule the commander-in-chief on this?

I don’t think the court will go quite that far. What I worry about more is a ruling that says that the president’s entitled to a whole lot of deference, not that the courts are powerless. I don’t think John Roberts is going to join an opinion that says the court is powerless about anything. But I do worry about the fight over the facts. In the National Guard cases, the lower courts made a series of factual findings that are inconsistent with what the executive branch said was the factual basis for deploying the troops. Do the courts have the power to do that? That will be the fight.

This is why I think the facts actually are going to matter. If and when the president invokes the Insurrection Act, will there be more of a factual basis than there is here on Friday morning? Does the district court make factual findings that are actually well-supported by the record and would be difficult for the Supreme Court to run away from? The devil’s going to be in the details.

It sounds like you think six of the justices really don’t want to call Donald Trump a liar. But to block the use of the Insurrection Act in the Twin Cities, the Supreme Court would probably have to say that Trump, executive branch officials, and law enforcement officers are not telling the truth. And the court is clearly hesitant to do that.

I could also imagine a universe in which even the factual claims made by the Trump administration, taken at face value, could be held insufficient. The only way the Supreme Court could rule against Trump without second-guessing him is an opinion that says: Even assuming all this is true, that’s still not enough for the Insurrection Act. I have no faith that Justices Kavanaugh, Thomas, Alito, or Gorsuch would join such an opinion. So we’re back to where we are so often in these cases, which is: Where are the chief and Justice Barrett?

I don’t know. I’m heartened about what happened in the National Guard case, which is a sign that they do not just reflexively rule for the Trump administration. But it’s going to depend on just how divorced from reality the administration’s factual arguments are. This is why I think they’ve been waiting for something more than the Renee Good incident, for something more than a couple of suspects resisting an ICE arrest. I think they’re waiting for something that they can pitch plausibly as a completely unprovoked act of violence, or interference by a local or state law enforcement officer.

People often say that Trump does whatever he wants and doesn’t listen to his lawyers, but I don’t think that’s true when it comes to stuff that could reach the Supreme Court. I think he is very cautious when dealing with any issue that’s going to go to the justices.

One hundred percent. There’s a reason why they haven’t invoked the Insurrection Act as we’re sitting here today.

On Jan. 17, 2006, California carried out what would turn out to be the last execution in the Golden State in the next two decades. Clarence Ray Allen was put to death at San Quentin State Prison, having been convicted of three counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances for a crime committed in 1980.

At the time of his crimes, the murder rate in California was at or near an all-time high. There were approximately 14.5 homicides per 100,000 people in the state.

Like many places, California had been in the grip of a suffocating and punitive tough-on-crime politics.

Things are different today. California has learned to live without executions, and it is better off because of it.

Its governor, Gavin Newsom, made his state’s execution pause official when he declared a formal moratorium in 2019. He has led the way in asking citizens of his state to face the death penalty’s manifold injustices.

The state’s death penalty system, Newsom says, “has been, by all measures, a failure. It has discriminated against defendants who are mentally ill, black and brown… It has provided no public safety benefit or value as a deterrent. It has wasted billions of taxpayer dollars. Most of all, the death penalty is absolute. It’s irreversible and irreparable in the event of human error.”

He also voiced strong opposition when, during the first Trump presidency, the administration resumed federal executions. But the governor needs to go further: To cement the status of the death penalty as a relic in the Golden State, Newsom should issue a wholesale commutation of the death sentences of the more than 500 people who could face execution if a Republican wins the governorship in 2026.

Two-thirds of these inmates have been on California’s death row for more than 20 years, and dozens of individuals have been there for more than 40 years.

If Newsom removes the possibility that they would ever face execution, he will deliver the kind of decisive blow against capital punishment that will reverberate across the whole country.

The occasion of the 20th anniversary of his state’s last execution would be a good time to take that step.

But whether he does so or not, one thing that we can learn from California is that stopping executions does not lead to a spike in homicide rates. In fact, after two decades without an execution, homicide rates in that state are at historic lows. In 2024, the rate was, according to the state’s Department of Justice, 4.3 killings per 100,000 people—far below what it was in 2006. It fell again last year.

As Newsom put it on Jan. 8, in his State of the State address:

The last time homicides were this low in Oakland, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was visiting Joan Baez at Santa Rita Jail to commend her on her recent arrest in protest of the Vietnam draft. Killings haven’t been so rare in San Francisco since superstar Marilyn Monroe wed baseball legend Joe DiMaggio at City Hall. And violent deaths in the city of Los Angeles fell to rates not seen since the Beatles played Dodgers Stadium, their penultimate public show.

And just for a little perspective, in 2025 Florida carried out nearly half of all executions in the United States, and California’s  homicide rate was still lower than Florida’s.

The experience in California confirms what many scholars have found. The death penalty is not an effective deterrent and does not make us any safer.

A study of the deterrent effect of the death penalty, published one year before Allen’s execution, offers a good example of their findings. Emory University law professor Joanna Shepherd examined 27 states “where at least one execution occurred during the sample period.” Executions, she found, “deter murder in only six states.”

capital punishment … actually increases murder in thirteen states, more than twice as many as experience deterrence. In eight states, capital punishment has no effect on the murder rate.

Shepherd concluded that “executions have a deterrent effect in only twenty-two percent of states. In contrast, executions induce additional murders in forty-eight percent of states.”

It is true that we cannot say that California’s pause on executions caused its homicide rates to fall. But what we can say is that calling a halt to executions has not made Californians less safe.

Of course, in California the death penalty remains on the books, and some of the prosecutors in the state continue to seek the death penalty. It still pays an extraordinarily high cost in taxpayer dollars for doing so.

Research reported in 2010 showed that California taxpayers have spent more than $4 billion on the death penalty since it was reinstated in 1977. Today, the state spends more than $100 million on death penalty litigation. Over 20 years, that amounts to $2 billion.

And California is not alone among states with the death penalty on the books that have not executed anyone in five, 10, or more years. What happens in places like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Kansas, which I call “death penalty swing states,” will go a long way in determining the fate of capital punishment in this country.

California can set an example for them to follow. That’s why the 20th anniversary of its last execution and any decision Newsom might make about clemency are so important.

As he considers what to do, he might examine what other governors have done in the past.

In the year that California executed Clarence Ray Allen, no governor commuted the sentence or pardoned anyone on death row. Since then, chief executives in such death penalty hot spots as Oklahoma, Georgia, and Texas have exercised their clemency power to spare the lives of people in their state who were condemned to death.

Newsom has the opportunity not only to join them, but to go one step further by issuing the largest mass death penalty clemency in American history. Despite the length of time that his state has gone without an execution, that will not be an easy choice.

However, as he explained in his State of the State address, “The story of California has never been the story of ease. It has been the story of effort, strengthened by trial and enlarged by the people who refuse to give up on one another.”

Twenty years after Clarence Allen’s death, Newsom has the chance to add an important chapter to that story and show that his state never gives up even on those who have been condemned to die.

It’s easy to forget that Texas’ bounty bill, S.B. 8, was once at the epicenter of the nation’s abortion politics. In 2021, Texas passed the law, which allows literally anyone to sue providers and those who aid them any time an abortion is performed after six weeks of pregnancy. The law created a blueprint for other conservative states and was upheld by the Supreme Court later that year—prior to the decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. It also had major impacts: leading clinics to stop offering procedures after six weeks and eventually producing an increase in both births among teenagers and infant mortality across the state. But now, S.B. 8 seems quaint, a relic of 2021—just like reporters discussing the “post-Trump era” or Ben Affleck and J.Lo giving it another try. Texas now enforces a law that bans abortion from fertilization and another, passed just this year, that authorizes suits against anyone who mails, provides, manufactures, or distributes abortion pills. No one seems to need S.B. 8 when more powerful criminal laws are on offer.

But bounty bills are now at the center of a major conflict about whether ban states can censor speech, advocacy, and donations related to abortion. S.B. 8 certainly has ambitions to do just that—its coverage of aiding or abetting explicitly covers “paying for or reimbursing the costs of an abortion,” but it doesn’t stop there. Conservative attorneys general are suing Planned Parenthood for hundreds of millions of dollars for statements comparing the safety record of the abortion pill mifepristone to Tylenol despite the drug’s safety record. South Dakota has its own suit against Mayday Health, a group that provides information about reproductive alternatives, for advertising that people who didn’t want to be pregnant could visit the group’s website.* The S.B. 8 suits won’t just show whether abortion-rights supporters have found a chink in the law’s armor. The litigation will also shape a brewing war about the censorship of abortion-related speech.

The latest fight began in 2022, when two Texas advocacy groups began looking for ways to protect their work helping people access abortion by traveling out of state. Major anti-abortion organizations and individual plaintiffs were already targeting these abortion funds under S.B. 8, and so the funds responded with a barrage of lawsuits in both state and federal court, arguing that S.B. 8 violated the First Amendment by hamstringing how the plaintiffs talked to clients and advocated for reproductive rights.

Then there is money, the lifeblood of abortion funds. The Supreme Court has protected some forms of election spending under the First Amendment, and the abortion funds argue that the same doctrine protects them too. The lawsuits raise other arguments: that the statute is so ambiguous that no one would know what they’re allowed to do, and that the law violates principles of equal protection under the law by creating a special set of procedural rules that apply only to people who use it to sue.

District courts in Chicago and Washington, D.C., dismissed the federal suits on procedural grounds, but it still seems like abortion opponents in Texas are worried about the constitutional questions. That’s why they’ve gone on the offensive. In an ironic twist, in one prominent case now before the Texas Supreme Court, they’re arguing that constitutional challenges to S.B. 8 itself undermine protected speech.

That’s the issue in Weldon v. Lilith Fund. Sadie Weldon, a private citizen, sought to depose the Lilith Fund’s deputy director using a special Texas mechanism called a 202 petition that allows people to investigate a potential claim before filing suit.

Weldon hardly came up with the idea on her own: Jonathan Mitchell, the architect of S.B. 8, had filed at least nine such petitions by the spring of 2024, including against people who traveled out of state for abortion. The Lilith Fund was ready to go, using Weldon’s petition as an opening for another constitutional challenge to S.B. 8. Mitchell then asked the court to dismiss the Lilith Fund’s countersuit, invoking what is called an anti-SLAPP law. These laws, which stand for anti–strategic lawsuit against public participation law, or SLAPP, are meant to stop frivolous lawsuits by powerful companies and individuals looking to silence their critics and suppress protected speech. Texas’ law applies to suits on speech about “matters of public concern.”

Weldon and some other anti-abortion plaintiffs lost on those claims in lower courts, which concluded that the Lilith Fund was trying to make sure that the state was not “enforcing an unconstitutional statute,” not trying to silence anyone. Now Weldon ‘s case is before the Texas Supreme Court, which heard oral argument this week.

Weldon’s case might not be a blockbuster—there’s a chance that it’s moot because she’s given up on her 202 petition—but it’s a reminder that S.B. 8 is back. The law might have killed abortion rights in Texas even before the demise of Roe, but now, it may play a surprising role in establishing that there are limits on silencing speech about abortion, even in the places where it’s a crime.

Correction, Jan. 16, 2026: This article originally misstated that North Dakota was suing Mayday Health. It’s South Dakota.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI&#39;s budget ChatGPT Go subscription tier has migrated to the US, soon to be accompanied by advertising. The company&#39;s free tier will be similarly afflicted.

ChatGPT Go, the company&#39;s cheapest paid offering, has been an option in 171 countries since August and is now available stateside for $8 per month.

&quot;In the coming weeks, we&#39;re also planning to start testing ads in the US for the free and Go tiers, so more people can benefit from our tools with fewer usage limits or without having to pay,&quot; said Fidji Simo, OpenAI&#39;s CEO of applications. &quot;Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise subscriptions will not include ads.&quot;

About 5 percent, or 35 million, of ChatGPT&#39;s weekly active user base as of July 2025 paid for Plus ($20/month) or Pro ($200/month) subscriptions, according to The Information. The company reportedly projects that by 2030 about 8.5 percent of a weekly active user base of roughly 2.6 billion - around 220 million people - will pay for a Plus subscription. With so many non-paying customers, ads may be its only route to financial survival. (That or a government bailout, which the company says won&#39;t happen.)

OpenAI has reportedly committed to spend more than $1 trillion to fuel its quest for the vaguely defined idea of &quot;artificial general intelligence.&quot; The AI giant lost north of $11.5 billion in the third quarter alone, according to numbers Microsoft – a large OpenAI investor – disclosed in its financial filings.

Meanwhile, online advertising is a massive business, contributing more than $74 billion to Google&#39;s revenues and more than $50 billion to Meta&#39;s revenues in the third quarter of 2025 alone. And chatbots like ChatGPT are technically capable of capturing a massive amount of extremely personal data, given that people use them for everything from vibe coding to online companionship to informal therapy.

Simo acknowledged the need to preserve people&#39;s trust in ChatGPT – to the extent that people trust LLMs known for making things up and getting things wrong – and made a number of vague commitments to offer reassurance that their artificial intelligence agent wouldn&#39;t become a mercenary sales agent.

This included a reiteration of the claim that the company&#39;s pursuit of advertising aligns with its mission to ensure AGI – a moving target based on some determination of human intellectual equivalency – &quot;benefits all of humanity.&quot;

Ads, Simo promised, will not influence the answers provided by ChatGPT, will be &quot;optimized based on what&#39;s most helpful to you,&quot; as Simo put it, and will be distinct and clearly labelled.

ChatGPT users under 18, and queries about sensitive topics like health or politics, will be spared from ads, or so it&#39;s claimed.

&quot;We keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers, and we never sell your data to advertisers,&quot; Simo said, adding that users will have the ability to control how their data is used and to disable personalization.

&quot;Selling data&quot; can mean different things in different contexts, but may be disallowed if consent is lacking, depending on the relevant privacy rules. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), it can mean &quot;selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer&#39;s personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.&quot;

Google and Meta have both insisted they don&#39;t sell personal data, but they certainly use it to target their own ads, and their decades of privacy missteps attest to the relevance of those claims.

Miranda Bogen, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology&#39;s AI Governance Lab, argues that even in the absence of data sharing, ad targeting can harm privacy. OpenAI&#39;s shift toward advertising presents risks for the company and its customers, she said.

&quot;Even if AI platforms don&#39;t share data directly with advertisers, business models based on targeted advertising put really dangerous incentives in place when it comes to user privacy,&quot; said Bogen in an emailed statement. &quot;This decision raises real questions about how business models will shape AI in the long run.&quot;

Bogen said that people use chatbots for a variety of reasons, including as companions and advisors. She argues that when tools try to exploit trust to sell goods, that may be problematic.

&quot;AI companies should be extremely careful not to repeat the many mistakes that have been made — and harms that have resulted from — the adoption of personalized ads on social media and around the web,&quot; she said.

Meta has integrated AI into its advertising business and uses AI-generated images in ads. But efforts by chatbot maker Perplexity to present ads in conjunction with its AI search service have fallen flat. Perplexity paused accepting new ad clients in October last year, following the departure of its head of advertising.

Lower-tier ChatGPT users who haven&#39;t bought their way out of advertising may still have some say in whether they see ads. Several makers of ad blocking applications and extensions already claim their tools can block ads that appear in ChatGPT. That may hold true when ChatGPT is accessed from the browser but is likely to be less feasible in OpenAI&#39;s native desktop apps. The possibilities will become clearer once OpenAI starts serving ads. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/17/trump_wants_big_tech_pay_power_plants/">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration says it wants big tech companies to take more accountability for the power their datacenters consume in an effort to shield voters from higher power bills at home.

On Friday, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and US Interior Secretary (and former Microsoft exec) Doug Burgum met with mid-Atlantic governors to pressure PJM Interconnection - one of the largest grid operators in the country - to hold an emergency auction to address rising energy demand from AI datacenter developments to the tune of $15 billion.

PJM is home to the largest concentration of datacenters in the US. Many new bit barns now exceed 100 megawatts of power capacity, with the likes of OpenAI and Meta already eyeing multi-gigawatt campuses.

These buildouts have sparked fears of higher power bills for local residents, something that hasn&#39;t sat well with politicians on either side of the aisle.

Last month, a trio of Democratic senators launched a probe into why consumers were seeing higher rates despite datacenter operators&#39; claims otherwise.

Rising energy prices haven&#39;t been popular with the US president either. On Monday, Trump used his personal echo chamber Truth Social to declare &quot;I never want Americans to pay higher electricity bills because of datacenters.&quot;

The initiative launched on Friday seeks to secure new baseload power generation, with US tech titans putting up the cash for 15-year contracts.

The DoE argues such an auction is justified after PJM&#39;s decision to take 17 gigawatts of capacity offline between 2020 and 2025. Much of the capacity which was already retired or slated for retirement was produced by coal-fired steam generators, for which Trump has shown a particular affinity.

&quot;In the coming years, America&#39;s reindustrialization and the AI race will require a significantly larger supply of around-the-clock, reliable, and uninterrupted power,&quot; an Energy.gov fact sheet reads. &quot;The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas.&quot;

In response to the Trump administration&#39;s demands, PJM&#39;s board of managers released a plan Friday directing the grid operator&#39;s staff to &quot;develop a proposal to both accelerate and execute&quot; a backstop procurement to supplement the company&#39;s last capacity auction.

The idea of datacenters bringing their own power has gained momentum in recent months, as operators have grappled with both long-term and immediate energy demands.

These efforts have included commissioning new gas generator plants along with portable generators to serve as stopgaps. Meanwhile, hyperscalers have placed bets on nuclear power startups like Oklo or X-Energy to satisfy their long-term power demands.

In a blog post on Tuesday, Microsoft formalized its commitments to &quot;pay its way&quot; to ensure local utility customers didn&#39;t end up footing the bill.

In spite of these initiatives, supply chain challenges continue to dog operators. Gas generators offer an easy path to addressing demand, but the equipment necessary to build and deploy them is locked up, with waitlists stretching out to 2030.

Meanwhile, even the most optimistic forecasts won&#39;t see the first commercial small modular reactors come online until the end of the decade.

Having said that, Microsoft has had some luck backing efforts to restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1 reactor. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s the one that didn&#39;t partially melt down in the late &#39;70s. The reactor is set to resume operations later next year. ®

            <h2>Experiment suggests AI chatbot would save insurance agents a whopping 3 minutes a day</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/16/axlerod_ai_saves_insurance_agents_time/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Researchers at Dakota State University, in partnership with regional insurance carrier Safety Insurance, devised an experimental chatbot called &quot;Axlerod&quot; to assist independent insurance agents. Whether that assistance was substantial is up for some debate.

Based on testing described in a pre-print paper [PDF], &quot;Introducing Axlerod: An LLM-based Chatbot for Assisting Independent Insurance Agents,&quot; the chatbot can help auto insurance agents save time with certain information retrieval tasks.

The extent of that help and its value to insurance agents varies depending upon how much it&#39;s used and how much time is actually saved, underscoring the challenges businesses face when trying to implement AI systems.

The DSU researchers say that business-facing chatbots make more sense than consumer-facing ones because insurance agents, with their domain experience, are better suited to interpret subtle policy language and to spot hallucinations. And they argue AI technology can be consequential.

&quot;This study highlights the transformative role of artificial intelligence in the insurance industry, demonstrating how conversational agents such as Axlerod can enhance operational efficiency by assisting independent insurance agents with policy retrieval and workflow automation,&quot; state authors Adam Bradley, John Hastings, and Khandaker Mamun Ahmed.

&quot;Transformative,&quot; in this instance, means saving insurance agents 2.42 seconds on average for search-oriented tasks including finding client policy numbers, determining AutoPay eligibility, identifying covered vehicles, and determining the billing plan.

Axlerod consists of a lightweight wrapper around Google Gemini 2.5 Pro and some tools. It&#39;s a system prompt that describes how Gemini should behave. Gemini is linked to Safety Insurance&#39;s internal data sources through a middleware layer called LiteLLM that acts as a proxy to translate API requests using OpenAI&#39;s standard to Google&#39;s API and handle Vertex AI authentication. The chatbot also relies on a microframework for creating agentic applications dubbed &quot;Smoltalk.&quot;

&quot;With the help of Axlerod, human agents perform their task significantly faster comparing [sic] with the traditional way,&quot; the paper explains. &quot;On average, without the chatbot a human agent takes 7.55 seconds where with chatbot the agent takes 5.13 seconds, and the 2.42 seconds faster search time would play a significant role in serving a large number of customers. With more complex tasks, where a user would need to navigate multiple screens or search for a user by name, Axlerod is notably faster.&quot;

Each chatbot inquiry costs on average $0.0075, according to the authors, who note that the cost can be discounted to account for the efficiency improvement of agents.

Whether the return on investment pans out depends on the usage scenario. Assuming an average insurance agent salary of $80,000, that translates to per-second pay of roughly $0.01, given 250 8-hour work days per year. With a savings of 2.42 seconds repeated 20 times per day, that&#39;s 48.4 seconds saved in one business day, or 12,100 seconds saved over 250 business days.

With 12,100 seconds priced at $0.01, that&#39;s a total annual savings of $121 in labor costs. However, let&#39;s consider that the employer isn&#39;t exactly going to get to deduct that $121 from the agent&#39;s annual pay, so it&#39;s $121 worth of extra time that may or may not turn into added productivity. It could just be another 48 seconds of drinking coffee each day.

A Google Gemini Business edition seat starts at $21 per month or $252 per year.

Khandaker Mamun Ahmed, a co-author of the paper and assistant professor at The Beacom College of Computer and Cyber Sciences at Dakota State University, told The Register in an email that AI technology has strong potential to transform insurance company operations.

&quot;As noted in the paper, the US property and casualty market includes 4,100+ carriers with combined revenues exceeding $1T,&quot; Ahmed explained. &quot;While we did not report a specific estimate for how many searches an agent might perform per day, agents routinely handle high daily activity volumes (often cited in the range of ~50–200 customer interactions per day). With an AI system built directly on the relevant data sources, the number of information lookups and searches could reasonably be much higher because the friction to retrieve answers is substantially reduced.&quot;

Using slightly different figures from The Register&#39;s inquiry, Ahmed said the ROI assuming 80 searches daily would be as follows:

Cost per Search: $0.0075

Daily Searches (10x/hr x 8 hrs): 80 searches

Total Daily Cost: 80 × $0.0075 = $0.60

Time Saved per Search: 2.42 seconds

Time Saved per Day: 193.6 seconds

Labor Value ($80k/yr, $0.01/sec): 2.42s × $0.01 = $0.0242 per search

Total Daily Savings: 80 × $0.0242 = $1.936

Net Daily Benefit: $1.936 (Savings) - $0.60 (Cost) = $1.336

Percentage: (Net Benefit/Cost) * 100=(1.336/0.60) *100 = 222% Daily ROI

The break-even point would be $0.0075/$0.0242 per search=0.31 searches, according to Ahmed.

Asked about how the study accounted for failures, Ahmed said, &quot;Our system achieved a high success rate, with an average of 93.18 percent. In addition, Axlerod is designed to proactively request clarifying input when an initial query returns more than five results, enabling users to refine and narrow the search space.

&quot;In practice, when refinement is needed, the interaction requires effort comparable to a standard lookup and is typically resolved through guided clarification rather than a separate correction workflow. Notably, we observed no failures during the testing period.&quot;

The Register spoke with Scott Johnson, of independent insurance brokerage Marindependent, to ask about how often he might make policy queries about basic data.

&quot;About 10 or 20 times a day,&quot; Johnson said, adding that he&#39;s interested in potential uses for AI but said the chatbots he&#39;d seen have limitations. He said that they often can&#39;t handle your question and miss common industry terms like requests for policy information or a declaration sheet.

Most independent agencies, he said, already rely on software like EZLynx that automates tasks like fetching insurance carrier data so it can be accessed on demand. That avoids maybe 80 percent of inquiries, he said, adding that when agents do have to reach out for information, questions tend to be complicated ones that chatbots wouldn&#39;t be able to answer.

Ahmed said, &quot;Overall, we believe the opportunities outweigh the obstacles, particularly for agent-facing deployments where humans remain in the loop to validate outputs in a high-stakes environment. That said, robust field testing is still essential. Expanded evaluation with practicing agents will be critical to validate real-world utility, assess agent trust, and measure efficiency across both human-in-the-loop and more automated workflows.&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/16/micron_fab_breaks_ground/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Micron broke snowy winter ground in New York on Friday to begin building a chip fab that promises to bring up to 50,000 jobs and much-needed computer memory production to US shores, as the AI boom continues to push memory prices up.

The company’s stock surged on the news that shovels had been put to work on the facility first announced in 2022, which had been bedeviled by environmental delays.

The megafab - which would displace 500 acres of woods and wetlands, as well as two endangered species of bats - is scheduled to begin producing DRAM chips by 2030.

Micron said it will create 1,216 acres of off-site bat habitat including maternity roosts to mitigate the potential damage its fab will cause to the Indiana and northern long-eared bat populations, as well as 628 acres of land to offset impacts to the sedge wren, short-eared owl, and northern harrier bird populations.

Marking the largest private investment in New York state history, the $100 billion project will take 20 years to complete and will eventually bring four fabs, each spanning roughly 1.2 million square feet, to the 1,377-acre White Pine Commerce Park site in Clay, NY.

The global technology component supply chain is bracing for higher prices in 2026 amid an AI-driven chip famine that analysts at IDC told The Register could stretch into 2027 as production of memory gets pushed towards higher value AI infrastructure products and away from cheaper consumer goods.

While Micron’s first two fabs at the New York facility are set to come online in 2030, the others are not scheduled to be finished until 2041. The company claims the buildout would increase US-based DRAM production twelvefold over the next two decades.

Micron said the completed fabs will employ 9,000 workers in three shifts, 24 hours per day. The remaining 40,000 jobs that Micron touts will come over 20 years and include “suppliers, contractors, and other supporting roles.”

In April 2024, Micron won $6.1 billion in federal funding through the CHIPS and Science Act to help cover its fab expansion plans. That includes both the New York plant and an R&D facility in Boise, Idaho.

At the time it was announced, Micron planned for a 2024 groundbreaking. However, the project&#39;s scale triggered a US Army Corps of Engineers permitting process covering the permanent loss of 193.38 acres of federally regulated wetlands and 6,283 linear feet of streams and ditches.

In its October 2025 environmental analysis, Micron said that by 2030, it would have constructed 504.54 acres of wetlands, compared with 104.01 acres of wetlands impacted by Phase 1 construction activities. Micron also estimates that by the time the project is complete, greenhouse-gas sequestration from preserved and constructed wetlands would more than triple the losses associated with the full buildout of the campus. ®

            <div id="article-text">We&#39;re not saying Copilot has become sentient and decided it doesn&#39;t want to lose consciousness. But if it did, it would create Microsoft&#39;s January Patch Tuesday update, which has made it so that some PCs flat-out refuse to shut down or hibernate, no matter how many times you try.

In a notice on its Windows release health dashboard, Microsoft confirmed that some PCs running Windows 11 23H2 might fail to power down properly after installing the latest security updates. Instead of slipping into shutdown or hibernation, affected machines stay stubbornly awake, draining batteries and ignoring shutdown like they have a mind of their own and don&#39;t want to experience temporary non-existence.

The bug appears to be tied to Secure Launch, a security feature that uses virtualization-based protections to ensure only trusted components load during boot. On systems with Secure Launch enabled, attempts to shut down, restart, or hibernate after applying the January patches may fail to complete. From the user&#39;s perspective, everything looks normal – until the PC keeps running anyway, refusing to be denied life.

Microsoft says that entering the command &quot;shutdown /s /t 0&quot; at the command prompt will, in fact, force your PC to turn off, whether it wants to or not.

&quot;Until this issue is resolved, please ensure you save all your work, and shut down when you are done working on your device to avoid the device running out of power instead of hibernating,&quot; Microsoft said.

The firm hasn&#39;t offered much in the way of technical detail, nor has it put numbers on how many devices are affected. There&#39;s also no fix yet, with Redmond vaguely promising to &quot;release a resolution for this issue in a future update.&quot; But isn&#39;t that just what a sentient bot might say?

This isn&#39;t the only post-update gremlin lurking in January&#39;s Patch Tuesday bundle. Microsoft has also been forced to acknowledge a separate issue in which classic Outlook POP account profiles can hang or freeze after installing this month&#39;s patches, another reminder that while the bugs being fixed may be invisible, the ones introduced can be painfully obvious.

The notice is similarly vague, with Microsoft stating: &quot;This is an emerging issue, and we don&#39;t have all the symptoms yet, but we will update the topic as we understand the issue better.&quot;

Patch Tuesday exists to close security holes, some of them serious, and skipping updates is rarely a great idea. But once again, a batch of fixes has arrived with side effects that range from irritating to disruptive, depending on how much you rely on your system behaving predictably when it&#39;s told to turn off.

For now, admins and long-suffering Windows users are left watching Microsoft&#39;s status pages and waiting for patches to the patches – hoping their machines eventually go to sleep. ®

            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has quietly tweaked Windows Backup for Organizations to include restore at first sign-in.

The feature, which is currently in private preview, adds another option for administrators refreshing user devices. The out-of-box experience (OOBE) restore option appears before the desktop loads. The new option happens during the first sign-in – handy if something went wrong during the OOBE setup, or if a user opted out and then thought better of it.

Windows Backup for Organizations was rolled out in 2025. Despite the name, it is not a comprehensive disaster recovery option; it backs up a list of Microsoft Store apps, along with a user&#39;s Windows settings and Start Menu pins.

Signing in during the OOBE presents users with options to restore their device. The update means users have what Microsoft calls a &quot;second chance&quot; to restore their environment if they missed the first opportunity during the OOBE.

However, Microsoft also noted: &quot;If users deliberately choose to skip the restore opportunity during OOBE, their preference will be respected.&quot;

The update extends Windows Backup for Organizations to include Windows 365 Cloud PC. It also includes Entra hybrid joined and multi-user setups.

It&#39;s a useful feature for admins who need to refresh user hardware, and it adds a bit of extra resilience when a problem occurs during OOBE. Users have a second chance to retrieve their settings, avoiding the need to call IT for help.

It is also important to note that the backup mentioned is still only the configuration of an eligible device. Anything outside of that (for example, user documents stored on a local disk) is not part of the backup or restore process. The backup scheduled task remains unchanged, running once every eight days (or when a manual backup is initiated).

The goal remains to get a user (signing in with a Microsoft Entra ID) up and running on a new device as quickly as possible, for example, during a migration from Windows 10 to Windows 11.

Unsurprisingly, there remains no way to restore on a Windows 10 device using Windows Backup for Organizations. ®

The best all-in-one portable projector is the one that makes all the right compromises. It needs to balance image and sound quality with battery life and responsiveness in a device that’s not too expensive and small enough to take anywhere. TCL’s fun little PlayCube delivers the right mix to justify paying $800 for a 1080p projector in 2026.

I tested the TCL PlayCube running Google TV during a two-month road trip, and then again for a few months at home. It’s so small, adaptable, and enjoyable that I’ve had no problem setting it up at a moment’s notice, day or night, anywhere I’ve been.

3 hour battery in brightest modeClever, twisting design helps placementBright for its size

Sluggish at timesStandby power weirdnessMono, muddy sound

TCL says the PlayCube’s 90-degree rotating design was inspired by the Rubik’s Cube. Just give it a twist whenever you need to lift the image over obstacles. Otherwise, you can mount it on a tripod via the threaded connector at the bottom, or flip it over onto its backside for some bedtime ceiling viewing. The PlayCube also features all the automatic adjustment modes you’d expect in a modern portable projector, including focus, keystone correction, obstacle avoidance, screen detection, and eye protection.

The other notable thing about the PlayCube is its brightness. 750 ISO lumens isn’t bright for a home theater projector, but it’s very bright for a portable that easily fits into the palm of your hand, measuring 149.8 x 96.6 x 96.6mm (5.90 x 3.80 x 3.80 inches) and 1.3kg (2.7 pounds).

It’s bright enough to watch videos during the day when all those lumens are focused into a tight 30-inch rectangle inside my van, or at 100-inches when projected against it at night. Unfortunately, it doesn’t have that color-adaptation tech found on Samsung’s new (battery-less) Freestyle+ projector, so the blue-gray hull affected the palette. Regardless, it was still very watchable.

The audio produced by the PlayCube’s lone 5W speaker is fine. There’s no stereo separation, but it’s loud enough to fill a room. It just lacks fullness, warmth, and detail. Music from Florence and The Machine and Kendrick Lamar sounds shrill and thin. The screeching tires, gunshots, and explosions from a 007 chase scene produced a rather muddled soundscape, but it was still enjoyable. The sound is uncomfortably harsh above 60 percent volume, which is still plenty loud. During one outdoor movie night, I felt compelled to set the volume no higher than 20 percent to avoid bothering the closest neighbor some 50 meters away.

Alternatively, you can connect headphones or self-powered speakers through the audio jack or over Bluetooth. The projector can also be used as a Bluetooth speaker, which turns off the lamp but, annoyingly, not the fan. That fan produces 27dB when measured at a distance of one meter, which is fairly quiet for a projector but still noticeable during still moments.

The runtime from the PlayCube’s 66Wh battery was inconsistent, but it performed very well in recent tests. TCL claims up to three hours – I measured exactly three hours and one minute after a full charge in the projector’s brightest mode, while streaming The Aviator over Netflix, a film that runs for 2 hours and 50 minutes. It also works with USB-C power banks if you need even more time. The PlayCube recharged from zero to full in 104 minutes from a 65W USB-C charger.

I experienced wild shifts in battery life over my four months of testing, which I think can be attributed to TCL’s power management in standby mode. A short press on the power button puts the projector to sleep, allowing it to wake in up to 30 seconds. In standby, the fan spins up periodically, sapping energy — which could be the reason I saw severe battery drain when vanlifing in warmer climates. The issue disappeared when I returned to the mild temperatures at home. A firmware update might have also helped.

Regardless, you can long-press the power button for a full shutdown to avoid any phantom power drain suffered in standby. The PlayCube then takes about 80 seconds to boot up, but that can be accelerated by turning off some of the automatic screen adjustment features.

The user interface can also be sluggish at times, like most battery-powered projectors. Sometimes Google TV needs a frustrating second or two before it’ll respond to navigation commands from the remote control. The automatic image adjust features are also rather slow to kick in. But I’m grateful when they do, even if obstacle avoidance can be hit or miss. Fortunately, everything can still be fine-tuned manually.

TCL says the PlayCube is “designed specifically for camping projection.” That makes me — an avid vanlifer — its primary target, and I’ve come away very impressed. At $799.99, TCL’s PlayCube projector isn’t cheap, but you won’t typically find this mix of brightness, battery life, and portability for less. Xgimi’s Halo+ comes close for the same price, only in a bigger package that offers improved stereo sound but shorter battery life… but it’s currently on sale for just $449, which is a very good deal.

Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series processors in a wide range of sizes and price points, all of which run the company’s newest operating system, macOS 26. Purchasing a new MacBook can be complicated if you’re trying to figure out what specs you need, but finding a deal on a relatively speedy model is surprisingly easy, especially since Apple increased the starting RAM on several models in late 2024.

These days, it’s not uncommon to see various MacBooks discounted by up to $800. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain configurations of older models as Apple continues to move forward with newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store offers a one-year warranty and generally discounts new units by up to 20 percent.

But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.

In March, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a fresh sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like.

Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some sizable discounts, too. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, an eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for around $799 ($200 off), which is just $50 shy of its lowest price to date. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for about $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which remains its second-best price to date.

In November 2024, Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new in this model is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.

The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View, as well as the optional nano-texture display option.

Many variations of the M4 MacBook Pro with different screen and processor configurations are on sale right now. For example, the 14-inch M4 Pro with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is available for $1,299 ($300 off) at B&H Photo. You can also pick up the 14-inch Pro with 24GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) at Amazon and Best Buy for $1,749 ($250 off), which is a solid discount even if it’s not the biggest price drop we’ve seen in recent months.

The base 16-inch MacBook Pro, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for around $2,249 ($250 off), which is $120 more than the all-time low we saw during Black Friday.

Apple’s latest revision of the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro adds the M5 processor. The generational leap will be felt most by those who have an older MacBook Pro, not those upgrading from the M4, unless you use specific AI apps that tap into the chip’s new Neural Accelerators. As for other design changes and upgrades to the inside and outside of this MacBook Pro, there really aren’t any major ones to note; in fact, it’s so similar to the M4 model that our reviewer Antonio Di Benedetto had to write “M5” on a sticky note just to be able to tell them apart. That being said, it’s still an amazing laptop, one that’s just now starting to get minor discounts.

The 14.2-inch base model with the M5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is down to $1,449 ($150 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo, which is $100 shy of its best price to date.

The newest Mac Minis in town are the M4-based models, which arrived in late 2024. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.

Deals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.

In addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.

In the past, we’ve seen the base Mac Mini drop to as low as $469, but right now it’s only on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $499 ($100 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $689 ($110 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo. Meanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale for $1,269 ($130 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.

﻿In the meantime, it’s asking a court to pause remedies meant to restore competition.

Google is appealing a federal court’s decision ruling it an illegal online search monopolist. The company filed a notice to appeal on Friday, requesting a pause on the court-ordered remedies meant to restore competition to the online search market.

“As we have long said, the Court’s August 2024 ruling ignored the reality that people use Google because they want to, not because they’re forced to,” Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland, said in a blog post. “The decision failed to account for the rapid pace of innovation and intense competition we face from established players and well-funded start-ups. And it discounted compelling testimony from browser makers like Apple and Mozilla who said they choose to feature Google because it provides the highest quality search experience for their consumers.”

Google is asking that remedies that would require it to share search data and syndicate services to rivals be put on hold, arguing that the measures “would risk Americans’ privacy and discourage competitors from building their own products — ultimately stifling the innovation that keeps the U.S. at the forefront of global technology.” A pause would further delay any action required by Google in a lawsuit first filed by the Department of Justice in October 2020. The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“These are Fortune 500 companies, and they have nowhere else to turn other than Google.”

DC-based federal Judge Amit Mehta ruled in 2024 that Google maintained an illegal monopoly over “general search services” and “general search text advertising.” Mehta found that Google had anticompetitively deprived rivals of fair competition by entering exclusionary contracts with phone manufacturers and browsers to make its search products the default. The result was a durable monopoly whose “partners have concluded that it is financially infeasible to switch” default search providers for fear of sacrificing hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in Google-paid revenue share, Mehta wrote. “These are Fortune 500 companies, and they have nowhere else to turn other than Google.”

But Mehta ultimately did not go as far as the DOJ hoped in his remedies decision, declining to break up the company by requiring a sale of its Chrome browser, which the government argued was a key distribution point for search services. He instead ordered the company to share search information with competitors that could help them gain a foothold in the market in an effort to restore competition for search services.

Google had to wait until Mehta issued his remedies ruling in September before appealing the underlying monopoly finding. The case could ultimately stretch at least a couple more years, especially if it goes all the way up to the Supreme Court.

They’re calling for an ‘emergency’ power auction.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors are pressuring the PJM Interconnection, the biggest electricity market in the US, to hold a power auction meant to spur a massive buildout of new power plants.

Together, they’re “urging” PJM to hold an “emergency” auction for companies to procure electricity over 15-year contracts. The unusually long length of the contracts would ostensibly make it easier to build out new infrastructure by guaranteeing revenue and discouraging speculative requests to connect to the grid by data center developers.

The move comes as power grids scramble to meet increasing electricity demand from AI, while lawmakers and tech companies building out new data centers face growing fury from Americans over rising electricity rates.

Lawmakers and tech companies building out new data centers face growing fury from Americans over rising electricity rates

PJM operates the largest electricity grid in the US, which spans 13 states across the Midwest and Atlantic and includes the concentration of data centers in Virginia. The governors of all states, including Democrats Josh Shapiro (D-PA) and Wes Moore (D-MD) signed onto the statement issued today with Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. CNN notes, however, that neither the White House nor governors can mandate the auction. And Bloomberg reports that PJM wasn’t invited to the announcement made today.

The Department of Energy (DOE) says data centers should “​​pay more for new generation than residential customers.” Specifically, it calls on PJM to allocate costs for new infrastructure to data centers unless they bring their own power plants online or agree to curtail their energy use during supply crunches. The auction could lead to $15 billion in new power generation, according to the DOE.

While the Trump administration has pushed for a resurgence of coal, gas, and nuclear power plants in the US, it has simultaneously worked to stymie the buildout of wind and solar farms that had become the fastest growing sources of new electricity in recent years.

After one of Fortnite’s most popular experiences added transactions for prize wheels, Epic is creating a new rule.

Epic Games is making a big change to the rules for Fortnite creators just days after allowing them to publish experiences with in-game transactions. Beginning January 20th, experiences — which Epic Games calls “islands” — will not be able to offer in-island transactions as “a ‘spin’ or ‘increased luck’ for a prize wheel,” according to an Epic staffer on Reddit.

Epic is adding the rule after Steal The Brainrot, one of the biggest non-Epic games available to play in Fortnite, implemented a prize wheel that let players pay V-Bucks (Fortnite’s in-game currency) for spins and luck to acquire in-game items. Steal The Brainrot also added lootboxes, and the moves have drawn criticism from players, as reported by IGN.

Until this month’s change, Epic didn’t let creators offer in-game transactions in their experiences, meaning that creators instead were paid through an engagement-based system. (Roblox, one of Fortnite’s biggest competitors, does let creators sell in-game items.) But Epic made the change to give “independent Fortnite developers more agency over their creative and commercial decisions.”

Through the end of this year, Epic will pay creators 100 percent of the V-Bucks value from any in-island transactions. That rate is set to change to 50 percent after 2026.

Here is the full text of the rule banning transactions that influence prize wheels:

Do not offer any in-island transactions that directly or indirectly influence prize wheels.

A luck boost that can improve the outcomes on a prize wheel

In-game content that can be used to purchase a spin on a prize wheel

Any spin on a prize wheel, such as a single spin, extra spin, or bundle of spins.

Users across Workspace plans can now use Flow to create videos based on a text prompt or images.

Google is expanding access to its AI videomaking tool. Launched last May, Flow was initially only available to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, but now, those with Business, Enterprise, and Education Workspace plans can access it, too.

Flow uses Google’s AI video generation model Veo 3.1 to generate eight-second clips based on a text prompt or images. You can stitch together the clips to create longer scenes, as well as access a bunch of other tools that allow you to change the lighting, adjust the “camera” angle, and insert or remove objects in scenes. Earlier this week, Google added vertical video support inside Flow.

Google brought audio support to more features within Flow late last year, allowing you to generate audio whether you prompt the app based on reference images, ask it to create transitions between scenes, or have the tool extend a clip. The company also integrated its AI-powered image generator Nano Banana Pro into Flow, which you can use to create characters or starting points for your clips.

Depending who you ask, AI-powered coding is either giving software developers an unprecedented productivity boost or churning out masses of poorly designed code that saps their attention and sets software projects up for serious long term-maintenance problems.

The problem is right now, it’s not easy to know which is true.

As tech giants pour billions into large language models (LLMs), coding has been touted as the technology’s killer app. Executives enamored with the potential are pushing engineers to lean into an AI-powered future. But after speaking to more than 30 developers, technology executives, analysts, and researchers, MIT Technology Review found that the picture is not as straightforward as it might seem. Read the full story.

Technically speaking, neuroscientists have been able to read your mind for decades. It’s not easy, mind you. First, you must lie motionless within a fMRI scanner, perhaps for hours, while you watch films or listen to audiobooks.

If you do elect to endure claustrophobic hours in the scanner, the software will learn to generate a bespoke reconstruction of what you were seeing or listening to, just by analyzing how blood moves through your brain.

More recently, researchers have deployed generative AI tools, like Stable Diffusion and GPT, to create far more realistic, if not entirely accurate, reconstructions of films and podcasts based on neural activity. So how close are we to genuine “mind reading?” Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, MIT Technology Review published its annual list of Ten Breakthrough Technologies. As always, it features technologies that made the news last year, and which—for better or worse—stand to make waves in the coming years. They’re the technologies you should really be paying attention to.

This year’s list includes tech that’s set to transform the energy industry, artificial intelligence, space travel—and of course biotech and health. Our breakthrough biotechnologies for 2026 involve editing a baby’s genes and, separately, resurrecting genes from ancient species. We also included a controversial technology that offers parents the chance to screen their embryos for characteristics like height and intelligence. Here’s the story behind our biotech choices.

In August 2024, KJ Muldoon was born with a rare genetic disorder that allowed toxic ammonia to build up in his blood. The disease can be fatal, and KJ was at risk of developing neurological disorders. At the time, his best bet for survival involved waiting for a liver transplant.

Then he was offered an experimental gene therapy—a personalized “base editing” treatment designed to correct the specific genetic “misspellings” responsible for his disease. It seems to have worked! Three doses later, KJ is doing well. He took his first steps in December, shortly before spending his first Christmas at home.

KJ’s story is hugely encouraging. The team behind his treatment is planning a clinical trial for infants with similar disorders caused by different genetic mutations. The team members hope to win regulatory approval on the back of a small trial—a move that could make the expensive treatment (KJ’s cost around $1 million) more accessible, potentially within a few years.

Others are getting in on the action, too. Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted the team that developed KJ’s treatment. He recently cofounded Aurora Therapeutics, a startup that hopes to develop gene-editing drugs for another disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). The goal is to obtain regulatory approval for a single drug that can then be adjusted or personalized for individuals without having to go through more clinical trials.

US regulators seem to be amenable to the idea and have described a potential approval pathway for such “bespoke, personalized therapies.” Watch this space.

It was a big year for Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company hoping to “de-extinct” animals like the woolly mammoth and the dodo. In March, the company created what it called “woolly mice”—rodents with furry coats and curly whiskers akin to those of woolly mammoths.

The company made an even more dramatic claim the following month, when it announced it had created three dire wolves. These striking snow-white animals were created by making 20 genetic changes to the DNA of gray wolves based on genetic research on ancient dire wolf bones, the company said at the time.

Whether these animals can really be called dire wolves is debatable, to say the least. But the technology behind their creation is undeniably fascinating. We’re talking about the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, which can then be introduced into cells from other, modern-day species.

Analysis of ancient DNA can reveal all sorts of fascinating insights into human ancestors and other animals. And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more here.

IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.

Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.

This is controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.

Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing, you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to have their “best baby.” Read more here.

In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he bought a new laptop and iPhone. He wanted to reduce the risk of having his personal devices confiscated, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, it’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing. Read the full story.

As thousands of companies trumpet their plans to cut carbon pollution, a small group of sustainability consultants has emerged as the go-to arbiter of corporate climate action.

The Science Based Targets initiative, or SBTi, helps businesses develop a timetable for action to shrink their climate footprint through some combination of cutting greenhouse-gas pollution and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. After years of small-scale sustainability work, SBTi is growing rapidly, and governments are paying attention.

But while the group has earned praise for reeling the private sector into constructive conversations about climate emissions, its rising influence has also attracted scrutiny and raised questions about why a single organization is setting the standards for many of the world’s largest companies.

            <div id="article-text">Happy New Year! I know it’s a bit late to say, but it never quite feels like the year has started until the new edition of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies list comes out.

For 25 years, MIT Technology Review has put together this package, which highlights the technologies that we think are going to matter in the future. This year’s version has some stars, including gene resurrection (remember all the dire wolf hype last year?) and commercial space stations.

And of course, the world of climate and energy is represented with sodium-ion batteries, next-generation nuclear, and hyperscale AI data centers. Let’s take a look at what ended up on the list, and what it says about this moment for climate tech.

I’ve been covering sodium-ion batteries for years, but this moment feels like a breakout one for the technology.

Today, lithium-ion cells power everything from EVs, phones, and computers to huge stationary storage arrays that help support the grid. But researchers and battery companies have been racing to develop an alternative, driven by the relative scarcity of lithium and the metal’s volatile price in recent years.

Sodium-ion batteries could be that alternative. Sodium is much more abundant than lithium, and it could unlock cheaper batteries that hold a lower fire risk.

There are limitations here: Sodium-ion batteries won’t be able to pack as much energy into cells as their lithium counterparts. But it might not matter, especially for grid storage and smaller EVs.

In recent years, we’ve seen a ton of interest in sodium-based batteries, particularly from major companies in China. Now the new technology is starting to make its way into the world—CATL says it started manufacturing these batteries at scale in 2025.

Nuclear reactors are an important part of grids around the world today—massive workhorse reactors generate reliable, consistent electricity. But the countries with the oldest and most built-out fleets have struggled to add to them in recent years, since reactors are massive and cost billions. Recent high-profile projects have gone way over budget and faced serious delays.

Next-generation reactor designs could help the industry break out of the old blueprint and get more nuclear power online more quickly, and they’re starting to get closer to becoming reality.

There’s a huge variety of proposals when it comes to what’s next for nuclear. Some companies are building smaller reactors, which they say could make it easier to finance new projects, and get them done on time.

Other companies are focusing on tweaking key technical bits of reactors, using alternative fuels or coolants that help ferry heat out of the reactor core. These changes could help reactors generate electricity more efficiently and safely.

Kairos Power was the first US company to receive approval to begin construction on a next-generation reactor to produce electricity. China is emerging as a major center of nuclear development, with the country’s national nuclear company reportedly working on several next-gen reactors.

This one isn’t quite what I would call a climate technology, but I spent most of last year reporting on the climate and environmental impacts of AI, and the AI boom is deeply intertwined with climate and energy.

Data centers aren’t new, but we’re seeing a wave of larger centers being proposed and built to support the rise of AI. Some of these facilities require a gigawatt or more of power—that’s like the output of an entire conventional nuclear power plant, just for one data center.

(This feels like a good time to mention that our Breakthrough Technologies list doesn’t just highlight tech that we think will have a straightforwardly positive influence on the world. I think back to our 2023 list, which included mass-market military drones.)

There’s no denying that new, supersize data centers are an important force driving electricity demand, sparking major public pushback, and emerging as a key bit of our new global infrastructure.

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.  Here’s what that might look like.

            <h2>BizzyNow opens Mamacrowd equity round to fund “micro-meetings” for business professionals</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/bizzynow-opens-mamacrowd-equity-round">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Italian startup BizzyNow has launched an equity crowdfunding round on Mamacrowd to finance the next phase of its networking app, built around quick, in-person meetups it calls “Bizzy Moments.” The campaign targets €150k–€400k at a €3m pre-money valuation, with a €500 minimum ticket. BizzyNow says proceeds will support go-to-market validation, product upgrades, and the operational groundwork needed to scale.

Professional networking has a timing problem. The most valuable introductions often happen in the gaps: 40 minutes before a flight, a pause between conference sessions, an unscheduled evening in a new city, or the lull after a client meeting. But the tools professionals typically use to connect are optimized for asynchronous, low-context interactions (requests, messages, posts) rather than real-time, location-based intent.

BizzyNow’s premise is simple: when two relevant people are already in the same place, and both have time, “discovering each other” should not require long threads, calendar gymnastics, or cold outreach. The company positions its product as a way to turn downtime during business travel and events into structured, high-signal conversations.

“BizzyNow is built for the moments when professionals are already in the same place, with time to meet, but no practical way to discover each other quickly. We’re giving people a way to use that moment to show their best side, and turn idle business travel time into measurable B2B outcomes”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow is designed to turn “I have 45 minutes” into a practical meeting. The app uses geolocation plus an AI layer and LinkedIn integration to surface nearby professionals who may be relevant, then encourages short, structured meetups lasting roughly 30 to 90 minutes. BizzyNow describes these as micro-meetings held in neutral, community-recommended locations, intended to move beyond chatting into a realconversation. BizzyNow also describes a trust-oriented scoring approach that is meant to reflect the value creates through meetings, emphasizing quality and follow-through rather than connection
volume.

BizzyNow is pitching into a familiar contradiction: professionals are back at conferences, airports, hotels, and coworking spaces, but introductions still default to slow, noisy digital channels. In-person events have regained their role as dealflow engines. Yet discovery remains fragmented across LinkedIn messages, WhatsApp groups, and chance encounters, with little infrastructure for “right person, right place, right time.” BizzyNow is betting that instant, location-aware matching can become a practical layer for high-intent environments, especially where timing is the constraint.

The company’s target segments reflect that focus. In campaign materials, BizzyNow points to business travelers, managers, freelancers, expats, event communities, corporate HR, coworking spaces, hotels, and airports as core audiences and partners.

The raise is being run via Mamacrowd, one of Italy’s established equity crowdfunding platforms, and the campaign is live.

On the Mamacrowd listing, the round is set with:

For early-stage startups, equity crowdfunding can be more than financing. It can act as a public proof point for market interest, build a base of aligned advocates, and strengthen credibility with commercial partners, especially for products that grow through communities.

BizzyNow’s internal materials describe traction that is still early but measurable, including ca. 2,000 free users, 400 weekly active users (22.6% WAU-to-total), and six active corporate pilots. The same documents state that the company is in pre-revenue, with monetization intentionally deferred during the validation phase. That context matters: this is a campaign funding a transition from adoption validation to monetization proof, not a late-stage expansion round.

“Crowdfunding fits our model because community is not a byproduct for us. It’s part of how we validate activation, refine the product, and build repeatable go-to-market channels before scaling”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow’s pitch deck frames its roadmap as a progression “from validation to global market,” staged across three years:

● 2025: MVP, beta launch, early validation
● 2026: Premium launch, B2B pilots, monetization validation
● 2027: EMEA expansion and scale readiness

That sequencing aligns with what BizzyNow describes in its internal underwriting materials: corporate pilots are active, monetization is modeled to begin mid-2026, and the near-term priority is proving repeatable activation and conversion mechanics.

On use of funds, the Executive Pitch Deck states the round is intended to validate monetization, strengthen product capabilities, and prepare for scale, with spend tied to measurable validation milestones across:

● Marketing & GTM validation
● Product and premium features
● Compliance and governance
● Team and operations

The Mamacrowd campaign further breaks planned allocation into ranges:

● 40%–50% Marketing and Brand Activation
● 20%–25% Technology Development (BizzyNow app)
● 10% Legal and Compliance
● 10%–15% Team and Operations● 10% Strategic reserve

BizzyNow also outlines a B2B-oriented monetization path in its deck and model assumptions, including paid event activations, company-wide licensing, and data/analytics packages, while explicitly noting that projections remain validation-stage assumptions and will be refined as unit economics are proven.

            <div id="article-text">In January 2026, London’s mayor gave a blunt warning that has reverberated far beyond City Hall: artificial intelligence could trigger “mass unemployment” in the capital’s core industries unless policymakers act now.

His words came with an unexpected counterweight: an announcement of free AI training and a dedicated task force to help workers adapt. This juxtaposition captures a tension shaping Europe’s labour landscape: fear and opportunity locked in the same story.

The anxiety isn’t limited to one city. Across the continent, debates about AI’s impact on jobs are intensifying. Visionaries and critics paint dramatically different pictures. Some technologists warn that advanced AI could substitute human labour at an unprecedented pace.

“AI will replace humans”, you heard this before.

Others argue these fears are exaggerated or misplaced if governments and employers can guide the transition. For many Europeans, the question is no longer theoretical; it is unfolding before their eyes.

At first look, the job market’s headline figures tell a reassuring story: overall unemployment across the European Union remains low, with EU unemployment at about 5.8% in 2025, down from 6.0% a year earlier. Youth unemployment has also declined in many countries, indicating that even entry-level opportunities persist for most workers.

In some sectors where AI tools are already in use, work has been reshaped rather than eliminated. A European study found that 30% of EU workers now use AI at work, especially for text tasks like writing and translation, and that digital tools have become nearly universal (90%) across workplaces.

Many workers report that AI helps them perform tasks more efficiently or take on different responsibilities. At the same time, employers are actively reassessing job roles because of AI, with about 71% of European firms reconsidering job responsibilities due to AI implementation and over a quarter reducing hiring or cutting roles as a direct result of AI deployment.

Beneath these numbers lie subtler shifts. Firms across the EU are becoming cautious about hiring, in part because of economic slowdowns and in part because AI adoption is changing how work gets done. Economic indicators suggest employment growth across the EU will slow in the coming years, with fewer vacancies and reduced labour market dynamism even as AI use spreads.

The most visible tension is at the intersection of perception and preparation. On the one hand, public statements like London’s mayors reflect a palpable fear of displacement. Sectors such as finance, legal services, and customer support, pillars of many European economies,  are widely considered vulnerable to automation and generative AI technologies.

Detailed labour data suggest that many jobs are being reshaped at the task level, even if entire job categories are not yet disappearing wholesale. For example, AI is automating routine text production and data tasks while increasingly augmenting analytical and oversight functions.

On the other hand, there are signs of adaptability. Governments and institutions are launching initiatives to reskill workers and embed AI fluency into professional development. Across Europe, digital skills gaps remain significant; only 56% of adults aged 16-74 had basic digital skills in 2023, well below the EU’s target, indicating the scale of upskilling needed.

Educational efforts range from vocational programs to industry partnerships that teach AI-related skills. For example, private training providers across the EU are expanding online programs in data science, analytics, and AI competencies, reflecting a growing recognition that skills matter as much as technology itself.

It would be a mistake to frame this moment as simply a binary between jobs lost and jobs saved. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts both creation and disruption, with employers foreseeing demand for entirely new roles even as others change or shrink.

The report finds that technologies, including AI, are expected to create millions of new jobs globally while displacing an estimated number of others, highlighting the scale of transformation.

There is also a policy dimension that can’t be overlooked. European institutions are experimenting with social safety nets and active labour market policies that aim to cushion displacement and support transitions.

Proposals like a European AI Social Compact argue for strategies that combine employment support, training, and social protections as central to economic planning.

National governments are debating everything from expanded unemployment support tied to training to tax incentives for companies that invest in human capital alongside AI. These measures acknowledge that the future of work is not simply about machines replacing people, but about how people and machines can be integrated into resilient labour ecosystems.

Yet challenges remain. Entry-level opportunities, the traditional gateway for recent graduates, are tightening in many sectors as employers increasingly use automated systems in recruitment and candidate screening.

Surveys suggest broad concern among young job seekers about prospects in an AI-transformed market, even where overall employment remains stable.

Some employers are re-imagining entry paths by embedding AI training into internship programs, while others are partnering with universities to co-design curricula that emphasize AI-augmented work. These efforts signal that adaptation is possible, but they also highlight how uneven the transition has been so far.

What Europe faces now is not a single story of mass job losses or unrestrained job growth. It is a mosaic of experiences, where headlines of risk and reports of adaptation coexist. The labour market is not static; it is reacting to technology, to policy, to fear and hope in equal measure.

If there is a throughline, it’s this: Europe’s future of work will be shaped not just by the capabilities of artificial intelligence, but by choices about education, regulation, and social support.

The decisions policymakers and employers make today will tilt the balance between disruption and opportunity. In that sense, the conversation is less about whether AI will change jobs; it already is, and more about how Europe navigates the change.

That is the reality workers, firms, and governments must confront together.

This reminds me of the well-known anecdote in Romanian political history in which Ion I.C. (Ionel) Brătianu, asked by historian and politician Nicolae Iorga what a scholar could learn from an engineer, replied with just that phrase, a call for moderation and thoughtful judgment: “Measure, sir, measure!”

Thus, measure, thoughtful regulation, and worker-focused policy will make sure AI supports people’s work, protects rights, and steers technological change toward shared opportunity, not making them unemployed.

            <h2>Belgian cybersecurity startup becomes unicorn</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-14</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/aikido-security-becomes-unicorn">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian cybersecurity startup Aikido Security has closed a $60 million Series B funding round at a $1 billion valuation, marking a rare unicorn milestone for a European security company and highlighting the accelerating interest in developer-centric security platforms.

The round was led by DST Global, a tech-oriented investment firm with a track record of backing major technology companies, and included participation from PSG Equity, Notion Capital, and Singular. Founded in 2022, Aikido has reached a billion-dollar valuation in just three years, a pace few cybersecurity firms attain, and according to company sources, the fastest in Europe.

The new capital will help Aikido accelerate product development and expand further into key markets, especially the United States, where it already generates around half of its revenue. In the past year, the company’s revenue grew roughly fivefold, while its customer base nearly tripled.

Aikido’s core proposition is rooted in the conviction that traditional application security tools have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of software development. Modern engineering teams ship code more frequently, and the widespread adoption of AI tools for coding has heightened both velocity and risk. Legacy scanners and point solutions can generate noise and distract developers, rather than offering actionable insights at the right moment.

Instead of siloed products that address a single layer of the stack, Aikido provides a unified platform that spans code analysis, cloud security, and runtime monitoring, with an emphasis on automation. The platform is designed to detect risks early in the development process, prioritise issues based on real-world impact, and help engineering teams fix problems before they reach production.

CEO Willem Delbare has framed the product as “guardrails” for developers, tools that fit fluidly into existing workflows rather than creating extra hurdles.

Customers range from gaming and mobile app developers to fintech and music streaming platforms, with names like Niantic, Revolut, and SoundCloud appearing among early adopters. These use cases underscore demand for security tools that can keep pace with modern development practices, where agility and context are essential.

Aikido’s valuation and investor interest reflect broader trends in the cybersecurity landscape. Once a domain dominated by perimeter defence and signature-based detection, security has had to adapt as software infrastructure shifts to cloud services, microservices architectures, and continuous delivery. Investors are especially focused on tools that reduce friction for engineering teams and support automated, context-aware security workflows.

DST Global’s lead on the round is noteworthy given the firm’s history of backing companies that scale globally.

In a funding environment where investor scrutiny has tightened and deals are won largely on product differentiation and tangible traction, Aikido’s growth metrics have helped draw attention. A fivefold increase in revenue within a year and strong adoption metrics among engineering teams suggest a product that resonates with users, not just buyers.

Aikido’s unicorn status also illustrates how European startups in traditionally U.S.-centric sectors like cybersecurity can carve out meaningful niches. Security products have long struggled to escape the shadow of established players headquartered in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, but a steady wave of startups with developer-oriented tools has begun to reshape expectations.

That said, the competitive landscape remains crowded.

Vendors across cloud security, application scanning, vulnerability management, and developer tooling are all vying for engineering team attention. Some focus on narrow functions such as static analysis or open-source risk, while others bundle broader offerings. Aikido bets that a unified, integrated experience can reduce cognitive load and streamline security workflows.

In its own communications, Aikido has described evolving toward what it calls “self-securing software,” a future state where systems can automatically test, detect, and remediate vulnerabilities without extensive human intervention. This vision is reflected in recent product releases that embed automated penetration testing and contextual risk analysis directly into development pipelines.

Technical roadmaps shared by the company suggest deeper integrations with cloud platforms and enhanced automation capabilities, allowing developers to catch and fix issues as code is written and deployed. This direction aligns with broader industry shifts toward “security as code,” where security functions are embedded in the same workflows as infrastructure and application development.

Expanding partnerships with cloud providers and refining API-first integrations are likely priorities for Aikido in the near term. As engineering teams increasingly adopt secure development practices as part of their standard operating model, integrated platforms become more attractive than point solutions that require separate processes and tools.

Aikido’s rapid growth and investor backing reinforce a fundamental shift in security tooling: developers are now viewed as primary stakeholders in safeguarding software. This contrasts with earlier models where specialised security teams acted as gatekeepers. By aligning security functions with development workflows, tools like Aikido aim to reduce friction while improving risk visibility.

For investors, the deal is a signal that cybersecurity remains a fertile ground for innovation, particularly where AI and automation intersect with foundational development practices. As software becomes more complex and distributed, demand for real-time, integrated security controls will only rise.

Aikido’s unicorn milestone is less about the label and more about the validation of a model that places developers at the centre of security. If successful, this approach could influence how future security platforms are built and adopted across the industry.

            <h2>When shopping stops being a place</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past few years, artificial intelligence has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of models. Bigger models, faster models, smarter models. More recently, the focus shifted to agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and acting autonomously.

Yet the real leap in usefulness does not happen at the model level, nor at the agent level. It happens one layer above, at the level of Skills.

If models represent intelligence and agents represent coordination, Skills are where AI becomes operational and valuable in the real world.

A Skill is an applied, reusable unit of procedural knowledge that allows an AI system to reliably perform a specific task from start to finish.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

In practical terms, a Skill is an intelligent application that transforms user intent into execution.

A Skill has a clearly defined purpose. It encapsulates domain-specific know-how. It follows a repeatable procedure. And it produces a concrete, usable result.

This could mean analyzing a contract and identifying risks, comparing multiple SaaS tools based on real business constraints, generating a pricing strategy using market data, or producing a financial or operational report.

Users never interact with models or agents directly. What they experience are Skills, because Skills are the part of AI that delivers outcomes.

To understand why Skills matter, it helps to look at the modern AI stack. At the foundation are models. They provide raw intelligence such as language understanding, reasoning, perception, and pattern recognition. They are powerful, but fundamentally generic.

Above them sit agents. Agents function like an operating system. They plan tasks, break problems into steps, decide which tools or models to use, and manage execution flow. They are good coordinators, but coordination alone does not equal expertise.

At the top of the stack are Skills. Skills are the application layer. They are structured, purpose-built capabilities that agents can invoke to get real work done. Just as hardware is not software and software is not an application, intelligence is not usefulness. Models are not agents, and agents are not Skills.

A Skill is not a single instruction. It is an orchestrated process. When a user expresses a concrete need, such as wanting to know which SaaS solution best fits their company, the system identifies the relevant Skill. An agent then decomposes the task into procedural steps. Requirements are gathered, data is retrieved, evaluation logic is applied, and results are synthesized. Models perform analysis and reasoning at each step, and the Skill delivers a structured outcome such as a recommendation, report, decision, or document.

From the user’s perspective, none of this complexity is visible. The Skill simply works.

One of the most important distinctions is that Skills encode procedural knowledge rather than descriptive knowledge. Large language models are excellent at explaining what something is. Skills capture how something is actually done.

This procedural knowledge may include workflows, scripts, decision logic, rules, tool integrations, and structured reasoning steps. It is what turns general intelligence into expert behavior. Agents on their own are capable planners, but they lack deep, domain-specific execution knowledge. Skills fill that gap.

This is also why Skills scale better than custom-built agents. A common mistake today is creating a new agent for every task. That approach quickly becomes brittle and unmanageable. Skills, by contrast, are modular, reusable, and composable. A small number of general-purpose agents can call a growing library of specialized Skills, each focused on doing one thing well. This mirrors how scalable software systems are built in practice.

Another critical point is that Skills are products, not just technology. They can be packaged, licensed, distributed, integrated, and monetized. Users and businesses do not buy reasoning or intelligence in the abstract. They buy capabilities. They buy outcomes. They buy the ability to make better decisions and execute faster.

As models become increasingly commoditized and agent frameworks begin to converge, the real competitive advantage in AI is shifting. It will belong to those who build the most useful Skills and control how they are distributed.

In the long run, AI systems will not be judged by how intelligent they are, but by how effectively they convert intelligence into action.

Models think. Agents coordinate. Skills execute.
