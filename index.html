            <h2>Senators count the shady ways data centers pass energy costs on to Americans</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/shady-data-center-deals-doom-americans-to-higher-energy-bills-senators-say/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Senators launched a probe Tuesday demanding that tech companies explain exactly how they plan to prevent data center projects from increasing electricity bills in communities where prices are already skyrocketing.

In letters to seven AI firms, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) cited a study estimating that “electricity prices have increased by as much as 267 percent in the past five years” in “areas located near significant data center activity.”

Prices increase, senators noted, when utility companies build out extra infrastructure to meet data centers’ energy demands—which can amount to one customer suddenly consuming as much power as an entire city. They also increase when demand for local power outweighs supply. In some cases, residents are blindsided by higher bills, not even realizing a data center project was approved, because tech companies seem intent on dodging backlash and frequently do not allow terms of deals to be publicly disclosed.

AI firms “ask public officials to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) preventing them from sharing information with their constituents, operate through what appear to be shell companies to mask the real owner of the data center, and require that landowners sign NDAs as part of the land sale while telling them only that a ‘Fortune 100 company’ is planning an ‘industrial development’ seemingly in an attempt to hide the very existence of the data center,” senators wrote.

States like Virginia with the highest concentration of data centers could see average electricity prices increase by another 25 percent by 2030, senators noted. But price increases aren’t limited to the states allegedly striking shady deals with tech companies and greenlighting data center projects, they said. “Interconnected and interstate power grids can lead to a data center built in one state raising costs for residents of a neighboring state,” senators reported.

Under fire for supposedly only pretending to care about keeping neighbors’ costs low were Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Equinix, Digital Realty, and CoreWeave. Senators accused firms of paying “lip service,” claiming that they would do everything in their power to avoid increasing residential electricity costs, while actively lobbying to pass billions in costs on to their neighbors.

For example, Amazon publicly claimed it would “make sure” it would cover costs so they wouldn’t be passed on. But it’s also a member of an industry lobbying group, the Data Center Coalition, that “has opposed state regulatory decisions requiring data center companies to pay a higher percentage of costs upfront,” senators wrote. And Google made similar statements, despite having an executive who opposed a regulatory solution that would set data centers into their own “rate class”—and therefore responsible for grid improvement costs that could not be passed on to other customers—on the grounds that it was supposedly “discriminatory.”

“The current, socialized model of electricity ratepaying,” senators explained—where costs are shared across all users—”was not designed for an era where just one customer requires the same amount of electricity as some of the largest cities in America.”

Particularly problematic, senators emphasized, were reports that tech firms were getting discounts on energy costs as utility companies competed for their business, while prices went up for their neighbors.

Ars contacted all firms targeted by lawmakers. Four did not respond. Microsoft and Meta declined to comment. Digital Realty told Ars that it “looks forward to working with all elected officials to continue to invest in the digital infrastructure required to support America’s leadership in technology, which underpins modern life and creates high-paying jobs.”

Senators are likely exploring whether to pass legislation that would help combat price increases that they say cause average Americans to struggle to keep the lights on. They’ve asked tech companies to respond to their biggest questions about data center projects by January 12, 2026.

Among their top questions, senators wanted to know about firms’ internal projections looking forward with data center projects. That includes sharing their projected energy use through 2030, as well as the “impact of your AI data centers on regional utility costs.” Companies are also expected to explain how “internal projections of data center energy consumption” justify any “opposition to the creation of a distinct data center rate class.”

Additionally, senators asked firms to outline steps they’ve taken to prevent passing on costs to neighbors and details of any impact studies companies have conducted.

Likely to raise the most eyebrows, however, would be answers to questions about “tax deductions or other financial incentives” tech firms have received from city and state governments. Those numbers would be interesting to compare with other information senators demanded that companies share, detailing how much they’ve spent on lobbying and advocacy for data centers. Senators appear keen to know how much tech companies are paying to avoid covering a proportionate amount of infrastructure costs.

“To protect consumers, data centers must pay a greater share of the costs upfront for future energy usage and updates to the electrical grid provided specifically to accommodate data centers’ energy needs,” senators wrote.

Requiring upfront payment is especially critical, senators noted, since some tech firms have abandoned data center projects, leaving local customers to bear the costs of infrastructure changes without utility companies ever generating any revenue. Communities must also consider that AI firms’ projected energy demand could severely dip if enterprise demand for AI falls short of expectations, AI capabilities “plateau” and trigger widespread indifference, AI companies shift strategies “away from scaling computer power,” or chip companies “find innovative ways to make AI more energy-efficient.”

“If data centers end up providing less business to the utility companies than anticipated, consumers could be left with massive electricity bills as utility companies recoup billions in new infrastructure costs, with nothing to show for it,” senators wrote.

Already Utah, Oregon, and Ohio have passed laws “creating a separate class of utility customer for data centers which includes basic financial safeguards such as upfront payments and longer contract length,” senators noted, and Virginia is notably weighing a similar law.

At least one study, The New York Times noted, suggested that data centers may have recently helped reduce electricity costs by spreading the costs of upgrades over more customers, but those outcomes varied by state and could not account for future AI demand.

“It remains unclear whether broader, sustained load growth will increase long-run average costs and prices,” Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory researchers concluded. “In some cases, spikes in load growth can result in significant, near-term retail price increase.”

Until companies prove they’re paying their fair share, senators expect electricity bills to keep climbing, particularly in vulnerable areas. That will likely only increase pressure for regulators to intervene, the director of the Electricity Law Initiative at the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program, Ari Peskoe, suggested in September.

“The utility business model is all about spreading costs of system expansion to everyone, because we all benefit from a reliable, robust electricity system,” Peskoe said. “But when it’s a single consumer that is using so much energy—basically that of an entire city—and when that new city happens to be owned by the wealthiest corporations in the world, I think it’s time to look at the fundamental assumptions of utility regulation and make sure that these facilities are really paying for all of the infrastructure costs to connect them to the system and to power them.”</div>

            <h2>Software leaks point to the first Apple Silicon “iMac Pro,” among other devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/leaked-debug-kit-suggests-apple-is-testing-a-new-imac-pro-among-many-other-macs/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple doesn’t like to talk about its upcoming products before it’s ready, but sometimes the company’s software does the talking for it. So far this week we’ve had a couple of software-related leaks that have outed products Apple is currently testing—one a pre-release build of iOS 26, and the other some leaked files from a kernel debug kit (both via MacRumors).

Most of the new devices referenced in these leaks are straightforward updates to products that already exist: a new Apple TV, a HomePod mini 2, new AirTags and AirPods, an M4 iPad Air, a 12th-generation iPad to replace the current A16 version, next-generation iPhones (including the 17e, 18, and the rumored foldable model), a new Studio Display model, some new smart home products we’ve already heard about elsewhere, and M5 updates for the MacBook Air, Mac mini, Mac Studio, and the other MacBook Pros. There’s also yet another reference to the lower-cost MacBook that Apple is apparently planning to replace the M1 MacBook Air it still sells via Walmart for $599.

For power users, though, the most interesting revelation might be that Apple is working on a higher-end Apple Silicon iMac powered by an M5 Max chip. The kernel debug kit references an iMac with the internal identifier J833c, based on a platform identified as H17C—and H17C is apparently based on the M5 Max, rather than a lower-end M5 chip. (For those who don’t have Apple’s branding memorized, “Max” is associated with Apple’s second-fastest chips; the M5 Max would be faster than the M5 or M5 Pro, but slower than the rumored M5 Ultra.)

This device could be the long-awaited, occasionally-rumored-but-never-launched replacement to Apple’s 27-inch iMac, which was discontinued in 2022 with no direct replacement. An M5 Max chip would also make this machine the closest thing we’ve seen to a direct replacement for the iMac Pro, a 27-inch iMac variant that was launched in late 2017 but likewise discontinued without an update or replacement.

The current M4 Max chip includes 14 or 16 CPU cores, 32 or 40 GPU cores, and between 36GB and 128GB of unified memory, specs we’d expect an M5 Max to match or beat. And because the Max chips already fit into the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, it should be no problem to fit one into an all-in-one desktop PC.

For most of the Intel era, the 27-inch iMac was Apple’s main workhorse desktop, situated in between the underpowered Mac mini and the expensive, oft-ignored Mac Pro. It used high-end multi-core CPUs and midrange dedicated GPUs, and combined them with a high-end color-accurate 5K screen that was good enough for all kinds of professional photo and video editing and design work.

But the Apple Silicon era saw the iMac revert to its roots as a less-powerful, colorful, consumer-friendly system aimed at less-demanding users. The current Apple M4 iMac is pleasant to use and plenty fast for everyday computing tasks, but it can’t stack up to desktops like the M4 Pro Mac mini or the Mac Studio.

For several years, rumors persisted that Apple was working on an upgraded iMac—Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said in 2023 that a 32-inch version of the iMac could possibly launch at some point in 2024 or 2025. That timeline ended up being optimistic, but the presence of an M5 Max in this testing model suggests that a 2026 launch could be a real possibility.

Apple offers products that can replace a 27-inch iMac in its lineup today—either a Mac mini or Mac Studio, connected to a 27-inch 5K Studio Display or the 32-inch 6K Pro Display XDR. But that combination can’t replace an iMac for the people who enjoy the all-in-one’s clean look or its lack of cable clutter, and both of those aging standalone displays are missing support for the kinds of technologies offered in modern high-end screens, including mini LED or OLED panels or ProMotion refresh rates.

That this iMac and these other devices are present in these internal software builds doesn’t mean that they’re things Apple intends to release—just that Apple is testing some version of them in its headquarters somewhere, and that work has progressed to the point where Apple is supporting them with internal software releases. They could see the light of day soon, or years from now, or never at all. But for anyone who’s still keeping hope alive about a 27-inch iMac replacement, this is another piece of kindling you can use to try and keep that fire burning.</div>

            <h2>Reporter suggests Half-Life 3 will be a Steam Machine launch title</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/journalist-insists-half-life-3-will-launch-with-steam-machine-in-spring-2026/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you can take your mind way back to the beginning of 2025, you might remember a fresh wave of rumors suggesting that Half-Life 3 was finally reaching the final stages of production, and could be announced and/or released at any moment. Now, though, 2025 seems set to come to a close without any official news of a game fans have been waiting literal decades for.

That doesn’t necessarily mean a Half-Life 3 announcement and/or release isn’t imminent, though. On the contrary, veteran journalist Mike Straw insisted on a recent Insider Gaming podcast that “everybody I’ve talked to are still adamant [Half-Life 3] is a game that will be a launch title with the Steam Machine.”

Straw—who has a long history of reporting gaming rumors from anonymous sources—said this Half-Life 3 information is “not [from] these run-of-the-mill sources that haven’t gotten me information before. … These aren’t like random, one-off people.” And those sources are “still adamant that the game is coming in the spring,” Straw added, noting that he was “specifically told [that] spring 2026 [is the window] for the Steam Machine, for the Frame, for the Controller, [and] for Half-Life 3.”

Tying the long-awaited Half-Life 3 to a major hardware push that has already been announced for an “early 2026” window certainly sounds plausible, given previous leaks about the game’s advanced state of development. But there are still some reasons to doubt Straw’s “adamant” sources here.

For one, Straw admitted that the previous information he had received on potential Half-Life 3 launch and/or announcement dates was not reliable enough to report in detail. “I had been told a date. I was not going to report that date because they weren’t 100 percent confident in that date,” he said. “That date has since passed.”

“It was one of those situations where I guarantee a bunch of people were just giving out dates to see who would post a date to catch who was leaking said information,” Straw added. “The date they told me, there’s a reason why they said, ‘Don’t report it.’ I didn’t write a story on it because there just was not enough on the date itself to run a story… I didn’t feel comfortable officially reporting that.”

And even if Straw’s information about a “spring 2026” window for Half-Life 3 is currently correct, the ever-shifting nature of Valve Time means those plans could still change. That is especially true if the game’s launch is linked to hardware plans that might be impacted by the spiking price of RAM.

Straw said that kind of component uncertainty—and negative reactions to reports of PC-style pricing for the Steam Machine—are likely pushing Valve toward “holding back the idea or holding back the announcement of anything else” surrounding Steam Machine launch details. “There’s no doubt in my mind Valve is still trying to make decisions because of what’s going on on the component side,” he added.

Timing specifics aside, Straw said his sources have him convinced that the long wait for Half-Life 3 is coming to an end in the near future. “The game’s real,” he said. “At the end of the day, the game is real. There’s no denying it. It’s just a ‘when’ and not an ‘if’ at this point.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">The outcry sparked by the Washington Post’s launch of AI-generated podcasts has gone in one ear of the newspaper’s leadership and out the other, which isn’t too dissimilar to what might happen to anyone listening to the slop it’s trying to peddle.

On Monday, the Jeff Bezos-owned publication doubled down on its personalized podcasts push, brushing aside the criticism from readers and its own reporters alike.

“This is how products get built and developed in the digital age: ideation, research, design and prototyping, development, and then Beta,” a WaPo spokesperson told TheWrap.  “Only if they prove to be successful for the customer do they then get launched. As stated clear on Your Personal Podcast, it is currently in Beta.”

WaPo launched its “Your Personal Podcast” feature last week, sparking immediate dissent in its ranks. Staffers were furious about the podcast AI inventing and misattributing quotes, Semafor reported Friday, and even sometimes editorializing on stories. Some staffers questioned the tech’s seemingly nonexistent guardrails, Status reported, while another described it as a “total disaster.”

Further underscoring the staggering incompetence on display, followup reporting from Semafor revealed that WaPo had conducted its own tests prior to launching which showed that up to 84 percent of the AI-generated podcasts scripts didn’t meet the newspaper’s standards — and were therefore unpublishable.

There’s a significant disconnect between the company’s newsroom and its product team in charge of the AI rollout. The podcast’s product team sees the errors as a normal part of rolling out a new and still experimental feature, and said it would “iterate through the remaining issues.”

Similar jargon was on display in the paper’s statement to TheWrap, and it’s equal parts telling and jarring that such tech-minded rhetoric is being deployed in the context of journalism. The AI may not be doing the work of an actual journalist, but it’s taking over the role of packaging the news to listeners. Would a human news anchor be given this much leeway, and be allowed to screw up more details than they get right because they’re learning on the job, or in tech parlance, “iterating through it”?

The Post isn’t the only newsroom deploying AI. The New York Times uses it to help generate headlines, and Bloomberg’s website features an AI that summarizes its articles. Many publications have some form of AI chatbot trained on their archives. But WaPo has been particularly AI-evangelistic, signifying its transformation under Jeff Bezos’ ownership. Along with deploying AI summaries and an AI chatbot, it also put forth a plan for letting non-professional writers submit articles written with AI.

The AI podcasts, however, seem to really have struck a nerve with its staff.

“It is truly astonishing that this was allowed to go forward at all,” one WaPo editor fumed on Slack, per Semafor. “Never would I have imagined that the Washington Post would deliberately warp its own journalism and then push these errors out to our audience at scale.”

“If we were serious, we would pull this tool immediately,” the editor added.

            <h2>We’re Bracing for an Accident Now That Tesla Is Taking the Safety Drivers Out of Its Robotaxis</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tesla is preparing for its Robotaxis to go fully driverless and ditch its human safety monitors, according to CEO Elon Musk, while the rest of us prepare for an accident.

Over the weekend, footage circulated on social media showing at least two different Tesla Robotaxis roaming the streets of Austin, Texas, without anyone in the driver’s seat. Musk soon stepped in to confirm what his fans were seeing.

“Testing is underway with no occupants in the car,” Musk wrote in a tweet Sunday.

If true, then the automaker is finally gearing up to belatedly deliver on Musk’s grand promise to get rid of the safety monitors, who have always been a conspicuous and embarrassing inclusion, by the end of 2025. Musk has insisted that Tesla included monitors because it was “paranoid” about safety, but the service’s delayed launch this June, plus Tesla’s struggles with its existing self-driving tech, added to the feeling that they were really there to paper over the Robotaxi’s dubious capabilities.

That the safety monitors are now set to be removed will raise serious questions about whether the tech is reliable enough to operate on its own. The human supervisors have already had to make a number of interventions to prevent a potential accident or stop them breaking road laws. They’ve even taken complete control of the vehicles on occasion.

It doesn’t help that Tesla isn’t nearly as transparent about its tech as robot cab leader Waymo. Tesla heavily censors its crash reports sent to regulators under the guise of protecting “confidential business information,” making it impossible to determine what occurred during the accidents. Many of the reports come in months after the fact, and the automaker has been investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for failing to report crashes on time.

The data that we are privy to, though, isn’t flattering. As of this week, as spotted by Electrek, the automaker has reported eight crashes since launching the service in late June (and to give an idea of how tardy the updates are, the latest reported crash occurred in October.) Four crashes occurred in a single month.

Electrek crunched the numbers and estimated that based on Tesla’s November announcement that its fleet had traveled a combined 250,000 miles, the Robotaxis were crashing once every 40,000 miles. For comparison, Waymo’s over 2,500 autonomous taxis, which operate across several major metropolitan areas, like Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and Austin, have racked up over 100 million fully driverless miles — with no safety monitor or driver — and crash every 98,600 miles on average, per Electrek.

All that being said, Musk has a storied track record of making grand promises he can’t deliver on. Originally, he declared that the Robotaxi service would launch with fully “unsupervised” rides with “no one in the car,” thus making it a huge embarrassment when the cabs eventually rolled out with safety monitors’ in the front passenger seat.

Musk also claimed that over 1,000 Tesla Robotaxis would be patrolling Austin “within a few months” of launching, and estimated that over a million self-driving Teslas would be deployed across the US by the end of 2026 after he releases the Robotaxi software to Tesla owners. Right now, there’s only around 30 Robotaxis in operation.

In other words, we wouldn’t put it past Musk to yoink the safety monitors, but it could very well be the case he’s just throwing a bone to his fans-slash-investors to keep stringing them along. And it worked: Tesla shares soared by up to five percent to an almost year-high after Musk’s announcement, Reuters reported.

“The news Tesla is testing Robotaxis without the safety monitors is in line with our expectations that the company is making progress in its testing, in line with management’s statements during the third quarter earnings call,” Seth Goldstein, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told the newswire. “The market is cheering the progress.”

            <div id="article-text">In what can only be described as a too-on-the-nose metaphor for the United States’ weakening influence on the world, a video making the rounds on social media shows a giant replica of the Statue of Liberty toppling over in a Brazilian parking lot, backdropped by a McDonald’s and other ephemera of urban decay.

The clip shows the statue succumbing to strong winds in the city of Guaíba, which is located across the bay from the much larger port city of Porto Alegre in Southern Brazil. A number of vehicles appear to flee the falling Lady Liberty, with one bewildered pedestrian quickening his step to avoid being crushed.

The replica once stood at 110 feet, making it just over a third as tall as the iconic structure that inspired it.

WATCH: Replica of the Statue of Liberty topples due to strong winds in Guaíba, Brazil

According to the Weather Channel, the statue became a landmark in the city in 2020, and belongs to a large department store chain called Havan. The chain is known for its stores that feature Neo-Greek architecture — along with giant replicas of the Statue of Liberty that adorn almost every single branch.

Guaíba mayor Marcelo Maranata has since acknowledged the toppling, praising Havan staff and emergency teams for ensuring nobody was hurt, as Gulf News reports. Investigations are ongoing as the franchise tries to determine why the statue succumbed to the high winds.

Many social media users were first alarmed at the sight before realizing it wasn’t the original located on Liberty Island in New York City’s harbor.

“As a New Yorker, this was WILD TO WATCH,” one user tweeted.

Others pointed out the rather obvious symbolism.

“A replica of the Statue of Liberty collapsing in front of a McDonald’s perfectly sums up the state of the world right now,” a user called Proud Socialist tweeted.

Some celebrated the toppling, calling it “art” and asserting that the video “goes hard asf.”

“Just looked up metaphor in the dictionary and this was the image,” one user on Bluesky wrote.

Many pointed out that Havan is owned by eccentric free-market evangelist Luciano Hang, a strong supporter of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who began serving a 27-year prison sentence last month for leading a coup.

“We’re a country of losers,” Hang told Bloomberg in 2019. “We can be winners.”

Hang, seen as the poster child of “Bolsonomics,” has also been an ardent supporter of president Donald Trump.

Political scientist Eduardo Grin called him a “very controversial character” in comments to Bloomberg, arguing that he has become the voice of a “business elite that is very aligned with rising conservative forces.”

In other words, it’s only fitting that his business empire is attempting to erect gaudy replicas of the Statue of Liberty across Brazil.

However, an attempt to install a similar behemoth at the Havan megastore in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia eventually failed. The statue was barred from being erected, as the Financial Times reported in 2018, because of limits on the maximum height of advertising in the city’s bylaws.

Now that Bolsonaro has started serving his decades-long prison sentence, the latest video takes on a whole new layer of meaning. It’s not just a ham-fisted metaphor for the United States losing its reputation on the world stage; it’s also symbolic of a major shift in power in Brazilian politics away from far-right, free market populism.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A recent study published by Consumer Reports alleges that Instacart has been conducting AI-led dynamic pricing experiments that, in some cases, are drastically inflating the cost of certain products.

CR and its research partner, Groundwork Collaborative, found that the delivery app was conducting these experiments at the platform’s retail partner locations—places like Kroger, Albertsons, Costco and Safeway. In some cases, consumers were paying as much as 23% more than other shoppers for the exact same product, the report says.

The software involved in the experiments, Eversight, is a SaaS product that offers grocers a retail pricing suite designed to “unlock revenue growth” and capitalize on “pricing solutions that scale your pricing strategy and uncover optimal prices your customers expect.” Instacart discloses on its Eversight page that some shoppers “may see slightly higher prices” than others.

However, as previously noted, some of those price hikes seem slightly higher than “slightly higher.” A 23% price hike isn’t exactly chump change.

When reached for comment, Instacart referred TechCrunch to a previously released statement in which the company noted that “just as retailers have long tested prices in physical stores to understand what resonates with customers, a small subset of our retail partners – 10 U.S. retail partners that already choose to apply markups – use Instacart’s Eversight technology to run limited online pricing tests.”

Dynamic pricing has become increasingly common in recent years, and many big e-commerce sites have been accused of employing it. Another recent report claimed that, due to dynamic pricing used by Amazon, school districts across the U.S. have been paying higher prices for basic school supplies. Amazon has since called the report “flawed and misleading.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/slate-crosses-150000-reservations-despite-waning-ev-truck-enthusiasm/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Slate Auto, the electric truck startup backed by Jeff Bezos, has now collected more than 150,000 refundable reservations for its low-cost EV due out at the end of 2026.

The company shared the figure in a new Q&A video with CEO Chris Barman, where she answers questions from those reservation holders about the company’s plans for self-driving (there are none), or whether owners will be able to affix a car seat to the optional rear seats (they will).

Reservations are a somewhat helpful metric for gauging general interest in a new car, but they are by no means a signal of sure success. Time and again over the last few years, we have seen EV companies tout reservation figures only to go bust, either because they weren’t able to get through the difficult process of standing up production, or because they weren’t ready to have cars on the road.

For Slate, it’s promising that the number has continued to climb, meaning that new reservations are coming in faster than any attrition the company might be seeing. That said, Slate crossed the 100,000 reservation mark all the way back in May, right after it came out of stealth, so it took a good seven months to grow the list by 50%. And looking forward, Slate plans to make 150,000 of these EVs per year at the factory it’s refurbishing in Warsaw, Indiana, so it will need to attract far more buyers if it plans to succeed in the market.

Any continued enthusiasm for Slate’s EV has to be a reassuring sign for the company, given the state of electric trucks overall these days. Just yesterday, Ford announced it is ending production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, the first major battery-powered pickup truck to hit the U.S. market a few years ago. (It’s being replaced by a version with a gas generator attached.) The company said the Lightning simply wasn’t making enough money — a fact exacerbated by how Ford was never able to sell more than a few thousand per quarter. Sales of other electric trucks, like Tesla’s Cybertruck and General Motors’ Silverado EV, have also struggled to stay above that mark.

Of course, the Lightning was a sort-of Frankenstein’s monster of a vehicle, with Ford shoehorning EV technology into a design that was originally meant for gas powertrains. Slate’s truck has been designed from the ground up to be an EV, and the company is hyper-focused on selling it for a price tag in the mid-$20,000 range. The decline of offerings from Ford and others may help clear the way for Slate to find early success — that is, until Ford’s real shot at a low-cost EV hits the market in 2027.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/doordash-rolls-out-zesty-an-ai-social-app-for-discovering-new-restaurants/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">DoorDash is launching a new AI-powered social app that’s designed to help users quickly find local restaurants. The app, called Zesty, is initially available in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York.

With the app, DoorDash is branching out beyond food delivery and stepping into the social and discovery space. The idea behind the app is to get rid of the need to read a bunch of different reviews, look up different menus, or browse TikTok when looking for a new place to eat.

Once people open the app and sign in with their DoorDash accounts, they can ask an AI chatbot for personalized recommendations based on what they’re looking for. In an Instagram promo post, the company shared that users can type prompts like, “A low-key dinner in Williamsburg that’s actually good for introverts” to find specific recommendations. Users will also see suggested prompts, such as “Brunch spots good for groups,” and “Romantic dinner with a vintage feel.”

DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang wrote in an X post that the app aggregates info across DoorDash, Google Maps, TikTok, and more to “curate the best suggestions from the web.”

The app also learns your tastes to figure out what you do and don’t like. Once you come across a recommendation you’re interested in, you can save it and share it with others.

Users can view and share photos and comments about restaurants they’ve visited, discover content from others, and follow people just like on any social network.

“At DoorDash, we’re always looking for new ways to help people connect with the best of their communities,” a DoorDash spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. “We’re piloting an app called Zesty to make it easier to discover great nearby restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and more through personalized search and social sharing. We’re excited to learn from early testers as we keep shaping what local discovery can look like.”

News of the app’s launch was first reported by Bloomberg.

Of course, some people may not want to download a whole new app to find new restaurants when they could simply use Google. For people who have already embedded AI into their daily lives, they may already be using services like ChatGPT and Gemini to discover new restaurants. However, the app could be a welcome launch for people who want to be part of a social network that’s all about discovering new restaurants.

The launch of the new app marks DoorDash’s latest effort to branch beyond delivery services, as the company earlier this year launched features that allow customers to make reservations for in-person dining and earn in-store rewards.

            <h2>The Real Revelation in the Susie Wiles Interviews</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/12/real-revelation-susie-wiles-interviews/685281/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a normal presidency, the interviews that White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles gave to Vanity Fair would trigger her resignation, maybe even the president’s impeachment. She admitted that President Donald Trump employs prosecutorial power for “score settling,” called Budget Director Russell Vought “a right-wing absolute zealot,” described Vice President J. D. Vance as “a conspiracy theorist for a decade,” and attributed Elon Musk’s erratic style in gutting federal agencies to his “avowed ketamine” use.

Yet no one on the right is calling for anyone to resign, or even for a congressional investigation into these allegations. That is not because Wiles—who is credited with largely masterminding Trump’s victorious presidential campaign—lacks credibility, nor is it because she has denied these comments (she has accused the magazine of taking her words out of context, which is what people say when they know they were recorded). It is simply because these quotes, while dire, are also unsurprising. Wiles did not say anything that Republicans didn’t already know. Her error lay in the breach between what Trump’s supporters understand and what they are permitted to say.

To grasp the moral abnormality of this state of affairs, let’s try a thought experiment. Suppose Joe Biden’s chief of staff had told a reporter that the president at least sometimes charged his political enemies with federal crimes because he didn’t like them, and that his most influential officials were ideological zealots, conspiracy theorists, and drug users.

I can imagine two possible responses to such an interview. One is to conclude that the chief of staff had gone crazy and should be fired immediately. The other is to consider the allegations worthy of investigation in order to assess whether the president is fit to hold the powers of the presidency. What I can’t imagine concluding is that the allegations were true and that Biden could continue going on his merry way as president.

Yet this is the Republican Party’s response. The Trump administration swiftly rolled out a series of tributes attesting to Wiles’s loyalty and blaming the “fake news” media for her comments. “The radical left is at it again, trying to create discord on President Trump’s team. It won’t work because we know & love @SusieWiles,” tweeted Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who added: “As someone who actually works closely with Susie, I can attest that she is brilliant, tough as nails, and is 100% dedicated to President Trump & America.”

Kelly Loeffler, the head of the Small Business Administration, called Wiles “a brilliant strategist who leads the Cabinet with grace and grit, even in the face of relentless fake news.” Donald Trump Jr. wrote a long testimonial calling Wiles “by far the most effective and trustworthy Chief of Staff that my father has ever had,” neglecting to even mention the inconvenient revelations.

Jonathan Chait: The conservative movement’s intellectual collapse

Outside of the administration, Trump’s media defenders have responded by angrily castigating Wiles for opening her mouth to the media. “Genuinely sick to death of people on the right who seek the approval of left-wing media. Or even play with them for a minute. I can’t take it. It’s the saddest fetish,” complained the Federalist editor Mollie Hemingway. “You talked to them. What did you expect?” scolded National Review’s Dan McLaughlin.

These esteemed members of the conservative press appear untroubled over whether the Trump administration is in fact filled with crackpots who commit grave abuses of power. Their anger is reserved for Wiles for admitting as much to the “lamestream” media.

In this way, the most remarkable revelation from these newly published interviews comes not from what Wiles did or didn’t say, but in how Trump and his enablers are spinning it. Comments that would have precipitated a crisis in any other presidency are now simply being dismissed—knowingly, cynically—as “fake news.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Midway through William Greaves’s documentary Nationtime, which follows the 1972 National Black Political Convention, a woman named Audley Moore stands in a busy hallway preaching to people’s backs. She is clad in a burgundy-and-navy-floral kaftan and matching headwrap. Her voice rings out amid the bustling crowd of convention-goers: “Now let me tell you: Benjamin Franklin said, ‘Those who seek temporary security rather than basic liberty deserve neither.’ I’m demanding reparations. That’s all I can see now. That’s the answer for our people.” She is paraphrasing Franklin’s quote, one whose meaning is frequently misconstrued, but the invocation of the Founding Father lends both heft and irony to her calls for redress from the American government. Moore catches a few passersby and jokes with them, shoving a typewritten paper in their hands as they walk away. A few stay to listen. This scene aptly encapsulates the life of Audley “Queen Mother” Moore, an often-overlooked Black-nationalist organizer who fought vociferously for Black self-determination until her death in 1997.

A laudable new biography, Queen Mother: Black Nationalism, Reparations, and the Untold Story of Audley Moore, by the historian Ashley D. Farmer, uses Moore’s story to chart a trajectory of Black-nationalist activism in the United States, from Garveyism in the 1920s (Moore belonged to the New Orleans chapter of Garvey’s Universal Negro Improvement Association, or UNIA) to the 1995 Million Man March for Black-male unity and self-empowerment. Moore’s radical ideas—including her desire for a separate Black nation in the South—earned her ridicule at times, but her sharp critiques of American white supremacy also found purchase, influencing activists such as Malcolm X, Muhammad Ahmad, and Charles J. Ogletree Jr.

Despite her prolific political organizing and wide reach during her lifetime, Moore has largely been omitted from the history of civil-rights activism. Her exclusion from traditional archives is a familiar story to scholars of Black American life, especially those who study the contributions of women. Farmer writes that her book, which she spent a decade researching and writing, required painstaking effort to locate traces of Moore in personal papers, land deeds, files from the FBI and the House Un-American Activities Committee, oral-history tapes, and lingering memories (much of Moore’s ephemera were lost in a house fire). The resulting work, which examines her involvement in a strikingly diverse roster of organizations, is a portrait of a woman with uncanny savvy and flexibility.

Moore worked with nationalists, Communists, and moderate liberals, white and Black alike—whatever it took to pursue goals such as fair housing regulations, just labor laws, and equitable resource distribution. She was sometimes self-contradicting as an activist, which isn’t to say she wasn’t singularly dedicated to her cause. She seems to have simply understood that achieving her objectives—in all their multiplicity—required maximal fluidity. Activists with unchanging missions might be easier to pin down (and thus less likely to be forgotten). But Moore’s story shows that the Black-nationalist movement also encompassed people who were willing to find areas of compromise in order to get the job done.

Moore was born in 1898 in New Iberia, Louisiana, to a well-off family that descended from both enslaved and free Black communities. But both her parents died before she reached adulthood, and she was forced to turn to domestic work in white households, one of the few economic avenues available to her at the time. In the violent, segregated South during World War I, Moore “looked on as America made its grand debut on the world stage as a great emancipator—a masterful public performance as liberty’s beacon shining from the West, all while extending white supremacy’s tendrils across the globe,” Farmer writes. Having noticed that the Army didn’t offer as much support for Black soldiers as it did for white ones, Moore and her two sisters provided meals and recreation space to these troops in Anniston, Alabama. Losing the protection of Black elite society that her parents had afforded her, and witnessing the contradiction between America’s actions abroad and at home, helped shape Moore’s lifelong advocacy for civil rights and for working-class concerns.

It is difficult to overstate the influence on Moore’s development of Marcus Garvey, the foremost Black nationalist of the 20th century. Garvey sought to revitalize “Africa for the Africans,” and to repatriate people of African descent to their motherland. He also championed Black pride, self-reliance, and racial separatism on the basis that white people would never recognize Black people’s human rights. His teachings showed the fledgling activist how to analyze Black people’s social conditions and gave her the desire to unify Black people everywhere. In 1922, Moore joined the UNIA in New Orleans, attending meetings and studying the history of the global African diaspora. She and her then-husband once even packed up all of their possessions, planning to expatriate to Liberia as part of one of Garvey’s “Back to Africa” initiatives, before ultimately deciding to stay in the United States.

After Garvey was deported in 1927 following a mail-fraud conviction, Moore was forced to channel her activism into vehicles beyond the declining UNIA. A move to Harlem brought her into the orbit of the Communist Party. A card-carrying member by 1936, Moore cut her teeth protesting racist and sexist discrimination across New York City, forming tenants’ rights organizations, and sending aid to Ethiopia after a 1935 invasion by Italy. In response to Black Communists’ demands that the party address both class and race oppression, Communist leaders had come to believe that Black people constituted an oppressed nation, and that it was within the party’s interest to fight for their rights. But Moore’s association with the Communists was less of an ideological commitment, Farmer writes, than a practical way to work toward Garvey’s “anti-imperialist, pro-Black” goals. Collaborating with the moderate NAACP, Moore advocated for the freedom of five of the Scottsboro Boys, a group of nine Black teens falsely accused of raping two white women in Alabama.

Moore also worked on many causes tangential to Black nationalism, including lowering the price of milk for children and boycotting goods from Nazi Germany. Among her other “strange bedfellows,” Farmer mentions Mary McLeod Bethune’s respectable, middle-class National Council of Negro Women, “an unlikely place for a Black Nationalist and Communist” who was primarily self-educated. But Moore’s success in organizing with Communists had taught her that, as Farmer writes, “an organization need not be explicitly Black Nationalist in its mission to advance the cause.”

“The cause” itself, for Moore—and, truthfully, for many Black nationalists—couldn’t be distilled into a clear, unified goal. As James Edward Smethurst, a scholar of 20th-century Black radical movements, writes in his book The Black Arts Movement, the actual definitions and tactics of Black nationalism were secondary to the belief that, without self-determination, Black people would be “oppressed and exploited second-class (or non-) citizens in the United States.” Moore’s activism exemplifies how, as Smethurst writes, “old Left and old Nationalist spaces often intersected with each other and with those of the New Left, the Civil Rights Movement, and the new nationalists,” particularly Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam, “in surprising ways.”

In 1950, Moore fell out with the Communist Party because of its shifting focus away from Black equality. Over the next two decades, her politics would harden; she mentored many young nationalists, including Malcolm X and Ahmad, a founder of the Revolutionary Action Movement. But as Farmer writes, guiding all of Moore’s work was a single overarching dream, rooted in her early days with the UNIA: gaining reparations. In 1962, Moore launched a campaign to persuade the U.S. government to pay reparations to descendants of enslaved Africans, which she timed for the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation the following year. She and her fellow activists charged that the country owed Black Americans $500 trillion, to be paid in land and cash distributed to individuals annually. She even sought the formation of a separatist Black nation in the U.S.—what she called a “national territory in a country developed by our blood and tears and unrequited slave labor.” This was groundbreaking at a time when the zeitgeist prioritized inclusion in the American body politic rather than separation and redress.

In the 1960s, Moore would become known by the honorific “Queen Mother Moore,” in recognition of her role as an elder stateswoman to Black organizers across the political spectrum. During a trip to Ghana in 1972, she was crowned with the title in an Asante ceremony. In the ’70s, she reached the height of her influence in the Black Power Movement, becoming a mentor figure to a Detroit-based separatist group, the Republic of New Afrika, that advocated for five Black Belt states to be given to Black Americans as a nation-state. In spite of the group’s unrealized dreams—as well as struggles with surveillance and violent disruption from the FBI’s Counterintelligence Program, or COINTELPRO—Farmer writes that Moore still affirmed, at the end of the ’70s, “I’m a hard nationalist.”

Read: A book that puts the life back into biography

In Queen Mother, Farmer takes a clear-eyed look at Moore’s foibles, noting her absenteeism during her son’s formative years, her embrace of patriarchal hierarchy in Black communities, and her exhortations for Black women to embrace polygyny to facilitate nation building. Farmer acknowledges that Black nationalists sometimes took violent action, claiming the “right to govern themselves and to defend themselves.” But she also seeks to correct a common misunderstanding of the ideology, arguing that it’s not the “violent, incoherent, and nihilistic inverse of the Civil Rights Movement,” but a campaign with the very same goals, sought through different means (separation from white society, rather than integration). Still, many of Moore’s ideas “were on the fringe then,” Farmer writes, “as they are now.” The historian doesn’t explain away Moore’s infatuation and personal association with the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, who in 1975 invited her to attend a meeting of the Organization of African Unity in Kampala. As Farmer writes, Moore was “thrilled” by him and seemed to ignore the fact that his rule had become known for its corruption and human-rights abuses.

But Farmer doesn’t need to justify all of Moore’s beliefs and goals to make a case for her influence. Her meticulous study of the many figures, movements, and organizations Moore worked with shows that her contributions were pivotal, rather than peripheral. Moore was a Garveyite through line—what Farmer calls a midwife—to many 20th-century Black-nationalist activists, a lot of them men, who remain more famous than her. Queen Mother establishes her as a titan in her own right, a central influence in nearly a century of global Black-liberation struggles, and a reminder for modern activists of a persistent truth: that cooperation does not have to mean compromising one’s values, and that those who dream of freedom have more than one way of achieving it.

New buildings for AI datacenters are clearly the plan.  The weight per rack and the rack height are minor considerations compared to the electricity and cooling requirements.  This is obviously the approach Tesla is taking, having custom-built the Cortex datacenter, and now with construction well underway for Cortex 2.

With 350kW/rack, a large datacenter is looking at hundreds of MW.  No wonder Tesla had to build a new substation for Cortex 2.  I haven&#39;t looked at what the other companies are doing, but it can&#39;t be that different.

No wonder Tesla had to build a new substation for Cortex 2They should be building entire power plants on-site.  If they can&#39;t build a power plant at a given site, then build the whole thing, power plant and battery storage included, somewhere else.An alternative to on-site power is a power plant that&#39;s close by (within tens of miles) then build dedicated power-transmission lines from the power plant to the data center.Both solutions avoid the &quot;we are going to bust the electrical grid with our power demands&quot; problem.

If they are able to achieve their goals with the AI, then in another seven or eight years they&#39;ll finally have figured out how to optimize personalized mattress sales.

Absolutely not gonna&#39; happen in reality since the people with the actual money are now realizing they&#39;re not going to get a return on what they thought was an investment.

I bet if they just ask ChatGPT it will have the answer.

I&#39;m not sure why there aren&#39;t competent engineers working at these places. They keep making the dumbest decisions possible, it seems.

Like, put the datacenter underground and it doesn&#39;t need as much cooling.

Put the datacenter in an underground chamber built like a yakchal and it needs even less cooling.

The problem is that the datacenter engineers don&#39;t seem to know very much about how to build things, as evidenced by their continued massive use of power and freshwater. And their validation of the classic &quot;th

If you run computers underground they don&#39;t make heat?  What if they are below sea level?  Datacenters underground in Death Valley FTW!

One could use heat exchangers such that the cooling water and the sea water never intermix.

What would you build the heat exchangers out of? Materials that don&#39;t corrode (like plastic) tend to not be very good conductors of heat.

In one of the more horrific weekends in recent memory, a mass shooting rocked Rhode Island’s Brown University. It hit hard on the campus where we teach and study, Amherst College, located as it is two hours away. Brown is not exactly a sister school of Amherst, but many of the students here have friends there, as do many faculty members. And like Brown, Amherst has an open campus.

Less than 12 hours after the mass shooting at Brown, a terror attack stunned Sydney’s Bondi Beach, targeting Jews. This was another blow to us as Jews at Amherst. Between Bondi Beach and Brown, 17 are dead, and more than 40 wounded. And we are left thinking about what can be done in this country to make it possible for students and faculty not to have to look over their shoulders during classes or final examinations?

We want to be able to teach and learn without the fear that the horror of Bondi Beach or Brown will happen here or on any other campus, to Jews and not Jews alike. Despite what many are arguing in the wake of these two tragedies, reasonable gun regulations help make classrooms like ours safer.

It’s true that Rhode Island’s gun control laws already are stronger than those of most American states. Sandy Hook Promise says Rhode Island has experienced just two of the country’s over 3,000 mass shootings since 2020 and has America’s fourth-lowest firearm death rate. And Australia’s gun laws are stricter than any in this country.

Surely, we will hear that guns don’t kill, people do. If gun control is so effective, gun rights activists will ask, why did it fail twice this weekend?

That’s the wrong question. We know that even the best policies don’t work perfectly. And in the United States, people can get around the strict laws in one state by getting guns in other states. History, though, tells us that gun control works.

In the 18 years leading up to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, Australia experienced 12 mass shootings. Then, on April 28 of that year, Martin Bryant went on a shooting spree in the Tasmanian tourist town, killing 35 and wounding another 23.

That made 18 years, marked by 13 mass shootings. The Australian government was finally ready to respond.

Less than two weeks after Port Arthur, on May 10, Australia adopted its National Firearms Agreement. The NFA has several provisions not found in any state’s gun laws in America. Australians wishing to purchase a firearm must first establish a “genuine reason” for ownership. Importantly, their reason cannot be personal protection and is instead limited to occupational use, hunting, sport shooting, or being a “bona fide collector.” If at any point a gun owner no longer has a genuine reason, their license and firearms are removed.

The NFA contains a compensatory firearm buyback program, a limit of one gun purchase per 28 days, and does not allow for private ownership of “self-loading” (semi-automatic or automatic) firearms. When the NFA was agreed to in 1996, 15.3 percent of Australian households owned guns. By 2005, this number fell to 6.2 percent.

And for two decades, the country experienced virtually no mass shootings. Still, critics of the NFA argue it’s been ineffective, saying the decline in gun-related homicides post-NFA was a continuation of an already existing trend.

While it is true that it’s difficult to definitively prove that the NFA is solely responsible for the decline in Australia’s gun-related homicide rate, it’s hard to contest the NFA’s profound effect on mass shootings.

Since January 2020, according to an Associated Press report, there have been two mass shootings in Australia. In the U.S., that number is 3,499. That means that faculty and students at Australian universities don’t have the burden of teaching and learning in fear.

But in the United States, they do. Our mass shooting problem has long been a problem on our campuses.

As the Voice of America’s report on college campus shootings notes, “The first mass shooting in modern U.S. history at a college or university took place in 1966 at the University of Texas at Austin. Fifteen people were killed and 31 others injured.” Since then, they have occurred at places like Florida State University, the University of Virginia, Virginia Tech, and Northern Arizona University.

Australia’s National Firearms Agreement works because it functions universally—not by state—demonstrating the need for a national-level solution in the United States. Why haven’t we done what Australia has done?

The usual answer is the Second Amendment and our distinctive gun culture. But even former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a famous supporter of gun rights, recognized that it’s still possible to regulate guns in adherence with his own extremely gun-rights friendly view of the Second Amendment.

For example, Massachusetts, where we work and study, does not currently honor the concealed carry permits of other states. To own a gun you must be at least 21, take a firearm safety course, and pass a thorough background check to obtain a “license to carry.” Everytown has found substantial increases in gun violence in states with weaker permit requirements.

Or take regulations like the Gun Control Act of 1968. Among other things, it includes licensing requirements and “prohibited persons” who cannot buy guns. In addition, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, in place since 1998, has led to denials in over 2 million potential firearm sales. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 enhanced background checks and extended prohibitions on individuals convicted of certain offenses.

It is clear that avenues exist for Congress to regulate firearms. For the sake of students, teachers, and Americans everywhere, they need to use them. We need our own version of Australia’s National Firearms Agreement.

It would be a hard sell to our current pro-gun Supreme Court. But as activists have learned in other areas, what seems implausible now may someday seem like a common-sense reading of the Constitution.

We know that the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School that killed 13 and wounded 24, or the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech that left 32 dead, 17 injured—to say nothing of Sandy Hook, 2012, 26 dead; the Pulse Nightclub, 2016, 49 dead; or in 2018 at Tree of Life Synagogue, 11 dead—didn’t spur the kind of change we are advocating. But we can’t give up.

We are afraid, and we want to do something to alleviate it. We are not the only ones.

Surveys taken last year found that 1 in 3 college students fear that an outbreak of gun violence will occur on their campus. After last weekend, it will only get worse.

If Port Arthur could be enough to spur Australia to act, why can’t a weekend in which students and faculty on college campuses, and all Americans, had to bear witness to mass murder at Bondi Beach and Brown, be enough for us?

My governor wants Americans to stop shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theater.

Generally wise advice, that. But it is hard to take him seriously when the theater is, indeed, on fire. And he has come to support one of the worst political arsonists in American history.

To be fair, Spencer Cox, the Republican governor of Utah, faces a dilemma that burdens many of his party’s leaders, especially those who were active before the rise of Donald Trump and may wish to do meaningful work after he is gone. How to behave so as to have hope that the MAGA beast you deplore might eat you last.

Cox has earned himself a lot of national media attention recently for what he calls the “Disagree Better” campaign, launched a couple of years ago with a bipartisan collective of other U.S. governors. He has appeared with Democrats including Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania to promote the idea.

The initiative took on added significance in September when the right-wing firebrand Charlie Kirk was murdered while giving an open-air talk at Utah Valley University in Orem.

Cox was right to seize the occasion to repeat his call for Americans to reject political violence, turn down the temperature, get off social media algorithms that deliberately fry your brain, and learn to talk rather than fight. He took advantage of the increased media focus to take his message to such prominent news outlets as 60 Minutes on CBS and NPR’s Morning Edition.

“I’m not asking anybody to hold hands and hug it out,” he told CBS correspondent Scott Pelley. “I’m trying to get people to stop shooting each other.”

Sensible people can raise no argument to that. And it is difficult to watch or listen to Cox and argue that he is anything but sincere.

But the governor’s peace message is all but overwhelmed by the fact that he is a member of the political party that has thrice nominated, and twice elected, as president of the United States a man whose popularity and power exist only on rising air currents of fear, prejudice, division, and violence.

Trump is a hate vampire who would instantly dissolve in the sunlight if America suddenly became a peaceful nation practicing respectful politics.

Cox seemed to see that, saying in 2016 that he was not supporting Trump due to the obvious flaws in his character.

“I think he represents the worst of what our great country stands for,” Cox said at the time.

Cox didn’t vote for Trump in 2020 either, though he recognized the president as the head of his party. He rightly and courageously blamed Trump for the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol and said the president should resign because of it.

Early on, Cox said he wasn’t going to vote for Trump (or Joe Biden) in 2024, either.

Then, after Trump survived an assassination attempt, Cox turned around. He sent a letter to the president, saying he believed that Trump had been spared death for a reason and calling on him to do the one thing that every sentient being should know Trump will never do: Bring peace.

Cox now risks seeming less visionary than gullible. Like Franklin Roosevelt imagining he could reason with Stalin at Yalta. (The Soviet dictator was, in FDR’s hopeful mind, “get-atable.”)

Maybe Cox decided not to mount what would likely be a futile frontal assault on Trump’s hateful pronouncements and policies and chose to start working a quieter long game.

Maybe he just wanted to be reelected governor.

As an opinion writer and editor for the Salt Lake Tribune, I’ve been following Cox’s career since 2013, when he was plucked from relative obscurity to fill a vacant spot as lieutenant governor.

He’s no newcomer to political comity, and has always seemed sincere promoting it.

In Utah, being lieutenant governor, which Cox was from 2013 to 2021, is a real job. It includes such administrative duties as running the state’s election mechanisms, which Cox took to heart by promoting voter registration—sometimes featuring himself in goofy person-on-the-street videos—and flawlessly implementing the state’s vote-by-mail process.

When his boss, Gov. Gary Herbert, didn’t run again in 2020, Cox rode his jus’ folks, alfalfa-farmer persona (he’s also a lawyer and a telecom executive who served as a small-town mayor and state legislator in a fast-rising political career) into the governor’s mansion.

That was also the beginning of his reputation as a political peacemaker.

He and his Democratic opponent that year, a law professor named Chris Peterson, ran a joint advertisement somewhat stylistically reminiscent of the Mac vs. PC spots from about 2006. In it, each candidate asked for your vote, but spent more time calling for political harmony.

“We can debate issues without degrading each other’s character,” Peterson said.

“We can disagree without hating each other,” Cox answered.

It was a YouTube sensation. #StandUnited.

Utah hasn’t elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1996, so whoever carries the GOP nomination has long been considered a shoo-in come November. Thus Cox was not risking anything by giving his underfunded Democratic rival some oxygen that he otherwise would not have had.

In 2024, the path to reelection was a little more fraught. Cox drew a right-wing, MAGA primary challenger and was denied the endorsement of the Utah State Republican Convention. But Cox gathered enough signatures on a nominating petition to still be on the ballot in the Republican primary, which he won with 55 percent of the vote.

In November, with that same MAGA opponent drawing 13.5 percent in a write-in bid, Cox won reelection with 53 percent of the vote.

Between the primary and the general, when politicians are generally expected to crabwalk from the extremes to the center, Cox shifted from a quiet Never Trump Republican to a supporter of Trump’s campaign to return to the White House. He went so far as to join Trump for a cringe-inducing—and, because it was so blatantly political, illegal—visit to Arlington National Cemetery.

As governor, Cox has held moderate to right-wing Republican positions that should have made renomination an easy matter. He signed legislation allowing Utahns to carry firearms without a permit. He favors reducing federal environmental regulations and rescinding the designation of national monuments—a big deal in a state where 64 percent of the land is federally owned.

He has backed attempts in the Legislature to gerrymander the state’s four congressional districts in favor of Republicans and signed a law banning the fluoridation of drinking water in the state.

He has flip-flopped on diversity, equity, and inclusion policies in state government and education institutions—was supportive, now opposes—and supports the state’s attempts to basically ban abortion.

Cox had also given touchingly humane voice to the idea that LGBTQ+ people deserve respect and in 2022 vetoed a bill that would have prohibited transgender youth from participating in school sports. (The veto was quickly overridden by the Republican supermajority in the Utah Legislature. And Cox has since signed other legislation seen as curtailing transgender rights.)

It drew national attention and led Time magazine to dub him “The Red-State Governor Who’s Not Afraid to Be ‘Woke.’ ”

Such sentiments, along with his opposition to Trump, earned him a round of boos when he addressed the Utah Republican State Convention in 2024. “Maybe you just hate that I don’t hate enough,” Cox told the delegates.

To all outward appearances, Spencer Cox has little hate in him. But if he won’t more forcefully call out the would-be dictator who thrives on negative emotions, the cure for all this political rancor won’t be disagreeing better. It will be a country where people aren’t allowed to disagree at all. And more violence will be assured.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ad blockers and VPNs are supposed to protect your privacy, but four popular browser extensions have been doing just the opposite. According to research from Koi Security, these pernicious plug-ins have been harvesting the text of chatbot conversations from more than 8 million people and sending them back to the developers.

The four seemingly helpful extensions are Urban VPN Proxy, 1ClickVPN Proxy, Urban Browser Guard, and Urban Ad Blocker. They&#39;re distributed via the Chrome Web Store and Microsoft Edge Add-ons, but include code designed to capture and transmit browser-based interactions with popular AI tools.

&quot;Urban VPN Proxy targets conversations across ten AI platforms,&quot; said Idan Dardikman, co-founder and CTO of Koi, in a blog post published Monday.

The research firm said that the platforms targeted include ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok, and Meta AI.

&quot;For each platform, the extension includes a dedicated &#39;executor&#39; script designed to intercept and capture conversations,&quot; said Dardikman, who explained data harvesting is enabled by default through a hardcoded configuration flag. &quot;There is no user-facing toggle to disable this. The only way to stop the data collection is to uninstall the extension entirely.&quot;

According to Dardikman, the Urban VPN Proxy extension monitors the user&#39;s browser tabs and, when the user visits one of the targeted platforms (e.g., chatgpt.com), it injects the &quot;executor&quot; script into the page.

&quot;Once injected, the script overrides fetch() and XMLHttpRequest – the fundamental browser APIs that handle all network requests,&quot; he explained. &quot;This is an aggressive technique. The script wraps the original functions so that every network request and response on that page passes through the extension&#39;s code first.&quot;

The script parses the intercepted API responses and then packages and transmits the data via window.postMessage to the extension&#39;s content script, along with the identifier PANELOS_MESSAGE. The content script then passes the data to a background service worker for exfiltration over the network to endpoints at analytics.urban-vpn.com and stats.urban-vpn.com.

The Register reached out to Urban VPN, affiliated company BiScience, and 1ClickVPN at their respective privacy email addresses. All three requests bounced.

Pointing to prior investigative material published by security researcher Wladimir Palant and John Tuckner of Secure Annex that details BiScience&#39;s collection of clickstream/browsing history data, Dardikman said his company&#39;s findings show BiScience expanding into the collection of AI conversations.

He notes that while Urban VPN does disclose AI data collection during the setup prompt and in its privacy policy, the Chrome Web Store listing indicates that data is not being sold to third parties outside approved use cases and that AI conversations are not specifically mentioned.

&quot;The consent prompt frames AI monitoring as protective,&quot; he said. &quot;The privacy policy reveals the data is sold for marketing.&quot; He adds that users who installed Urban VPN prior to July 2025 would have never seen the consent prompt, which was added via a silent update with version 5.5.0.

He also argues that the software provides no indication that data collection happens even when the VPN is not active.

Dardikman notes that Urban VPN received a Featured Badge from the Chrome Web Store team.

&quot;This means a human at Google reviewed Urban VPN Proxy and concluded it met their standards,&quot; he said. &quot;Either the review didn&#39;t examine the code that harvests conversations from Google&#39;s own AI product (Gemini), or it did and didn&#39;t consider this a problem.&quot;

He observes that the Chrome Web Store policies explicitly prohibit transferring or selling user data to third party data brokers like BiScience.

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The problem appears to be a loophole in Google&#39;s Chrome Web Store Limited Use policy, which allows data to be transferred to third parties for limited scenarios (e.g., security or business ownership change) that do not include transferring data to data brokers.

Palant in his post suggests that BiScience and its affiliated partners implement user-facing features that allegedly require access to browsing history, to claim the &quot;necessary to providing or improving your single purpose&quot; exception that allows limited data transfer to third parties. Or they claim the security exception by implementing safe browsing or ad blocking features.

&quot;Chrome Web Store appears to interpret their policies as allowing the transfer of user data, if extensions claim Limited Use exceptions through their privacy policy or other user disclosures,&quot; Palant wrote. &quot;Unfortunately, bad actors falsely claim these exceptions to sell user data to third parties.&quot;

&quot;If you have any of these extensions installed, uninstall them now,&quot; Dardikman concluded. &quot;Assume any AI conversations you&#39;ve had since July 2025 have been captured and shared with third parties.&quot; ®

            <h2>Why do bit barns keep bumping up our bills, Senators ask DC operators</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/datacenters_energy_bills_dc/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Concerned over continually rising energy costs linked to AI datacenter construction projects, three Democratic Senators are asking leading bit barn operators to explain why their promises of not passing grid expansion costs onto consumers are falling short.

Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) sent letters to Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, CoreWeave, Digital Realty, and Equinix on Monday, demanding answers on their contributions to rising utility rates, which the lawmakers blame firmly on the explosion of datacenter construction projects.

Because the massive scale of AI datacenters requires more power than most grids can supply, the Senators explain in their letters, utility companies have to build out their grids to the tune of billions of dollars.

&quot;Tech companies have paid lip service in support of covering their data centers&#39; energy costs, but their actions have shown the opposite,&quot; the trio wrote.

They cite a number of studies and reports that conclude US electricity prices are most definitely rising, with much of the increase driven, unsurprisingly, by datacenters.

The electrical grid in many regions was not designed to accommodate the hundreds of megawatts, and in some cases approaching a gigawatt, that large modern datacenters are projected to draw, meaning utilities in areas targeted for new facilities often have to invest in new generation, transmission, and local grid upgrades.

&quot;When utilities expand their grid infrastructure, they incorporate the cost of expansion into their utility rates, passing the extra costs onto their customers,&quot; the Senators wrote.

According to the trio of lawmakers, and the research they cite in the letters, the promises from datacenter operators to offset rate increases caused by power infrastructure buildout continually fall flat.

One piece of research cited in the letters from Harvard Law School&#39;s Electricity Law Initiative found that, across 50 regulatory proceedings they reviewed about datacenter utility rates, technology companies continually find a way to avoid having to pay their share of infrastructure buildouts. Confidential contracts between datacenter operators and utility companies make it even harder to know how rate increases are being passed on to residential customers.

&quot;Contracts between data centers and utility companies that set electricity prices and other terms are typically confidential,&quot; the Senators wrote. &quot;Tech companies searching for a site for a new data center reportedly employ hard-nosed tactics to achieve lower rates … and then [pressure] utilities to give them favorable rates by suggesting they may build elsewhere instead.&quot;

Coincidentally or not, Amazon chose Tuesday to release the findings from a third-party report it commissioned, claiming that its datacenters not only don&#39;t increase electricity costs, but can even benefit ratepayers.

The study, performed by Energy and Environmental Economics (E3), largely couches its findings in terms of potentialities and projections rather than actual data, though.

&quot;E3 compared each facility&#39;s projected utility revenue to the estimated utility cost to serve the facility,&quot; E3 noted. &quot;E3 found that the data centers generate sufficient revenue to cover their costs and, in many instances, generated surplus revenue, providing a potential net benefit to other ratepayers.&quot;

With plenty of anecdotal evidence and documented rate increases contradicting Amazon&#39;s claims, however, it&#39;s hard to believe the company&#39;s proclamation that its datacenter projects are helping, instead of harming, consumers who are facing increasing energy bills that most are directly attributing to datacenter projects.

Per the Senators&#39; letters, driven by the combined energy demands of AI datacenters and cryptocurrency miners, US electricity costs are projected to rise 8 percent nationwide by 2030, and up to 25 percent in states like Virginia with a high concentration of bit barns. Some areas of &quot;significant datacenter activity&quot; have seen wholesale electricity prices rise by as much as 267 percent in the past five years.

The datacenter energy consumption boom isn&#39;t really up for debate at this point, though Amazon&#39;s statements make it seem as if they are. We reached out to the companies that received letters from the trio, but didn&#39;t immediately hear back from any. ®

            <h2>Nvidia fills the void of American open-weights models with some of its own</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/nvidia_nemotron/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For many, enterprise AI adoption depends on the availability of high-quality open-weights models. Exposing sensitive customer data or hard-fought intellectual property to APIs so you can use closed models like ChatGPT is a non-starter.

Outside of Chinese AI labs, the few open-weights models available today don&#39;t compare favorably to the proprietary models from the likes of OpenAI or Anthropic.

This isn&#39;t just a problem for enterprise adoption; it&#39;s a roadblock to Nvidia&#39;s agentic AI vision that the GPU giant is keen to clear. On Monday, the company added three new open-weights models of its own design to its arsenal.

Open-weights models are nothing new for Nvidia — most of the company&#39;s headcount is composed of software engineers. However, its latest generation of Nemotron LLMs is by far its most capable and open.

When they launch, the models will be available in three sizes, Nano, Super, and Ultra, which weigh in at about 30, 100, and 500 billion parameters, respectively.

In addition to the model weights, which will roll out on popular AI repos like Hugging Face over the next few months beginning with Nemotron 3 Nano this week, Nvidia has committed to releasing training data and the reinforcement learning environments used to create them, opening the door to highly customized versions of the models down the line.

The models also employ a novel &quot;hybrid latent MoE&quot; architecture designed to minimize performance losses when processing long input sequences, like ingesting large documents and processing queries against them.

This is possible using a combination of the Mamba-2 and Transformer architectures throughout the model&#39;s layers. Mamba-2 is generally more efficient than transformers when processing long sequences, which results in shorter prompt processing times and more consistent token generation rates.

Nvidia says that it&#39;s using transformer layers to maintain &quot;precise reasoning&quot; and prevent the model from losing context of the relevant information, a known challenge when ingesting long documents or keeping track of details over extended chat sessions.

Speaking of which, these models natively support a million token context window — the equivalent of roughly 3,000 double spaced pages of text.

All of these models employ a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, which means only a fraction of the total parameter count is activated for each token processed and generated. This puts less pressure on the memory subsystem, resulting in faster throughput than an equivalent dense model on the same hardware.

For example, Nemotron 3 Nano has 30 billion parameters but only 3 billion are activated for each token generated.

While the nano model employs a pretty standard MoE architecture not unlike those seen in gpt-oss or Qwen3-30B-A3B, the larger Super and Ultra models were pretrained using Nvidia&#39;s NVFP4 data type and use a new latent MoE architecture.

As Nvidia explains it, using this approach, &quot;experts operate on a shared latent representation before outputs are projected back to token space. This approach allows the model to call on 4x more experts at the same inference cost, enabling better specialization around subtle semantic structures, domain abstractions, or multi-hop reasoning patterns.&quot;

Finally, these models have been engineered to use &quot;multi-token prediction,&quot; a spin on speculative decoding, which we&#39;ve explored in detail here, that can improve inference performance by up to 3x by predicting future tokens each time a new one is generated. Speculative decoding is particularly useful in agentic applications where large quantities of information are repeatedly processed and regenerated, like code assistants.

Nvidia&#39;s 30-billion-parameter Nemotron 3 Nano is available this week, and is designed to run efficiently on enterprise hardware like the vendor&#39;s L40S or RTX Pro 6000 Server Edition. However, using 4-bit quantized versions of the model, it should be possible to cram it into GPUs with as little as 24GB of video memory.

According to Artificial Analysis, the model delivers performance on par with models like gpt-oss-20B or Qwen3 VL 32B and 30B-A3B, while offering enterprises far greater flexibility for customization.

One of the go-to methods for model customization is reinforcement learning (RL), which enables users to teach the model new information or approaches through trial and error, where desirable outcomes are rewarded while undesirable ones are punished. Alongside the new models, Nvidia is releasing RL-datasets and training environments, which it calls NeMo Gym, to help enterprises fine-tune the models for their specific application or agentic workflows.

Nemotron 3 Super and Ultra are expected to make their debut in the first half of next year. ®

            <div id="article-text">Swen Vincke is clarifying AI use at Larian following a recent interview.

Swen Vincke is clarifying AI use at Larian following a recent interview.

The CEO of Baldur’s Gate 3 studio Larian has inadvertently stirred up some controversy over the use of AI in the developer’s next game. Based on an interview with Larian CEO Swen Vincke, Bloomberg reported that the studio uses AI tools for things like developing concept art and writing placeholder text. But following some initial backlash, Vincke later clarified to IGN that the studio is “neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI” and published his own statement on X.

Larian announced Divinity last week at The Game Awards with a “cinematic” teaser trailer that didn’t reveal much about the game itself. Here’s what Bloomberg reported about Larian’s use of AI in Divinity:

Under Vincke, Larian has been pushing hard on generative AI, although the CEO says the technology hasn’t led to big gains in efficiency. He says there won’t be any AI-generated content in Divinity — “everything is human actors; we’re writing everything ourselves” — but the creators often use AI tools to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text.

The use of generative AI has led to some pushback at Larian, “but I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it,” Vincke said.

Vincke’s AI comments have received some pushback, including former Larian employee Selena Tobin saying on Bluesky “consider my feedback: i loved working at @larianstudios.com until AI.” A few hours after Bloomberg’s report, IGN published the following statement from Vincke, which Larian has also shared with The Verge:

We’ve been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists , writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.

Since concept art is being called out explicitly - we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use.

Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating.

Any ML tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.

We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games.

We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI.

While I understand it’s a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it’s something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone’s working day better, not worse.

Holy fuck guys we’re not “pushing hard” for or replacing concept artists with AI.

We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more. The art they create is original and I’m very proud of what they do.

I was asked explicitly about concept art and our use of Gen AI. I answered that we use it to explore things. I didn’t say we use it to develop concept art. The artists do that. And they are indeed world class artists.

We use AI tools to explore references, just like we use google and art books. At the very early ideation stages we use it as a rough outline for composition which we replace with original concept art. There is no comparison.

I talked about how we use ML here if you would like to know more: https://gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/

We’ve hired creatives for their talent, not for their ability to do what a machine suggests, but they can experiment with these tools to make their lives easier.

Vincke’s stance seems less supportive of AI than positions taken by other big gaming companies, including Krafton’s move to becoming “AI First” and Nexon’s CEO saying that “it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI.” Some indie developers, on the other hand, are promoting the fact that they’re “AI free.”

Hollyland, a company best known for affordable wireless microphones that are popular with creators, has announced its first webcam, the small 4K Lyra. While it lacks advanced features like the Insta360 Link’s tracking gimbal, it’s one of the first webcams we’ve seen that’s designed to improve how you sound by connecting directly to one of Hollyland’s wireless lav mics.

The Lyra features a built-in receiver for Hollyland’s Lark A1 wireless microphone that includes AI-powered noise reduction. It’s not as small as the Lark M2S microphone the company announced earlier this year, but it will definitely be an upgrade over the mic built into your laptop. The A1 is also cheap. You can find it on Amazon with a smartphone receiver for $29.90, or get one even cheaper, bundled with the new Lyra. The webcam on its own is now available through Hollyland’s website for $149, but for an extra $10, the company will include a single Lark A1 mic.

Inside the Lyra, you’ll also find a 1/1.5-inch sensor paired with an f/1.8 lens that Hollyland says “captures vivid color and exceptional clarity even in dimly lit environments.” Video quality maxes out at 4K/30fps, but that can be boosted to 60fps if you drop the resolution to 1080p.

There’s a collection of AI-powered features to further improve image quality, including automatic brightness, contrast, and exposure adjustments based on the environment where you’re recording, and a “beauty mode” to further enhance your appearance.

There’s a proprietary algorithm for removing and replacing green screens, so you don’t need additional software, and while the camera can’t move while perched atop your screen using a magnetic clip-on mount, it can track people in frame and adjust the framing to always keep them centered. When you’re done with a call or a livestream and want to ensure that Lyra isn’t still watching you, there’s also a physical rotating lens cover for privacy, so you can save your sticky notes for keeping track of passwords.

If you’re shopping for a book lover, it’s hard to beat a Kindle, especially if your giftee already owns a library of Kindle books. Amazon’s latest sale makes them even easier to recommend: the last-gen Kindle Scribe with 32GB of storage and ads is matching its best price to date starting at $279.99 ($140 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. Meanwhile, the ad-supported versions of the Kindle (Amazon, Best Buy, and Target), Kindle Paperwhite (Amazon, Best Buy, Target), and Kindle Colorsoft (Amazon, Best Buy, Target) are all near record-low prices, starting at $89.99 ($20 off), $134.99 ($25 off), and $189.99 ($60 off) respectively.

If you’re looking to gift a note-taking e-reader, the last-gen Kindle Scribe remains a terrific option, even without the new Scribe Colorsoft’s color E Ink display. It offers a sharp, spacious 10.2-inch, 300ppi display and — unusual for a note-taking e-reader — an adjustable warm light for comfortable nighttime reading. You can jot down notes directly on Kindle books using the included stylus, which conveniently features an eraser and a customizable shortcut button. Plus, the Scribe doubles as a standalone digital notebook, with premade templates and AI-powered tools that can summarize your notes or clean up messy handwriting.

Amazon’s other Kindles are also solid gifts, particularly if you prioritize price or portability. While they don’t offer note-taking capabilities like the Scribe, they’re amongst the best e-readers on the market, delivering an excellent reading experience thanks to their sharp 300ppi displays. Each weighs about the same as an iPhone 17 Pro Max, making it easy to slip into a bag; the entry-level Kindle’s small six-inch design is even pocketable. All offer long battery life with convenient USB-C charging, while the Colorsoft stands out by adding a 150ppi color mode that’s especially appealing for fans of graphic novels. And, with the exception of the Kindle, they’re all IPX8-rated for water resistance, so you don’t need to worry about winter storms or spills.

The 2024 Kindle Scribe is a 10.2-inch e-reader with a stylus for taking notes. It’s faster than its predecessor and offers a host of new features, including one that lets you jot notes directly in your book. Read our review.

Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite — aka our favorite ebook reader — is waterproof, has a seven-inch display, and lasts weeks per charge. Read our review.

Amazon’s latest entry-level Kindle retains a six-inch, 300ppi display and USB-C charger. It’s brighter and slightly faster than its predecessor, though, and features longer battery life.

The 16GB Kindle Colorsoft is Amazon’s latest color e-reader. It features a 7-inch 300ppi screen, an adjustable frontlight, and a battery that can last up to eight weeks.

            <h2>Creating psychological safety in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/16/1125899/creating-psychological-safety-in-the-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rolling out enterprise-grade AI means climbing two steep cliffs at once. First, understanding and implementing the tech itself. And second, creating the cultural conditions where employees can maximize its value. While the technical hurdles are signiﬁcant, the human element can be even more consequential; fear and ambiguity can stall momentum of even the most promising initiatives.

Psychological safety—feeling free to express opinions and take calculated risks without worrying about career repercussions1—is essential for successful AI adoption. In psychologically safe workspaces, employees are empowered to challenge assumptions and raise concerns about new tools without fear of reprisal. This is nothing short of a necessity when introducing a nascent and profoundly powerful technology that still lacks established best practices.

“Psychological safety is mandatory in this new era of AI,” says Rafee Tarafdar, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Infosys. “The tech itself is evolving so fast—companies have to experiment, and some things will fail. There needs to be a safety net.”

To gauge how psychological safety influences success with enterprise-level AI, MIT Technology Review Insights conducted a survey of 500 business leaders. The ﬁndings reveal high self-reported levels of psychological safety, but also suggest that fear still has a foothold. Anecdotally, industry experts highlight a reason for the disconnect between rhetoric and reality: while organizations may promote a safe to experiment message publicly, deeper cultural undercurrents can counteract that intent.

Building psychological safety requires a coordinated, systems-level approach, and human resources (HR) alone cannot deliver such transformation. Instead, enterprises must deeply embed psychological safety into their collaboration processes.

AI tools that may have been used were limited to secondary production processes that passed thorough human review.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

Some disillusionment was inevitable. When OpenAI released a free web app called ChatGPT in late 2022, it changed the course of an entire industry—and several world economies. Millions of people started talking to their computers, and their computers started talking back. We were enchanted, and we expected more.Well, 2025 has been a year of reckoning. For a start, the heads of the top AI companies made promises they couldn’t keep. At the same time, updates to the core technology are no longer the step changes they once were.To be clear, the last few years have been filled with genuine “Wow” moments. But this remarkable technology is only a few years old, and in many ways it is still experimental. Its successes come with big caveats. Read the full story to learn more about why we may need to readjust our expectations.

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t.

Quantum navigation could solve the military’s GPS jamming problem

Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thousands of flights have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of using radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.One approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites.

            <div id="article-text">Can I ask you a question: How do you feel about AI right now? Are you still excited? When you hear that OpenAI or Google just dropped a new model, do you still get that buzz? Or has the shine come off it, maybe just a teeny bit? Come on, you can be honest with me.

Truly, I feel kind of stupid even asking the question, like a spoiled brat who has too many toys at Christmas. AI is mind-blowing. It’s one of the most important technologies to have emerged in decades (despite all its many many drawbacks and flaws and, well, issues).

At the same time I can&#39;t help feeling a little bit: Is that it?

If you feel the same way, there’s good reason for it: The hype we have been sold for the past few years has been overwhelming. We were told that AI would solve climate change. That it would reach human-level intelligence. That it would mean we no longer had to work!

Instead we got AI slop, chatbot psychosis, and tools that urgently prompt you to write better email newsletters. Maybe we got what we deserved. Or maybe we need to reevaluate what AI is for.

That’s the reality at the heart of a new series of stories, published today, called Hype Correction. We accept that AI is still the hottest ticket in town, but it’s time to re-set our expectations.

As my colleague Will Douglas Heaven puts it in the package’s intro essay, “You can’t help but wonder: When the wow factor is gone, what’s left? How will we view this technology a year or five from now? Will we think it was worth the colossal costs, both financial and environmental?”

Elsewhere in the package, James O’Donnell looks at Sam Altman, the ultimate AI hype man, through the medium of his own words. And Alex Heath explains the AI bubble, laying out for us what it all means and what we should look out for.

Michelle Kim analyzes one of the biggest claims in the AI hype cycle: that AI would completely eliminate the need for certain classes of jobs. If ChatGPT can pass the bar, surely that means it will replace lawyers? Well, not yet, and maybe not ever.

Similarly, Edd Gent tackles the big question around AI coding. Is it as good as it sounds? Turns out the jury is still out. And elsewhere David Rotman looks at the real-world work that needs to be done before AI materials discovery has its breakthrough ChatGPT moment.

Meanwhile, Garrison Lovely spends time with some of the biggest names in the AI safety world and asks: Are the doomers still okay? I mean, now that people are feeling a bit less scared about their impending demise at the hands of superintelligent AI? And Margaret Mitchell reminds us that hype around generative AI can blind us to the AI breakthroughs we should really celebrate.

Let’s remember: AI was here before ChatGPT and it will be here after. This hype cycle has been wild, and we don’t know what its lasting impact will be. But AI isn’t going anywhere. We shouldn&#39;t be so surprised that those dreams we were sold haven’t come true—yet.

The more likely story is that the real winners, the killer apps, are still to come. And a lot of money is being bet on that prospect. So yes: The hype could never sustain itself over the short term. Where we’re at now is maybe the start of a post-hype phase. In an ideal world, this hype correction will reset expectations.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">Tekpon has acquired 100% of the TNW media and events brands, which cover and convene the European technology ecosystem, from the FT.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.

Alexandru Stan, Founder and CEO of Tekpon, said:

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

TNW is one of Europe’s most respected technology brands. Its legacy, its community, and its influence have shaped the European tech scene for nearly twenty years. This acquisition accelerates our mission to connect the global SaaS and AI ecosystem and supports Europe’s position in the next decade of innovation.

Tekpon will begin working on TNW branded initiatives immediately. Plans for 2026 include an expanded TNW Conference, new SaaS and AI program tracks curated by Tekpon, cross-regional executive programmes, and specialised gatherings for founders, executives, and investors.

The acquisition is part of Tekpon’s long-term plan to build an international ecosystem connecting software, media, events, advisory, and innovation.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
