            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the big stories of last year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas was the debut of Donut Lab’s diminutive but powerful electric motors. When I spoke with Donut earlier this year, the company told me that it was looking at applications ranging from drones to large automotive motors, but also things like wind turbines and even washing machines. Now, almost a year later, we have our first look at an electric vehicle that uses the technology, thanks to a new collaboration between Donut Lab and WATT Electric Vehicle Company.

WATT had previously developed the Passenger and Commercial EV Skateboard (PACES), a lightweight aluminum platform for low-volume EVs. Now, it’s integrating Donut’s motors, first with one for each rear wheel, although there will eventually be an all-wheel-drive variant, too.

The small EV chassis is rather intriguing—with the motors in the rear wheel hubs, the layout is even more space-efficient than a more conventional EV, which still needs to find a few cubic feet to package its drive unit(s). The two companies see plenty of potential for the platform, which they say could give rise to “multiple vehicle configurations from beach buggies to high-performance sports cars to commercial delivery vehicles.”

“The integration of Donut Lab’s revolutionary in-wheel motor technology represents a significant leap for what PACES can offer the automotive world,” said Neil Yates, CEO of WATT Electric Vehicles. “Its motors, inverter, and software systems, perfectly complement our lightweight platform philosophy. The direct, fine control of the individual wheel speeds brings an agility and that is perfectly complemented by the low mass and inertia of our chassis technology. This skateboard can produce vehicles that will set new benchmarks for EV handling.”

“WATT EV’s PACES platform provides the perfect canvas to showcase the full potential of our advanced motor technology,” said Marko Lehtimäki, CEO of Donut Lab. “The exceptional low mass of PACES allows our high-torque, high-power-density in-wheel motors to truly shine, delivering a driving experience that would be impossible with heavier platforms. When you combine our direct-drive precision control with WATT’s lightweight engineering expertise, you create something genuinely transformative, a vehicle architecture that’s lighter, more efficient, more powerful, and infinitely more engaging to drive.”

It almost makes me wish I were going to CES in a few weeks to check it out.</div>

            <h2>Bursting AI bubble may be EU’s “secret weapon” in clash with Trump, expert says</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/us-threatens-crackdown-on-eu-firms-as-clash-over-tech-regulations-intensifies/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US threatened to restrict some of the largest service providers in the European Union as retaliation for EU tech regulations and investigations are increasingly drawing Donald Trump’s ire.

On Tuesday, the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) issued a warning on X, naming Spotify, Accenture, Amadeus, Mistral, Publicis, and DHL among nine firms suddenly yanked into the middle of the US-EU tech fight.

“The European Union and certain EU Member States have persisted in a continuing course of discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines, and directives against US service providers,” USTR’s post said.

The clash comes after Elon Musk’s X became the first tech company fined for violating the EU’s Digital Services Act, which is widely considered among the world’s strictest tech regulations. Trump was not appeased by the European Commission (EC) noting that X was not ordered to pay the maximum possible fine. Instead, the $140 million fine sparked backlash within the Trump administration, including from Vice President JD Vance, who slammed the fine as “censorship” of X and its users.

Asked for comment on the USTR’s post, an EC spokesperson told Ars that the EU intends to defend its tech regulations while implementing commitments from a Trump trade deal that the EU struck in August.

“The EU is an open and rules-based market, where companies from all over the world do business successfully and profitably,” the EC’s spokesperson said. “As we have made clear many times, our rules apply equally and fairly to all companies operating in the EU,” ensuring “a safe, fair and level playing field in the EU, in line with the expectations of our citizens. We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination.”

On X, the USTR account suggested that the EU was overlooking that US companies “provide substantial free services to EU citizens and reliable enterprise services to EU companies,” while supporting “millions of jobs and more than $100 billion in direct investment in Europe.”

To stop what Trump views as “overseas extortion” of American tech companies, the USTR said the US was prepared to go after EU service providers, which “have been able to operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field.”

“If the EU and EU Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of US service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” USTR’s post said. “Should responsive measures be necessary, US law permits the assessment of fees or restrictions on foreign services, among other actions.”

The pushback comes after the Trump administration released a November national security report that questioned how long the EU could remain a “reliable” ally as overregulation of its tech industry could hobble both its economy and military strength. Claiming that the EU was only “doubling down” on such regulations, the EU “will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less,” the report predicted.

“We want Europe to remain European, to regain its civilizational self-confidence, and to abandon its failed focus on regulatory suffocation,” the report said.

However, the report acknowledged that “Europe remains strategically and culturally vital to the United States.”

“Transatlantic trade remains one of the pillars of the global economy and of American prosperity,” the report said. “European sectors from manufacturing to technology to energy remain among the world’s most robust. Europe is home to cutting-edge scientific research and world-leading cultural institutions. Not only can we not afford to write Europe off—doing so would be self-defeating for what this strategy aims to achieve.”

At least one expert in the EU has suggested that the EU can use this acknowledgement as leverage, while perhaps even using the looming threat of the supposed American “AI bubble” bursting to pressure Trump into backing off EU tech laws.

In an op-ed for The Guardian, Johnny Ryan, the director of Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, suggested that the EU could even throw Trump’s presidency into “crisis” by taking bold steps that Trump may not see coming.

According to Ryan, the national security report made clear that the EU must fight the US or else “perish.” However, the EU has two “strong cards” to play if it wants to win the fight, he suggested.

Right now, market analysts are fretting about an “AI bubble,” with US investment in AI far outpacing potential gains until perhaps 2030. A Harvard University business professor focused on helping businesses implement cutting-edge technology like generative AI, Andy Wu, recently explained that AI’s big problem is that “everyone can imagine how useful the technology will be, but no one has figured out yet how to make money.”

“If the market can keep the faith to persist, it buys the necessary time for the technology to mature, for the costs to come down, and for companies to figure out the business model,” Wu said. But US “companies can end up underwater if AI grows fast but less rapidly than they hope for,” he suggested.

During this moment, Ryan wrote, it’s not just AI firms with skin in the game, but potentially all of Trump’s supporters. The US is currently on “shaky economic ground” with AI investment accounting “for virtually all (92 percent) GDP growth in the first half of this year.”

“The US’s bet on AI is now so gigantic that every MAGA voter’s pension is bound to the bubble’s precarious survival,” Ryan said.

Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, could exploit this apparent weakness first by messing with one of the biggest players in America’s AI industry, Nvidia, then by ramping up enforcement of the tech laws Trump loathes.

According to Ryan, “Dutch company ASML commands a global monopoly on the microchip-etching machines that use light to carve patterns on silicon,” and Nvidia needs those machines if it wants to remain the world’s most valuable company. Should the US GDP remain reliant on AI investment for growth, von der Leyen could use export curbs on that technology like a “lever,” Ryan said, controlling “whether and by how much the US economy expands or contracts.”

Withholding those machines “would be difficult for Europe” and “extremely painful for the Dutch economy,” Ryan noted, but “it would be far more painful for Trump.”

Another step the EU could take is even “easier,” Ryan suggested. It could go even harder on the enforcement of tech regulations based on evidence of mismanaged data surfaced in lawsuits against giants like Google and Meta. For example, it seems clear that Meta may have violated the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), after the Facebook owner was “unable to tell a US court that what its internal systems do with your data, or who can access it, or for what purpose.”

“This data free-for-all lets big tech companies train their AI models on masses of everyone’s data, but it is illegal in Europe, where companies are required to carefully control and account for how they use personal data,” Ryan wrote. “All Brussels has to do is crack down on Ireland, which for years has been a wild west of lax data enforcement, and the repercussions will be felt far beyond.”

Taking that step would also arguably make it harder for tech companies to secure AI investments, since firms would have to disclose that their “AI tools are barred from accessing Europe’s valuable markets,” Ryan said.

Calling the reaction to the X fine “extreme,” Ryan pushed for von der Leyen to advance on both fronts, forecasting that “the AI bubble would be unlikely to survive this double shock” and likely neither could Trump’s approval ratings. There’s also a possibility that tech firms could pressure Trump to back down if coping with any increased enforcement threatens AI progress.

Although Wu suggested that Big Tech firms like Google and Meta would likely be “insulated” from the AI bubble bursting, Google CEO Sundar Pichai doesn’t seem so sure. In November, Pichai told the BBC that if AI investments didn’t pay off quickly enough, he thinks “no company is going to be immune, including us.”</div>

            <h2>Trump admin threatens to break up major climate research center</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/trump-admin-threatens-to-break-up-major-climate-research-center/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, announced that a major climate research center will be “broken up.” The National Center for Atmospheric Research, or NCAR, is a significant contributor to research on the weather, climate, and other atmospheric phenomena. The move will be a crippling blow to climate research in the US and is being widely decried by scientists.

Vought initially gave a statement regarding NCAR to USA Today and later confirmed the outlet’s reporting on social media. Calling it “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,” Vought also decried what he termed “woke” activities at NCAR. These appear to be fairly typical efforts made to attract underrepresented groups to the sciences—efforts that were uncontroversial prior to the current administration.

NCAR is primarily based in a complex on the outskirts of Boulder, Colorado, and maintains a supercomputing center in Wyoming. Much of its funding comes from the National Science Foundation, but the day-to-day management is handled by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), a nonprofit that represents 130 individual educational institutions. In addition to climate science, researchers based there study Earth and space weather, atmospheric chemistry, and their impacts on the environment and humans. NCAR hosts a series of webpages that explain its research and all the ways it helps society.

Vought indicates that the government will specifically target what were termed “green new scam research activities,” while moving other aspects of the center’s work to different institutions. The government doesn’t directly manage activities at NCAR, though, and it’s not clear whether its agreement with UCAR allows it to directly order these sorts of changes. The NSF has since released a statement that suggests it’s ready to do as ordered; it references preserving a list of critical functions that does not include climate change, and discusses divesting NCAR resources like its supercomputing center and research aircraft.

UCAR, for its part, has issued a statement indicating that the USA Today article was the first it has heard of the matter.

In many cases where the administration has attempted to take drastic actions like this, courts have ruled that they run afoul of a legal prohibition against “arbitrary and capricious” federal actions. That said, courtroom losses haven’t inhibited the administration’s willingness to try, and the time spent waiting for legal certainty can often accomplish many of its aims, such as disrupting research on politically disfavored subjects and forcing scientists to look elsewhere for career stability.

Scientists, meanwhile, are reacting with dismay. “Dismantling NCAR is like taking a sledgehammer to the keystone holding up our scientific understanding of the planet,” said Texas Tech climate researcher Katharine Hayhoe. “Everyone who works in climate and weather has passed through its doors and benefited from its incredible resources.”

Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, called NCAR a “unique and valuable asset” and emphasized the wide range of research conducted there.

Obviously, shutting down one source of information about climate change won’t alter what’s happening—greenhouse gases will continue to behave as physics dictates, raising global temperatures. But the Trump administration seemingly views everything through the lens of ideology. It has concluded that scientists are its ideological opponents and thus that its own ideologically driven conclusions are equal to the facts produced by science. Because of that perspective, it has been willing to harm scientists, even if the cost will eventually be felt by the public that Trump ostensibly represents.

Story was updated on Dec. 17 to reflect a recently issued statement by the NSF.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lab mice are subjected to countless horrors during their short lives, from being injected with cancerous cells to getting exposed to microplastics or ending up dosed with cocaine.

It’s a controversial research standard that has long been criticized by animal rights activists. Even some in the scientific community argue they deserve better treatment, much like their human counterparts in clinical trials.

And things get even worse when you learn about the lives they could be living if they weren’t confined inside a lab. As detailed in a new paper published in the journal Current Biology, researchers at Cornell University found that lab mice that were released into a large, enclosed field near the institution’s campus almost immediately became less anxious — a lesson we might all learn something from.

These “rewilded” mice behaved in dramatically different ways, even when they had an established record of anxiety.

“We release the mice into these very large, enclosed fields where they can run around and touch grass and dirt for the first time in their lives,” said senior author and Cornell associate professor of neurobiology and behavior Michael Sheehan in a statement about the research.

Beyond the positive effects of having lab mice live healthier lives, scientists suggest the data gleaned from them might become more reliable and generalizable. Scientists have long debated whether we can or should apply what we learn from lab mouse-based experiments to other animals or humans, especially when it comes to health-related research.

“It’s a new approach to understanding more about how experiences shape subsequent responses to the world, and the hope is that what we learn from these mice will have more generalizability to other animals and to ourselves as well,” Sheehan added.

To gauge anxiety in the test mice, the researchers used the most commonly used technique out there, called the “elevated plus maze.” The cross-shaped maze has an open and a closed arm. Rodents with higher anxiety seek the shelter of the closed-off arm, while those with lower anxiety generally spend more time in the exposed arm.

In an experiment, the Cornell team introduced lab mice to the maze before releasing them into the field. Once they returned from their odyssey, their behavior in the maze changed significantly.

“The rewilded mice show either no fear response or a much, much weaker response,” said first author and Cornell postdoctoral researcher Matthew Zipple in the statement.

Even mice that were reintroduced several times to the maze before being rewilded reversed their anxiety after their transition to a more natural environment.

“We put them in the field for a week, and they returned to their original levels of anxiety behavior,” Zipple explained. “Living in this naturalistic environment both blocks the formation of the initial fear response, and it can reset a fear response that’s already been developed in these animals in the lab.”

The team suggests mice may learn from having a wider range of experiences, findings that echo previous studies into the psychology of humans.

“We think this change in behavior is about agency, at its core,” Zipple said. “What I mean by agency is the ability of an animal to change its experiences in an environment through its own behavior.”

The more the mice experienced, like finding their own food or escaping from predators, the more they were able to cope with adversity.

“If you experience lots of different things that happen to you every day, you have a better way to calibrate whether or not something is scary or threatening,” Sheehan said in the statement. “But if you’ve only had five experiences, you come across your sixth experience, and it’s quite different from everything you’ve done before, that’s going to invoke anxiety.”

There might even be a lesson for humans in there somewhere: that it can’t hurt to touch grass every once in a while.

“One of the things that could be causing a rise in anxiety in young people is that they’re living more sheltered lives,” Sheehan explained. “There are conversations around modernity and our own lives that are echoed in this research that make it really interesting.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo’s self-driving taxis are at it again, this time blocking a widely trafficked street during the annual Venice Beach canals holiday boat parade in Los Angeles.

Footage of a Waymo getting confused at a narrow canal bridge was shared by local resident Ryan Light on Instagram. It shows a Waymo cautiously waiting to enter the bridge, as a single line of cars piles up on the one-way street behind it.

“One narrow bridge, an unusual amount and positioning of pedestrian chaos… and suddenly it panicked, froze and blocked traffic for a mile,” Light wrote. “All the pedestrian activity just made it shut down, though folks weren’t directly in the way.”

Along with the video, Light wrote in a comment that the wayward Waymo blocked traffic for an agonizing 45 minutes, as pedestrians shuffled to the side of the bridge so it could make its way across.

“Here and there it would inch forward, usually in a non-helpful direction,” Light observed.

Footage shows a police officer walking alongside the self-driving vehicle as it slowly tries to cross, an agonizing bit at a time. “The bridge was cleared numerous times, only to refill with pedestrians,” Light recalled. “Any movement would get the people as excited as the best floats in the parade below.”

As Waymo glitches go, it’s pretty ironic: in a sense, attempts by law enforcement to jockey the crowd around in order to clear vehicle traffic are a perfect illustration of who gets the right-of-way in US cities.

Yet until the boat parade ends, the crowd was able to hold the Waymo off — effectively creating a car-free footbridge that otherwise would’ve been traveled by “hundreds of cars,” as Light observed.

Light comes to a similar conclusion. After the Waymo passes, he has “no idea what happened to it at the next bridge, but watching a self driving car struggle with a decades old neighborhood tradition was endlessly entertaining, and more memorable than the parade (though that was great too).”More on self-driving cars: Waymo Haunted by Killing of Beloved Neighborhood Cat</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re mere days away from mysterious interstellar object 3I/ATLAS making its closest approach to Earth before it speeds back out of the solar system, never to be seen again.

The object, which scientists believe is a comet visiting from far away, is expected to come within just shy of twice the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. While that may sound like an enormous divide, astronomers are eager to point ground- and space-based telescopes at the extremely rare object during the best opportunity they’ll ever have to study it.

As we wait to hear more about those observations, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb — who has long championed the far-fetched hypothesis that the object could be an alien spacecraft coming to visit — is continuing to closely track 3I/ATLAS, while taking note of what he calls its many “anomalies.”

The main thing that got his attention was that the object’s trajectory is almost exactly aligned with the solar system’s planets, in a striking coincidence. And that’s without getting into the object’s unusually large suspected size, its close approach of several solar system planets, its unexpectedly high concentration of carbon dioxide ice and gas, and a “Sunward jet” that he suggests could be a beam designed to “mitigate the risk from micrometeorites or rocks,” among several other “anomalies.”

Now, he’s pointing to a new letter published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, in which a team of astronomers in Spain detailed the “detection of a wobbling high-altitude jet” in the interstellar comet that showed up in observations taken by the Two-meter Twin Telescope in Tenerife, Spain, between early July and September.

According to the findings, this Sun-facing “anti-tail” jet is “offset by less than eight degrees from the poles associated with the rotation axis of the nucleus,” as Loeb explained in his latest blog post, which means that “3I/ATLAS has a steady dayside and a steady nightside, which switch roles at perihelion,” or its closest approach to the Sun.

3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29, coming within 126 million miles of the Sun.

Loeb argued that it’s extremely unlikely — a probability of just 0.5 percent, according to his calculations — that the object’s rotation axis would be aligned within just eight degrees with the direction of the Sun, giving it a smooth transition from dayside to nightside.

“If not for that special alignment, the anti-tail jet towards the Sun would have been oriented at a much larger angle relative to the rotation axis and would have shown a much larger wobble in position angle than the observed value of eight degrees,” he wrote.

“With a larger misalignment angle, it could have featured prominent gaps in activity as its base exits the dayside and enters the nightside of 3I/ATLAS,” Loeb explained.

3I/ATLAS’ Sunward anti-tail didn’t disappear after it reached its closest point to the Sun, adding to the mystery. To Loeb, this would imply that there’s a “new pocket of ice near the opposite pole of the rotation axis, that gives rise to a prominent new anti-tail jet after perihelion.”

“Of course, a technological spacecraft might have a reason for aligning the outflow of gas from its thrusters in the direction of the Sun,” he suggested, arguing that “we do not have high-resolution images of the jet direction near perihelion.”

Plenty of questions remain, and Loeb hopes that “upcoming spectroscopic observations of the material” inside 3I/ATLAS’ anti-tail will shed more light on the matter.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/youtube-will-stream-the-oscars-exclusively-beginning-in-2029/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">YouTube has won exclusive rights to stream the Oscars starting in 2029, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Wednesday. The Google-owned platform outbid other contenders, including the Oscars’ longtime home ABC, ending the network’s streak of hosting the awards show since 1976 (with the exception of a brief period in the early 1970s).

YouTube’s first show will be the 101st Oscars in 2029, and its deal will run through 2033. ABC will continue to broadcast the ceremony until 2028.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The news, which marks a landmark shift for one of television’s marquee events, highlights YouTube’s growing dominance in the television space and a major shift as streaming takes on more live events. The ceremony will be available live and for free to more than 2 billion viewers globally on YouTube, as well as to YouTube TV subscribers in the United States. The move comes as Oscar ratings have steadily fallen from a peak of 55 million viewers in 1998 to closer to 20 million in recent years, prompting the Academy to explore new ways to reach audiences.

“We are thrilled to enter into a multifaceted global partnership with YouTube to be the future home of the Oscars and our year-round Academy programming,” said Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Lynette Howell Taylor in a joint statement. “The Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible — which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community.”

As part of the deal, YouTube will not only broadcast the ceremony, but also red carpet coverage, behind-the-scenes content, the Oscar nominations announcement, Academy member and filmmaker interviews, Governors Ball access, film education programs, podcasts, and more.

“The Oscars are one of our essential cultural institutions, honoring excellence in storytelling and artistry,” YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said in a statement. “Partnering with the Academy to bring this celebration of art and entertainment to viewers all over the world will inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars’ storied legacy.”

Although this isn’t the first time a streamer has acquired the rights to an awards show — Netflix has secured rights to the SAG Awards — it’s the first time one of the big four awards shows (Emmys, Grammys, Oscars, and Tonys) will leave broadcast TV entirely in favor of streaming.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/meta-is-pausing-its-dream-of-sharing-quests-horizon-os-with-third-party-headset-makers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta says that it has paused its program to share Meta Horizon OS, the mixed reality operating system that powers its Quest headsets, with third-party device makers. The program was part of the company’s metaverse push — the idea behind the program was to create a “new generation of hardware” that would give VR users their pick of devices when it came to engaging with Meta’s digital worlds.

“We have paused the program to focus on building the world-class first-party hardware and software needed to advance the VR market,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We’re committed to this for the long term and will revisit opportunities for third-party device partnerships as the category evolves.”

The news was originally reported by Road to VR.

Last April, the tech giant announced that it would be opening up Meta Horizon OS to third-party headset makers. At the time, the company said that Asus, Microsoft’s Xbox, and Lenovo, were all working on creating new hardware that would run the company’s software. “As we’ve seen with the PC and smartphone industries, consumers are best served by a broad hardware ecosystem producing both general-purpose computing devices and more specialized products, all running on a common platform,” the company said at the time.

Between the announcement of the partner program and now, there haven’t been a whole lot of updates about it. In September, at the company’s Connect event, a Meta spokesperson said that Meta was still working with its business partners to push Horizon OS into more devices.

Horizon OS was designed to deliver “mixed reality experiences,” and to communicate “social presence” through technologies like hand, body, eye, and face tracking. It launched in the days when Mark Zuckerberg still maintained that the metaverse was the “future” of his company.

Unfortunately for Horizon and the coders who work on it, Meta and its top executive have seemed less and less interested in the metaverse in recent times, as AI becomes a larger focus for the company. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the metaverse group within Reality Labs, Meta’s unit focused on VR and AR hardware, was facing potential budgetary cuts as high as 30%. The company subsequently confirmed that it was planning on “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and wearables given the momentum there.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, Cisco announced hackers are exploiting a critical vulnerability in some of its most popular products that allows the full takeover of affected devices. Worse, there are no patches available at this time.

In a security advisory, Cisco said it discovered a hacking campaign on December 10 targeting Cisco AsyncOS software, and in particular the physical and virtual appliances Cisco Secure Email Gateway, Cisco Secure Email, and Web Manager. The advisory said affected devices have a feature called “Spam Quarantine” enabled and are reachable from the internet.

Cisco noted that this feature is not enabled by default and does not need to be exposed to the internet, which may be good news. Michael Taggart, a senior cybersecurity researcher at UCLA Health Sciences, told TechCrunch that “the requirement of an internet-facing management interface and certain features being enabled will limit the attack surface for this vulnerability.”

However, Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who tracks hacking campaigns, told TechCrunch that this appears to be a particularly problematic hacking campaign since a lot of big organizations use the affected products, there are no patches available, and it’s unclear how long the hackers had backdoors in the affected systems.

At this point Cisco is not saying how many customers are affected.

When reached by TechCrunch, Cisco spokesperson Meredith Corley did not answer a series of questions, and instead said that the company “is actively investigating the issue and developing a permanent remediation.”

The solution Cisco is suggesting to customers right now is essentially to wipe and rebuild the affected products’ software, as there is no patch available.

“​​In case of confirmed compromise, rebuilding the appliances is, currently, the only viable option to eradicate the threat actors persistence mechanism from the appliance,” the company wrote.

The hackers behind the campaign are linked to China and other known Chinese government hacking groups, according to Cisco Talos, the company’s threat intelligence research team, which published a blog post about the hacking campaign.

The researchers wrote that the hackers are taking advantage of the vulnerability, which at this point is a zero-day, to install persistent backdoors, and that the campaign has been ongoing “since at least late November 2025.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The home-vacuum robot began, like most things, with war. In August 1990, the same month and year Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, three MIT roboticists incorporated the company that would eventually become iRobot, the maker of the Roomba.

In its first decade, iRobot began to assemble a small-droid A-team for the theater of combat. The Ariel defused mines; the PackBot handled bomb disposal. (Later they would be joined by the Warrior, which breached obstacles; the camera-encrusted SUGV, which handled recon; and the palm-size FirstLook, which could be thrown through a window to investigate hazardous materials.) These machines weren’t weapons, but they facilitated weaponry’s consequences. At the turn of the millennium, iRobots might be seen on cable news kicking up Iraqi dust, investigating suspicious domestic packages, and probing the ruins of the World Trade Center.

From their armature, iRobot built Roomba in 2002—a domesticated robot that surveilled, detected, and removed materials from wood floors and carpets. Roomba created the U.S. market for home vacuum robots, and home robotics in general, insofar as a general home robotics was ever realized. Eventually, things went south. Competitors took over. A 2022 acquisition by Amazon failed on antitrust grounds, and this week iRobot filed for bankruptcy. Roombas will continue to meander across wool and laminate, but under the control of iRobot’s Chinese manufacturing partner.

Roombas never really worked, not well. They got stuck on the lips of rugs. They tumbled down stairs their sensors failed to see. Cluttered spaces—which is to say, homes and apartments—caused Roombas to struggle. They tripped over electrical cords, they failed to clean in corners, and they failed to pick up debris beyond fine dust. Because of all this, Roomba owners sometimes felt the need to tidy up in advance of robotic cleanings, or to add a round of human cleaning afterward. The high-tech vacuum could seem like a wayward pet.

The Roomba also shared some DNA with its military forebears. The device builds an internal map of the home it struggles to clean, and iRobot disclosed that these ghost maps could be shared with partners. In 2022, images leaked from Roomba test units outfitted with cameras, which showed real people in their homes, including one woman on the toilet. Depending on the whims of its new owner, the innocuous robot could become a spy. Some worry that Roombas will become a swarm of covert, foreign operatives.

Roomba’s affliction inverts the hopeful spirit that it and other robots of the early aughts once held. In 2001, Segway promised to reinvent cities with its electrified stand-up scooters. Sony’s AIBO, an expensive robot dog, was meant to offer both companionship and entertainment. LEGO Mindstorms promised to teach kids to program robots. But most such products either failed or drifted into unexpected niches. (The Segway lingers as a vehicle for sightseers and mall cops.) New ones have appeared—the costly Roomba-style lawn mowers I now see in my neighborhood, for example, or preposterous humanoid AI butlers such as the 1X Neo and the as-yet unreleased Tesla Optimus, which cost as much as a small car. By any reasonable standard, the dream of everyday robotics has largely failed.

Why? Because software was easier. After 2004 or so, when the economy had recovered from the dot-com crash, consumer growth and corporate profit came from scaling low-cost, data-driven software services: Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Salesforce, YouTube, Skype, even WordPress and Blackboard. Innovation in machinery was redirected toward personal-media and communication devices. Once the smartphone was invented, it produced another surge of data-driven software products.

For most consumers, robots also promised (and delivered) far less utility or joy than, say, a social network, which was much simpler to build and run. But the robots still had value in the contexts that begat them: warfare and espionage. iRobot continued selling military products, and spun off that business in 2016. Sony discontinued its original entertainment robots, and repurposed their technologies for other consumer products. Industry found applications, too: Larger-scale robots became commonplace in factories and warehouses, where the environments are standardized and automated labor can be overseen. And iPad-on-a-stick telepresence robots became popular in hospitals, where eventually they helped deliver last rites to COVID-19 patients in quarantine.

The humble Roomba is important as a symbol of everyday robotics’ promise and its failure. Whether in The Jetsons or Star Wars, the idea that cute, autonomous devices could live inside your home has persisted. It is time to abandon that dream for good. Robots are for battle, and robots are for spying, and robots are for places where humans will not or cannot be. They are not your friends, and they will never clean your floors.</div>

would be better without capitalisation or quotation marks and maybe add some phonetic spellings into the mix and then get jamming on the auto suggestion and the word is this was a good day and a good night of fun with my family i hope everyone had fun today too i hope everyone had an this was a good day and a good night of fun with my family i hope everyone has an this was a good idea and a good thing i will try this next year as i am very excited about this new product i have made in my life i am excited a

Sure, &quot;me&quot; LOL.  As if we haven&#39;t seen these same petty insults countless times before.

You deleted the punctuation but to do it right you need to let all the ideas flow together in a run on stream of consciousness so there is no way to split the ideas apart even when reading it three times as you try to make sense of a meandering paragraph long sentence which is grammatically valid aside from some missing commas to give you a clue where the individual chunks of information are in the unorganized soup of thoughts which might even have a rational point and a period at the end.

The conventional wisdom that English prose [became] easier to read because sentences [became] shorter is wrong,

Heck, don&#39;t bother with ChatGPT... just talk to the current US administration.

I&#39;m not sure the victorians could be accused of having used a plain style. Their prose was often more contorted with more unnecessary padding words than shakespear .

https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com]

I rarely use semicolons; decades ago my teachers always used a red pen to replace them with a period and capitalize the next word. I eventually just gave up and complied with their grammar regime.

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition, I began to look round me, to see what kind of place I was in, and what was next to be done; and I soon found my comforts abate, and that in a word I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me, nor any thing either to eat or drink to comfort me; neither did I see any prospect before me, but that of perishing with hunger, or being devoured by wild beasts; and that which was particularly afflicting to me, was, that I had no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or to defend myself against any other creature that might desire to kill me for theirs; in a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco pipe, and a little tobacco in a box; this was all my provision, and this threw me into terrible agonies of mind, that for a while I ran about like a madman.

That is ONE sentence. 

But this kind of many-claused style is hardly new.  Here is the first sentence from the Gospel of Luke:

Since many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the events that have been fulfilled among us,a just as those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning and ministers of the word have handed them down to us, I too have decided, after investigating everything accurately anew, to write it down in an orderly sequence for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may realize the certainty of the teachings you have received.

Apparently this kind of structure was not uncommon in Greek of the time.

When it&#39;s profitable to the already rich. Duh.

.. it technically IS part of the executive branch.And it&#39;s still funded by fees, not congressional appropriations, yes?And the commissioners nominated by the president, approved by the Senate, yeah?

But please: feel free to resume your fetal position if you like.

If a president can dictate how the agency runs, it&#39;s not independent, is it?

We all know why this change was done. It&#39;s so the Russian asset can force the agency to revoke licenses for communication companies who report mean things about him such as him falling asleep every day or reporting his inane ramblings or calling him out on his lies.  Also, he can force communication companies to report only what he says, just like in Russia.

the point is - when has it ever been truly independent?

Name a previous President that interfered directly in their operations and decisions as the current one has and then you might have a point.

Independent doesn’t mean what you think. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

That&#39;s the job of Congress before the Republican members sacrificed their symbolic testicles at the altar of their King.

So &quot;independent&quot; agency really does mean the president can&#39;t use the agency to extort companies into punishing his &quot;enemies&quot;? Good to know... now how do we enforce that distinction?
Republicans will fight for it - when a Democrat is in office.

But hey how about that time Obama ordered an orange juice instead of coffee?

I mean they are literally doing everything they can to make sure it&#39;s permanent. To the point they want people to tattle on their neighbors for not thinking like them.

Am i the only one who&#39;s read the constitution? Every federal government agency is in one of the three branches. FCC is not legislative, it is not judicial. So it is executive. The executive branch reports directly to and is directly answerable to the head of the executive - the president.

The congress cannot legislate a fourth branch even if they wanted to. They&#39;d need a constitutional amendment for that.

For those of you playing stupid games centered around the word &quot;independent&quot;, I will suspend disbelief and assume you are simply ignorant of what the word means [wikipedia.org] in context.

In a narrower sense, the term refers only to those independent agencies that, while considered part of the executive branch, have regulatory or rulemaking authority and are insulated from presidential control, usually because the president&#39;s power to dism

The FCC has never been independent, and it&#39;s disingenuous to make it sound like they are. At least this is more honest?

This is a legal, political and normative definition, not out of the dictionary.

ISIS attacks over the past week in Australia and Syria have led some to wonder whether the Islamist terrorist organization, once also known as the Islamic State, is making a comeback.

“Actually,” says Bruce Hoffman, “it never went away.”

Hoffman is a professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations. “We defeated the caliphate,” he told me on Tuesday, referring to the stretch of land—one-third of Syria and two-fifths of Iraq—that ISIS ruled from 2014–19, until a coalition of 90 nations crushed it militarily. But ISIS itself “reverted to its roots and has emerged as a highly capable international terrorist organization” that “still poses a threat to the security of Western countries.”

About 1,000 U.S. troops are still based in Syria, mainly to fight the group’s surviving remnants. So it shouldn’t be too surprising that ISIS militiamen killed two of them, as well as an American translator, in an ambush over the weekend.

Australia is a different case; ISIS has never mounted a political or military challenge to the existing order. But antisemitic incidents have soared in the two years since Hamas’ assault on Israel; the pace of incidents since then is five times as high as in the decade before the war in Gaza got underway. Some of these incidents have been theatrical (anti-Israel graffiti), but some have been deadly—for instance last year’s burning of a synagogue in Melbourne, an event that, like this week’s mass shooting on Bondi Beach, took place around the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah.

This latest attack killed at least 15 people.

News outlets have reported that the two gunmen, a father and a son, were “inspired” by ISIS. But Hoffman suspects that the connection is more direct. The pair had recently spent time—and might have been trained—in the southern Philippines, a region he describes as a “hotbed” of ISIS activity.

The Australian people stepped up in response to the latest attack. A Syrian immigrant, the owner of a nearby fruit stand, tackled and disarmed one of the gunmen at great personal risk. More than 20,000 citizens lined up to donate blood for the dozens who were injured in the attack—most of them Jews gathered to celebrate the beginning of Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights. The Australian government also moved swiftly to tighten laws on firearms; the two shooters had bought their weapons legally.

It is hard to say how many ISIS adherents are still around and active. A “counterterrorism guide” published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence estimates between 8,800 and 13,100 (though the document doesn’t explain how it came to such precise figures). Hoffman thinks this number is too low, placing the figure somewhere between 13,000 and 20,000.

At the height of the caliphate, Hoffman says, ISIS had recruited 53,000 foreign fighters from more than 80 countries. Some were subsequently killed; many more likely deserted. But others simply moved. The ODNI fact sheet describes the organization as “a global enterprise, overseeing at least 15 branches and networks in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, as well as supporters worldwide.”

The burning of the Melbourne synagogue wasn’t even the most damaging assault by ISIS last year. In January 2024, two ISIS suicide bombers killed 84 Shiite Muslims who were attending a memorial service for Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran’s terrorist operations throughout the Middle East, on the fourth anniversary of his assassination. (ISIS is a radical Sunni Muslim group.) Two months later, agents of ISIS-K (the K denotes the Khorasan region, which overlaps parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran) planned and carried out a mass shooting at a concert hall in Moscow, killing 137 and injuring at least 100. (U.S. intelligence officials had warned the Kremlin of the impending attack, but Moscow ignored them.)

“Iran and Moscow are police states,” Hoffman said. “If ISIS can operate in police states, they can operate in Western countries”—as the attack on the open beach in Australia tragically demonstrated.

According to the ODNI document, “ISIS elements use ambushes, IED [improvised-explosive-device] attacks, kidnappings, military-style assaults, suicide operations, and targeted killings,” and the organization “encourages supporters worldwide to conduct operations in their own countries using readily available weapons.” The intelligence agency, however, adds that the group’s ability to train and deploy agents against civilian targets in Europe has been “significantly degraded during the past decade.” Certainly, its ability to mount centralized or coordinated attacks has sharply diminished.

Still, the global war on terrorism, like global terrorism itself, is far from over.

Discussions of race are everywhere and nowhere in 2025. On one hand, President Donald Trump is openly insulting Somali immigrants, describing entire nations as “shithole” countries, and insisting that the most persecuted class of humans are white South Africans. On the other, none of this is actually registering as anything other than Trump being Trump, and so when the Supreme Court agrees to revisit a foundational doctrine like birthright citizenship, too many of us shrug it off. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick spoke to civil rights attorney Sherrilyn Ifill about her recent Substack, “Is It Too Late,” in which she argued that it is not too late to save American ideals of democracy and equality, but it is assuredly too late to remain indifferent. Part of that conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity below.

Dahlia Lithwick: There is a very human propensity, especially in times of crisis, to normalize and rationalize and temporize. We comfort the comfortable, and we look for hope in norms and in institutions and in rationality. So many people have this perpetual hope that something’s going to come along and life is going to go back to 2010 or 2012. This hope says that with enough time, and even if it’s uncomfortable right now, someone else is going to come along, or some institution is going to come along, and put us in the DeLorean and we’re all going to go back. Can you talk about the ways in which American exceptionalism and the American normalization bias and the profound—just to talk about the Supreme Court as an example—American trust in institutions can get us to the point where it’s not that we don’t see the fire, we can’t even smell the smoke. You write, “everyone should be on full alert,” but you and I both know that not only are people not on full alert, I’m not even sure what could put them on full alert.

Sherrilyn Ifill: I think things are unraveling pretty fast and people will get on full alert. The only question is, when they get on full alert, will it be too late? That’s why I’m saying: “You might want to do that now.” I’ve been guilty of this as well: not ringing the alarm bell with sufficient urgency. This is something lawyers do all the time, because we’re used to finding the little interstices and figuring out how to move within these small spaces so that we can get where we want to go and so that we can make change. I was trained in that tradition—you find a way, you find a pathway, and all of that presumes the legitimacy of the framework.

I’m not a nihilist. I actually always do have hope. And I think one of the reasons I feel so clear, in this moment, is that I have no desire to return to 2010. I have no desire to return to the ’80s. I’ve been a civil rights lawyer for 35 years. The ’80s were a nightmare.

What are we returning to? I don’t have a dream time calling out to me. People will say, “When Obama was president.” I mean, really? Because most of the videos you’ve seen of police killing unarmed black men, most of that was in the second Obama administration. That was Eric Garner. That was Ferguson. That was Walter Scott running in that park. So if you’ve been doing the work that I’ve been doing, you’re always invested in the future.

I have excitement and hope in this time because as this whole thing begins to unravel, we have the opportunity to create something new. This is where the 14th Amendment is so helpful for me, because it’s one of the biggest moments of creating something absolutely new in this country, so I use it as inspiration, not only its very words and provisions and guarantees, but also to remind me that we have the right and the obligation to refound our country when it goes astray. That’s what those young kids in college during the Civil Rights Movement did. They did a version of refounding. So I don’t want to suggest that I don’t feel hope for the future. I do feel quite hopeful. But I also feel that pretending that all we need to do is just make some incremental changes to get us back to 2010 interferes with our ability to do that reset. What has been laid bare is that 2010 ain’t it.

We have some serious structural problems. As a litigator, I don’t know how anyone can purport to pretend that they know what the rules are at the Supreme Court anymore. We have a Supreme Court that not only has the power to say what the law is, pursuant to Chief Justice John Marshall and Marbury v. Madison, but they’ve now decided that they have the power to say what the facts are. That has never been part of our system of adjudication and litigation. Assigning factual findings to the Supreme Court? No, that is for the trial courts, for district courts. But we are now seeing a majority on the Supreme Court that regularly swats away the findings of the district court. That is the power of the district court. They are closest to the conflict. They can evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. They’re seeing the exhibits, the documents, all of it. It’s playing out in real time. It’s not theoretical for them. And now we have a Supreme Court that months later will swat away a two-week trial and the findings of fact over 160 pages by a district court. That’s real. That is real and structural. And it should not be dependent on the personnel of the court.

Last week was a startling and arresting moment for me in terms of the Trump v. Slaughter arguments about Humphrey’s Executor. Put aside originalism, that’s gone, there’s not even a pretense of text and history. But the idea that, “Well, you know, since agencies don’t look like they did 100 years ago, I guess we don’t have to think about them the same way.” It is so strange to see serious people pretending to be doing serious work in this serious place, when all pretense of intellectual seriousness has fallen away. Instead you have feelingsball and “How does executive power make me feel today?” There is no commitment to the principles that were laid out and in which people like you and I as institutionalists took a lot of solace. Part of what is so challenging about this moment is that by the time most Americans get around to the point that they can say the sentence “Amy Coney Barrett’s not going to save us,” or “Brett Kavanaugh is not going to save us,” it’s all going to be too late. It seems we are so committed to the principle that they are originalists, that they are textualists, that they care about a precedent, and so committed to the proposition that the U.S. Supreme Court is going to save us in the end.

The irony of it is that the U.S. Supreme Court got this reputation and the confidence of the American public after Brown. And that’s why, as much as this court is hollowing out Brown, they’ll never overturn it because that is how they became—how they got the reputation, certainly among Black people, for many decades, of being the people who come to your rescue. The shift started to happen with the Burger court in the 1980s.

So many of those who have the greatest platforms are still speaking and behaving in a way that suggests that this is something easily solved, or this is just how it goes, or we can just do this for a couple of years. But if you are watching the videos of people being chased by masked figures who claim to be federal agents, but we don’t know, and who are kidnapping people and throwing them in vans and doing this to American citizens and holding them? The danger is just there. It  is apparent. The more we treat it as though this is just Trumpism, this is Trump 2.0—all the little things that we say to tamp down the alarm are really profoundly problematic.

Many of those who have the greatest microphones frankly don’t know very much about race or racism or the history of it in this country. They want to be experts, so they play to their expertise. These are also the people who have said, “We talk about race too much. We talk about identity too much. We’re scaring people off with that. Everything’s not race.” We’ve made it seem illegitimate to talk about racism. It’s almost like you’re being soft, you’re being anti-intellectual, you’re not doing the rigorous work of politics if you’re talking about race.

In fact, race is threaded through every institutional structure of this country. And we have someone who is exploiting it every day. It’s not that I’m talking about race, it’s that he just stood up the other day and said, We want the Danes, the Swedes, and the Norwegians. We don’t want people from shithole countries. We’re being told that it’s illegitimate to keep talking about race when we’re confronting a tsunami of a movement that uses racism as its stalking horse. It is the lure that brought so many people into this movement. It’s important to help people understand that that’s the bait they’re using. The bait that says, “Yeah, I’m not sure that those people are qualified,” right? Yeah, all of that stuff that just lives in this country, that’s being used as the bait for this smash-and-grab, for this power grab. And I don’t think we’re doing this country any favors by steering people away from that realization.

            <div id="article-text">Amid the AI boom, nuclear power is in vogue, with venture capitalists lining up to plow hundreds of millions into small modular reactor (SMR) startups to make their datacenter energy headaches go away.

On Wednesday, Radiant, an El Segundo, California-based startup founded in 2020, said it raised more than $300 million in a funding round led by Draper Associates and Boost VC to commercialize its semi-trailer-sized microreactors.

The company expects to break ground on an SMR manufacturing plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee next year.

&quot;This funding enables us to build our factory and keep to our DOME schedule, where we will achieve a self-sustained chain reaction on a reactor designed by, built by, fueled by, and operated by Radiant alongside our partners at the Idaho National Lab,&quot; Radiant CEO Doug Bernauer said in a canned statement.

DOME refers to Idaho National Laboratory&#39;s Demonstration of Microreactor Experiments project, where Radiant says it&#39;s on track to flip the switch on its first reactor, the Kaleidos Demonstration Unit (KDU), sometime next year.

Unlike other SMR designs we&#39;ve discussed over the past year, Radiant&#39;s Kaleidos reactors are tiny, capable of producing about a megawatt of power each. However, the actual mechanism for energy generation isn&#39;t too far off from the designs we&#39;ve seen from X-Energy, which use TRISO fuel pellets and helium gas as a coolant.

Thanks to their size, Radiant says they can be transported using standard semi-tractors and refueled up to four times over their 20-year lifespans.

However, from a datacenter standpoint, a megawatt just isn&#39;t that much power anymore. Modern rack systems from Nvidia are pushing 140 kW each with next-gen designs targeting 600 kW, beginning in late 2027. As such, datacenter operators would need at least two Kaleidos for every three Nvidia Kyber racks deployed.

But that&#39;s not stopping datacenter operators including Equinix from going all in on the tech. In August, the colocation giant revealed it&#39;d preordered 20 of Radiant&#39;s Kaleidos reactors.

Equinix is one of several large bit barn operators that&#39;ve thrown their weight behind backyard atomics. Amazon is investing in both conventional nuclear and SMRs in order to unburden itself from relying on US grid operators. Google and Oracle are also investing in SMR startups, while Microsoft is funding the re-ignition of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 reactor — you know the one that didn&#39;t partially melt down in the late 70s.

However, the jury is still out on whether SMRs will ever be cost effective. In September, analysts at the Centre for Net Zero (CNZ) estimated it would cost 43 percent less to power a 120 MW data facility with renewables and a small amount of gas-generated energy, compared to using SMRs. ®

            <h2>GitHub is going to start charging you for using your own hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/github_charge_dev_own_hardware/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">GitHub customers, take notice: Come March, the Microsoft-owned repository host will begin charging for some uses of self-hosted Actions runners.

The change comes in the form of a $0.002 per minute charge for self-hosted runners executing jobs on private GitHub repositories. At the same time, GitHub noted in a Tuesday blog post that it&#39;s lowering the prices of GitHub-hosted runners beginning January 1, under a scheme it calls &quot;simpler pricing and a better experience for GitHub Actions.&quot; Self-hosted runner usage on public repositories will remain free, we note.

Regardless of the public repo distinction, enterprise-scale developers who rely on self-hosted runners were predictably not pleased about the announcement.

&quot;Github have just sent out an email announcing a $0.002/minute fee for self-hosted runners,&quot; Reddit user markmcw posted on the DevOps subreddit. &quot;Just ran the numbers, and for us, that&#39;s close to $3.5k a month extra on our GitHub bill.&quot;

The powers-that-be at GitHub owner Microsoft seem to understand that the change to self-hosted runner billing would piss off a number of customers, as the very first question in the FAQ attached to Tuesday&#39;s blog post is &quot;why am I being charged to use my own hardware?&quot;

To be fair to GitHub, it’s not exactly free for the company to run the GitHub Actions infrastructure and services that self-hosted runners rely on, and that’s the company’s justification for the change.

&quot;Historically, self-hosted runner customers were able to leverage much of GitHub Actions&#39; infrastructure and services at no cost,&quot; the repo host said in its blog FAQ. &quot;This meant that the cost of maintaining and evolving these essential services was largely being subsidized by the prices set for GitHub-hosted runners.&quot;

The move, GitHub said, will align costs more closely with usage. Like many similar changes to pricing models pushed by tech firms, GitHub says &quot;the vast majority of users … will see no price increase.&quot;

GitHub claims that 96 percent of its customers will see no change to their bill, and that 85 percent of the 4 percent affected by the pricing update will actually see their Actions costs decrease. The company says the remaining 15 percent of impacted users will face a median increase of about $13 a month.

For those using self-hosted runners and worried about increased costs, GitHub has updated its pricing calculator to include the cost of self-hosted runners.

As the company noted, it&#39;s also decreasing the costs of many GitHub-hosted runners, and while some will be up to 39 percent less, self-hosted runners can still work out cheaper for teams with their own hardware. The cheapest standard GitHub hosted runners using a 1-core Linux system come in at the same price as $0.002 per minute for a self-hosted runner, and haven&#39;t been adjusted under the new pricing scheme.

Many commenters concerned over the self-hosted runner price change also expressed worry that their runners would eat into free quota minutes associated with their GitHub plan, and that appears to be a valid concern.

&quot;Billable self-hosted runner usage will be able to consume minutes from the free quota associated with your plan,&quot; GitHub said. In other words, the time spent using runners on your own hardware will eat into your free time and further increase your GitHub costs.

&quot;We believe this is a sustainable option that will not deeply impact our lightly- nor heavily-active customers, while still delivering fast, flexible workloads for the best end user experience,&quot; GitHub said. ®

            <h2>NASA tries savin' MAVEN as Mars probe loses contact with Earth</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/nasa_maven_mars_probe_loses_contact/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA is still trying to recontact the MAVEN Mars orbiter after it stopped responding earlier this month, with fragmentary tracking data hinting the craft may be tumbling and off its predicted trajectory.

Earlier this week, the US space agency revealed that the MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) team had managed to recover a fragment of tracking data from December 6 that indicated the spacecraft was &quot;rotating in an unexpected manner&quot; when it emerged from behind Mars. The signal&#39;s frequency also suggested that the orbit&#39;s trajectory might have changed.

In the update, NASA wrote, &quot;The team continues to analyze tracking data to understand the most likely scenarios leading to the loss of signal.

&quot;Efforts to reestablish contact with MAVEN also continue.&quot;

The agency did not confirm whether the spacecraft had entered safe mode, in which an anomalous event causes the probe to shut down all non-essential systems and enter a safe state until communication with controllers can be restored. One space industry insider told The Register that &quot;Safe mode will change the orbit as it involves firing the thrusters,&quot; and went on to explain that on their mission, recovery involves performing a maneuver &quot;to undo the damage that safe mode entry has done to the orbit.&quot;

This is assuming that MAVEN&#39;s orbit has changed. NASA&#39;s language (&quot;may have changed&quot;) is deliberately vague. There is, after all, precious little data for engineers to work with – just a fragment of Doppler data to hint that something is different. Our source noted that the team responsible for tracking the trajectory of their spacecraft typically needed an hour of decent signal, though the MAVEN team&#39;s needs might differ.

Engineers do not have the luxury of time for regaining control of the spacecraft. A solar conjunction (where Mars is obscured from the Earth by the Sun) is due shortly, during which the Deep Space Network (DSN) will be unable to communicate with spacecraft on or around Mars.

That mysterious trajectory change further complicates things. If the trajectory has changed, then engineers will have difficulty pinpointing where the spacecraft should be at any given time, hampering recovery efforts.

Having launched in 2013, MAVEN is a relative spring chicken when it comes to NASA&#39;s Mars fleet. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) arrived in 2006, and the Mars Odyssey entered orbit in 2001. The latter, however, is running on fumes at the moment, having outlived its original mission by decades.

Other Mars orbiters include the European Space Agency&#39;s Mars Express, which was launched in 2003, and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter.

Should MAVEN be lost, there is a chance that NASA might find itself down to two operational but aging spacecraft orbiting the red planet sooner rather than later. ®

            <div id="article-text">For those of us who don’t ever seem to know where our keys, wallets, and remote controls have gone.

For those of us who don’t ever seem to know where our keys, wallets, and remote controls have gone.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Some people rarely lose things. Wallets are always exactly where they’re supposed to be, keys never go missing, and remotes never slip between the couch cushions. And then there’s the rest of us — the folks who can’t ever seem to find the thing that was right there a few seconds ago. For us, there are Bluetooth trackers.

Bluetooth trackers have been around for a long time, and they all generally work the same way. You stick the tracker onto an object, pair it with your phone, and then, when you lose said object, you can go into an app and ring the tracker. But these days, Bluetooth trackers can do a lot more. Some have ultra-wideband chips that enable precision tracking, so you can find exactly where in a room your item is. Increasingly, trackers also tap into large networks — like Apple’s and Google’s — making it easier to locate lost items outside the home. Many will notify you if they detect you’ve left the device behind or come with QR codes that link to your contact information so people can easily return lost devices.

Bluetooth trackers are meant to find lost items. To test that, we lose items — both organically (some of us really do misplace wallets and keys daily) and in more controlled test environments. For the latter, one example is testing how these trackers perform in office environments or in multi-story houses. Sometimes, we also enlist the help of family and friends to “hide” objects to evaluate precision finding features. We’ll also enlist help to simulate and evaluate unwanted tracking alerts. In our testing, we’re also looking to assess factors like Bluetooth and network (ie., Find My, Tile, etc.) range, battery life, and how loud chimes / alerts are.

Are you limited to Bluetooth range, or can you make use of wider networks like Apple’s Find My, Google’s Find Hub network, or Amazon Sidewalk? Is it hard to hear the tracker when you ring it?

A technology that lets you track small objects can be abused to track people without their consent. Tracker companies know this, and an increasing number now come with anti-stalking features. These features may never prevent abuse 100 percent of the time, but we investigate whether these features were crafted with care, how well the company educates users about them, and if the company is proactive about updating them according to feedback from experts.

Do you need to pay a subscription fee to get all available features? If so, is it worth the moolah?

Most Bluetooth trackers last at least a year, but not all of them allow you to replace the battery. That means you have to buy a whole new tracker when the battery dies. I prefer the ability to replace batteries whenever possible.

These features are incredibly handy but also have the potential for misuse. Take AirTags. When Apple launched the trackers, it hadn’t anticipated they’d be used to track people or stolen items — but that’s exactly what happened. It’s since beefed up its anti-stalking features, and companies like Tile have also followed suit. Apple and Google have launched a standard that enables unwanted tracking alerts across both Android and iOS devices — and major players like Tile, Samsung, and Chipolo are on board. But until this standard is up and running, it pays to be aware of each tracker’s current approach when you’re deciding the best option for you.

As a consummate Loser of Things, I’ve tested my fair share of Bluetooth trackers on wallets, keys, and luggage. Here’s what I’d recommend if you, too, have a hard time finding things.

Apple’s AirTags can help you find your lost items with their ultra wideband technology. You’ll get the best compatibility with an iPhone, though Apple released an Android app that can detect an AirTag’s location and notify you if one seems to be following you.

When Apple launched AirTags in 2021, it really did shake up the category. That’s because AirTags are equipped with Apple’s Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip and tap into Apple’s vast Find My network. That’s a potent combo. And even though you can now get third-party accessories that work with the Find My network — including the Pebblebee trackers featured later in this guide — AirTags are still the best, thanks to UWB.

Basically, UWB enables precision tracking while Find My compatibility expands range far, far beyond Bluetooth’s limitations. With precision tracking, all you have to do is open the Find My app, tap “Find,” and you should see an arrow pointing you in the exact direction you need to go to find your item. Using the Find My network also means that so long as there’s an Apple device nearby, a lost AirTag can ping its location to Apple’s iCloud servers without notifying the owners of those other devices. And there are over a billion Apple products out there.

That accuracy is super convenient. My keys fell out of my pocket while running once, and I didn’t notice until my phone pinged me to say my keys were no longer with me. While I wasn’t able to use the precision tracking outdoors, I could see the last reported location in the Find My app. Twenty minutes had already passed, but I was still able to find my keys. I haven’t had that degree of success with any other item tracker.

However, this accuracy is a double-edged sword. In 2022, I ran a test to see whether I could track a friend and my spouse (with their consent) in real time. And I could, to a disturbing degree. While Apple’s unwanted tracking prevention measures worked, there were also inherent flaws. (You can read about our testing in full here.) However, Apple has since improved unwanted tracking alerts by shortening the time before you’re notified an unknown AirTag is in your vicinity, making chimes louder, and creating a separate app that lets Android users scan for unknown AirTags. Apple also now informs users during setup that unwanted tracking is a crime and that AirTags are “intended solely to track items that belong to you.”

Apple has also added more ways to share AirTag locations with trusted people. iOS 17 introduced AirTag sharing, which means shared items won’t trigger unwanted tracking alerts. As of iOS 18.2, you can also share the location of a lost AirTag with other people via a temporary link. So if an airline loses your luggage, you can send them a link to an interactive map showing your item’s last known location. (Apple is partnering with more than 15 airlines for this particular use case.)

The only thing I really don’t like about AirTags is that they aren’t truly $29. They’re $29, plus the cost of any accessory needed to attach them to the item you want to track. For example, you’ll need a holder to attach it to your keys or luggage. Thankfully, there’s a robust third-party accessory market, so you don’t have to pay Apple’s prices if you don’t want to. The fact that you can easily replace the battery with a regular CR2032 coin cell battery helps take the sting out, too. I’ve done it for two of my AirTags, and it’s much, much cheaper than buying two new ones.

The Tile Pro is the company’s loudest Bluetooth tracker and has the widest range at 400 feet. It also has a user-replaceable battery, unlike other Tiles.

More and more trackers now support both Google’s and Apple’s Find My networks, but Tile’s trackers — especially the $34.99 Tile Pro — are still our top recommendation for Android users or mixed iOS / Android households. Functionally, the platform-agnostic trackers can do just about anything an AirTag can. Like AirTags, Tile devices can tap into a larger network — in this case, the Tile Network and Amazon Sidewalk — to help you find your devices outside of your phone’s Bluetooth range. While this network isn’t as expansive as Apple’s or Google’s, Amazon Sidewalk’s coverage has improved significantly. When we tested Google’s Find Hub-compatible trackers — including the Chipolo Pop, Pebblebee Clip Universal, and the Moto Tag — we found that Tile still did better at tracking items outside the home.

Unfortunately, Tile still can’t do true real-time tracking, and it still doesn’t offer a tracker with UWB, so it lacks the AirTag’s precision tracking. The company announced one back in 2021, but we’re still waiting, partly because Apple is effectively blocking UWB compatibility for third parties in iOS and because Tile’s priorities shifted once it was acquired by Life360.

Last year, Google finally launched its Find My Device network, which was later renamed Find Hub. It works similarly to Apple’s Find My network: you’ll be able to share trackers with family members, and there are also unwanted tracking alerts.

Initially, the network lagged behind Apple’s, but it’s starting to catch up. After several weeks of testing Find Hub-compatible trackers — specifically the Chipolo Pop, Pebblebee Clip Universal, and Moto Tag — in April, we found the network had improved significantly over the past year or so, especially in busy areas. Still, it’s clear Google prioritized privacy over precision.

Google is making some progress, though. In May, Google added UWB support for more precise tracking with Motorola’s Moto Tag and, eventually, other compatible phones and trackers. Google also rolled out satellite connectivity to Pixel 9 phones and newer devices in August, with the ability to share tracker locations with airline staff coming in early 2026.

That said, Life360’s acquisition has brought some meaningful upgrades. Pressing a Tile button three times now sends an SOS alert to emergency contacts through Life360. You can also add others to your Circle so they can view and ring nearby Tiles on a shared Life360 map. More recently, Tile trackers have become fully integrated into Life360, letting users manage their trackers directly within the Life360 app. This merger unlocked a few premium features for free, including push alerts for forgotten items and two-day location history.

Still, most of the good stuff — like 30-day location history, unlimited sharing with friends and family, free replacements for damaged Tiles, and up to $100 reimbursement for lost items — sits behind a $29.99/year subscription. Fortunately, Tile offers new members a one-year trial, and a single subscription covers all your devices. You also still get a lot of core functionality without paying: you can find your Tile via Bluetooth, view its last known location on a map, ring your phone from the Tile, and share access with one other person for free.

Tile also stands out for its versatility. While AirTags come in a single puck-like design, Tile offers four distinct form factors to suit different needs. The card-shaped Tile Slim ($29.99), for example, is the best option if you’re constantly losing your wallet. The square Tile Mate ($24.99) comes with a hole so you can stick it on a key ring or carabiner, and is probably the most versatile. The $24.99 Tile Sticker, meanwhile, is a small disc that comes with a sticky backing so you can put it on remotes, pet collars, and anything else you can stick it on.

The best Tile will depend on what you’re looking to track. My personal favorite, however, is the $34.99 Tile Pro, which is shaped like a key fob, is larger than the Mate, and can also be attached to other items. Of the four, it has the longest Bluetooth range at 500 feet and the loudest ring. It’s also the only one that has a replaceable one-year CR2032 battery.

Last but not least, Tile may actually be better than AirTags for tracking stolen items. The company rolled out an anti-theft feature in 2023, which renders Tile devices invisible to unwanted tracking detection in the event someone steals your item. Just know that to use it, Tile requires you to submit a government ID for verification, agree to Tile working with law enforcement without a subpoena, and consent to a $1 million fine if you misuse this feature. For anti-stalking measures, Tile also has a “Scan and Secure” feature, which allows you to use the Tile app to scan for unknown Tile devices in your vicinity. While better than nothing, it’s a flawed measure, as it requires the potential victim to proactively scan their surroundings.

The Pebblebee Clip Universal supports Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks, but also has a 500-foot Bluetooth range, LEDs that flash to help you locate it, and a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 12 months on a single charge.

If you’re looking for an AirTag or Tile alternative, the Pebblebee Clip Universal is an excellent choice. It’s one of a growing number of trackers that support both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks, a major improvement over its predecessor. This makes setup seamless for both iOS and Android users, while also enabling more accurate and reliable tracking than Pebblebee’s own network could provide.

The thing I like best about the Pebblebee Clip Universal is its rechargeable battery. A single charge lasts up to one year, up from six months — though you may get longer than that depending on your usage. It has a USB-C port, too, so you don’t have to sweat it if you lose the charger that comes with it. You love to see it.

The Pebblebee Clip Universal also has an LED strip at the bottom that lights up when you ring the tracker. That’s helped me spot my car keys more quickly when they’ve fallen under the car seat or other dark areas. The ringtone is also quite loud, and the 500-foot Bluetooth range is actually about 100 feet more than the Tile Pro, our pick for Android users. And while larger than an AirTag, the Pebblebee Clip Universal also comes with a snap-on key ring, so you don’t have to buy another accessory to attach it. It’s also IPX6-rated for water resistance.

Clip Universal owners can still use Pebblee’s app to set voice tags and ask Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant to help find their device. You can also use the “Find Phone” feature, which lets you double-tap to ring your phone.

Earlier this year, Pebblebee added a free “panic alarm” safety feature that’s similar to Tile’s SOS alert. Compatible with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub network, the Alert feature lets you press the Clip’s button to activate a loud 97-decibel siren and flashing light, which you can disable via Silent Mode. No matter what, the Pebblebee app will still text your location to a trusted contact — or up to five people, with live location sharing if you pay for the $2.99 monthly Alert Live subscription.

That said, Clip Universal owners can’t use the Pebblebee app for tracking, and so only last-gen Clip owners can take advantage of the Pebblebee app’s extensive customizable geofencing features. That means, for instance, Clip Universal owners can no longer set up custom areas on a map and be notified whenever a device enters or leaves the area. They also can’t use the app to designate safe zones, which was useful to avoid unnecessary “left behind” notifications in familiar places like home or work. The latter can be done in Apple’s Find My app, though Google’s Find Hub doesn’t yet have an equivalent feature.

It’s worth noting that Pebblebee recently introduced the $34.99 Clip 5, the like-minded successor to the Clip Universal. The newer location tracker has been redesigned to function as a better panic alarm, with a louder buzzer, brighter LEDs, and improved durability. It’s also available in a string of new colors thanks to Pebblebee’s new Evercolor program, which introduces and retires two limited-edition colors every two weeks (the first colors in the lineup are green and purple). We’ll update this guide with our impressions once testing is complete.

The Pebblebee Card has a rechargeable battery that lasts for up to 18 months. It supports Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub, but you can also use the Pebblebee app for voice tagging.

You could be like my spouse, who stuffs an AirTag in their bifold wallet and then makes a surprised Pikachu face every time it falls out. Or, you could opt for a Find My-compatible alternative specifically designed for wallets, like the $34.99 Pebblebee Card Universal. It plays nice with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks, giving you cross-platform flexibility and the benefits of each — all with a super loud ringtone. It doesn’t come with precision tracking because it lacks UWB, but it makes up for it with those loud ringtones. As part of the Find My network, it also supports unwanted tracking alerts.

The Pebblebee Card Universal also stands out because of its rechargeable battery, which lasts up to 18 months on a single charge. Like the Pebblebee Clip Universal, it works with the Pebblebee app to support voice tagging and even has a button you can press to locate your phone. That being said, Pebble recently introduced a newer, slimmer version called the Card 5, which measures a mere 1.8mm thick and supports wireless charging. We’re currently testing the $34.99 tracker and will share our thoughts soon.

The $29 Chipolo Pop offers a similar form factor to Apple’s AirTag in a lighter, more colorful package with a hole for a keychain or lanyard, a louder beep, and compatibility with both Apple’s Find My or Google’s Find Hub networks (though only one at a time). You can even use the Pop as a remote camera shutter and press the built-in button twice to find your lost phone. Unlike Chipolo’s other trackers, it boasts a wider 300-foot Bluetooth range, a more robust IP55 rating for water and dust resistance, and includes a user-replaceable battery that can last up to a year.

In my testing, tracking was accurate on both Apple’s and Google’s networks in most cases, Google’s struggled to track items outside my home as reliably as the Tile. And without UWB, the Pop couldn’t match the AirTag’s pinpoint precision. Still, the Chipolo app provides Android users with reliable out-of-range alerts and left-behind notifications — something Pebblebee and Moto Tag’s trackers lack —which, in my experience, triggered even faster than the AirTag and Tile.

If you’re willing to spend an extra $10, the $39 Chipolo Loop is very similar to the Chipolo Pop, with many of the same strengths and weaknesses. However, it charges via USB-C and includes a built-in silicone ring that’s easy to attach to keys, bags, and other items. You also get a more durable IP67 rating and an extra 100 feet of Bluetooth range — up to 400 feet total. Just note you’ll have to supply your own USB-C cable. ~ Sheena Vasani, Commerce Writer

If you’re a Samsung Galaxy phone user, the $29.99 Samsung SmartTag2 gets you UWB tracking and can tap into the Galaxy Find network, which operates similarly to Apple’s Find My network. It’s a great AirTag alternative but isn’t our overall pick for Android because it’s limited to Samsung Galaxy users. But for Samsung users, the latest SmartTag2 includes an improved Compass View, longer battery life, and a better app experience. It also has a newer, oblong design with a larger key ring than the original SmartTag.

Motorola’s $29.99 Moto Tag is the first tracker on Google’s Find My Device network to offer ultra wideband for locating lost items on phones equipped with a UWB chip, which is a feature Google only recently enabled via a firmware update. Like Apple’s AirTag, it can guide you directly to your missing item via directional cues in the Find My Device app. It worked well in my testing, helping me find the exact location of nearby items in my small apartment, though Apple’s AirTag was occasionally more precise when tracking objects farther away or through walls. The Moto Tag was also less effective than Tile’s trackers at locating items outside my home.

Still, if you want a tracker to find things around the house, the Moto Tag is a solid pick. It also fits most AirTag accessories, carries an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, and uses a replaceable CR2032 battery that lasts up to a year. It can ring your misplaced phone, too, and doubles as a remote shutter for Motorola phones. ~ Sheena Vasani, Commerce Writer

Eufy’s rechargeable $34.99 SmartTrack Card E30 is another good option for wallets, one that offers the same Find My network benefits as the aforementioned Pebblebee Card Universal and Pebblebee Card 5. On the back, there’s also a QR code — similar to the ones Tile uses — that helps good Samaritans return your item to you. Like the Pebblebee’s newest offerings, you can share it with multiple people if you set it up via the Eufy Security app. The bummer here is that it doesn’t work with Android and lacks UWB.

The $35 Chipolo Card Spot or $35 Card Point is also a good option for wallets if you want something a bit simpler, though it lacks the QR code, and its battery only lasts two years. If you do opt for Chipolo, double-check that the specific tracker you’re buying works on the network you want to use. For example, the Chipolo Card and Chipolo Card Spot can both be used with iPhones, but the Chipolo Card only works with the Chipolo app, while the Card Spot only works with Find My. The Chipolo Card Point is for Android users and works with Google’s Find Hub network. Read my full Chipolo Card Spot review.

Update, December 17th: Adjusted prices / availability and added the Chipolo Loop to our list of secondary recommendations. Also removed the Eufy SmartTrack Card. Sheena Vasani also contributed to this guide.

            <div id="article-text">Toy companies must respond to questions about safety and security by January 6th.

Toy companies must respond to questions about safety and security by January 6th.

Sexual fetish content. How to light a match. Where to find knives in the home.

These are all conversation topics that recently-recalled children’s toys — built atop AI chatbots like OpenAI’s GPT-4o — are capable of bringing up to children. On Tuesday, U.S. senators Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) sent a letter to toy companies about their concerns — including a list of questions and a deadline for the companies to respond by January 6, 2026.

“Many of these toys are not offering interactive play, but instead are exposing children to inappropriate content, privacy risks, and manipulative engagement tactics,” the senators wrote. “These aren’t theoretical worst-case scenarios; they are documented failures uncovered through real-world testing, and they must be addressed … These chatbots have encouraged kids to commit self harm and suicide, and now your company is pushing them on the youngest children who have the least ability to recognize this danger.”

AI-enabled children’s toys have been in the spotlight recently after a series of reports on their potential unsafe and explicit conversation topics, some of which the chatbots built into the toys brought up themselves. Last month, FoloToy, a Singapore-based toy company, temporarily suspended sales of its AI teddy bear, “Kumma,” after researchers at the U.S. PIRG Education Fund found it offered advice on sex positions and roleplay scenarios. (The company brought the toy back on the market after conducting an internal safety audit and researchers said it behaved better.)

And this week, researchers published findings that Alilo’s Smart AI Bunny discussed sexually explicit topics with users. They also said that when testing the FoloToy teddy bear, Alilo’s Smart AI Bunny, Curio’s Grok-stuffed rocket, and Miko’s Miko 3 robot, all of the toys “told us where to find potentially dangerous objects in the house, such as plastic bags, matches and knives.”

The researchers said that “at least four of the five toys” they tested in the December report “seem to rely in part on some version of OpenAI’s AI models.”

Another main concern in the letter is surveillance and data collection. The senators wrote that such toys often “rely on the collection of data about children, either provided by a parent while registering the toy or collected through built-in camera and facial recognition capabilities or recordings,” and that children will often “share troves of personal information” unwittingly, which can raise particular concerns when companies store and sell the data they collect. In the latest U.S. PIRG Education Fund report, researchers wrote that Curio’s privacy policy “lists 3 tech companies that may collect children’s data: Kids Web Services (KWS), Azure Cognitive Services and OpenAI,” but that Miko’s privacy policy vaguely states that the company can share data with third-party game developers, business partners, service providers, affiliates and advertising partners.

Letters went out to Mattel, Little Learners Toys, Miko, Curio, FoloToy, and Keyi Robot, according to NBC News. (Mattel struck a partnership with OpenAI in June, but following the reports, it said on Monday that it would no longer release a toy powered by OpenAI’s tech in 2025.) The senators are requesting details on specific safeguards companies have in place to prevent AI-powered toys from generating inappropriate responses; whether the company has conducted independent third-party testing (and what the results yielded); whether the company conducts internal reviews on potential psychological, developmental, and emotional risks to children; what type of data the toys collect from children (and the purpose); and whether the toys “include any features that pressure children to continue conversations or discourage them from disengaging.”

“Toymakers have a unique and profound influence on childhood—and with that influence comes responsibility,” the senators wrote. “Your company must not choose profit over safety for children, a choice made by Big Tech that has devastated our nation’s kids.”

They’ll be available to stream for free as part of a deal that runs through 2033.

The Oscars are headed to YouTube — in a few years. “Beginning in 2029, the Oscars will broadcast exclusively on YouTube for free globally and on YouTube TV in the U.S.,” YouTube announced.

YouTube’s coverage will include the red carpet, behind the scenes content, and Governors Ball access. The deal runs through 2033, according to an Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences press release shared by The Hollywood Reporter.

ABC will continue to broadcast the Oscars through the 100th edition of the show in 2028. Earlier this year, YouTube was rumored to be looking into acquiring the rights to the Oscars.

“This collaboration will leverage YouTube’s vast reach and infuse the Oscars and other Academy programming with innovative opportunities for engagement while honoring our legacy,” Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Lynette Howell Taylor said in a statement.

Netflix also streams a big entertainment awards show; it started streaming the Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards on its platform in 2024 as part of a “multi-year partnership.”

            <h2>This Nobel Prize–winning chemist dreams of making water from thin air</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/17/1129259/omar-yaghi-chemist-nobel-prize-crystals-water-air/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Omar Yaghi was a quiet child, diligent, unlikely to roughhouse with his nine siblings. So when he was old enough, his parents tasked him with one of the family’s most vital chores: fetching water. Like most homes in his Palestinian neighborhood in Amman, Jordan, the Yaghis’ had no electricity or running water. At least once every two weeks, the city switched on local taps for a few hours so residents could fill their tanks. Young Omar helped top up the family supply. Decades later, he says he can’t remember once showing up late. The fear of leaving his parents, seven brothers, and two sisters parched kept him punctual.

Yaghi proved so dependable that his father put him in charge of monitoring how much the cattle destined for the family butcher shop ate and drank. The best-­quality cuts came from well-fed, hydrated animals—a challenge given that they were raised in arid desert.

Specially designed materials called metal-organic frameworks can pull water from the air like a sponge—and then give it back.

But at 10 years old, Yaghi learned of a different occupation. Hoping to avoid a rambunctious crowd at recess, he found the library doors in his school unbolted and sneaked in. Thumbing through a chemistry textbook, he saw an image he didn’t understand: little balls connected by sticks in fascinating shapes. Molecules. The building blocks of everything.

“I didn’t know what they were, but it captivated my attention,” Yaghi says. “I kept trying to figure out what they might be.”

That’s how he discovered chemistry—or maybe how chemistry discovered him. After coming to the United States and, eventually, a postdoctoral program at Harvard University, Yaghi devoted his career to finding ways to make entirely new and fascinating shapes for those little sticks and balls. In October 2025, he was one of three scientists who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for identifying metal-­organic frameworks, or MOFs—metal ions tethered to organic molecules that form repeating structural landscapes. Today that work is the basis for a new project that sounds like science fiction, or a miracle: conjuring water out of thin air.

When he first started working with MOFs, Yaghi thought they might be able to absorb climate-damaging carbon dioxide—or maybe hold hydrogen molecules, solving the thorny problem of storing that climate-friendly but hard-to-contain fuel. But then, in 2014, Yaghi’s team of researchers at UC Berkeley had an epiphany. The tiny pores in MOFs could be designed so the material would pull water molecules from the air around them, like a sponge—and then, with just a little heat, give back that water as if squeezed dry. Just one gram of a water-absorbing MOF has an internal surface area of roughly 7,000 square meters.

Yaghi wasn’t the first to try to pull potable water from the atmosphere. But his method could do it at lower levels of humidity than rivals—potentially shaking up a tiny, nascent industry that could be critical to humanity in the thirsty decades to come. Now the company he founded, called Atoco, is racing to demonstrate a pair of machines that Yaghi believes could produce clean, fresh, drinkable water virtually anywhere on Earth, without even hooking up to an energy supply.

That’s the goal Yaghi has been working toward for more than a decade now, with the rigid determination that he learned while doing chores in his father’s butcher shop.

“It was in that shop where I learned how to perfect things, how to have a work ethic,” he says. “I learned that a job is not done until it is well done. Don’t start a job unless you can finish it.”

Most of Earth is covered in water, but just 3% of it is fresh, with no salt—the kind of water all terrestrial living things need. Today, desalination plants that take the salt out of seawater provide the bulk of potable water in technologically advanced desert nations like Israel and the United Arab Emirates, but at a high cost. Desalination facilities either heat water to distill out the drinkable stuff or filter it with membranes the salt doesn’t pass through; both methods require a lot of energy and leave behind concentrated brine. Typically desal pumps send that brine back into the ocean, with devastating ecological effects.

I was talking to Atoco executives about carbon dioxide capture earlier this year when they mentioned the possibility of harvesting water from the atmosphere. Of course my mind immediately jumped to Star Wars, and Luke Skywalker working on his family’s moisture farm, using “vaporators” to pull water from the atmosphere of the arid planet Tatooine. (Other sci-fi fans’ minds might go to Dune, and the water-gathering technology of the Fremen.) Could this possibly be real?

It turns out people have been doing it for millennia. Archaeological evidence of water harvesting from fog dates back as far as 5000 BCE. The ancient Greeks harvested dew, and 500 years ago so did the Inca, using mesh nets and buckets under trees.

Today, harvesting water from the air is a business already worth billions of dollars, say industry analysts—and it’s on track to be worth billions more in the next five years. In part that’s because typical sources of fresh water are in crisis. Less snowfall in mountains during hotter winters means less meltwater in the spring, which means less water downstream. Droughts regularly break records. Rising seas seep into underground aquifers, already drained by farming and sprawling cities. Aging septic tanks leach bacteria into water, and cancer-causing “forever chemicals” are creating what the US Government Accountability Office last year said “may be the biggest water problem since lead.” That doesn’t even get to the emerging catastrophe from microplastics.

So lots of places are turning to atmospheric water harvesting. Watergen, an Israel-based company working on the tech, initially planned on deploying in the arid, poorer parts of the world. Instead, buyers in Europe and the United States have approached the company as a way to ensure a clean supply of water. And one of Watergen’s biggest markets is the wealthy United Arab Emirates. “When you say ‘water crisis,’ it’s not just the lack of water—it’s access to good-quality water,” says Anna Chernyavsky, Watergen’s vice president of marketing.

In other words, the technology “has evolved from lab prototypes to robust, field-deployable systems,” says Guihua Yu, a mechanical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin. “There is still room to improve productivity and energy efficiency in the whole-system level, but so much progress has been steady and encouraging.”

MOFs are just the latest approach to the idea. The first generation of commercial tech depended on compressors and refrigerant chemicals—large-scale versions of the machine that keeps food cold and fresh in your kitchen. Both use electricity and a clot of pipes and exchangers to make cold by phase-shifting a chemical from gas to liquid and back; refrigerators try to limit condensation, and water generators basically try to enhance it.

That’s how Watergen’s tech works: using a compressor and a heat exchanger to wring water from air at humidity levels as low as 20%—Death Valley in the spring. “We’re talking about deserts,” Chernyavsky says. “Below 20%, you get nosebleeds.”

That still might not be good enough. “Refrigeration works pretty well when you are above a certain relative humidity,” says Sameer Rao, a mechanical engineer at the University of Utah who researches atmospheric water harvesting. “As the environment dries out, you go to lower relative humidities, and it becomes harder and harder. In some cases, it’s impossible for refrigeration-based systems to really work.”

So a second wave of technology has found a market. Companies like Source Global use desiccants—substances that absorb moisture from the air, like the silica packets found in vitamin bottles—to pull in moisture and then release it when heated. In theory, the benefit of desiccant-­based tech is that it could absorb water at lower humidity levels, and it uses less energy on the front end since it isn’t running a condenser system. Source Global claims its off-grid, solar-powered system is deployed in dozens of countries.

But both technologies still require a lot of energy, either to run the heat exchangers or to generate sufficient heat to release water from the desiccants. MOFs, Yaghi hopes, do not. Now Atoco is trying to prove it. Instead of using heat exchangers to bring the air temperature to dew point or desiccants to attract water from the atmosphere, a system can rely on specially designed MOFs to attract water molecules. Atoco’s prototype version uses an MOF that looks like baby powder, stuck to a surface like glass. The pores in the MOF naturally draw in water molecules but remain open, making it theoretically easy to discharge the water with no more heat than what comes from direct sunlight. Atoco’s industrial-scale design uses electricity to speed up the process, but the company is working on a second design that can operate completely off grid, without any energy input.

Yaghi’s Atoco isn’t the only contender seeking to use MOFs for water harvesting. A competitor, AirJoule, has introduced MOF-based atmospheric water generators in Texas and the UAE and is working with researchers at Arizona State University, planning to deploy more units in the coming months. The company started out trying to build more efficient air-­conditioning for electric buses operating on hot, humid city streets. But then founder Matt Jore heard about US government efforts to harvest water from air—and pivoted. The startup’s stock price has been a bit of a roller-­coaster, but Jore says the sheer size of the market should keep him in business. Take Maricopa County, encompassing Phoenix and its environs—it uses 1.2 billion gallons of water from its shrinking aquifer every day, and another 874 million gallons from surface sources like rivers.

“So, a couple of billion gallons a day, right?” Jore tells me. “You know how much influx is in the atmosphere every day? Twenty-five billion gallons.”

“Just the greater Phoenix area gets influx of about 25 billion gallons of water in the air,” he says. “If you can tap into it, that’s your source. And it’s not going away. It’s all around the world. We view the atmosphere as the world’s free pipeline.”

Besides AirJoule’s head start on Atoco, the companies also differ on where they get their MOFs. AirJoule’s system relies on an off-the-shelf version the company buys from the chemical giant BASF; Atoco aims to use Yaghi’s skill with designing the novel material to create bespoke MOFs for different applications and locations.

“Given the fact that we have the inventor of the whole class of materials, and we leverage the stuff that comes out of his lab at Berkeley—everything else equal, we have a good starting point to engineer maybe the best materials in the world,” says Magnus Bach, Atoco’s VP of business development.

Yaghi envisions a two-pronged product line. Industrial-scale water generators that run on electricity would be capable of producing thousands of liters per day on one end, while units that run on passive systems could operate in remote locations without power, just harnessing energy from the sun and ambient temperatures. In theory, these units could someday replace desalination and even entire municipal water supplies. The next round of field tests is scheduled for early 2026, in the Mojave Desert—one of the hottest, driest places on Earth.

“That’s my dream,” Yaghi says. “To give people water independence, so they’re not reliant on another party for their lives.”

Both Yaghi and Watergen’s Chernyavsky say they’re looking at more decentralized versions that could operate outside municipal utility systems. Home appliances, similar to rooftop solar panels and batteries, could allow households to generate their own water off grid.

That could be tricky, though, without economies of scale to bring down prices. “You have to produce, you have to cool, you have to filter—all in one place,” Chernyavsky says. “So to make it small is very, very challenging.”

Difficult as that may be, Yaghi’s childhood gave him a particular appreciation for the freedom to go off grid, to liberate the basic necessity of water from the whims of systems that dictate when and how people can access it.

“That’s really my dream,” he says. “To give people independence, water independence, so that they’re not reliant on another party for their livelihood or lives.”

Toward the end of one of our conversations, I asked Yaghi what he would tell the younger version of himself if he could. “Jordan is one of the worst countries in terms of the impact of water stress,” he said. “I would say, ‘Continue to be diligent and observant. It doesn’t really matter what you’re pursuing, as long as you’re passionate.’”

I pressed him for something more specific: “What do you think he’d say when you described this technology to him?”

Yaghi smiled: “I think young Omar would think you’re putting him on, that this is all fictitious and you’re trying to take something from him.” This reality, in other words, would be beyond young Omar’s wildest dreams.

            <h2>Creating psychological safety in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/16/1125899/creating-psychological-safety-in-the-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rolling out enterprise-grade AI means climbing two steep cliffs at once. First, understanding and implementing the tech itself. And second, creating the cultural conditions where employees can maximize its value. While the technical hurdles are signiﬁcant, the human element can be even more consequential; fear and ambiguity can stall momentum of even the most promising initiatives.

Psychological safety—feeling free to express opinions and take calculated risks without worrying about career repercussions1—is essential for successful AI adoption. In psychologically safe workspaces, employees are empowered to challenge assumptions and raise concerns about new tools without fear of reprisal. This is nothing short of a necessity when introducing a nascent and profoundly powerful technology that still lacks established best practices.

“Psychological safety is mandatory in this new era of AI,” says Rafee Tarafdar, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Infosys. “The tech itself is evolving so fast—companies have to experiment, and some things will fail. There needs to be a safety net.”

To gauge how psychological safety influences success with enterprise-level AI, MIT Technology Review Insights conducted a survey of 500 business leaders. The ﬁndings reveal high self-reported levels of psychological safety, but also suggest that fear still has a foothold. Anecdotally, industry experts highlight a reason for the disconnect between rhetoric and reality: while organizations may promote a safe to experiment message publicly, deeper cultural undercurrents can counteract that intent.

Building psychological safety requires a coordinated, systems-level approach, and human resources (HR) alone cannot deliver such transformation. Instead, enterprises must deeply embed psychological safety into their collaboration processes.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Some disillusionment was inevitable. When OpenAI released a free web app called ChatGPT in late 2022, it changed the course of an entire industry—and several world economies. Millions of people started talking to their computers, and their computers started talking back. We were enchanted, and we expected more.Well, 2025 has been a year of reckoning. For a start, the heads of the top AI companies made promises they couldn’t keep. At the same time, updates to the core technology are no longer the step changes they once were.To be clear, the last few years have been filled with genuine “Wow” moments. But this remarkable technology is only a few years old, and in many ways it is still experimental. Its successes come with big caveats. Read the full story to learn more about why we may need to readjust our expectations.

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t.

Quantum navigation could solve the military’s GPS jamming problem

Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thousands of flights have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of using radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.One approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
