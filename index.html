            <h2>OpenClaw security fears lead Meta, other AI firms to restrict its use</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/openclaw-security-fears-lead-meta-other-ai-firms-to-restrict-its-use/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last month, Jason Grad issued a late-night warning to the 20 employees at his tech startup. “You’ve likely seen Clawdbot trending on X/LinkedIn. While cool, it is currently unvetted and high-risk for our environment,” he wrote in a Slack message with a red siren emoji. “Please keep Clawdbot off all company hardware and away from work-linked accounts.”

Grad isn’t the only tech executive who has raised concerns to staff about the experimental agentic AI tool, which was briefly known as MoltBot and is now named OpenClaw. A Meta executive says he recently told his team to keep OpenClaw off their regular work laptops or risk losing their jobs. The executive told reporters he believes the software is unpredictable and could lead to a privacy breach if used in otherwise secure environments. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.

Peter Steinberger, OpenClaw’s solo founder, launched it as a free, open source tool last November. But its popularity surged last month as other coders contributed features and began sharing their experiences using it on social media. Last week, Steinberger joined ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which says it will keep OpenClaw open source and support it through a foundation.

OpenClaw requires basic software engineering knowledge to set up. After that, it only needs limited direction to take control of a user’s computer and interact with other apps to assist with tasks such as organizing files, conducting web research, and shopping online.

Some cybersecurity professionals have publicly urged companies to take measures to strictly control how their workforces use OpenClaw. And the recent bans show how companies are moving quickly to ensure security is prioritized ahead of their desire to experiment with emerging AI technologies.

“Our policy is, ‘mitigate first, investigate second’ when we come across anything that could be harmful to our company, users, or clients,” says Grad, who is cofounder and CEO of Massive, which provides Internet proxy tools to millions of users and businesses. His warning to staff went out on January 26, before any of his employees had installed OpenClaw, he says.

At another tech company, Valere, which works on software for organizations including Johns Hopkins University, an employee posted about OpenClaw on January 29 on an internal Slack channel for sharing new tech to potentially try out. The company’s president quickly responded that use of OpenClaw was strictly banned, Valere CEO Guy Pistone tells WIRED.

“If it got access to one of our developer’s machines, it could get access to our cloud services and our clients’ sensitive information, including credit card information and GitHub codebases,” Pistone says. “It’s pretty good at cleaning up some of its actions, which also scares me.”

A week later, Pistone did allow Valere’s research team to run OpenClaw on an employee’s old computer. The goal was to identify flaws in the software and potential fixes to make it more secure. The research team later advised limiting who can give orders to OpenClaw and exposing it to the Internet only with a password in place for its control panel to prevent unwanted access.

In a report shared with WIRED, the Valere researchers added that users have to “accept that the bot can be tricked.” For instance, if OpenClaw is set up to summarize a user’s email, a hacker could send a malicious email to the person instructing the AI to share copies of files on the person’s computer.

But Pistone is confident that safeguards can be put in place to make OpenClaw more secure. He has given a team at Valere 60 days to investigate. “If we don’t think we can do it in a reasonable time, we’ll forgo it,” he says. “Whoever figures out how to make it secure for businesses is definitely going to have a winner.”

Some companies concerned about OpenClaw are choosing to trust the cybersecurity protections they already have in place rather than introduce a formal or one-off ban. A CEO of a major software company says only about 15 programs are allowed on corporate devices. Anything else should be automatically blocked, says the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal security protocols. He says that while OpenClaw is innovative, he doubts that it will find a way to operate on the company’s network undetected.

Jan-Joost den Brinker, chief technology officer at Prague-based compliance software developer Dubrink, says he bought a dedicated machine not connected to company systems or accounts that employees can use to play around with OpenClaw. “We aren’t solving business problems with OpenClaw at the moment,” he says.

Massive, the web proxy company, is cautiously exploring OpenClaw’s commercial possibilities. Grad says it tested the AI tool on isolated machines in the cloud and then, last week, released ClawPod, a way for OpenClaw agents to use Massive’s services to browse the web. While OpenClaw is still not welcome on Massive’s systems without protections in place, the allure of the new technology and its moneymaking potential was too great to ignore. OpenClaw “might be a glimpse into the future. That’s why we’re building for it,” Grad says.

            <h2>Rare gifted word-learner dogs like to share their toys</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/rare-gifted-word-learner-dogs-like-to-share-their-toys/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We love hearing about the latest findings coming out of an Eötvös Loránd University (ELU) research group focused on gifted word learner (GWL) dogs—if only for the pictures of adorable doggoes playing with their toys. Just last month, we learned that such dogs can learn the labels for new toys just by overhearing their owners talking about those toys. The group is back with yet another new paper, published in the journal Animal Cognition, presenting evidence that GWL dogs have a preference for novel toys and like to share them with their owners. That social interaction seems to be the key to the unique cognitive abilities of these rare dogs.

As previously reported, ELU co-author Claudia Fugazza has been studying canine behavior and cognition for several years as part of the Genius Dog Challenge. For instance, the group’s 2022 study discovered that dogs store key sensory features about their toys—notably what they look like and how they smell—and recall those features when searching for the named toy. Prior studies had suggested that dogs typically rely on vision, or a combination of sight and smell, to locate target objects. GWL dogs can also identify objects based on verbal labels.

Last fall, Fugazza’s group discovered that certain dogs can not only memorize the names of objects like their favorite toys, but also extend those labels to entirely new objects with a similar function, regardless of whether or not they are similar in appearance. It’s a cognitively advanced ability known as “label extension,” and for animals to acquire it usually involves years of intensive training in captivity. But the dogs in this new study developed the ability to classify their toys by function with no formal training, merely by playing naturally with their owners. It’s akin to a person calling a hammer and a rock by the same name, or a child understanding that “cup” can describe a mug, a glass, or a tumbler because they serve the same function.

This time around, the group recruited 10 GWL dogs and 21 non-GWL dogs, all border collies, since this the most common breed to fall into the GWL category. They compiled a list of eight toys: two labeled, two unlabeled, and four that were new to each dog.

There was a two-week period where owners familiarized the dogs with the toys once a day for at least 10 minutes. Each toy was presented separately. For the labeled toys, owners moved the toy while crouched on the floor, repeatedly naming the toy (“Look at the [toy name]! Here is the [toy name]”).  They did not name the unlabeled toys. Owners devoted an equal amount of time to all the toys. Novel toys were excluded from the familiarization phase.

After that period, each dog participated in two trials lasting 90 seconds each. The dogs were provided free access to the toys (washed with soap to control for odor cues). In the first trial, owners entered first and placed the labeled and unlabeled toys, plus two of the novel ones, on the floor and stood at a distance, passive and ignoring the dogs as the latter explored the toys. After a five-minute break, the test was repeated with the other two novel toys. All tests were recorded remotely and the footage subsequently analyzed.

Human babies are known to pay more attention to named objects, and the authors thought the GWL dogs would show a similar response, but that’s not what happened. All the dogs, whether they were GWL dogs or not, strongly preferred the new toys, and there were no significant differences between the two groups of dogs in terms of how much time they spent playing with labeled vs. unlabeled. So just hearing the names of toys does not automatically increase a dog’s attention.

However, the GWL dogs were much more likely to pick up a toy—particularly the new ones—and bring it to their owner, clearly attempting to get said owner to play with them. The typical dogs were more likely to opt for passive physical contact with their owners. The authors interpreted this as a difference in social style rather than curiosity, possibly mirroring  the way human babies try to communicate with parents by pointing or showing objects to them.

“The way these dogs actively recruit humans into interactions around novel objects is intriguing,” said co-author Andrea Sommese of University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, Austria. “It raises the possibility that social motivation plays a role in why some dogs end up learning object names. Our results suggest that to understand why some dogs learn words, we may need to look less at the toys and more at the relationship. This opens new directions for studying how language-related skills can emerge in species that live so closely with humans.”

            <h2>Verizon acknowledges "pain" of new unlock policy, suggests change is coming</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/verizon-might-drop-its-annoying-35-day-wait-for-unlocking-paid-off-phones/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Following our report last week that Verizon is forcing people to wait 35 days for phone unlocks after paying off device installment plans, Verizon is apparently trying to eliminate the inconvenient delay. But Verizon hasn’t confirmed the plan to Ars, and a Verizon statement published by Android Authority yesterday did not provide any timeline for implementing the change.

As a refresher, an update to Verizon’s device unlocking policy for postpaid customers imposed a 35-day waiting period when a customer pays off the remaining balance of a device installment plan online, in the Verizon app, or with a Verizon gift card. There’s also a 35-day waiting period after paying off an installment plan over the phone or at a Verizon Authorized Retailer.

Saying restrictions are needed to counter fraud, Verizon will only unlock a phone immediately when someone pays off their device-plan balance at a Verizon corporate store or when someone pays off an installment plan on schedule via automatic payments. If you’re partway into one of Verizon’s 36-month device installment plans and pay off the remaining balance early, but without making a trip to a Verizon corporate store, you’d have to wait 35 days for an unlock that would allow you to switch the phone to a different carrier’s network.

Verizon reportedly said it is trying to change that “really soon,” but provided no specific or even estimated rollout date. Android Authority reported yesterday that it received a statement from Verizon saying, “we’ve already rolled out immediate unlocking for customers who pay at our corporate stores or use automated payment methods, since those systems can validate transactions in real-time. For other channels such as our app or authorized retailers, the 35-day window is strictly focused on fraud prevention, ensuring payments are fully cleared. That said, we recognize this is a pain point for our customers and our goal is to provide an immediate device unlock for all payment methods really soon. Our teams are diligently working to bridge that gap and we’ll update the website/policy when this is possible.”

Verizon did not mention this plan when we contacted the company’s public relations team on Friday. At the time, Verizon confirmed the current policy but didn’t say whether it had any plans to change it. We contacted Verizon again yesterday morning and today about the statement reported by Android Authority and have not received a response.

Shortly after or around the time this article was published today, PCMag reported that it received a statement from Verizon indicating that the 35-day delay will be dropped for online payments in a matter of weeks. A Verizon spokesperson “said that several weeks from now, the company would add an extra layer of authentication to its site for credit-card payments that would exempt device payoffs from the 35-day hold,” according to PCMag.

Until recently, Verizon had the most consumer-friendly unlocking policy of the major nationwide wireless carriers in the US. This was because of rules imposed on Verizon’s 700 MHz spectrum licenses and merger conditions on the firm’s purchase of TracFone, which resulted in phones being unlocked after 60 days.

Verizon used to sell phones that were already unlocked, but in 2019, it obtained a waiver from the Federal Communications Commission allowing it to lock phones for 60 days to deter fraud. Verizon subsequently claimed that even the 60-day period wasn’t long enough to stop fraud, and last month received another waiver that lifted the unlocking requirement.

Verizon started overhauling its unlocking policies after receiving the latest waiver, and the rollout has been confusing. When the new policy was put online with an effective date of January 27, it applied the 35-day delay only to cases in which a customer uses a Verizon gift card to buy a phone or pay off the remaining balance.

As we reported, Verizon last week changed that language on the policy page to apply the 35-day delay in more scenarios, but did not change the January 27 effective date. The Verizon statement quoted by Android Authority yesterday said the full terms were presented to customers starting on January 27 even though those terms weren’t fully described on the webpage.

“Regarding the website update timing, the new device unlocking policy went into effect on January 27th,” the Verizon statement said. “Customers purchasing or upgrading from that date were (and are being) presented with the full terms of the new policy at their point of sale. We’ll make sure all our public-facing info is also clear and consistent across channels.”

But information still is not “clear and consistent across channels,” even when it comes to terms presented directly to phone buyers. For example, the version of the device unlocking policy on Verizon’s webpage for ordering an iPhone 17 says the 35-day delay only applies when a customer uses a Verizon gift card to buy a phone or pay off the remaining balance. We found the same language today in Verizon’s listings for other iPhones and devices made by Google, Samsung, and Motorola.

This version of the policy presented to phone buyers would lead a consumer to believe that a phone will be unlocked automatically once the device financing agreement balance is paid in full, as long as a gift card isn’t used. That is not accurate, as we described in this article and our article last week.

In one more development we found after this article published, Verizon changed its device unlocking policy again today and updated the effective date to February 18. The new policy is similar to an older version; it details the 35-day unlocking delay after gift card payments but deletes the part that applied the 35-day delay to payments made online or in the Verizon app. This omission is curious because Verizon’s statements to other media outlets indicate that the 35-day delay is still in place for online payments.

The omission is apparently explained by new language in the policy that says, “A secure payment method is required to unlock a device immediately when paying the full device balance.” But as far as we know, the only “secure payment methods” that currently result in an immediate unlock require paying in a Verizon corporate store. While a separate Verizon FAQ still describes the in-store limitation, a user reading the policy after today’s update may be given the false belief that paying off a device on Verizon’s website will result in an immediate unlock.

The Verizon unlocking policy discussed so far in this article is for postpaid customers. Verizon’s policy for prepaid customers locks phones to its network “until the completion of 365 days of paid and active service.”

AT&T’s unlocking policy says postpaid phones purchased at least 60 days ago can be unlocked when the device is paid in full. The T-Mobile policy says postpaid phones active on the T-Mobile network for at least 40 days can be unlocked after being paid in full. AT&T imposes a six-month waiting period for unlocking prepaid phones, while T-Mobile has a 365-day waiting period for prepaid phones.

This article was updated with another change to Verizon’s unlocking policy and a statement reported by PCMag.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">2026 is looking like a pretty good year for affordable electric vehicles. There’s a new Nissan Leaf that starts at a hair under $30,000 (as long as you ignore the destination charge). We’ll soon drive the reborn Chevrolet Bolt—with a new lithium iron phosphate battery, it also has a price tag starting with a two (again, ignoring the destination charge). And the closer you get to $40,000, the more your options expand: the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Chevy Equinox EV, Toyota bZ, Tesla Model 3, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Subaru Solterra all fall within that price bracket, and some of those are pretty good cars.

But what if you only want to spend a fraction of that? Well, you won’t be buying anything new, but then neither do three-quarters of American car buyers, and there’s nothing wrong with that. A few weeks ago, we looked at what passes for the used EV bargain basement—ones that cost $5,000 or less. As long as you’re OK with limited range and slow charging, going electric on a shoestring is possible. But if you’re prepared to spend twice that, it turns out you’ve got plenty of options.

As before, we stress that you should have a reliable place to charge an EV if you’re going to buy one, which means at home at night or at work during the day. At this price range, you’re unlikely to find something that DC fast charges quickly, and relying on public AC charging sounds stressful. You’ll probably find a car with some battery degradation, but for the vast majority of models that use active battery cooling, this should be minimal; about 2 percent a year appears to be the average.

EVs in the US usually come with an eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty for the battery, although cars in this price range will probably be too old to take advantage of it. If you can, have the car checked out by an independent EV specialist; if not, for some models, there are apps you can use. Even a test drive would work, particularly if you can fully recharge it and see how much range the car reports.

In this price range, you should find plenty of two of Ars’ favorite small EVs: the BMW i3 and the Chevy Bolt. The i3 was one of the first EVs we tested; it appeared on the market around the same time Ars started covering cars. Even now, more than a decade later, there’s some seriously cool stuff in an i3. You’re unlikely to find any other car with a carbon fiber passenger cell for this little money, for one thing. And the interior is still one of the most stylish you’ll find on four wheels. It’s the perfect size for city traffic, and it handles pretty well, too.

Of course, it’s not the perfect EV. Its tires are an odd size and expensive to replace. And in this price range, you’re more likely to find earlier cars that came with a 22 kWh pack and a range of 81 miles (130 km), although for model year 2017, that increased to 33 kWh and 114 miles (183 km), making these the ones to look for. But plenty of i3s can also be found with the range extender, a two-cylinder motorbike engine that adds another 60 or 70 miles (97–112 km). And it is a true range extender—the little engine can’t directly drive the rear wheels; purists take note.

Similarly, we were smitten with the Chevy Bolt from our very first time behind the wheel at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show. The following year, the little Bolt hit the market as the first affordable EV to offer more than 200 miles of range on a full battery: 238 miles (383 km) to be precise. That might not sound like a lot in 2026, when people expect a new EV to get 300 miles (482 km) between charges, but back then, it was plenty compared to the likes of the i3 or the compliance cars offered by other OEMs. And Tesla’s Model 3 was still some way away, remember.

The Bolt is efficient, but can also be a hoot to drive, especially if you fit it with tires that prioritize grip over low rolling resistance. Some people find the front seats uncomfortable. And it will only accept DC fast charges at up to 55 kW, but as long as you understand that up front, road trips are more than possible. Early Bolts—the ones in this price range—should have had their battery replaced as part of a $1.8 billion recall.

You’ll find lots of Nissan Leafs for less than $10,000, a mix of first- and second-generation models. Unlike the new Leaf, these don’t have active battery cooling, and thus will be subject to more battery degradation and therefore lost range than alternatives. (There’s a smartphone app you can use to interrogate the battery.) The Leaf is competent, but wouldn’t be our first pick over the Bolt.

If you’re feeling a bit quirky, consider a compliance car. You’ll find Volkswagen e-Golfs, electric Ford Focuses, Kia Souls, and even some Toyota RAV4s and Mercedes-Benz B-classes, the latter two both using Tesla-supplied powertrains. As all of these are less common, it’s probably worth investigating how easily you can get them fixed if something breaks.

And there are quite a few used Teslas within our budget. Mostly these are an older Model S with stratospheric mileages, but friend-of-Ars, the Late Brake Show’s Jonny Smith, bought a Tesla with more than 260,000 miles last year and seems to be doing OK with it. This includes benefiting from free Supercharging, although this does not apply to every Model S. And at this price, everyone will think you bought the car well before Elon took off the mask.</div>

            <h2>Lawsuit: EPA revoking greenhouse gas finding risks “thousands of avoidable deaths”</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/lawsuit-epa-revoking-greenhouse-gas-finding-risks-thousands-of-avoidable-deaths/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency was accused of abandoning its mission to protect public health after repealing an “endangerment finding” that has served as the basis for federal climate change regulations for 17 years.

The lawsuit came from more than a dozen environmental and health groups, including the American Public Health Association, the American Lung Association, the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), the Clean Air Council, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the Sierra Club, and the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The groups have asked the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the EPA decision, which also eliminated requirements controlling greenhouse gas emissions in new cars and trucks. Urging a return to the status quo, the groups argued that the Trump administration is anti-science and illegally moving to benefit the fossil fuel industry, despite a mountain of evidence demonstrating the deadly consequences of unchecked pollution and climate change-induced floods, droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes.

“Undercutting the ability of the federal government to tackle the largest source of climate pollution is deadly serious,” Meredith Hankins, legal director for federal climate at NRDC, said in an EDF roundup of statements from plaintiffs.

The science is overwhelmingly clear, the groups argued, despite the Trump EPA attempting to muddy the waters by forming a since-disbanded working group of climate contrarians.

Trump is a longtime climate denier, as evidenced by a Euro News tracker monitoring his most controversial comments. Most recently, during a cold snap affecting much of the US, he predictably trolled environmentalists, writing on Truth Social, “could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain—WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING?”

The EPA’s final rule summary bragged that “this is the single largest deregulatory action in US history and will save Americans over $1.3 trillion” by 2055. Supposedly, carmakers will pass on any savings from no longer having to meet emissions requirements, giving Americans more access to affordable cars by shutting down expensive emissions and EV mandates “strangling” the auto industry. Sounding nothing like an agency created to monitor pollutants, a fact sheet on the final rule emphasized that Trump’s EPA “chooses consumer choice over climate change zealotry every time.”

Critics quickly slammed Trump’s claims that removing the endangerment finding would help the economy. Any savings from cheaper vehicles or reduced costs of charging infrastructure (as Americans ostensibly buy fewer EVs) would be offset by $1.4 trillion “in additional costs from increased fuel purchases, vehicle repair and maintenance, insurance, traffic congestion, and noise,” The Guardian reported. The EPA’s economic analysis also ignores public health costs, the groups suing alleged. David Pettit, an attorney at the CBD’s Climate Law Institute, slammed the EPA’s messaging as an attempt to sway consumers without explaining the true costs.

“Nobody but Big Oil profits from Trump trashing climate science and making cars and trucks guzzle and pollute more,” Pettit said. “Consumers will pay more to fill up, and our skies and oceans will fill up with more pollution.”

If the court sides with the EPA, “people everywhere will face more pollution, higher costs, and thousands of avoidable deaths,” Peter Zalzal, EDF’s associate vice president of clean air strategies, said.

For environmentalists, the decision to sue the EPA was risky but necessary. By putting up a fight, they risk a court potentially reversing the 2009 Supreme Court ruling requiring the EPA to conduct the initial endangerment analysis and then regulate any pollution found from greenhouse gases.

Seemingly, that reversal is what the Trump administration has been angling for, hoping the case will reach the Supreme Court, which is more conservative today and perhaps less likely to read the Clean Air Act as broadly as the 2009 court.

It’s worth the risk, according to William Piermattei, the managing director of the Environmental Law Program at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law. He told The New York Times that environmentalists had no choice but to file the lawsuit and act on the public’s behalf.

Environmentalists “must challenge this,” Piermattei said. If they didn’t, they’d be “agreeing that we should not regulate greenhouse gasses under the Clean Air Act, full stop.” He suggested that “a majority of the public, does not agree with that statement at all.”

Since 2010, the EPA has found that the scientific basis for concluding that “elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health and welfare of current and future US generations is robust, voluminous, and compelling.” And since then, the evidence base has only grown, the groups suing said.

Trump used to seem intimidated by the “overwhelming” evidence, environmentalists have noted. During Trump’s prior term, he notably left the endangerment finding in place, perhaps expecting that the evidence was irrefutable. He’s now renewed that fight, arguing that the evidence should be set aside, so that courts can focus on whether Congress “must weigh in on ‘major questions’ that have significant political and economic implications” and serve as a check on the EPA.

In the EPA’s comments addressing public concerns about the agency ignoring evidence, the agency has already argued that evidence of climate change is “out of scope” since the EPA did not repeal the basis of the finding. Instead, the EPA claims it is merely challenging its own authority to continue to regulate the auto industry for harmful emissions, suggesting that only Congress has that authority.

The Clean Air Act “does not provide EPA statutory authority to prescribe motor vehicle emission standards for the purpose of addressing global climate change concerns,” the EPA said. “In the absence of such authority, the Endangerment Finding is not valid, and EPA cannot retain the regulations that resulted from it.”

Whether courts will agree that evidence supporting climate change is “out of scope” could determine whether the Supreme Court’s prior decision that compelled the endangerment finding is ultimately overturned. If that happens, subsequent administrations may struggle to issue a new endangerment finding to undo any potential damage. All eyes would then turn to Congress to pass a law to uphold protections.

By ignoring science, the EPA risks eroding public trust, according to Hana Vizcarra, a senior lawyer at the nonprofit Earthjustice, which is representing several groups in the litigation.

“With this action, EPA flips its mission on its head,” Vizcarra said. “It abandons its core mandate to protect human health and the environment to boost polluting industries and attempts to rewrite the law in order to do so.”

Groups appear confident that the courts will consider the science. Joanne Spalding, director of the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, noted that the early 2000s litigation from the Sierra Club brought about the original EPA protections. She vowed that the Sierra Club would continue fighting to keep them.

“People should not be forced to suffer for this administration’s blind allegiance to the fossil fuel industry and corporate polluters,” Spalding said. “This shortsighted rollback is blatantly unlawful and their efforts to force this upon the American people will fail.”

Ankush Bansal, board president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, warned that courts cannot afford to ignore the evidence. The EPA’s “devastating decision” goes “against the science and testimony of countless scientists, health care professionals, and public health practitioners,” Bansal said. If upheld, the long-term consequences could seemingly bury courts in future legal battles.

“It will result in direct harm to the health of Americans throughout the country, particularly children, older adults, those with chronic illnesses, and other vulnerable populations, rural to urban, red and blue, of all races and incomes,” Bansal said. “The increased exposure to harmful pollutants and other greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel production and consumption will make America sicker, not healthier, less prosperous, not more, for generations to come.”</div>

            <h2>5 changes to know about in Apple's latest iOS, macOS, and iPadOS betas</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/5-changes-to-know-about-in-apples-latest-ios-macos-and-ipados-betas/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week, Apple released the first developer betas for iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, macOS 26.4, and its other operating systems. On Tuesday, it followed those up with public beta versions of the same updates.

Usually released around the midpoint between one major iOS release and the next, the *.4 updates to its operating system usually include a significant batch of new features and other refinements, and if the first beta is any indication, this year’s releases uphold that tradition.

A new “Playlist Playground” feature will let Apple Music subscribers generate playlists with text prompts, and native support for video podcasts is coming to the Podcasts app. The Creator Studio version of the Freeform drawing and collaboration app is also available in the 26.4 updates, allowing subscribers to access stock images from Apple’s Content Hub and to insert AI-generated images.

But we’ve spent time digging through the betas to identify some of the more below-the-surface improvements and changes that Apple is testing. Some of these changes won’t come to the public versions of the software until a later release; others may be removed or changed between now and when the 26.4 update is made available to the general public. But generally, Apple’s betas give us a good idea of what the final release will look like.

One feature that hasn’t appeared in these betas? The new “more intelligent Siri” that Apple has been promising since the iOS 18 launch in 2024. Apple delayed the feature until sometime in 2026, citing that it wasn’t meeting the company’s standards for quality and reliability.

Reports indicated that the company had been planning to make the new Siri part of the 26.4 update, but as of earlier this month, Apple has reportedly decided to push it to the 26.5 release or later; even releasing it as part of iOS 27 in the fall would technically not run afoul of the “2026” promise.

Before we begin, the standard warning about installing beta software on hardware you rely on day to day. Although these point updates are generally more stable than the major releases Apple tests in the summer and fall, they can still contain major bugs and may cause your device to behave strangely. The first beta, in particular, tends to be the roughest—more stable versions will be released in the coming weeks, and we should see the final version of the update within the next couple months.

In macOS 11 Big Sur, Apple added an on-by-default “Optimized Battery Charging” toggle to the operating system that would allow macOS to limit your battery’s charge percentage to 80 percent based on your usage and charging behavior. The idea is to limit the time your battery spends charging while full, something that can gradually reduce its capacity.

The macOS 26.4 update adds a new slider similar to the one in iOS, further allowing users to manually specify a maximum charge limit that is always observed, no matter what. It’s adjustable in 5 percent increments from 80 to 100 percent.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that limiting your charge percentage can lengthen the useful life of your battery and reduce wear, but there’s nothing that will fully prevent a battery from wearing out and losing capacity over time. It’s up to users to decide whether an immediately noticeable everyday hit to battery life is worth a slightly longer service life.

In the current macOS betas, enabling a charge limit manually doesn’t disable the Optimized Battery Charging feature the way it does in iOS. It’s unclear if this is an early bug or an intentional difference in how the feature is implemented in macOS.

Apple has been infamously slow to adopt support for the Rich Communication Services (RCS) messaging protocol used by most modern Android phones. Apple-to-Apple messaging was handled using iMessage, which supports end-to-end encryption among many other features. But for many years, it stuck by the aging SMS standard for “green bubble” texting between Apple’s platforms and others, to the enduring frustration of anyone with a single Android-using friend in a group chat.

Apple finally began supporting RCS messaging for major cellular carriers in iOS 18, and has slowly expanded support to other networks in subsequent releases. But Apple’s implementation still doesn’t support end-to-end encryption, which was added to the RCS standard about a year ago.

The 26.4 update is the first to begin testing encryption for RCS messages. But as with the initial RCS rollout, Apple is moving slowly and deliberately: for now, encrypted RCS messaging only works when texting between Apple devices, and not between Apple devices and Android phones. The feature also won’t be included in the final 26.4 release—it’s only included in the betas for testing purposes, and it “will be available to customers in a future software update for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS.”

Encrypted iMessage and RCS chats will be labeled with a lock icon, much like how most web browsers label HTTPS sites.

To support encrypted messaging, Apple will jump from version 2.4 of the RCS Universal Profile to version 3.0. This should also enable support for several improvements in versions 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 of the RCS standard, including previously iMessage-exclusive things like editing and recalling messages and replying to specific messages inline.

As part of the macOS 12 Monterey/iPadOS 15 beta cycle in 2021, Apple attempted a pretty radical redesign of the Safari browser that combined your tabs and the address bar into one, with the goal of increasing the amount of viewable space on the pages you were viewing. By the time both operating systems were released to the public, Safari’s default design had more or less reverted to its previous state, but the “compact” tab view lived on as an optional view in the settings for those who liked it.

Tahoe, the Safari 26 update, and iPadOS 26 all removed that Compact view entirely, though a version of the Compact view became the default for the iPhone version of Safari. The macOS 26.4, Safari 26.4, and iPadOS 26.4 updates restore the Compact tab option to the other versions of Safari.

Originally introduced in the iOS 17.3 update, Apple’s “Stolen Device Protection” toggle for iPhones added an extra layer of security for users whose phones were stolen by people who had learned their passcodes. With Stolen Device Protection enabled, an iPhone that had been removed from “familiar locations, such as home or work” would require biometric Face ID or Touch ID authentication before accessing stored passwords and credit cards, erasing your phone, or changing Apple Account passwords. Normally, users can enter their passcodes as a fallback; Stolen Device Protection removes that fallback.

The iOS 26.4 update will make Stolen Device Protection on by default. Generally, you won’t notice a difference in how your phone behaves, but if you’re traveling or away from places where you regularly use your phone and you can’t use your passcode to access certain information, this is why.

It’s possible to switch off Stolen Device protection, but doing so requires biometric authentication, an hour-long wait, and then a second biometric authentication. (This extended wait is also required for disabling Find My, changing your phone’s passcode, or changing Touch ID and Face ID settings.)

Apple’s Rosetta 2 was a crucial support beam in the bridge from the Intel Mac era to the Apple Silicon era, enabling unmodified Intel-native apps to run on the M1 and later processors, with noticeable but manageable performance and responsiveness hits. As with the original Rosetta, it allowed Apple to execute a major CPU architecture switch while keeping it mostly invisible to Mac users, and it bought developers time to release Arm-native versions of their apps so they could take full advantage of the new chips.

But now that the transition is complete and the last Intel Macs are fading into the rearview, Apple plans to remove the translation layer from future versions of macOS, with some exceptions for games that rely on the technology.

Rosetta 2 won’t be completely removed until macOS 28, but macOS 26.4 will be the first to begin warning users about the end of Rosetta when they launch Intel-native apps. Those notifications link to an Apple support page about identifying and updating Intel-only apps to Apple Silicon-native versions (or universal binaries that support both architectures).

Apple has deployed this “adding notifications without removing functionality” approach to deprecating older apps before. Versions 10.13 and 10.14 of macOS would show users pop-ups about the end of support for 32-bit apps for a couple of years before that support was removed in macOS 10.15, for example.</div>

            <h2>A Huge Survey of CEOs and Other Execs Just Found Something Damning About AI’s Effects on Productivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-19</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The case against AI’s usefulness in the workplace continues to grow.

In a new analysis of a survey published by the National Bureau of Economic Research and highlighted by Fortune, around 90 percent of the nearly 6,000  interviewed CEOs, chief financial officers, and other top executives at firms across the US, UK, Germany, and Australia, said that AI has had no impact on productivity or employment at their business.

To be clear, the question was about AI’s impact generally, and not just from implementing it in the workplace. But around 70 percent of the firms reported actively using AI, meaning the vast majority of them are admitting that adopting the tech hasn’t budged the needle for them yet.

The CEOs themselves don’t appear to be getting a whole lot out of using AI tools. While two-thirds said they personally used AI, their average use amounted to only 1.5 hours a week, the survey found — less time than most people spend doomscrolling on their phones in a single day. That’s striking, considering that execs tend to be far more enthusiastic about the tech compared to their underlings. Another recent survey, for example, found that 40 percent of rank-and-file white collar workers thought AI didn’t save them any time at work, while 98 percent of their bosses did.

These latest findings will continue to raise questions about AI’s economic impact, and in its promise to supercharge productivity in the workplace. In another recent survey, more than half of nearly 4,500 CEOs said their companies weren’t seeing a financial return from investing in AI. A notable MIT study rang alarm bells across the industry after findings that 95 percent of companies that incorporated AI experiencing no meaningful growth in revenue.

Why this is the case isn’t much of a mystery. Studies have found that AIs fail at completing remote work and other white collar tasks, and slow down rather than speed up human programmers because they frequently slip errors into their code. Meanwhile, a fresher avenue of research exploring AI’s effect on the workforce using it is already producing damning insights. The tech may actually be intensifying work and accelerating burn-out, one report found, and it’s also leading to employees producing low-quality “workslop” that their co-workers are forced to fix, bogging down workflows and leading to resentment, another found — leading the researchers to opine that its “most alarming cost may be interpersonal.”

Despite this, AI adoption has gone up since the start up of 2025, the new survey found, with the percentage of businesses using AI tech increasing from 61 percent in February-April 2025 to 71 percent in November 2025-January 2026.

Perhaps what AI brings to the table is tough to quantify from an economic standpoint. Decades ago, the Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Solow correctly predicted that the advent of information technology wouldn’t lead to a measurable surge in productivity, and instead would lead to a slow in productivity growth. The phenomenon is now called the Solow paradox: though computers were obviously transformative, they didn’t immediately translate to economic gains.

But the business world, nonetheless, is clinging to the hope that the tech’s promises will be borne out in the long run. The surveyed executives are predicting that AI will boost productivity by 1.4 percent and output by 0.8 percent over the next three years — while also cutting down employment by 0.5 percent. Hard to say which part they’re excited about more.

            <h2>AI Will Destroy Millions of White Collars Jobs in the Coming Months, Andrew Yang Warns, Driving Surge of Personal Bankruptcies</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-labor-andrew-yang">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Andrew Yang — millionaire entrepreneur, noted Ivy leaguer, and one-time presidential hopeful — has a grim warning for his fellow salaried professionals: AI is about to wipe “millions” of office jobs over the coming months.

In an essay published on his Substack and flagged by Business Insider, Yang explained what he calls the “great disemboweling of white-collar jobs” due to AI.

“Do you sit at a desk and look at a computer much of the day?” he challenged. “Take this very seriously.”

“This automation wave will kick millions of white-collar workers to the curb in the next 12-18 months,” Yang wrote. “As one company starts to streamline, all of their competitors will follow suit. It will become a competition because the stock market will reward you if you cut headcount and punish you if you don’t. As one investor put it, ‘sell anything that consists of people sitting at a desk looking at a computer.&#39;”

Yang predicts that mid-career office professionals will be among the first to go. Right now, there are around 70 million office workers in the United States, but “expect that number to be reduced substantially, by 20-50 percent in the next several years,” the entrepreneur warned.

Yang went so far as to urge anyone in mid-career management, particularly those who own homes in the affluent burbs of Silicon Valley or Westchester County, New York to put there house up for sale now, to avoid the mad scramble once the labor apocalypse hits. “It might not feel great being first, but you don’t want to be last,” Yang wrote.

Going on, Yang predicted that personal bankruptcies will “surge” as office workers struggle to find gainful employment to maintain their lifestyles. This, he says, will also come for service workers down-wind of office labor — those employed as drycleaners, hair stylists, and dog walkers.

The “great disemboweling” will likewise impact recent college grads — a section which is already suffering through a brutal hiring market in the US — according to Yang.

All of this will result in even greater unrest and angst as the wealth generated by the AI spending boom will largely go to the few CEOs and executives at the top of the food chain. “Imagine what people are going to think when we all feel like serfs to AI overlords that have soaked up the white-collar work?” Yang posits.

At the end of the day, Yang’s pronouncement reads like a lot of the other AI doomsaying out there, much of which comes, ironically, from the tech moguls themselves. Like those prophecies, Yang’s ends when it comes time to supply a constructive answer to the world-upending crisis beyond some vague idea of universal basic income.

“Expect it to get incredibly, intergenerationally rough out there,” Yang concluded. “Batten down the hatches, and do what you can for yourself and those around you.”

            <h2>SpaceX Angling for Military Contract to Produce Drone Swarms</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2017, Elon Musk signed an open letter calling on the United Nations to ban the development of autonomous weapons.

“We do not have long to act,” the letter read. “Once this Pandora’s box is opened, it will be hard to close.”

In 2018, he signed a pledge by the Future of Life Institute, agreeing that “the decision to take a human life should never be delegated to a machine” and that “we will neither participate in nor support the development, manufacture, trade, or use of lethal autonomous weapons.”

But the draw of big government contracts to do exactly what he opposed back then has seemingly become too lucrative to remain ethically consistent. As Bloomberg reports, SpaceX and xAI, the latter of which was recently folded into the former, are now competing in a Pentagon contest to produce voice-controlled, autonomous drone swarming tech.

Inside sources told Bloomberg that the Pentagon’s contest has a $100 million prize and was launched last month. The goal is to develop a drone swarm that can respond to voice commands simultaneously.

However, considering the current state of large language models, which continue to be plagued by hallucinations, it’s no wonder experts have voiced concerns about using generative AI to command lethal drones.

While coordinated movement of drones is already well-established tech, having a whole network of drones move autonomously at once in pursuit of a target has proven extremely difficult on the battlefield, per Bloomberg‘s sources.

The effort is part of the Trump administration’s Defense Autonomous Warfare Group (DAWG), and the Defense Innovation Unit, the Pentagon’s arm dedicated to tapping Silicon Valley for cutting-edge tech.

The goal is to progressively develop the concept from software to real-life testing across five separate phases.

According to Bloomberg‘s sources, the drones won’t just be used for reconnaissance, implying they will also serve offensive purposes. The human-machine interaction “will directly impact the lethality and effectiveness of these systems.”

That’s a considerable departure for SpaceX, which has previously inked government contracts for access to space and military satellites, but not weapons systems.

Musk’s xAI signed a $200 million contract with the US military for the use of its Grok chatbot and has been looking to hire engineers with security clearance.

The news comes ahead of a rumored SpaceX IPO at a record-crushing valuation of $1.25 trillion. How investors will react to Musk reversing his stance on the use of autonomous weapons systems remains to be seen.

Musk claimed earlier this month that SpaceX would “form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform,” following the company’s merger with xAI.

The CEO, however, made no mention of his companies’ efforts to develop drone swarms.

            <div id="article-text">After being merged with Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI, SpaceX is gearing up for a $1.25 trillion IPO — but since the entity is still currently private, it’s remained mostly out of reach of everyday investors.

But Powerlaw Corp, a fund that owns stakes in buzzy and not-yet-public companies including SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic, is giving retail traders an early taste of what could be in store for them. As Bloomberg reports, the $1.2 billion fund announced in a regulatory filing that it’s looking to give mom-and-pop investors a shot at buying in.

“With the pool of capital in private markets, the best companies are not choosing to go public,” Powerlaw investor and Jazz Venture Partners managing partner John Spinale told Bloomberg. “This robs the public the ability to access the high-growth firms.”

Powerlaw will act as the intermediary and charge shareholders a 2.5 percent management fee. The fund is planning for a direct listing, meaning that it will sell existing shares by current stockholders, unlike an IPO, which involves selling new shares to raise capital.

However, the fund will still need approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission before it can go ahead.

“Our investment objective is long-term capital appreciation,” the regulatory filing reads. “We seek to achieve our investment objective by investing in a concentrated portfolio of approximately 15 late-stage technology companies.”

Powerlaw’s portfolio includes six AI companies, including xAI, Perplexity, OpenAI, and Anthropic, as well as predictions market platform Kalshi, and even Palmer Luckey’s defense contractor Anduril.

“The fund reflects [parent company] Akkadian’s mission to democratize access to Silicon Valley’s premier technology investments,” the filing reads.

But taking advantage of the service could come with risks. For one, shareholders may not see immediate gains when share prices of these companies rise due to the way Powerlaw structures its trades. Closed-end funds also routinely trade at a significant premium to their actual holdings.

Information could also be hard to come by as privately traded companies like SpaceX and OpenAI aren’t required to disclose financial statements publicly. And a more prosaic possibility: these hype-fueled stocks could eventually crash for a variety of reasons.

And a similar investment platform, called Linqto, which aimed to allow accredited investors to invest in private and pre-IPO companies, filed for bankruptcy in July of last year after facing alleged security violations, further highlighting the inherent risks of trying to invest in private companies through an intermediary.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the strangest stories in contemporary statecraft refuses to go away.

New reporting by the Washington Post revealed that a Norwegian government scientist has been secretly working on a pulse-energy weapon, an approximation of the fabled “Havana syndrome” gun, which may or may not even exist. Specifically, the weapon was described as a device capable of emitting powerful pulses of microwave energy.

Here’s where things get truly weird. In 2024, after the unnamed scientist had presumably produced a working unit, he became skeptical of its efficacy. So he did what any self-respecting man of science would do, and turned the weapon on himself in an attempt to demonstrate microwave weapons are harmless, WaPo reported.

The result was unfortunately pretty gnarly. Instead of proving the tech to be harmless, the weapon did what it was built to do, scrambling the man’s brain and bringing on a host of “neurological symptoms” associated with the infamous Havana syndrome, four people with knowledge of the event told WaPo.

Though the medical community has no precise working definition of Havana syndrome — preferring the term “Anomalous Health Incidents” — these fabled symptoms experienced by US and Canadian embassy staff in Havana, Cuba are said to include head or ear pain, loss of balance or dizziness, insomnia, confusion, brain fog, emotional distress, and nausea.

Never ones to waste an opportunity, the event spurred at least two separate visits from CIA and US State Department apparatchiks, according to WaPo. That may have something to do with a 2024 Department of Homeland Security operation to buy a pulsed-radio weapon for eight-figures, news of which broke earlier this year.

It’s just the latest episode in a decade-long search to link US foreign adversaries to Havana syndrome, a vague and highly-suspect charge that was once considered debunked. As far as this incident goes, anyone hoping it would reveal further insights into the geopolitical legend will be disappointed.

For one thing, WaPo‘s government sources noted that successful production of a weapon in US-allied Norway does nothing to prove that foreign adversaries are conspiring to use direct energy devices out in the open. (That’s in keeping with a 2023 report by five US intelligence agencies, which concluded it was “highly unlikely” that Havana syndrome was the result of a malicious direct-energy attack, though that hasn’t stopped hawkish politicians from claiming otherwise.)

One source poured even more cold water on the whole thing, sharing their opinion that the scientist’s symptoms don’t line up with the “classic” effects of Havana syndrome.

Still, the Norwegian incident has reinvigorated the claim that direct energy weapons are capable of inducing brain damage — whether its creators believe it or not.

            <h2>Tesla Robotaxis Crashing Vastly More Often Than Human Drivers</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/advanced-transport/tesla-robotaxis-crashing-more-human-drivers">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ostensible point of robotaxis is that they’re supposed to be safer drivers than humans.

According to updated filings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration examined by Electrek, the Elon Musk-owned automaker has reported another five crashes involving its capital-R “Robotaxis,” for a total of 14 documented collisions since the service began operating in Austin, Texas last June.

The newly reported crashes were submitted by Tesla last month and occurred between December 2025 and January 2026. They include a collision with a fixed object at 17 miles per hour, a crash with a bus while the Robotaxi was stationary, a crash with a truck at four miles per hour, and two incidents in which the Tesla backed into a pole or tree.

Because Tesla heavily censors its crash reports, it’s impossible to get a clear idea of what happened in any of these incidents. No amount of blank ink, however, can cover the fact that the Robotaxis are getting into accidents at a high rate — a rate, Electrek calculates, that’s not only worse than its competitors, but the fallible human drivers it’s supposed to outmode.

Based on the mileage data shared in Tesla’s Q4 2025  earnings, the EV blog estimates that the Robotaxi fleet accumulated roughly 800,000 miles by mid-January. Divide that by fourteen, and that works out to a crash once every 57,000 miles. Compare that to Tesla’s Vehicle Safety Report, which claims that the average American driver experiences a minor collision every 229,000 miles, and it means the Robotaxis are crashing at a rate four times higher than human motorists.

It looks even worse when you compare Tesla’s fleet to Waymo’s, a company that Musk constantly tries to pick fights with, insisting that his self-driving cars are superior. Across over 127 million fully driverless miles, Waymo averages an accident around every 98,000 miles.

Even this already sizable gap may slightly flatter Tesla. In reality, Waymo’s fleet comprises over 2,000 robotaxis, while Tesla has less than fifty. Waymo operates in several major US cities, while Tesla is limited to a small area of just one. And though it’s been vague about how much it relies on remote teleoperation, Waymo cars are considered fully driverless, meaning there’s no human driver or safety monitor inside the vehicle. Or for that matter, outside it: Tesla reportedly resorted to having a human-driven car tail its Robotaxis to fulfill a Musk boast that the service would start giving rides with no supervisor in the cabs.

In short, Waymo and Tesla aren’t in the same league.

The new crashes weren’t the only alarming takeaway in the updated NHTSA data. Tesla also quietly revised a report for a July 2025 crash that was originally described as causing “property damage only.” Now, a new version submitted in December said that the injury severity was “Minor W/Hospitalization.” It took Tesla nearly half a year to properly report that someone was hurt by one of its cars.

The delay isn’t an isolated incident. The NHTSA previously launched an investigation into Tesla for repeatedly failing to report crashes in time, sometimes several months after the accidents occurred. It also heavily censors its reports by redacting crucial details like crash narrative under the guise of protecting “confidential business information.” The practice is legal, but shady. As Electrek notes, it’s the only robotaxi company that systematically censors these details in all of its NHTSA filings.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI is nearing a deal to raise more than $100 billion at a valuation that could exceed $850 billion, Bloomberg reports, citing sources familiar with the matter.

The deal comes as the ChatGPT-maker burns through cash as it inches towards profitability. To that end, OpenAI has said it will soon launch ads in ChatGPT for free users, a gamble that could lead to more revenue or could send users running from the platform.

Apparently investors think it’s worth the risk if they’re valuing the company $20 billion higher than the $830 billion valuation initially expected. The company’s pre-money value will remain at $730 billion, per Bloomberg’s source.

The first tranches of funding are reportedly coming from the usual suspects: Amazon (already in talks to invest up to $50 billion), SoftBank (gearing up for $30 billion), Nvidia (close to investing $20 billion), and Microsoft. VC firms and sovereign wealth funds are expected to close later, potentially bringing the total amount raised higher.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/19/current-is-a-new-rss-reader-thats-more-like-a-river-than-an-inbox/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A new app called Current is rethinking the RSS reader, aiming to offer a reading experience that feels more like dipping into a stream of news, and less like a task to be completed. In doing so, the app could make using RSS feeds to consume news and information a more approachable experience for those who aren’t consuming news for work or consider themselves information junkies.

Current’s developer, Terry Godier, said he noticed that he always felt guilty when returning to his feed reader after a few days away. He attributed his feelings to how most readers were built to resemble email inboxes, with unread counts, and bolded text for new items.

“Email’s unread count means something specific: these are messages from real people who wrote to you and are, in some cases, actively waiting for your response. The number isn’t neutral information. It’s a measure of social debt,” Godier wrote in a blog post about how he came to create Current, which is a side project he worked on during his free time.

“But when we applied that same visual language to RSS…we imported the anxiety without the cause,” he said.

For those unfamiliar, RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, is a format that allows users to access updated information from websites in a structured format. For instance, new headlines and articles from your favorite news site would appear as new, unread entries in the RSS reader (aka news reader or feed reader) of your choice.

The format was hugely popular in the early 2000s until the 2006 arrival of Twitter shifted people to another platform for real-time news and information sharing. Within a few years, people were ditching Google’s popular RSS reader, Google Reader, in favor of Twitter’s 140-character posts. Another few years later, Google Reader shut down for good. (We still miss it.)

But RSS itself never died. In addition to being the underlying tool for podcast distribution, you can still use the format to syndicate from websites through RSS apps like Feedly, NetNewsWire, Inoreader, Reeder, and others.

Current, however, proposes a different RSS experience. Instead of structuring feeds as lists to be processed, or unread counts driven to zero, the app’s main screen is a river.

“You’re not watching content drift past like a screensaver. It’s a river in the sense that matters: content arrives, lingers for a time, and then fades away,” writes Godier.

Each piece of content ages differently, with items dimming before fading out entirely and becoming invisible. Breaking news, for instance, remains bright for three hours, while daily news articles may stick around for around 18 hours. Essays sit for longer (three days) and articles like evergreen tutorials remain in the river for a week. As you scroll through the river, you keep up with what’s new and interesting without the pressure of marking things as read.

When you set up Current, you pick one of five speeds per source: Breaking, News, Article, Essay, or Tutorial. As you read, you don’t have to physically mark them as read; instead, you just push cards off the screen with a long left swipe, or tap the release button at the end of the article you’ve finished, which brings you back to the river. (There’s also an undo button.)

Current also offers a number of other clever features that will thrill RSS enthusiasts.

It can fetch the full article text from the web even if the website itself is set to truncate its feeds (as many sites do to motivate people to visit), and you can mark sources as webcomics to unlock an image-first reader experience. You can also mute sources for a week and pin those you can’t miss to the top of the river.

The app adds some intelligence to your reading experience, too: if a site is flooding your feed, the app will prompt you to quiet or rate-limit them. It also notices when you regularly skip specific content or enthusiastically read it, and will suggest you to either remove feeds you don’t read often or pin those that you do.

Notably, Current lets you follow individual writers in a space called Voices, which differentiates blogs or newsletters written by individuals from feeds belonging to larger news publications. You can tap on any Voice to filter your feed to focus on just their content.

(You can potentially follow individuals within larger publications if their writers have individual RSS feeds. Here’s mine!)

Godier is interested in identifying voices behind the news, having authored a specification called Byline that adds author context to RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds.

“Voices” is just one of three built-in categories, which Current simply calls “currents” (hence the app’s name). There’s also the main feed, or “River,” and the “Read Later” category. You can even create your own currents (like “tech” or “design,” for example), or wait for the app to suggest some based on your reading patterns.

Overall, the app uses subtle touches and design elements like font choices, gestures, and themes  to make the reading experience feel less stressful. That’s something even news junkies can appreciate.

Current is available as a one-time purchase costing $9.99 on Apple’s App Store for iOS, iPad, and Mac, and includes iCloud Sync and OPML import. There are no in-app purchases or subscriptions. A web version will be available in the future.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Sex toy maker Tenga notified customers of a data breach on Friday, according to an email obtained by TechCrunch.

In the message, the Japanese company said that “an unauthorized party gained access to the professional email account of one of our employees,” which gave the hacker access to the contents of the employee’s inbox. This access potentially allowed the hacker to see and steal customer names, email addresses, and historical email correspondence, “which may include order details or customer service inquiries.”

The hacker also sent spam emails to the hacked employee’s contacts, including customers, according to the email sent to customers.

After this story was published, a Tenga spokesperson told TechCrunch that the breach affected “approximately 600 people” in the United States, based on a forensic review. “We have already proactively contacted those who may have been impacted to ensure their safety and provide guidance,” said the spokesperson.

Tenga says on its website that it has shipped over 162 million products worldwide.

Order details and customer service inquiries are likely to include intimate information that many customers probably wouldn’t want to disclose, given the nature of the products in question.

The company recommended customers change their passwords, even though it did not say that customers’ passwords were compromised, and to be vigilant of suspicious emails, especially coming from a specific employee, who appears to be the one whose account was breached.

Tenga said it took several measures after the breach, including resetting the hacked employee’s credentials and enabling “across our systems,” a basic security feature called multi-factor authentication, which prevents access to accounts with stolen passwords.

The company spokesperson would not say if there was any multi-factor on the email account prior to the breach.

Tenga was founded in 2005 in Japan, and is headquartered in Tokyo. Tenga sells a variety of sex toys, mostly for men. It’s unclear if the breach affected customers outside of the United States, given that the email came explicitly from Tenga Store USA.

Tenga is the latest in a long list of sex toy makers, such as Lovense last year, and adult websites, such as Pornhub last year and SexPanther in 2020, that have been hacked.

            <div id="article-text">A student admissions website used by families to enroll children into schools has fixed a security lapse that was exposing their personal information.

The website, Ravenna Hub, which lets parents apply and track the status of their kids’ applications across thousands of schools, was allowing any logged-in user to access the personally identifiable data associated with any other user, including their children.

The exposed data includes children’s names, dates of birth, addresses, pictures, and details about their school. Email addresses and phone numbers of parents, as well as information about children’s siblings, were also exposed.

Florida-based VentureEd Solutions, which develops and maintains Ravenna Hub, says on its website that it serves over a million students, and processes hundreds of thousands of applications a year.

TechCrunch first learned of the vulnerability on Wednesday and soon after alerted the company. VentureEd fixed the bug the same day, but TechCrunch held this report until we could verify that the bug was fixed.

Nick Laird, the chief executive of VentureEd Solutions, told TechCrunch in an email that the company was able to replicate the issue and has addressed the vulnerability.

Laird said the company was investigating the incident, but he would not commit to notifying users about the security lapse, or say — when asked by TechCrunch — if the company has the ability to check if there was any improper access to other users’ data. We also asked if Ravenna Hub had its security checked by a third-party, and if so, by whom. Laird would not say, and declined to comment further.

It’s not clear who, if anyone, oversees cybersecurity at VentureEd and Ravenna Hub.

The vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a common security flaw that allows users to access stored information because of weak or non-existent security controls on the concerned servers.

In practice, the bug allowed any logged-in user to access another student’s data, including their personal information, by modifying the unique number associated with a student’s profile using their web browser’s address bar.

In the case of Ravenna Hub, student numbers are sequential, meaning it was possible for any user to access another student’s data by changing the profile number by one or more digits.

When TechCrunch created a new account with test data, we found that the web address contained a seven-digit number. As such, there were slightly more than 1.63 million records prior to ours that were accessible to any other user.

This is the latest security lapse involving simple security flaws affecting the personal information of children. In January, online mentoring site UStrive exposed the personal information of its users, many of whom are still in school.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/19/reload-an-ai-employee-agent-management-platform-raises-2-275m-and-launches-an-ai-employee/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There came a point when Newton Asare realized AI agents weren’t just tools anymore. “They were operating more like teammates,” he told TechCrunch.

The realization crystallized when Asare and Kiran Das, both serial founders, noticed they were using AI agents to perform tasks they usually would have done themselves. Asare said he came to believe that the future lay in people managing AI employees.

“And if that’s true, we’ll need a real system to manage them, with structure around onboarding, coordination, and oversight for digital workers,” he added.

Last year, the duo launched Reload, an AI workforce management platform. On Thursday, the company announced its first AI product, Epic, alongside a $2.275 million round led by Anthemis, with participation from Zeal Capital Partners and Plug and Play.

Reload is a platform that lets organizations manage their AI agents across teams and departments. Companies can connect agents, regardless of who built them (whether by a third party or internally), assign them roles and permissions, and track the work they perform. “Reload acts like the system of record for AI employees, providing visibility, coordination, and oversight as agents operate across functions,” said Asare, the company’s CEO.

Right now, he observed, teams are using multiple agents simultaneously for tasks such as coding, debugging, and refactoring. The problem is that these agents are often focused solely on whatever they were prompted to do and don’t necessarily retain long-term memory of what a product is or why they were told to perform a specific function. They operate, in other words, with only short-term memory.

Over time, an agent can lose context, or the system can evolve away from its original intent. That’s why Reload is launching Epic. Built on top of the Reload platform, it serves as an architect alongside other coding agents, continuously defining a product’s requirements and constraints, and reminding agents what they are building and why, to keep a system consistent as it develops.

“In software development specifically, coding agents can generate large amounts of code, but they don’t preserve shared system understanding over time,” Asare said. “Epic complements those agents by defining the system upfront and maintaining shared context as it evolves. It doesn’t replace coding agents; it makes them more effective.”

Epic is designed to live inside the coding environments where developers already work. It can be installed as an extension in AI-assisted code editors like Cursor and Windsurf, running alongside other agents inside these tools.

“When a team starts a project, Epic helps create the core system artifacts such as product requirements, data models, API specifications, tech stack decisions, diagrams, and structured task breakdowns,” Asare said, adding that these are the foundations that coding agents build against.

“As development progresses, Epic maintains a structured memory of decisions, code changes, and patterns,” he continued. “If you switch coding agents, your structure and memory follow. If multiple engineers use different agents on the same project, everyone builds against the same shared source of truth.”

Asare and Das previously had a company together that was acquired and this is their second company together.

The AI infrastructure space is crowded. Competitors include LongChain, which helps with AI agent deployment and memory management, and CrewAI, which helps enterprises manage their AI agents.

Das said Reload is different because it “defines the system upfront and maintains shared project-level context across agents and sessions,” with a focus specifically on building infrastructure to maintain AI employees. “Traditional workforce systems weren’t designed for AI agents operating as teammates,” said Das, who serves as the company’s CTO. “That’s the layer we’re focused on.”

The fresh capital will go toward hiring and product advancement, specifically expanding the infrastructure needed to support a growing number of AI agents. “We’re building for the next era of work,” Asare said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rivian has a new pitch for its outdoorsy, tech-loving customers: Ditch the phone and use your Apple Watch to access vehicle controls.

The company said on Thursday it plans to launch a companion app that pairs with the Apple Watch as part of a broader update to the Rivian mobile app next week. Rivian owners will be able to perform basic tasks such as locking and unlocking doors, venting windows, and triggering the vehicle alarm using their Apple Watch.

Rivian said it is adding more precise and customizable functions, too. For instance, users can adjust the digital crown on the watch to set a target state of charge or adjust the temperature inside the vehicle. The app also allows users to pick four quick controls, depending on which they use the most.

There are some limitations, however, for Rivian’s first-generation R1T trucks and R1S SUVs. Owners of these cars will only be able to lock or unlock their vehicle by opening the app and tapping the lock icon on the Watch. Second-generation R1 vehicles, meanwhile, will unlock automatically as the driver approaches the car, provided a digital key has been set up.

The Apple Watch integration follows a broader update to the vehicle software system that was rolled out on Thursday.

Most of the updates focus on improving performance and accessibility, including a “kneel mode” that lowers the vehicle another inch below its previous low setting. The update will also allow drivers to toggle between different drive modes without causing the advanced driver assistance system to disengage.

There’s also a new cold weather indicator that will add a blue tint to the battery graphic displayed on the vehicle’s digital screen so drivers can see how much energy the battery pack is used for warming.

Rivian makes and sells EVs, but software has become one of its central products, and a selling point, for consumers as well as companies like Volkswagen that have tapped the carmaker for its technology. In 2024, Rivian and VW set up a $5.8 billion technology joint venture under which Volkswagen will invest in Rivian, based on reaching certain milestones, through 2027. Software developed by the joint venture will be used in future VW Group vehicles.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The life of a globe-trotting environmentalist is a breeding ground for moral quandaries. My oldest friend happens to be one such climate advocate; for several years, he ran a nonprofit encouraging carbon capture in the European Union. When it comes time to attend a lecture or a summit abroad, he avoids flying if he can. If not, he flies economy—the least carbon-intensive option—and swats aside a vague feeling that he is “getting away with something.” Even though his work could help save the planet, he is forever calculating each mote of carbon that enters the atmosphere as a result of his personal choices: what to eat, where to travel, what to keep or throw away. He feels, in a word, responsible.

This is no accident. For decades, industries hoping to avoid regulation have reminded us about our personal culpability for social problems. Think of the famous 1971 “Crying Indian” ad, in which a Native American man sheds a tear over a piece of litter—a PSA that was sponsored by packaging companies. Or the concept of a personal carbon footprint, which was popularized in the early 2000s by one of the world’s largest oil companies, BP. A few years after that, behavioral economists began repurposing these tactics for benevolent purposes, using subtle psychological cues called “nudges” to encourage people to file their taxes, save for retirement, exercise, and vote. Over the next decade and a half, political leaders enthusiastically embraced the idea, adopting behavioral-science solutions to far-reaching public-policy problems.

Let’s say you’d like to encourage everyone to recycle as diligently as my friend does. Instead of instituting an onerous, possibly unpopular mandate, you could nudge. You could, as officials did in the United Kingdom, put up posters of watching eyes to promote good behavior. Or you could copy the authorities in Copenhagen and paint the sidewalk with footprints leading to trash bins. The problem that emerged with this approach, which is neatly summarized by George Loewenstein and Nick Chater in their new book, It’s on You, is that, in retrospect, a focus on personal responsibility in this situation was “misplaced.” “The prevalence of plastics, and plastic waste, has not been caused by individual careless consumers,” they write. “It has been caused by the relentless growth of the plastics industry.”

When nudges like these work, the benefits are minor. Meanwhile, and much worse, they shift focus away from truly effective changes—in this case, a limit on the production of single-use plastics—by convincing individuals that they are at fault. In the long term, this failure to address deep social problems contributes to the erosion of people’s trust in governments and institutions, breeding nihilism and an attraction to demagogues who claim to have easy answers.

Loewenstein is widely credited with co-founding the field of behavioral economics, and both he and Chater, a U.K.-based behavioral scientist and consultant, contributed to nudge-policy making and research. This book is in part their mea culpa. It’s also a convincing argument that grounding the collective good in personal choices can be corrosive, especially in a deeply individualistic culture. Like my friend the environmentalist, many of us are left to wonder: How can we function in a society that betrays our natural concern for the world around us?

Like most would-be revolutions, the nudge was launched with a manifesto. “Better governance often requires less in the way of government coercion and more in the way of freedom to choose,” the law professor Cass R. Sunstein and the economist Richard H. Thaler wrote in their 2008 best seller, Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness. The book sold more than 2 million copies and became a sensation in policy circles. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron created dedicated teams often referred to as “nudge units” within their administrations. Sunstein joined the federal government as Obama’s regulatory czar. The appeal to politicians was obvious: They could engineer a better society without having to build consensus for more taxes, regulations, bans, and mandates. Sunstein and Thaler called this approach “libertarian paternalism,” which promised to resolve a central conflict in civics by, in effect, sidestepping it.

Loewenstein and Chater met on the U.K.’s nudge unit in 2013. “It is hard now to recapture the sense of possibility that was in the air as the new behavioral approach to solving society’s, and the world’s, problems began to gain ground,” they write. In the years that followed, their enthusiasm faded to skepticism as some of the most touted nudges proved less effective, or less durable, than advertised.

One such nudge is to “default” people into responsible choices, which exploits their natural bias for the status quo. A 2024 paper co-authored by the economist David Laibson tracked several American companies that auto-enrolled employees into sensible retirement plans with a standard minimum contribution. This worked—for a time. Because sticking with the plan was optional, many workers withdrew their money early, which mostly erased any long-term gains. Laibson and his collaborators found that workers saved less than 1 percent more of their income. By contrast, Australia signs up all earners for a retirement plan at a 12 percent contribution and doesn’t let them withdraw funds before age 55. The country’s retirement savings are more than 150 percent of GDP, one of the highest rates in the world.

Examples of inadequate nudges abound. In the fight against obesity, a well-known intervention is to pay people for losing weight. This does show meaningful effects—as long as they’re being paid. When payment stops, they gain the weight back. As the authors note, a more lasting solution would be to place limits on fat and sugar in ultra-processed food, which makes up more than half of the average person’s calorie consumption.

Chater and Loewenstein refer to these competing policy approaches—the individual and the systemic—as the “i-frame” and the “s-frame.” When we focus on i-frame nudges, they argue, we drain momentum from more effective s-frame solutions. Take paying taxes, a monumentally complex and frustrating endeavor for the average person: The IRS could just calculate your return and send you a check or a bill, as other countries’ tax authorities do. But the tax lobby has consistently blocked this, promoting individual choice to protect the billions of dollars that it earns each year in tax-preparation fees. This kind of misdirection creates a “crowding out” effect: Experiments by Loewenstein and his colleagues have shown that, after people are nudged to conserve energy, they become less likely to support a more systemic solution such as a carbon tax.

Using human flaws to manipulate people into doing the wrong thing seems much easier than getting them to do the right one, especially when the negative forces are global corporations funding multibillion-dollar marketing campaigns, and the positive forces are enlightened bureaucrats sending small experimental signals. Chater and Loewenstein believe that the government nudgers are not malevolent, but misguided. But by participating in the past half century’s slide into hyper-individualism, libertarian paternalists are contributing to a collective ungluing. To understand the consequences of this “one weird trick” model of ordering a society, just look at the current state of America’s institutions, which are being torn down by a public convinced that nothing works.

The authors of It’s on You mention the present-day social and political consequences of nudge policies, including the hunger for reform that populists such as Donald Trump have seized on and sometimes betrayed—but they don’t really spell them out. The book ends with a series of prescriptions for “unrigging” the rules of democracy and the economy, many of which sound familiar: take money out of politics, close the revolving door between government and industry, hold Big Tech accountable for online abuses. Thaler, the Nudge co-author, objected in a 2023 paper that such “nanny state” initiatives are unrealistic. But if the spotty record of nudges has proved anything, it’s that half measures won’t solve our deepest problems. “The history of democratic politics across the world is, after all, one of continual and often convulsive struggle to wrest control of the political and legal processes from the few to the many,” Chater and Loewenstein write.

But what if the problem is not only structural but also cultural? I suspect that the authors would largely agree that nudges didn’t make American society pathologically individualistic and atomized; instead, nudging was a well-meaning but inadequate attempt to circumvent a mindset that is already baked in. The depth of this predicament was apparent during the coronavirus pandemic, when social media abounded with declarations of resistance such as that of the retired baseball player Aubrey Huff, who stated that he “would rather die” than wear a mask. You might say that the United States has—as the behavioral economists might put it—its own cognitive bias. You could call it the cowboy effect.

At times, that bias has dragged us down; in other moments, it has helped us achieve a collective good. Large social changes built around appeals to personal freedom, such as the legalization of gay marriage, seemed impossible until a substantial proportion of the public showed visible support for them, and then they started happening all at once. Today’s progressive populists, including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have gained some limited traction in portraying the government as a protector of individual freedom against corporate power, much as President Franklin D. Roosevelt sold his New Deal policies as a shield against the “economic tyranny” of that era’s oligarchs.

Which brings me back to my friend the environmentalist. He knows all about the manipulative history of the nudge, including the packaging-company PSA and the carbon footprint, yet he still feels a personal obligation that goes beyond his work in the s-frame. With a lot of thought, he has learned to recontextualize the sense of responsibility. Now when he carefully chooses to stay home rather than fly, or when he eats veggies instead of pork, he imagines not a one-man fix to the climate crisis but a quiet demonstration of a new social norm, which one day might force politicians to act—if not through the recycling bin, then through the ballot box. After all, there is a way to harness the collective effort of individuals to bring about desperately needed change. It’s called a government.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">America loves its heroes. The nation has made lions of the men who signed a document 250 years ago to declare independence from the English crown; it’s made saints of the 55 men who gathered in a sweaty room in Philadelphia to draft its Constitution. Time elevates those people and their deeds to the heights of deities, and American gods must be faultless. But those heroes are not gods; they were, indeed, men—fallible as all others.

In the same city where the Founders wrote the words that have guided the nation for more than two centuries, George Washington—the most esteemed of them—made a home as America’s first president. He brought men and women he had enslaved with him, and rotated them between Philadelphia and Mount Vernon, in Virginia, so that they would not earn their liberty under Pennsylvania law. He shuffled them back and forth so that they would remain his property. These facts cannot be changed; only how they are remembered can.

For 16 years, an exhibit at Washington’s Philadelphia home, “The President’s House: Freedom and Slavery in the Making of a New Nation”—situated in the shadow of the Liberty Bell’s unambiguous nod to freedom’s ring—highlighted that difficult history. But in late January, a cadre of federal workers yanked placards from the site’s brick walls in response to a March 2025 executive order from the White House that shunned complication. In the order, President Trump had charged the secretary of the interior with ensuring that public monuments “focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people.”

Clint Smith: What it means to tell the truth about America

Black History Month is sometimes treated as little more than an opportunity for corporate branding and, maybe, school assemblies; but in the face of such erasure, observing it this February feels radical. Black history in America is, of course, more than the story of enslavement and what was done to Black people on this continent across hundreds of years. It is a story of family, love, resilience, determination, achievement, and, yes, despair, wrapped into one package—what Black Americans achieved in spite of the fact that, for many years, they were not seen as fully Americans. It is not a simple history and it is not a story of unrelenting progress, because America’s history is neither of those things. To acknowledge the troubling, shameful aspects of American history is not to denigrate the Founders but to see them, and the others who made their livelihoods possible, as people. Black History Month calls on us to remember their humanity, and to remember the heroic and human deeds of those who have always been unsung.

This is a milestone year for America. It marks both the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the 100th anniversary of an effort to recover and recount the contributions of Black Americans left out of the national narrative—what was launched in 1926 as Negro History Week and then became Black History Month in 1976. One anniversary honors the nation’s founding ideals; the other reckons with its failures to live up to them. Both offer an essential—and timely—opportunity to acknowledge the ambitions and shortcomings of America’s grand and unfinished experiment.

The majority of Americans experience Black History Month as a formula. Students prepare PowerPoint or posterboard projects about people such as Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, or Jackie Robinson—or, for those who would venture further in our history, Phillis Wheatley, the nation’s first published Black poet. Businesses invite speakers and hold events for staff. Civic associations host dinners.

That is not how Black History Month began, though. Its precursor was established by Carter G. Woodson, the historian and founder of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, at a time when eugenics—race science and the idea that white people were genetically superior to Black people—was finally being challenged as the pseudoscience it is. “The greatest scholars of today are saying that there is no such thing as race in science, and that there is nothing in anthropology or psychology to support such myths as the inferiority and superiority of races,” the 1927 announcement for Negro History Week reads. “These truths, however, will have little bearing on the uplift of the negro if they are left in the state of academic discussion.” From its inception, the event was designed to be a chance to tell the truth about the past in public—the whole truth.

In 1976, Negro History Week became Black History Month, and was officially acknowledged by President Gerald Ford. The nation, founded on “individual rights,” was turning 200—but Black Americans had only just had their right to vote reinforced by law. Every president since then has issued a proclamation to celebrate Black History Month. Freedom is a struggle, Ronald Reagan’s proclamation said in 1986, echoing Frederick Douglass’s exhortation that if there is no struggle, there is no progress. “The American experience and character can never be fully grasped until the knowledge of black history assumes its rightful place in our schools and our scholarship,” Reagan wrote.

Vann R. Newkirk II: American democracy is only 55 years old–and hanging by a thread

On February 3, President Trump continued that tradition, and signed a proclamation of his own for Black History Month. “From the very beginning, our country has been blessed with countless black American heroes,” he stated, before lambasting people who have “needlessly divided” the public over race. “As President, I proclaim that ‘black history’ is not distinct from American history—rather, the history of Black Americans is an indispensable chapter in our grand American story.”

But what his administration is doing belies whatever nice words Trump had to say about Black heroes. Its actions to limit what aspects of Black history can be included in the American story betray Trump’s real meaning. His administration has renamed monuments for Confederate traitors, scrubbed memorials to the contributions of Black military service members, and purged writings by authors such as Maya Angelou from the U.S. Naval Academy library; this is an ongoing project.

Other politicians have made a concerted effort to curtail examinations of American history over the past several years. State lawmakers have limited what can be taught in public schools. Florida passed a law that warns teachers not to “persuade students to a particular point of view,” and blocked an Advanced Placement curriculum for African American studies. Oklahoma barred “discriminatory principles,” such as the idea that people bear responsibility for what someone of their race did in the past; teachers at one school said they were told to stop saying “Black excellence” to motivate their students. The Trump administration’s executive orders targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives have created confusion and a climate of fear—not least because administration officials have been vague about what punishments districts, universities, and nonprofits might face for running afoul of their ideological standards and about what would even constitute a violation.

That haze has led to a drawback of even the most anodyne of celebrations honoring Black achievement. Last month, Indiana University at Indianapolis canceled its annual Martin Luther King Jr. Dinner—held, without fail, every year since 1969—citing budget cuts. As a joint production of the university and its Black Student Union, the dinner was a marquee event in town. But halfway through 2025, IU closed its DEI office. State law had mandated that it shut down all DEI-adjacent programs, which meant the Black Student Union would lose a portion of its funding—funding that would have helped support the dinner.

On January 13, in response to a community outcry, the chancellor, Latha Ramchand, said the university was trying to “reimagine” its “affinity dinners” and other such events. “In short, the MLK Dinner is not going away—rather we are in a moment of transition and the work of this task force will help us create its next iteration.” But traditions gain salience through time and repetition. When they are interrupted, when we stop choosing them consistently, they lose their heft.

Clint Smith: Those who try to erase history will fail

At its most elemental, Black History Month is about seeing the nation in full. It invites complexity. Booker T. Washington, who created the Tuskegee Institute and built it into an academic juggernaut for Black students, was the most powerful Black man of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Even his critics were forced to confess as much and admire his brilliance. Acknowledging his greatness does not mean forgetting that his philosophy would have allowed—at least in the short term—the continuation of Black Americans’ second-class citizenship. “In all things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers,” he told a predominantly white audience at the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta in 1895, “yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress.”

Trump is correct that the United States is one nation with a shared history—people, places, dates, and events. But that history has been experienced differently by different people. It is a nation of the enslaved and the enslaver. It is also a nation built on principles. And one feels bad about telling the true legacy of the slaveholder only if one identifies, in some way, with his actions rather than his nobler ideals. To recognize the divide between someone’s stated values and their actions is to recognize where they should have done better and where we can still do better.

On Monday, citing George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984, a federal judge ordered the administration to restore the placards at Washington’s old home in Philadelphia. History could not be erased. “The government here likewise asserts truth is no longer self-evident, but rather the property of the elected chief magistrate and his appointees and delegees,” Judge Cynthia Rufe, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote. “An agency, whether the Department of the Interior, NPS, or any other agency, cannot arbitrarily decide what is true, based on its own whims or the whims of the new leadership, regardless of the evidence before it.”

A day later, Jesse Jackson died at the age of 84. The civil-rights leader’s two upstart presidential campaigns revealed how limited America’s political imagination was at the time; his platform would become the foundation of the progressive movement for the next three decades. Sometimes I look at black-and-white photos of Jackson—playing basketball with Marvin Gaye, standing next to King on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis before he was murdered, or preparing to deliver the first joint address by a Black man to the Alabama legislature since Reconstruction. It’s easy to think of Jackson in the past. But he was also human, and lived until it was no longer this world but his friend John Lewis that he would see in the morning.

In 2019, members of Congress were preparing to discuss H.R. 40, a bill that would study reparations for slavery—a bill to atone for history. I spoke with Jackson ahead of the hearing. We talked about racism, reparations, and ultimately about hope. It felt natural to wonder where someone who had seen so much bad in U.S. history continued to draw his resolve from. Jackson told me that his own hope stemmed from the fact that the truth cannot be erased. “The truth of slavery—that Africans subsidized America’s wealth—that truth will not go away,” he said. History must be remembered. His death is a reminder that the duty to contend with that history falls to those who are still on this Earth.</div>

            <h2>Hitler’s Greenland Obsession</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/hitler-greenland/685984/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Greenland appears to have been a lifelong preoccupation of Adolf Hitler’s. According to stenographic notes from a lunchtime conversation dated May 21, 1942, Hitler recalled that hardly anyone “interested him more in his youth” than Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian explorer who in 1888 led the first team to cross Greenland’s interior. A surviving volume from Hitler’s private book collection contains firsthand accounts of the geologic and Arctic explorer Alfred Wegener’s Grönland Expedition, which left Wegener dead in 1930 and inspired the 1933 adventure film S.O.S. Eisberg, starring the actor and eventual filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl.

Hitler’s personal copy of History of the Expedition, the narrative of the tragic Wegener venture, can be perused in the rare-book collection at the Library of Congress among the 1,200 or so remnant volumes from Hitler’s private library. The 198-page monograph bears his personal bookplate—ex libris, eagle, swastika—like many of the others, but is notable because unlike most, it does not include a handwritten inscription by an author, a close associate, or a distant admirer. This suggests that the volume was a personal acquisition rather than a gift, a fact made all the more interesting by the 1933 publication date, the first year of the Hitler chancellorship, when the Nazi leader’s interest in Greenland transitioned from personal to strategic.

From the May 2003 issue: Hitler’s forgotten library

By April 1934, Hitler’s government had inventoried Greenland: 13,500 Eskimo, 3,500 Danes, and 8,000 sheep, as well as the world’s largest deposit of a strategic natural resource—cryolite, a mineral essential to American aluminum production. In 1938, Hermann Göring dispatched an expedition to Greenland, ostensibly to explore the island’s flora and fauna. However, Hitler’s true intent may have been not scientific, but economic—the expedition was headed by a mining engineer, Kurt Herdemerten, who had been a member of the ill-fated Wegener expedition. Hitler had inflicted countless economic wounds on his country over his five years as chancellor, and this foray into the Arctic was part of a broader effort to remedy one of them.

﻿In a drive to move Germany toward economic self-sufficiency, Hitler had imposed draconian tariffs, refused to honor foreign-debt obligations, and sought to wean the nation off Norwegian whale-oil consumption. The problem was that Germany used whale oil not only for margarine, a staple of the German diet, but also in the production of nitroglycerin, a key component for the munitions industry. Whale-oil imports ranged from 165,000 to 220,000 tons annually, representing the country’s single largest foreign-currency expenditure. To replace Norwegian whale oil, it was proposed that “German ships with German fishermen using German equipment” could harvest “the riches of the sea”—or Fischreichtum—“without giving a single penny to foreign countries.” So Hitler mobilized a German whaling fleet that gradually depleted whale populations in the North. By 1938, the Germans also had 31 whale-oil-processing ships in the frozen South, off the coast of Antarctica, along with two processing stations on land supplied by 257 “catcher boats.” Plans were made to declare the “whaling enterprises” German colonial possessions.

In mid-January 1939, two twin-engine Dornier “flying boats”—model Do 18-D—coursed along the coast of Antarctica, dropping weighted steel rods stamped with swastikas and bearing Nazi flags every 15 miles or so. The secret expedition, overseen by Göring and led by Alfred Ritscher, one of Germany’s top Arctic explorers, was intended to stake a territorial claim “corresponding to the expansion of the economic interests of greater Germany,” as Ritscher later put it.

The Antarctic demarcation project undertaken by Ritscher in January 1939 was part of Hitler’s aggressive peacetime land grab in the name of ethnic unification and national security, beginning with the annexation of Austria in March 1938 and continuing with the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in September of that year.

Hitler dismissed those who opposed the acquisition of land on the grounds of human rights as “scribblers.” No divine authority dictated how much land a people possessed or occupied, Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf: “National borders are made by men, and they are changed by men.” A country’s claim to territory was based on its ability to impose brute force over another, a principle that dated back, Hitler continued, to days of the “might of a victorious sword,” when Germanic tribes asserted themselves with blood and iron. “Und nur in dieser Kraft allein liegt dann das Recht,” Hitler wrote, a maxim that, distilled into English, translates as “Might makes right.”

Following the invasion of Poland, in 1939, Hitler’s interests in the Far North expanded from economic to military. On April 8, 1940, Hitler briefed his propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, on an imminent military operation in Denmark and Norway. The preemptive strike, Hitler explained, was a defensive measure against an anticipated attack by Britain and France that he believed might come via Scandinavia. (Sweden had already declared its neutrality.) “Approximately 250,000 men will carry out the operation,” Goebbels wrote in his diary. “Most of the artillery and ammunition have already been transported across, hidden in coal steamers.” The next morning, six infantry divisions, two motorized brigades, a paratrooper unit, and hundreds of aircraft, including 186 Heinkel bombers, launched Operation Weser Maneuver. Denmark capitulated. Norway resisted and was crushed. “Once we have the two countries,” Goebbels recorded, “England will be flattened” because Germany could use Scandinavia as “a base of attack.” As for the United States? That country “is of no interest to us,” Goebbels wrote, because by the time the Americans could deliver any material assistance (eight months, in Goebbels’s reckoning) or put boots on the ground in Europe (18 months), the war would be over.

But unbeknownst to Goebbels, U.S. Coast Guard cruisers were already on their way to Greenland. A strategic analysis had determined that a well-directed shot from a German U-boat or an act of sabotage could cripple the cryolite-mining operations at Ivittuut, in the Arsuk Fjord in South Greenland, which America was determined to safeguard to protect its aluminum production.

Henrik Kauffmann, the Danish ambassador in Washington, D.C., distanced himself from the government in German-occupied Copenhagen and declared himself the representative of “the interests of the free Denmark,” a status the United States readily recognized. The American Greenland Commission was formed, and an American consulate was opened in Godthaab, the island’s capital city (today known as Nuuk), with the consent of Eske Brun, Greenland’s colonial administrator, who was an ally of Kauffmann’s. “Adaptability of areas for installation of airfields was the first consideration governing location of forces,” Kaufmann later recalled. “Since these areas were of the same value to Germany as to the United States, these, in addition to the cryolite mine, were the localities actively defended.”

“The Eskimos in Greenland will be astonished to see how the Americans are staffing their newly established consulate,” the German newspaper Schwäbischer Merkur reported on June 9, 1940, questioning the purpose of the “ten officers and 167 men” that the Americans had dispatched to “peaceful” Greenland. “Under international law,” the newspaper observed, “Greenland belongs to Denmark.”

Another Nazi-aligned newspaper, Stuttgarter NS-Kurier, reminded its readers of Greenland’s status under international law, noting that the American presence was causing “serious disquiet” in Denmark: “It goes without saying that there cannot be any talk of a change in the Danish position toward an apparent American interference in the administration of Greenland, Denmark’s last colonial holding.”

Read: The intellectual rationalization for annexing Greenland

On April 9, 1941, exactly one year after the German occupation of Denmark, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Kauffmann, with the assent of the Greenland colonial administrator, signed the Agreement Between the United States of America and Denmark Respecting the Defense of Greenland. The preamble of the agreement highlighted the imminent danger that Greenland “may be converted into a point of aggression against nations of the American continent.” The subsequent articles allowed the United States to “improve and deepen” harbors and to “construct, maintain and operate such landing fields, seaplane facilities and radio and meteorological installations as necessary” for the protection of the North American continent against foreign aggression.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt publicly hailed the agreement the next day. In America, Ambassador Kauffmann, as the defender of “free Denmark,” was proclaimed “king of Greenland”; in Nazi-occupied Copenhagen, he was charged with treason.

On April 27, Danish Foreign Minister Erik Scavenius, claiming to act on instructions from the Danish king, issued a formal note to Hull protesting Kauffmann’s actions. By signing the bilateral agreement, Scavenius wrote, Kauffmann had acted “against the will and knowledge of His Majesty,” as well as against the “Cabinet and the Danish Rigsdag,” the equivalent of the U.S. Congress. “From real as well as from formal points of view,” Scavenius wrote, “the Danish Government has therefore been obliged to consider the agreement as invalid in point of Danish constitutional as well as international law.” For the United States to have entered into an agreement with “a person who has no country and no head of state behind him” was, Scavenius wrote, “a fiction.”

If so, this fiction was similar to the one the British government had endorsed a year earlier, after Germany had invaded France and installed the collaborationist Vichy regime. In June 1940, a 49-year-old colonel who had led the French army’s 4th Armored Division in counterattacks against the Germans at Abbeville retreated to London after France surrendered. The British recognized the colonel, Charles de Gaulle, as the self-declared representative of the “free French”; the Vichy government denounced de Gaulle as a traitor and deserter, stripping him of his military rank, convicting him of treason, and sentencing him to death in absentia.

The Americans, like the British, recognized the distinction between a fascist takeover by force and the prerogatives of a democratically elected government. So just as de Gaulle was recognized as the legitimate representative of France, Kauffman was recognized as the legitimate representative of Denmark and Greenland. Over the next four years, Greenland became a vital transit point for the Allies—it had as many as 17 military facilities, including airfields and naval installations that protected the cryolite-mining operation at Ivittuut—and assisted in the liberation of hundreds of millions of Europeans across the continent. When the war was over and the democratically elected government in Denmark was restored, it willingly reaffirmed this American protection in the 1951 Defense of Greenland agreement, which remains in effect today.</div>

            <h2>The West’s Winter Has Been a Slow-Moving Catastrophe</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-18</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you are reading this on the East Coast, congratulations on the warmer weather you’re finally getting this week. It was cold and snowy for a while there. Here in the West, we wish we’d been in your shoes. Spare a thought for the tens of millions of us who live on the other side of the continent, where a catastrophe is unfolding.

In Colorado, where I live and grew up, this winter has been especially warm and dry. Last year closed with the warmest December in the history of recordkeeping. It was 8.9 degrees warmer than the average from 1991 to 2020, and the warmest of all in a record that goes back to the late 19th century. Over this past weekend, my neighbors and my family walked with our dogs and our kids in T-shirts and shorts, because it was in the mid-60s in Colorado Springs. About 60 miles north, my family in Denver saw a new record high of 68 degrees—on February 15.

But temperatures are not the only reason this winter is a catastrophe. This year, our snowpack is among the lowest ever measured, which means it won’t be enough to fill the rivers that are born in our mountains, which feed  reservoirs and water farms from here to Los Angeles. Snow is finally coming to the mountains this week, but we still cannot avoid one of the worst water years in modern history. The West is already experiencing the worst drought we have seen in 1,200 years, as our junior senator, John Hickenlooper, reminded me in an email over the weekend. Colorado politicians have to be attuned to these dynamics: “The snowpack is pretty much as large as all of our reservoirs combined. That’s why winters like this one are so terrifying,” he wrote. Drought can mean economic disaster.

Hickenlooper, who was also the state’s governor and the mayor of Denver, is not a man given to hyperbole. It really is that dire. Unless a lot of snow falls soon, Colorado’s environment and economy will take a huge hit. Ski resorts are losing money now. In the spring, rivers that usually offer waist-high whitewater rapids and fishing pools will instead be a trickle; in the summer, farmers will lose peach crops. Hydrologists, fire scientists, and climate researchers are bracing for summer too; their spectrum of worry ranges from concern to actual panic.

“It’s as bad as you think it is,” Russ Schumacher, the Colorado state climatologist, told me. On top of the ongoing, decades-long drought in the region, all of Colorado is in a snow drought too. The amount of water stored in the snowpack is the lowest it’s been at this point in winter since at least 1987, when comprehensive measurements began, he said. Going back to older records, some of which date from the Dust Bowl, the 2025–26 water year is the third-worst ever measured. In the two worse years, snowpack measured about 40 to 42 percent of average at this point in winter; this year, Colorado is sitting around 58 percent of median overall, and lower in some areas.

Climatologists say that a weak La Niña pattern in the Pacific is partly to blame, parking a high-pressure “heartbreak ridge” farther east than usual, which continually pushes moisture away from the mountains. But the abysmal snowpack is also causing a bad feedback loop, allowing the mountains to warm more than usual. The pattern could finally break this week, and “we definitely have time to make up ground,” Allie Mazurek, a climatologist at the Colorado Climate Center, told me. But she also cautioned that “at this stage, it is looking almost impossible for us to get back to an average snowpack.”

Schumacher’s predecessor, the longtime state climatologist Nolan Doesken, used to say that Colorado’s snowmelt is well behaved. Rain comes in a flash and is gone just as quickly, but we know where snow falls, where it will lie in wait, and which rivers it will feed months later. Flakes accumulate on cold ground, and when the Rockies stay cold the way they should, the snow remains for many months. And the surrounding air stays colder with snowpack than without it. This winter, temperatures are soaring 10 to 12 degrees above normal in northwestern Colorado—temperatures that region would not be seeing if the ground were covered in snow, Mazurek said.

Western water monitors use a metric called snow water equivalent, which is just what it sounds like, to estimate how much water will flow into rivers when the snow melts. Since 1987, the Snowpack Telemetry Network, SNOTEL, has measured snowpack by weighing the snow that falls at hundreds of stations across the West, including more than 100 currently active ones in Colorado. Other measurements are taken by hikers who snowshoe up to designated spots and measure the snowpack by hand. Climate scientists have been doing this for decades. Last week, the snow water equivalent in the Colorado River basin was tied for the lowest ever recorded, according to Brad Udall, a senior water scientist at Colorado State University and an expert on the Colorado River.

That snowpack forms the headwaters of rivers including the Colorado, the Rio Grande, and the Arkansas. And the Colorado River feeds the two largest reservoirs in the United States: Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Both reservoirs are critically low and have been for years: Powell is about 25 percent full, and Mead is at about 34 percent. If Powell’s water level drops another 40 or so feet, which it could this year, there won’t be enough water to generate hydroelectric power at Glen Canyon Dam. Water managers are starting to worry about “dead pool” too, in which the lake will get too low to let water flow through Glen Canyon toward Lake Mead; they are likely to reduce water flow out of Powell this year to avoid it.

In most of the Colorado River’s upper basin—in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Wyoming—water is not collected in many reservoirs; instead, it is diverted out to thousands of small locations, from streams to irrigation ditches. And “this year, there just isn’t going to be any water in these rivers. Or there will be water, but instead of 12 weeks or 16 weeks of water, it will be four weeks of water,” Udall told me. “Under western water law, people can basically completely dry these rivers up.”

This is bad timing, because Colorado and the other basin states are currently failing to renegotiate key parts of the more-than-century-old Colorado River Compact, which expire later this year. Along with seven states, the river-management agreement includes the federal Bureau of Reclamation, 30 tribal nations, and Mexico, and controls how the river flows into and out of Lakes Powell and Mead. The states missed a major deadline on February 14, which means that the Bureau of Reclamation will instead impose its own plan—one that none of the states are likely to be happy with. In Colorado, at least, some residents are concerned that the Trump administration will punish the solidly blue state by simply giving more water to, say, Arizona, which Donald Trump won in 2024. This is far from an irrational worry. In late December, Trump vetoed funding for a pipeline, already under construction with bipartisan support, that would bring water from a reservoir to rural communities in southeastern Colorado. The fight over the Colorado River could shape up in similar fashion, pitting state against state. (In response to a request for comment, a Department of the Interior spokesperson pointed me to a press release in which Secretary Doug Burgum said that the department had “listened to every state’s perspective” and that a “fair compromise with shared responsibility remains within reach.”)

Further in the future, the effects of water reductions will spill through the western economy. Agriculture, water recreation such as fishing and river rafting, and entire mountain ecosystems—both environmental and economic—will falter. For now, though, we are worrying about our trees budding six weeks too early, and pouring buckets of water around their trunks to keep them hydrated in the warmth. We are updating our fire checklists and go bags during red-flag warnings: One went up yesterday as I was working on this story. Winter fire watches are abnormal, but we are growing all too accustomed to them. And we are checking the snow forecast every day.</div>

            <div id="article-text">If you put any stock in the ability of IQ tests to assess intelligence, we humans have spent the past century steadily getting smarter. (And if you don’t put any stock in them, well, we humans have steadily gotten better at IQ tests.)

Because IQ is a standardized measure, humankind’s average score still sits at 100—but this isn’t your granddaddy’s 100. IQ tests are regularly recalibrated, and over the past many decades, when new subjects have taken an old test, they have almost always outscored their predecessors’ average; Grandpa’s generation might have hovered around 100, but the kids are scoring 115 … which then becomes the new 100.

This phenomenon is called the Flynn effect, and researchers still aren’t sure what causes it. Perhaps it’s due to more efficient education or better nutrition. The reason could be that modern environments contain more interesting stimuli or that modern gasoline no longer contains lead.

I haven’t seen anyone propose that trivia is to thank, but the growing popularity of quizzing tracks with the IQ trend line pretty well too. I think I speak for all of science when I say we shouldn’t rule it out quite yet.

And by the way, did you know that the University of Bologna is nearly a millennium old? It’s the world’s oldest university that was founded as such (at least one older university started as a madrasa), and its alumni include Copernicus, Dante, and more than one pope.

Imagine trying to write a halfway-decent poem for an assignment, and your classmate turns in the Divine Comedy. Then again, at least you’d have had a leg up on Copernicus, who probably got marked off plenty for insisting that the Earth actually orbits the sun.

Any legislation titled with a backronym is automatically suspect, and the SAVE America Act—that’s Safeguard American Voter Eligibility—is no exception. A version of the bill languished last year, but President Trump is now pressuring Senate Republicans to pass it, among his other attempts to subvert the midterm elections. Although the bill seems unlikely to become a law, it could still create chaos and confusion about the race.

The SAVE Act is relatively simple to understand: It requires that anyone wishing to vote provide documentation to prove they are a U.S. citizen. On an intuitive level, this might make sense, because noncitizens aren’t permitted to vote. But the bill is a solution in search of a problem. States already have methods of verifying citizenship, and illegal voting by noncitizens is very rare. The bill also threatens to disenfranchise eligible voters. Although some of the bill’s supporters may be sincere, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem committed a classic Kinsley gaffe on Friday, inadvertently revealing the truth of the administration’s push: It’s a ploy to help Republicans win elections.

“When it gets to Election Day,” she said at an event boosting the bill in Arizona, “we’ve been proactive to make sure that we have the right people voting, electing the right leaders to lead this country.”

Many states have enacted laws that require photo identification for voting. (Most election laws are made at the state level, though Congress has occasionally passed nationwide laws, such as the 2002 Help America Vote Act.) Studies have found that voter-ID laws have a relatively minor effect on turnout; they are generally popular with voters, but they also disproportionately affect older voters, poorer voters, and minority voters. Politicians who support them like to point out that people need ID to board a plane or buy alcohol—but neither of those is a constitutional right, and violations of alcohol laws are very common. The SAVE Act would go a step further, not only by mandating ID at the federal level but by requiring voters to present proof of citizenship, most likely a passport or a birth certificate. Noncitizen voting simply isn’t a major threat to election integrity, and it’s already punishable under existing laws. The Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank that supports the law, maintains a very helpful database of election fraud. The database contains 99 instances of ineligible voting by noncitizens since 1982. For comparison, more than 150 million votes were cast for president in 2024 alone.

Experts warn that requiring proof of citizenship would shut many Americans out of the polls. Only about half of the population holds a passport. Not all Americans have access to their birth certificate, and even that would not be sufficient for, say, a woman who changed her name at marriage, who would also have to produce proof of marriage. The congressional scholar Norm Ornstein argues that given the cost of establishing proof, the SAVE Act is in effect “a poll tax, a parallel to what Jim Crow laws used to suppress black votes, which the Supreme Court ultimately outlawed.”

If the law passes, Votebeat’s Nathaniel Rakich reports, “there are serious questions about whether it’s even practically possible to implement” by the midterms. Among other problems, the law would require cross-checking state voter rolls against a federal database, also called SAVE (though in this case it stands for Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements). But ProPublica reports that the tool is a mess, often turning up inaccurate results.

All that said, the bill seems unlikely to pass. Republican Susan Collins of Maine last week became the 50th senator to back the bill, but because Democrats will filibuster, passing the bill requires 60 votes, which it doesn’t have. Some senators are demanding the end of the filibuster (or the introduction of a “talking filibuster”), but there doesn’t appear to be enough GOP support to make that happen.

Yet Trump doesn’t seem ready to accept defeat. “There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!” Trump posted on Truth Social on Friday. The president promised to issue an executive order, but he has no power to mandate voter-ID requirements—indeed, he has no control over elections, and a previous order requiring proof of citizenship to register has been partially blocked by federal courts. Trump insisted, however, that he has “searched the depths of Legal Arguments not yet articulated or vetted on this subject, and will be presenting an irrefutable one in the very near future.” (No one seems to know what he’s talking about, and keeping expectations low is probably wise. The legal proof will surely be coming right after his health-care plan and Infrastructure Week.)

The president may just be posturing, trying to get Republicans in the Senate to act. But he has shown little interest in stopping where his legal limitations end. And he’s testing other methods of subversion: He has tried to tell states when they can accept ballots and dictate what machines they use, and he recently called for Republicans to “nationalize” elections. Many of his actions seem motivated by a cynical calculus: Even if he loses the battle to enact the SAVE Act or put it into effect via executive order, he may be able to sow doubt about the results of the elections, which he can use if his party fares poorly in November. For his purposes of subverting elections, creating uncertainty may be nearly as effective as a real policy change.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, is the sort of highly selective institution that jockeys for the unofficial title of Harvard of the South. Recently, the university’s chancellor had a new idea: What if Vanderbilt was also in San Francisco? Maybe it could become the Harvard of the West too.

Last month, Vanderbilt announced that it was acquiring the facilities of the financially insolvent California College of the Arts and would be converting the space into a new campus. Private universities have been experimenting with satellite campuses for decades. Typically, these outposts are either overseas or limited to a graduate program or two. The Vanderbilt expansion, set to open in 2027, will be different: It will include a full-blown, four-year undergraduate college, not in Abu Dhabi but in the San Francisco Design District. This new tactic, pioneered by Northeastern University a few years ago, is taking the satellite-campus concept to its logical extreme: the national-chain model of undergraduate education. If it works for Vanderbilt, other selective institutions are likely to follow—because no one really wants to be the Harvard of the South. Everyone wants to be Harvard. Perhaps the way for excellent regional schools to develop a national reputation is to set up shop around the nation.

            <div id="article-text">Wal-Mart is not the first retail giant dethroned by Amazon despite having a web presence, that was Sears. Ironically, they had just defeated Montgomery Ward in the catalog sales business, just in time for that to become irrelevant.

Sears&#39; website was garbage, but their prices were also garbage. The former thing was not entirely unexpected, but the latter was weird. I tend to suppose that actually points to deliberate failure to execute in order to further the goal of liquidating the company.

Wal-Mart is more puzzling to me. They have natural advantages over Amazon that they don&#39;t seem to be able to actually benefit from, like their existing retail locations. And they also already had their own trucking fleet before Amazon even came into existence at all. I would have thought they could have parlayed this into superior performance to Amazon, but their delivery periods are tragic.

What prevents Wal-Mart from dominating here? They were basically Amazon before Amazon. Now they&#39;re Temu Amazon.

i thought it happened several years ago at the peak of COVID. prior to pandemic I&#39;d made less than $500 of purchases from Amazon.since early 2021, it&#39;s close to $10k

That&#39;s probably the reason it&#39;s a speaker and not a screen, correct? But then again, booking payments is only numbers, which shouldn&#39;t be that difficult. Any Indians here who can shed some light on this?

There is corruption in a lot of places in India.  This is one of the few success stories of India, where people can make instant payments w/o carrying loads of cash or a check book.  In the US, if one uses Apple or Android Pay, then it takes as much time as a debit/credit card transaction for the transaction to be completed - a day or so.  Not sure what it is in Europe.  But here, the transactions are pretty instant

The real issue Indians face are KYC (Know Your Customer) demands from various entities, suc

Really?  I have used UPI to pay for things in India (cash is no longer accepted in a lot of places, mainly b&#39;cos they have no loose change), and there have been a lot of places w/o those speakers.  Usually, after one scans the QR code, the phone beeps and shows a message that the transaction has been paid.  I&#39;d show that acknowledgement to the cashier, and they&#39;d be satisfied

They cannot waste time on every payment to go and check the status
Except that they have to, since every payment happens serially.  People don&#39;t scan the same QR code from their respective phones in

It&#39;s an efficiency and convenience thing.

When this UPI system was launched, vendors had to continuously check their mobile to see if the payment had actually been received.

Now they just listen for the acknowledgement while multitasking.

Here when you buy something you typically pay by putting your bank card into a card reader, or nowadays by tapping the card or your phone for a contactless payment. The card reading terminal of the shopkeeper has has an lcd screen that will show if the payment has been accepted or declined. Does it work differently in India? Do the shoppers have to enter the store&#39;s bank account into their phone to pay? In that case the shopkeeper would need some confirmation that the payment has been received.

You scan the vendor&#39;s QR code on your phone, and then confirm the purchase in the app.  This will send a notification that the vendor can view on their phone.  The speaker just uses text-to-speech to give an immediate audible notification so the vendor doesn&#39;t have to look at their phone.

no, even the illiterate need to have basic money skills since they need to be functional, illiteracy is not binary, it is a matter of degree

i suspect this is just the least expensive effective solution to the problem which is why it won out over alternatives

Pricing is not always dependent on cost to provide. As often, it is based on value received.

This seems like a high value item, to the merchant. Worth the &#39;cost to provide&#39;. And solving an existing problem. Passes the test of value. Not simple rent-seeking, and I submit not at all...

Boom simply means that a product/category is seeing more popularity, no matter the reason.

The number of EVs went up by over five-fold, that is a boom. You may not *like* why it happened, but it happened.

Further given the context, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s like the people are going to call &#39;bullshit&#39; or anything, the entire nation has fewer cars than you&#39;ll find in medium sized US cities.  Looks like you might be over a hundred miles from the nearest gas station for most of the country.  Looks like there&#39;s no such thing as convenient long-haul refueling for gas either.

Boom simply means that a product/category is seeing more popularity, no matter the reason.I see. So you think it would be accurate to say Forced Labor Camps Boom in North Korea?

People embraced EVs. Just as long as by people, you mean not your average Ethiopian, but the ones making decisions in Ethiopia.

And so? That&#39;s how it works with most things everywhere. If you&#39;re bothered by how the decisions by people with money and power influence regular people&#39;s decisions, I suggest you have bigger fish to fry than EVs in Ethiopia.

Yeah, fretting about cars in ethiopia, based on the stated adoption rate, would be like people getting up in arms over particulars of yacht ownership in the USA.

Yeah, there&#39;s a lot of people projecting from areas with ubiquitous cars and robust fossil fuel infrastructure and can&#39;t imagine a context where combustion engines aren&#39;t as amazingly convenient.  Getting upset on behalf of a population that probably mostly does not care.

Boom implies that people choosing EVs, which is clearly not the case here if it is mandated.Fuck you and your outdated definition of &quot;boom&quot;.  The new definition is here to stay.(Just in case you were wondering how we got here.  It was because the masses chose to not bitch-slap the living shit out of stupidity and incompetence when it started speaking in public.)

The last line of the summary is the interesting bit: &quot;That has made new EVs cost-competitive with old gasoline cars.&quot;

They reached price parity, so people do have a choice. They can buy a fossil car still, albeit a used one. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a completely equal, free choice, but it&#39;s also not fully compelled either.

The government squeezes the car market so tightly that there is almost no activity, and when they loosen their grip it&#39;s like they&#39;ve made some great achievement. No, they&#39;ve been screwing up their economy for a long time and accidentally took a half-step in the right direction.This all feels like a variation on the broken window fallacy.

&quot;When gas-fueled cars are outlawed, only outlaws will have gas-powered cars.&quot;

Canadian band Rish warned us about this.  So did Australian actor Mel Gibson.

Yes, and the only historical measure where it isn&#39;t is if you go way way before humans were kicking about.  By any *human* history it&#39;s already too warm, and exacerbating our path toward an unfamiliar climate is not a huge comfort just because prehistoric fauna could cope on some scale, nothing to know that human civilization at our current scale can be sustained under such conditions.

Correlation is not causation.  Tech is the big factor for our current rise to dominance over nature, rather than any warming climate.

Big negative changes for populations, like loss of food security, is exactly what causes wars to break out.  Widespread floods and droughts are still something we can&#39;t deal with technologically.

Correlation is not causation.We have enough data to safely assume causation. Civilizations that adapted to extreme cold, such as Inuit, are universally non-technological. That is, farming, which requires temperate climate, is a clear prerequisite for technological civilization to exist. I stand by my earlier assertion.

LOL.  And all that happened *during* the last ice age.  You could just as easily say it was the ice-age that gave us the tech.

What&#39;s more, human activities have been so large we&#39;ve flipped the direction of climate trajectory.  The natural cycle had been heading back towards an ice-age.

Talk about missing the point!  We&#39;ve got the collective strength to flip the climate of the whole planet!

Canadian band Rish warned us about this.Larry Niven, is that you?

Oh look I&#39;m important again, my troll is back to ride my dick. They modded this and the next two posts down because they didn&#39;t understand what I wrote, as usual.

“When gas-fueled cars are outlawed, only non-legacy American car manufacturers will sell abroad”.

Given the state of auto manufacturers and US oil business, with their focus on lobbying to weaken EPA environmental regulations, they will have to play catch-up. Certainly EVs certainly have always to go in terms of battery technologies and reducing costs, but they are improving given the increased investments. The problem for the US is that it keeps on giving up its techn

They also don&#39;t, nationally, produce enough energy.   Enen with that energy deficit, they were still exporting electricity to Djibouti, Sudan, and Kenya as of 2024.   I&#39;m sure this will be viewed as a wonderful decision when viewed from 2030.

Once solar panels are installed, and they ain&#39;t expensive, the electricity is free. And Ethiopia is equatorial, so it gets fantastic insolation. Why keep paying over again for oil when you can pay for solar panels once?

Best of luck to Ethiopia, but they are now fully a Chinese client state.

If you&#39;re not a major power, or part of a bloc, you need to pick your poison. If you think this kind of thing is bad, then vote for whoever supports international development. Countries ar

Sure, but it&#39;s not like Ethiopia has the manufacturing base to make cars or solar panels. They&#39;re going to be relying on foreign cars and foreign solar panels either way.

It looks like they are getting rid of subsidies on gasoline as well, which will also make electric vehicles more attractive.

Ethiopiaâ(TM)s Government Officially Ends Fuel Subsidy: Prices to Follow Global Market Rates [addisinsight.net]

Here&#39;s the thing. Oil is concentrated in a few countries, and if you do not have oil resources, you have to pay other countries for it.

Electricity, though, is everywhere. You can get it in various forms, and while you may have to buy solar panels, once you put them up, they power EVs for a really long time.

So you could import a gallon of oil and once you use that gallon up, import another gallon of oil, Lather, rinse, repeat.

Or you could import a solar panel, and now have basically a limitless supply of ele

I certainly did _not_ have Ethiopia in my top list of progressive environmentally aware ueber-hipster compliant countries but you never know.

1.) It&#39;s totally logical for Afrika to skip any outdated ICE tech and infrastructure and go strait to the good new stuff.

2.) Quite a few parts of Afrika have been gaining traction and gotten on top of things. Ruanda has a rise in womans rights and participation due to the exorbitant male death toll from that civil war / epically uncivil

            <div id="article-text">the upper class will continue to use corporate AI in order to maintain their control over the rest of us, the powerful will use every means at their disposal in order to maintain and increase their power

these irresponsible rich people live in a affluent fueled fantasy and they have no idea how incompetent they really are as they drive society over the cliff

Did you even actually read the report?  This is Slashdot, so my money is on &quot;no&quot;.  Do you even know who the authors are?  For example, Friends of the Earth is highly anti-tech, famous for example for protesting demanding the closure of nuclear plants, against mining (in general), against logging (in general), they&#39;ve protested wind farms on NIMBY grounds, etc. Basically anti-growth.

The report is a long series of bait and switches.

Talking about how &quot;data centres&quot; consume 1,5% of global electricity.  But AI i

Claims that Generative AI can help solve the energy problem or find a cure for cancer sound so stupid. Generative AI can only &quot;create&quot; bad copies of what already exists.

Politicians: How do we stop climate change?

Experts: Reduce consumption, limit abuses by the powerful, instate a carbon tax with teeth

Politicians: Unacceptable! AI, how do we stop climate change?

Every single LLM since GPT-3.5: Reduce consumption, limit abuses by the powerful, instate a carbon tax with teeth

Politicians: Unacceptable! Techbros, how do we stop climate change?

I am so sick and tired of all this disinformation.

Even if it had been obvious to every adult with at least half a brain that the claim had been the verbal equivalent to bovine do-do from the start, disinformation such as this is wasting everyone&#39;s time, money and energy to process.

The people behind that claim should be severely fined and locked up. And anyone who were fooled to believe it should be forced to return to kindergarten.

Max consumerism, if we buy / use a product that they sell, it&#39;ll save the environment. Watching videos of how products are made (like GPUs), its an energy intensive process that in a circular way requires machines that they themselves took a lot of energy to make (heating up recycling/ore and making anything uses a lot of energy). Its hard to differentiate between products that overall will result in less damage to the environment, and the marketing dept hype that preys on people&#39;s emotion.

You beat me to it!  All these years, we have been finding new ways to use either less energy or be more efficient about it.  Now, suddenly, here comes a new segment of the IT industry that needs to hog power 24/7/365, and nobody amongst the Greenies is out there protesting against it.  Since the bulk of Leftists there in the world today work in the tech sector and are enthralled by this very trend - AI!  Just look at Mozilla, which today is not about web browsers, email clients or other internet related sof

&quot;AI can fix the climate&quot;  &quot;AI can cure cancer.&quot;

No you pillocks.  AI can&#39;t do these things anymore than a book can do these things.   You need people, and materials.  Maybe they&#39;ll follow instructions from a book, but the book itself is inert.  Furthermore, it takes a person to pick the book and distribute it.

If there&#39;s nobody willing to gather the people and commit the materials, there is no cure for climate or cancer or whatever thing you&#39;re responsible for.  Eventually you&#39;ll have to do the work.

Yes, let&#39;s use AI, which consumes enormous amounts of power we don;t have, vast tracts of land we  have to clear away, level and build on and huge amounts of water to cool all the heat it generates.

Let&#39;s use this resource hungry thing to help us find ways to use less resources to save the planet.

Perhaps we can start by not using this resource hungry thing in the first place. The first &quot;R&quot; is Reduce, which means you use less of it. Using less power, land and water by not building unnecessary data centers seems to be the best place to start.

He&#39;s looking for things that can get his name in the history books. Naming things after himself, statues, resolving long running conflicts, and being the guy who announced that the US had discovered aliens. He will lean on DOD to say that some UFO is definitely aliens next.

This is all misdirection from the Epstein files and who knows what else. It&#39;s a CIA tactic that the White House has learned.  People are here talking about aliens and Nancy Guthrie not arresting people for their involvement in Epstein&#39;s depravity.

I can be both. Fortunately the arrest of that nonce Andrew Windsor should shift attention back to Epstein.

Ah yes the Epstein files, were the internet has now had access to bulk of it for weeks. Hostile congress and senate persons have access to underacted content longer, a Biden DOJ looking for any reason to keep Trump off the ballot had for four years, and nobody has anything to show for it as far as any actual criminal behavior on Trump&#39;s part besides unsubstantiated tips phoned in to the FBI right around election time...Those Epstein files?

Not that it matters.  As soon as the Extraterrestrial Aliens landed, Trump would have them deported.

But it wasn&#39;t even just Trump or Obama.  Even Bill Clinton back in the 90s had a pretty tough stance on immigration, similar to Trump&#39;s, and at the time, this was one of the issues on which there generally was bipartisan agreement.  Also, Trump&#39;s stances on trade and tariffs today are what Dick Gephardt and David Bonior used to voice in Congress in the 90s, whereas at that time, you had fossilized Republicans just yammering away about free trade, tariffs being taxes, blah blah blah.

No, if he states that, he will be lying and looking behind the scenes will be a trail of McNuggets back to his pockets. If he state the opposite of that, he will be lying and looking behind the scenes will be a trail of McNuggets back to his pockets. He isn&#39;t difficult to understand.

Actual aliens? He will send ICE to deport them to some South American regime.

then be prepared for discussions on whether or not they have souls and if so, whether or not Yaweh/Jehova had his son (/ himself) Jesus brutally tortured and killed to save these alien souls as well.Whether they have souls really depends on how good they taste on a bun with tomato, lettuce, and cheese. In all seriousness, the dogma that &#39;Jesus died to save sinners&#39; wasn&#39;t developed until 400-500 years after Jesus&#39;s time, and there are plenty of theologians and Christians who don&#39;t believe that was why Jesus died.

Will jewish space lasers make an appearance ?

At a recent Cabinet meeting, the usual circle jerk was at hand.

Kristi Noem: Sire, no one has the excellent leadership of you.(tears in her eyes)..sniff.

Kash Patel: Sire, you are immense. No one is immenser than you. Your immenseness makes the Universe envious!!

Scott Bessent: Gee Sire, I only wish I could be as smart as you, how do you do it?

La Presidenta: I don’t know, just call me “I am”!!!

Rev. Paula White (in for the meeting, gets excited, starts speaking in tongues): Habba labba spooky bee, havenah wannabe soundalike Isaacca Sidneywah Caesarean. *

Tulsi Gabbard (gets off her knees to speak): You make me orgasmic, Sire!!!

Secret Service Agent (in an aside to his boss): I don’t believe this is real.

Boss: Hehehehehe..come by my office later and I’ll show you.

SSA: Well boss, you were going to show me something?

Boss: Get in the car, we’ll take a little trip.

Unfortunately, Kash Patel runs into them in the hallway and demands to go with them on a real live mission. He’s VERY excited.

SSA (whispers to his boss): Shouldn’t he have a blindfold on?

They arrive, get out of the car, and go down an elevator 80 stories. They get out and enter a lab.

Chief Scientist: Why Boss, this is a pleasant surprise, do you need replacements?

Boss: No, they are working just as we ordered.

SSA: What a weird place. What’s in those sarcophagi?

CS: Uh..you don’t want to look in one. Many people find it..disturbing.

Boss: Oh go ahead and show him, he’s got a strong stomach.

Kash Patel nearly wets himself with excitement.

Boss: This one has a green light blinking on top.

CS opens the nearest sarcophagus. A puff of blue smoke issues forth. And Kristi Noem is standing there in a Wonder Woman costume.

Boss: Wow!! Well done!! I see you have corrected the psycho eyes.

SSA: Yeah, I can see the difference, there’s a bit more effervescence in these.

Kash Patel (peering a bit further down): They look so real.

CS: We had to be bit careful with the Pete Hegseths. If anyone says the wrong word around him, his right arm does a Dr. Strangelove salute. Although for your application, this should not be a problem.

CS: You betcha. Recall those amazing AI-Pets they have in Japan? Those were only our export models, we didn’t make those nearly as complete as these.

CS (now nearly beside himself with enthusiasm): We have the entire Cabinet!!! That’s why the circle jerks are so lively. We store the spares in our warehouse.

Kash: I just came from a Cabinet Meeting, they looked so real! Doesn’t anyone notice?

CS (now snickering): They were never real people to begin with. We like to think of them as Our Little Chia Pets.

Kash: Hey.wait a minute, have you got one of me too?

Kash: So you could replace me at any time?

CS (breaks out laughing): We already have!

Kash: But I’m here and I’ve never seen another of me running around the White House.

CS: Damn, I hate when they become self-aware. Boss, we’ll need to replace this unit right away, we cannot send him back like this.

Kash: What?? Replace me? But you can’t!! I’m, I’m the h-h-hhead of the FBI. I’m important!

Boss: I’m sorry you have to see this, SSA.

Kash Patel can see everything, everywhere, all at once.

Poor speech writers have nothing serious to do since he mangles most their work they may as well write more fiction...The guy can&#39;t read a speech unless forced which is obvious since he reads the prompter like a moron.

“You know, the new thing is magnets. So instead of using hydraulic that can be hit by lightning and it’s fine. You take a little glass of water, you drop it on magnets, I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Trump said.

“So, you know, the elevators come up in the new carriers—I think I’m going to change it, by the way—they have magnets. Every tractor has hydraulic, every excavator, every excavating machine of any kind has hydraulic. But somebody decided to use magnets.”

“I’m going to sign an executive order. When we build aircraft carriers, it’s steam for the catapults and it’s hydraulic for the elevators. We’ll never have a problem,” Trump said. “He agrees. Everybody agrees. But, ahh, these people in Washington.”

“You know, China intelligently went and they sort of took a monopoly of the world’s magnets, and nobody needed magnets until they convinced everybody 20 years ago, ‘Let’s all do magnets,’” Trump said. “There were many other ways that the world could have gone.”

AI makes more sense than this dementia patient.

and probably also some rambling mention of how he&#39;s much smarter than the aliens are.I&#39;m sure even if it was explained to him at length and repeated to him right before he makes his speech - he&#39;ll still confuse space aliens with the border crossing kind.

Maybe the article title should be &quot;trump&#39;s attention seeking daughter gets attention by saying he has written a speech about aliens&quot;?although... it probably would be a great way to distract people from those epstein files... if its that or a war with Iran, why not tell everyone that Rosewell was a real deal thing?

The most bullshit-riddled part of your post, was where you never mentioned that Democrats could ever be just as complicit if not more in criminal activity.  How convenient you forget the Epstein files were completely under the release control of Democrats for years.  Democrats who refused to release any of it.

Fuck you and your Us vs. Them bullshit within the same fucking country.  It solves nothing.  And everyone is dumber for assuming it does.  If a Civil War ever does br

If Trump has the speech I&#39;m sure well hear it when they start coming to arrest him for diddling kids.

I guarantee it includes at least one mention of Iron Dome, and probably also some rambling mention of how he&#39;s much smarter than the aliens are.And yet, somehow everyone can guarantee that would be more coherent than any speech coming from President Autopen.Just in case Democrats needed a reminder of exactly how President Trump happened. Twice. (Oh, please don&#39;t let my comments stop Democrats from putting up The Kackler or AOC as the next Presidential candidate.  Just give me time to set up the industrial popcorn machine and on-site distillery, so that we may become unburdened by what will be entertaining debate responses..)

There is nothing in the Epstein files. Look a UFO.

I&#39;m going to shit bricks if the UFO conspiracy theorists were right all along. LOL

There&#39;s better secrecy surrounding the Epstein files than any evidence of extraterrestrial life.

He should definitely give a speech about how there are terabytes of government files on extraterrestrials, and that people should be demanding to see them instead of the Trump-Epstein files. It would be a distraction, and it might work for a week or so! Unless there are alien files. I&#39;m sure that Trump would release those too, to distract from his pedophile and rape issues.

Isn&#39;t God and the Devil and angels and all that hogwash all extra-terrestrial? It&#39;s not like they&#39;re all living in Malibu...

throwing out the baby with the bath water

just because you don&#39;t understand something does not mean it cannot exist, to dismiss out of hand what one does not understand is called fundamentalism

higher realties are not extraterrestrial they are extradimensional or transdimensional beings who exist on a more profound, higher or more fundamental level of reality, it&#39;s called metaphysics and spirituality

both science and philosophy deal with this

No that&#39;s incorrect. If a being or species originates outside of earth and it&#39;s atmosphere it is extra-terrestrial by definition. It may be extra-dimensional too but not necessarily (and I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re even getting that).

no, if the earth exists multidimensionally, then the beings here at every level of existence also inhabit the higher dimensional modes we coexist within, the Many Worlds Theory for example, there&#39;s nothing extraterrestrial about it

i also noticed you can&#39;t reply without being insulting can you?

Remember, the DoD has a plan in case of the girl scouts performing a full up insurrection.Some speech writer at the white house doing up some sort of speech in case of the discovery of extraterrestrial life is not unexpected, though I&#39;ll note that there are many possible levels, from not very impactive to very impactive, but incredibly unlikely.Low impact:  We&#39;ve discovered and verified some sort of microscopic life on Mars, Europa, or such.Medium impact: We&#39;ve found signs of life on a planet orbiting a different starHigh impact: We&#39;ve found signs of intelligent tool using life in a different solar systemExtreme impact:  We&#39;ve discovered ET, and they&#39;re visiting.

I&#39;m reminded of Apollo 13. Nixon had a speech prepared for their successful return. He also had a speech for their death in space. Probably more than one.

So, yeah, Trump has a speech for aliens contact. Probably more than one, for friendly aliens, hostile aliens, attacking aliens, refugee aliens running from their enemies, and any other scenario science fiction has thought of for the last hundred years.

They&#39;re probably the same speeches Biden had, and Obama, and every other President for decades, at most, p

Just look at that orange face. For generstions we&#39;ve thought tha Martians are green.  Now even one of them is telling us we&#39;re wrong.

Because that&#39;s exactly what we need - more official incentive for whackadoodles to start praying to aliens now.

for two reasons, the stats tell us so as in the drake equation

we know the evil people in power are lying

One thing I&#39;ll guess - everybody who does believe that there are aliens - which is not unreasonable given the size and scale of the universe - are people whose support/votes he can add to the ones he already has

Here’s something to chew on.  If the US Government has knowledge of UFOs or aliens, that knowledge is decades old.

When Governments abuse tools like social media, it’s known as a Weapon of Mass Distraction.  The Epstein files dribbling out slower than a 90-year old man taking a piss is a perfect example of that weaponization.

Now back to the point about UFOs.  At a time when a planet is arguably entering a Recession of sorts, perhaps now is NOT the time for any Government to start talking about a

Someone said &#39;aliens&#39; and he got all excited.

The ONLY reason this is even being mentioned is because Obama said it first. Had he not said anything the dementia-adled pumpkin and his minions wouldn&#39;t have a reason to say anything.  It&#39;s only because the first black president, one who is looked upon far more favorably than the current goon-in-chief, that anything is even being mentioned.

Give it a week. You&#39;ll never hear anything about it again.

will he take off the mask and show his orange  lizard skin?

Trump prepared a speech.  Ya, you already lost me.

You should be talking about the stock market! Err, I mean, aliens! Something else. Anything else, just not raping children. Why the fuck would you want to talk about raping children when we could be talking about aliens? I never raped an alien.

MAGA are conspiracy lovers, if Trump does this and then doesn&#39;t confirm the Greys have visited us, then they&#39;re going to lose their shit. Possibly claim that Trump is &quot;compromised&quot; and now part of the cover up.

My guess is that this is an old man that is looking for attention and for a distraction. He&#39;ll release the Roswell files but not the Epstein files. Or his tax returns.The dude is a con man. And I don&#39;t understand why millions of people keep falling for it.

            <div id="article-text">For many of us, living in President Donald Trump’s America feels like a never-ending doom loop. Every day brings a fresh batch of headlines about the administration’s lawless attacks on independent federal agencies, the judiciary, and our democracy itself—and you can easily miss some important things. To help you sift through the noise, we’re launching a new newsletter: Executive Dysfunction.

Each week, we will surface one important legal story that you may have overlooked amid all the ongoing chaos. We’ll be highlighting stories about how Trump is doing violence to the law, and stories about how people involved in shaping and upholding the law—judges, lawyers, lawmakers—are pushing back. And we’ll also keep you in the loop about what’s going on with our Slate Jurisprudence team, including Mark Joseph Stern and Dahlia Lithwick. Welcome to the first edition of Executive Dysfunction.

You may have missed it over the long weekend, but a partial government shutdown began on Saturday. After over a year of enduring President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda—as we’ve watched masked agents drag people through the streets, harass families in their homes, and even kill U.S. citizens in broad daylight—Democrats in Washington decided to use their power over federal funding to try to force change. Before signing off on any new dollars for the Department of Homeland Security, Democrats have put forth a list of 10 demands they want Republicans to meet in an effort to rein in a rogue Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

One big question remains, though, as we wait to see if the partial shutdown begins to affect the day-to-day of Americans in travel and other parts of life: Would the Democratic demands, if met, actually do anything to stem ICE’s abuses? This question has already spurred fights on social media, where some progressives are excoriating the Democrats for not asking for nearly enough, and others are praising these proposals as pragmatic solutions that will make a real difference. The truth is probably somewhere in between.

“What these mostly require is for ICE to follow laws and return to practices and procedures that had been standard practice for a long period of time,” Scott Shuchart, former assistant director for regulatory affairs for ICE under the Biden administration, told me. “And so they’re not very ambitious.” ICE would not be completely transformed by this particular set of Democratic demands; rather, it would return to a pre-Trump status quo when we were not witnessing masked agents rampaging across the entire country, pepper-spraying children, ripping disabled people out of their cars, and gunning men and women down in the street.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ list of demands—unveiled in early February, shortly after Alex Pretti was shot to death by federal agents in Minneapolis—ranges from banning agents from wearing masks to outlawing racial profiling. Progressives want the party to go further, while activists have been pushing to simply abolish ICE completely. Voters want something to give, with polling consistently showing they are seriously concerned about the way the Trump administration is handling immigration enforcement.

When looking at Democrats’ list of demands, it’s important to consider that U.S. immigration law has not been significantly updated since Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act in 1996. Whatever the party manages to win in this government funding negotiation will likely be narrow and insufficient to solve our country’s biggest immigration challenges, but it could pare back some of the worst excesses and abuses of the current administration. Thus far, negotiations don’t seem to be going anywhere. It’s also hard to say whether ICE would even obey any new restrictions, given the administration’s persistent refusal to comply with congressional directives and the Supreme Court’s tolerance for such defiance. During a recent congressional oversight hearing, for instance, DHS leadership outright rejected a mask ban, one of Democrats’ key demands.

Let’s take a closer look at the list to try to assess whether the demands actually stand a chance of making a material difference in how ICE uses—and abuses—its vast power over immigration enforcement.

Democrats want to prohibit DHS officers from entering private property without a judicial warrant. This is something that’s technically already against the law, though the administration has attempted to circumvent that very basic right with little pushback. “That’s what the Fourth Amendment has always required,” Nayna Gupta, policy director at American Immigration Council, told me. “The hope here would be not just that Congress restates the law, but that they offer some consequences for the fact that officers don’t follow them, whether that’s dismissal of cases of anyone they arrest once they’re inside, or other disciplinary measures.” According to the public-facing list, there’s no real enforcement mechanism, though this may get sorted out in the writing of any legislation.

Also baked into this demand is a requirement that ICE officers verify that a person is not a U.S. citizen before holding them in immigration detention, as has reportedly happened countless times in recent months. This could be one of the harder things for Republicans to say no to. During congressional hearings last week, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons seemed to acknowledge how politically perilous it is for the agency to be detaining U.S. citizens, hemming and hawing when asked if ICE arrested and deported U.S. citizens, before saying that the agency did only “detain” Americans.

While this feels like a straightforward demand, Shuchart believes that Democrats not taking it further is a missed opportunity to rein in the indiscriminate detention of thousands of immigrants, whether or not they have any sort of criminal background or present any sort of flight risk. “I would like to see this Congress clarify the detention authority and undo this craziness that ICE is doing, where everybody is now subject to expedited removal and mandatory detention.”

Prohibiting immigration enforcement agents from wearing face coverings is something many states are already attempting to implement through legislation. However, these state efforts face challenges in court given broad federal authority to enforce U.S. immigration law and local officers’ fear of conflict with other armed law-enforcement agents. A federal judge recently blocked a new California law prohibiting federal agents from wearing masks, holding that it “unlawfully discriminates against the federal government” because it did not apply to all state officers as well. Although California could in theory address this defect, the ruling illustrates the constitutional challenges that states face when regulating a federal agency, and shows the need for a uniform, nationwide rule from Congress.

Congressional Democrats are also trying to compel immigration enforcement agents to display their agency, unique ID number, and last name. This would be a significant policy change, something Shuchart says would go beyond existing law. As Felipe De La Hoz recently noted in Slate, it wouldn’t reverse the fact that ICE is currently enrolling any and all federal law-enforcement agencies into a vast police “blob” as part of its immigration agenda. It would, though, allow people to at a minimum recognize who is taking part in any given enforcement action, leading to a greater potential for future accountability and a chance that agents will think twice before committing abuses.

Democrats want to prohibit DHS funds from being used to conduct enforcement near sensitive locations, including medical facilities, schools, child care centers, churches, polling places, and courts. If Republicans agree to this proposal, Shuchart said, it would be an enormous change in current policy.

This demand would revert back to the Biden administration’s position, and in theory would end the Trump administration’s strategy of arresting migrants who show up to court-mandated hearings. It could also stop ICE agents from entering hospitals and interfering with patients’ medical care, as was the case in Minnesota. Health care workers there reported an incident when ICE agents hovered over the bedside of a patient for more than 24 hours, at times shackling them to the bed and denying them privacy. In another encounter with ICE, agents remained present while a patient was being bathed.

Democrats also want to bar DHS officers from detaining people based on their ethnicity, spoken language, accent, or place of work. In September, the Supreme Court seemed to signal that these detentions—known as “Kavanaugh stops”—are permissible under the Fourth Amendment. But that decision does not prevent Congress from forbidding them by legislation. This would be a sea change in immigration policy if Democrats can get it.

However, as currently written, this proposal includes no penalty for DHS or individual officers if they were to violate such a ban. And if there is no way to hold agents or agencies accountable, then “it’s a meaningless restriction,” Gupta said.

This is a critical demand where, according to Shuchart, Democrats have fallen short. They are asking that DHS institute a “reasonable use of force policy, expand training and require certification of officers. In the case of an incident, the officer must be removed from the field until an investigation is conducted.” However, the demand does not define what a “reasonable” policy is, nor does it mention how this would be implemented.

It’s worth noting that last year, the Trump administration shut down DHS’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, an oversight agency that was responsible for investigating allegations against the agency from migrants, their families, and the public. Reinstating this office could play a critical role in upholding any use-of-force policy, according to Shuchart. It’s not in the list of Democratic demands, however. “I think the entire model of leaving the immigration agencies to their own devices and hoping for accountability on the back end just doesn’t work, and Congress needs to find a way to be much more prescriptive about what it expects,” Shuchart noted.

In light of the FBI stonewalling Minnesota prosecutors’ efforts to investigate the killing of Renee Nicole Good and withholding evidence from Alex Pretti’s death, Democrats are asking to codify a requirement that DHS “preserve the ability of state and local jurisdictions to investigate and prosecute potential crimes and use of excessive force incidents.” It also would require that evidence be preserved and shared with local jurisdictions. This issue flared up when the federal government appeared to allow the contamination of evidence from the scene of Pretti’s killing, then refused to let state investigators access that evidence in an alarming breach of protocol.

This reform could help states win federal court orders securing access to evidence when immigration agents commit violent crimes within their borders. But again, it does not create any new ways of holding immigration agents accountable for abuses, a weak spot across these demands. Until victims and their families can file claims against officers who violate their rights, there will be few disincentives against excessive use of force. “There are more meaningful reforms that could have been included, in particular ensuring that there is a way for people to individually sue federal officers who violate constitutional and civil rights,” Gupta said. Right now, it is almost impossible for victims to file such suits, thanks in part to a series of Supreme Court decisions shielding federal officials from accountability. But Congress has the power to effectively overturn these rulings and create liability for federal officials by statute.

Democrats want to hold DHS to a higher standard when it comes to immigration detention, as many of us have seen and read about the horrific conditions at detention centers, where illnesses are rampant, medical care is scarce, and access to clean water and food is limited.

Through this demand, Democrats are asking to standardize all buildings where people are detained, ensuring that each one abides by the same basic detention standards and requiring immediate access to a person’s attorney to prevent citizen arrests or detention. States would also be allowed to sue DHS for violating these requirements, and federal lawmakers would be allowed to inspect ICE facilities.

This demand, though, doesn’t address the specific sanitation issues at ICE detention centers, nor does it attempt to claw back the agency’s authority to set its own standards, where Shuchart believes that the real problem lies. “Congress needs to have enforceable detention standards in place, rather than letting ICE write its own detention standards and hoping that the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties will hold them to that,” Shuchart said. “Because guess what? The administration got rid of CRCL, and now nobody on the outside is holding ICE to its standards.”

Forcing federal agents to use body-worn cameras when interacting with the public has been a hotly debated issue, with some arguing it deters officers from misbehaving, while others feel it does little to inhibit abuses. (The agents who shot Pretti were reportedly wearing body cameras.) During that recent congressional hearing, acting Director Lyons confirmed that many federal agents are already using body cameras and the agency intends to roll them out to every agent.

Just last week, body-camera footage of a Border Patrol agent involved in the shooting of Marimar Martinez in Chicago was released, and it appeared to contradict DHS’s version of the incident. Body-cam footage from other violent incidents in Chicago demonstrated that federal agents were brazenly lying about protesters’ actions to justify excessive force against them. Shuchart said that policing experts tend to believe that body cameras are valuable, as they improve the quality of police interactions with the public. Especially considering the Trump administration’s lawless approach to immigration enforcement, where they have outright lied about what actually happened in high-profile ICE encounters, Shuchart thinks Democrats’ demand for body cameras is the right move.

Democrats also want to prohibit the footage from being used to track Americans in a database of people exercising their First Amendment rights, something that federal agents have threatened protesters with. This is a critical safety measure, as we’re seeing the administration abusing its powers to intimidate those who criticize it, and it seems to be surveilling dissenters.

The bottom line for this entire list of demands is that some of what Democrats are asking for would have a real impact in counteracting how ICE has been operating with impunity across the country, but it truly is a bare minimum. If they fold, though, without achieving many of these baseline limits on ICE’s ability to abuse citizens and noncitizens alike, Democrats will themselves be on the hook the next time ICE commits a high-profile atrocity like the ones we’ve seen so frequently in Minneapolis.

Dahlia Lithwick covered a number of these issues in the most recent episode of Amicus. Lithwick spoke with Linus Chan, a professor and lawyer in Minneapolis who has been working with clients caught in ICE’s snare during the recent surge, about the way ICE has been getting around the current restrictions that already exist on its detention authority.

In that same episode, she also spoke with journalist Andrea Pitzer about the Stephen Miller campaign to expand the Department of Homeland Security’s capacity for mass detention and how it already resembles some of the darkest periods in human history.

In the Slate Plus segment of that episode, Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the various breadcrumbs that Supreme Court Justice Sam Alito has been leaving us that he intends to retire this summer, and what it would mean for the court for its staunchest partisan to step down.

Amherst College law professor and Slate contributor Austin Sarat wrote about another issue that seems destined soon to reach the Supreme Court: whether Texas will execute a likely innocent man, Charles Flores, or whether the high court will force the state to reconsider Flores’ case.

On Tuesday, Trump’s most vile spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, announced she would be departing her job at DHS. Stern explained how this is a bittersweet moment for immigration activists, who relied heavily on McLaughlin’s outlandish statements to disprove DHS lies in court.

From the hundreds of Washington Post staffers fired, to Anderson Cooper leaving 60 Minutes, to Stephen Colbert and his own network fighting in public, Trump’s return to the White House is transforming legacy media into something less antagonistic to power—but also less capable of fulfilling its own self-described mission.

The Department of Homeland Security announced on Tuesday that its top spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, would depart the agency after just over a year on the job. To most, McLaughlin is probably best known for slandering Americans wounded or killed by immigration agents—including Renee Good (whom she accused of “domestic terrorism”) and Alex Pretti (whom she claimed sought to “massacre law enforcement”). Inside the legal system, though, McLaughlin is known for something else: Actively sabotaging the Department of Homeland Security in court through her crass, often false public statements. Most notably, McLaughlin has gained notoriety for smearing judges who rule against the Trump administration, deriding them as “activist,” “craven,” “out of control” partisans engaged in “judicial sabotage,” “race-baiting,” and stoking “the embers of hatred.”

President Donald Trump has praised her tactics, but they have done her department no favors in front of these judges. It was perhaps inevitable that judges would bristle at a government spokeswoman deriding them as hacks. But McLaughlin did not merely alienate the judiciary; she consistently undermined the administration’s legal arguments, sabotaging lawyers’ efforts to cover up unlawful conduct by boasting about it on social media. Judges then cited these posts to refute the administration’s claims and rule against it. Few if any government spokespeople have done more to kneecap their own agency in court than McLaughlin.

The gap between this administration’s public statements and legal assertions has been a stubborn problem since Trump returned to office, but nowhere is it more chasmic than DHS. In their briefings, government lawyers finesse a sanitized version into a clean narrative of law-abiding responsibility. At hearings, they insist that the department adheres to high standards of professionalism and good-faith compliance. But McLaughlin’s confrontational declarations to the press routinely punctured this fiction. And lawyers suing DHS pointed judges toward her messaging as evidence of the agency’s real actions and policies—which were, quite often, flagrantly illegal.

Escobar Molina v. DHS illustrates this pattern perfectly. It marked a challenge to immigration agents’ widespread warrantless arrests of suspected immigrants in the District of Columbia, which seemingly targeted anyone who appeared Hispanic. The plaintiffs—lawful residents and American citizens caught up in the dragnet—sued, alleging violations of a statute that allows warrantless arrests only when agents have “probable cause” that an individual is undocumented. In court, lawyers for the department attested that Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection rigorously adhered to this standard. Outside of court, however, McLaughlin kept contradicting them, asserting over and over again that immigration agents did not require probable cause to arrest a person suspected of lacking lawful status. To the contrary, she said that agents merely required “reasonable suspicion,” a much more lenient standard. This was not a one-off: McLaughlin repeated her claim over and over again, and amplified it from DHS’s official accounts.

Judge Beryl Howell was not pleased with this discrepancy. At one hearing, she ordered government lawyers to explain whether they or McLaughlin were stating the agency’s true position. The lawyers tried to dismiss McLaughlin’s comments, saying she did not “necessarily understand” “legal terms of art” because she was not a lawyer. “This,” Howell later wrote, “is a remarkable assertion.” The government seemed to be saying that McLaughlin was “ignorant or incompetent, or both.” Howell scolded the lawyers for their failure to “prevent these statements from being made in DHS’s official communications to the public.” And she concluded that McLaughlin’s statements must be “taken at face value as reflecting the current policy and practice of DHS and federal law enforcement agents making civil immigration arrests.” Howell then issued an injunction barring warrantless immigration arrests without probable cause in D.C. (The government says it will appeal her ruling but has not yet done so.)

McLaughlin also helped to botch ICE’s efforts to keep immigration activist Jeanette Vizguerra-Ramirez locked up without bond. Federal agents arrested Vizguerra-Ramirez while she was on a work break from Target, just one day after she marched against Trump in a widely publicized protest. ICE boasted of the arrest online, and McLaughlin took a victory lap on X, writing: “We will find, arrest, and deport illegal aliens regardless of if they were a featured ‘Time Person of the Year.’ ” The implication seemed to be that ICE had singled out Vizguerra-Ramirez to send a message that no immigrant was safe.

The courts paid attention. Judge Nina Wang later pointed to this tweet as evidence that the administration “sought to make an example of Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez by arresting and detaining an individual with a high profile as a labor and immigration activist.” McLaughlin’s brag that the government had snagged a well-known advocate raised “unique due process concerns,” Wang wrote, and contributed to her conclusion that Vizguerra-Ramirez’s detention violated the Fifth Amendment. Wang ordered a bond hearing, and Vizguerra-Ramirez was quickly released. She remains free today and continues to challenge her order of removal.

McLaughlin’s X account has, in fact, routinely corroborated plaintiffs’ claims that DHS is violating the Constitution. In one case challenging the revocation of student visas because of anti-Israel activism, the government argued that it was merely trying to avoid “adverse foreign policy consequences,” not punishing protected speech. Judge Noël Wise didn’t buy it, pointing to McLaughlin’s insistence that those “pushing Hamas propaganda” and similar “anti-American conduct” would see their visas revoked. Wise cited McLaughlin’s warning as evidence that the government was retaliating against “expression related to Israel and Palestine,” denying the government’s motion to dismiss the case. Judge William Young also cited McLaughlin’s post in ruling that the administration had violated the First Amendment by detaining and deporting pro-Gaza activists. DHS lawyers spent many hours camouflaging their speech suppression in neutral terms, only to see McLaughlin tweet out the real—and unconstitutional—reason for the crackdown.

Sometimes McLaughlin stepped on more prosaic rakes. In a case challenging immigration agents’ excessive force against protesters, the government argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing because the threat of future violence was too speculative. This contention seemed to be bolstered by a credible news report that immigration agents would imminently end the surge and, with it, the plaintiffs’ need for relief. But McLaughlin promptly refuted the report on X, writing: “We aren’t leaving Chicago.” Judge Sara Ellis then used her post to show that the threat of continued violence was all too real, granting the protesters standing.

It’s easy to see why McLaughlin believed she could undermine or contradict her agency’s official position in court without consequence. Trump posts bizarre and aggressive rants on Truth Social all the time, yet courts mostly ignore his late-night ramblings. But that’s because the Supreme Court has shied away from using a president’s public comments as proof of policy, preferring to focus on official communications like executive orders (ostensibly out of respect for the office). The rules for DHS are different: SCOTUS subjects agencies to far more scrutiny and demands that they tell the truth about their decisions. Federal courts may block agency actions that are “arbitrary and capricious,” and statements by a spokesperson can be evidence that an agency is breaking the law.

McLaughlin’s departure may therefore be bittersweet news to the many lawyers now litigating against DHS. Sure, she vilified immigrants, smeared protesters, and attacked judges. Sometimes, though, she also told the truth, in ways that were inadvertently beneficial to the targets of her ire. If she is replaced by a more disciplined spokesperson, the courts may have a more difficult time smoking out the real, lawless policies driving Trump’s mass deportation machine. McLaughlin’s comments were reliably abhorrent. But they were, with remarkable frequency, also a smoking gun.

Trump’s “Board of Peace” emerged from last year’s ceasefire negotiations to govern Gaza after the war. But since then, the board has evolved into a motley group of countries that are willing to pay a billion dollars to join a body that has Donald Trump as its chairman for life. They also have mostly stopped talking about Gaza.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Job cuts at the IRS&#39;s tech arm have gone faster and farther than expected, with 40 percent of IT staff and four-fifths of tech leaders gone, the agency&#39;s CIO revealed yesterday.

Kaschit Pandya detailed the extent of the tech reorganization during a panel at the Association of Government Accountants yesterday, describing it as the biggest in two decades.

This happened as the Trump administration reshaped the federal bureaucracy last year with Elon Musk&#39;s DOGE wielding the chainsaw.

The IRS lost a quarter of its workforce overall in 2025. But the tech team was clearly affected more deeply. At the start of the year, the team encompassed around 8,500 employees.

As reported by Federal News Network (FNN), Pandya said: &quot;Last year, we lost approximately 40 percent of the IT staff and nearly 80 percent of the execs.&quot;

&quot;So clearly there was an opportunity, and I thought the opportunity that we needed to really execute was reorganizing.&quot;

That included breaking up silos within the organization, he said. &quot;Everyone was operating in their own department or area.&quot;

It is not entirely clear where all those staff have gone. According to a report by the US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the IT department had 8,504 workers as of October 2024. As of October 2025, it had 7,135.

However, reports say that as part of the reorganization, 1,000 techies were detailed to work on delivering frontline services during the US tax season. According to FNN, those employees have questioned the wisdom of this move and its implementation.

At yesterday&#39;s conference, Pandya said better outcomes had yet to be delivered. &quot;What it didn&#39;t lead to is automatically everybody coming together and working as one team. We just had different silos,&quot; he said. But his department had now set up &quot;cross-functional&quot; teams focused on end-to-end delivery of individual projects.

&quot;This way there isn&#39;t a cold hand-off of, &#39;My job is X, and now I&#39;m handing it off to somebody else,&#39;&quot; he said.

Ultimately, he said the aim was to have the IT group as a whole working toward a &quot;scorecard.&quot;

Naturally, AI is expected to play a significant role in all this, making people better at their jobs and more end-user-focused, he said.

However, Pandya said IRS leaders are telling employees that AI won&#39;t endanger their jobs. Clearly the agency is perfectly capable of getting rid of people the old-fashioned way.

The US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said last month the agency was behind in its efforts to digitize paper returns. It noted: &quot;The Information Technology function lost approximately 16 percent of its staff,&quot; who are responsible for updates for inflation and expiring or newly enacted tax provisions. This meant that &quot;according to the IRS readiness reports, implementation of these legislative changes is at risk for the 2026 Filing Season.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Meta is among tech giants reportedly funding US politicians friendly to the AI industry, as concerns mount over a huge expansion in datacenter building and the effects of AI on everyday life.

According to The New York Times, Meta is set to spend $65 million this year backing politicians who are sympathetic to its cause.

This is driven by concerns that its AI ambitions might be hampered by regulations intended to keep people safe, plus growing opposition from communities to giant data campuses popping up in their local area.

Meta is starting up two new super PACs (Political Action Committees – organizations to influence election outcomes), the NYT says, which will join two others it has already formed. One group, &quot;Forge the Future Project,&quot;, targets Republicans, while the second, &quot;Making Our Tomorrow,&quot; focuses on Democrats.

Zuckcorp isn&#39;t the only tech giant doing this, of course. The Los Angeles Times reported recently that Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman are among tech industry leaders stumping up $50 million for a new super PAC called &quot;Leading the Future.&quot; The PAC has similar aims in ensuring AI-friendly candidates prevail in the coming mid-term elections in the US.

It is perhaps a sign of the massive sums of money at stake in what many regard as an inflating AI market bubble.

The frenzy of interest in AI development has led to a boom in datacenter building to feed the demand for AI processing infrastructure. This in turn has met opposition from local communities, who are worried about issues including the impact on electricity bills and water supplies.

Research org Data Center Watch reports that 20 US server farm projects were blocked or delayed amid local opposition during Q2 2025.

Meta alone has revealed plans to build a number of multi-gigawatt datacenter clusters, one of which would cover much of the island of Manhattan in New York City.

The datacenter industry knows it has a public image problem, as discussed last year at the Datacloud Global Congress in Cannes, France. Perhaps not surprisingly, one solution touted is to get political leaders onside.

In the US, the situation has got bad enough that the Trump administration has stepped in to attempt to defuse public opposition through some sort of pact between the datacenter industry and hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, and OpenAI, establishing principles around energy, water use and community relations.

Washington is also determined to stamp out any regulations, particularly those at state level, that might constrain the AI industry. In December last year, President Trump issued an executive order intended to punish states that introduce any such legislation.

While individual states want to protect citizens from the effects of algorithmic bias, data privacy breaches, and security risks that might result from AI systems, Trump has empowered Attorney General Pam Bondi to set up an AI Litigation Task Force to challenge any state regulations that potentially hinder America&#39;s race for global AI dominance.

Financial analysts reported last year that the huge level of spending on AI was keeping the US economy out of recession, with datacenter infrastructure and model development providing the only significant growth. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/def_con_epstein_bans/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cybersecurity conference DEF CON has added three men named in the Epstein files to its list of banned individuals. They are not accused of any criminal wrongdoing.

Pablos Holman, Vincenzo Iozzo, and Joichi Ito are the first names to be added to the shortlist this year, preventing them from attending any future conferences. Organizers said contact with the sex offender provided a rationale for the sanction.

All three are named in the Epstein files as having worked with, benefited from, or were otherwise tied to the disgraced financier during the prior decade, although as mentioned, they aren&#39;t accused of being involved in crimes.

The emails show that Holman and Epstein became acquainted as far back as 2010. Politico&#39;s reporting claimed that Epstein made plans to meet with the technologist in 2013, although it isn&#39;t clear if the sex offender actually attended.

Emails from the evidence bundle also appear to show that in the same year, Holman planned to stay at Epstein&#39;s residence in New York City, and introduced Epstein to other industry figures, including those who offered assistance to manipulate search results – burying bad news and promoting philanthropic efforts [PDF].

Holman currently works as a tech investor at venture capital firm Deep Future. He had not responded to The Register&#39;s request for comment at the time of publication.

Iozzo, who is the current CEO at identity management company SlashID and a former Black Hat board member, was in contact with Epstein between at least 2014 and 2018, the files indicate, offering to procure DEF CON tickets for him, emails show.

Iozzo did not immediately respond to The Register&#39;s request for comment, but sent a lengthy statement to Politico for its previous reporting on the files. The CEO said he was first introduced to the financier in 2014 while aged 25 and exploring funding opportunities for a startup.

He claims the allegations in the files were fabricated, that the FBI had never contacted him about his ties to Epstein, and that his interactions with Epstein were limited to business opportunities that never materialized.

&quot;I regret the past association and take full responsibility for not exercising greater judgment at the time,&quot; he said.

A spokesperson for Iozzo told TechCrunch that the SlashID CEO had &quot;barely&quot; attended DEF CON for 20 years, describing the organizers&#39; decision as &quot;entirely performative.&quot;

&quot;It was a rush to judgment not based on any investigation or wrongdoing by Mr Iozzo,&quot; the statement added.

Joichi &quot;Joi&quot; Ito appears to be one of the individuals who introduced Iozzo to Epstein, according to emails in the DoJ&#39;s files.

&quot;Vincenzo is one of the best network security guys I know,&quot; Ito said in one May 2014 email. &quot;Working with him on a network security company idea. He&#39;s in NYC often. If you have time, you should connect. I think you&#39;ll enjoy meeting each other and I also think this business idea that we&#39;re working on might be interesting for you as well.&quot;

Ito, a venture capitalist currently serving as president of the Chiba Institute of Technology (CIT), was in contact with Epstein between 2013 and 2019, emails show, and the two met numerous times during that period.

Epstein was an investor in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#39;s Media Lab, where Ito formerly served as a director. Ito resigned from his post at MIT in 2019, The New York Times reported, after it was revealed that he had accepted $1.7 million from Epstein to help fund the lab.

Ito did not respond to The Register after we requested a statement via the CIT, but he previously apologized for his association with Epstein and claimed to have no knowledge &quot;of the horrific acts that he was accused of.&quot;

The project was set up by Luke Igel and Riley Walz. It ingests the raw email files included in the DoJ&#39;s poorly formatted dump of Epstein files and presents them in a Gmail-like interface.

Holman, Iozzo, and Ito join a list of individuals already publicly banned from DEF CON. The conference states that &quot;many bans&quot; are not revealed, and only six others have made the public list since 2017. ®

            <div id="article-text">Teach an AI agent how to fish for information and it can feed itself with data. Tell an AI agent to figure things out on its own and it may make things worse.

AI agents are machine learning models (e.g. Claude Opus 4.6) that have access to other software through a CLI harness (e.g. Claude Code) and operate in an iterative loop. These agents can be instructed to handle various tasks, some of which may not be covered in their training data.

When lacking the appropriate training, software agents can be given access to new &quot;skills,&quot; which are essentially added reference material to impart domain-specific capabilities. &quot;Skills&quot; in this context refer to instructions, metadata, and other resources like scripts and templates that agents load to obtain procedural knowledge.

For example, an AI agent could be instructed how to process PDFs with a skill that consists of markdown text, code, libraries, and reference material about APIs. While the agent might have some idea how to do this from its training data, it should perform better with more specific guidance.

Yet according to a recent study, SkillsBench: Benchmarking How Well Agent Skills Work Across Diverse Tasks, asking an agent to develop that skill on its own will end in disappointment. The &quot;intelligence&quot; part of artificial intelligence is somewhat overstated.

At least that&#39;s the case with large language models (LLMs) at inference time – when the trained model is being used as opposed to during the training process.

Certain forms of machine learning, like deep learning, can be applied in a way that allows neural network models to improve their performance in domain-specific tasks like video games.

The explosion of AI agents – Claude Code from Anthropic, Gemini CLI from Google, and Codex CLI from OpenAI – has led to the rapid development of skills to augment what the agents can do. Skill directories are proliferating like weeds. And given how OpenClaw agents have been teaching each other in the Moltbook automated community network, it seems well past time to figure out how good a job they do at it.

To date, there&#39;s been no common way to see whether these skills deliver what they promise. So a team of 40 (!) computer scientists, affiliated with with companies like Amazon, BenchFlow, ByteDance, Foxconn, and Zennity, and various universities, including Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and Oxford, set out to develop a benchmark test to evaluate how agent skills augment performance during inference.

The authors, led by Xiangyi Li, founder of agent measurement startup BenchFlow, developed a test they dubbed SkillsBench, and described their findings in the above-mentioned preprint paper.

The researchers looked at seven agent-model setups across 84 tasks for 7,308 trajectories – one agent&#39;s attempt at solving a single task under a specific skills condition. Three conditions were tested: no skills, curated skills, and self-generated skills.

The agents using curated skills – designed by people – completed tasks 16.2 percent more frequently than no-skill agents on average, though with high variance.

One example cited in the study is a flood-risk analysis task. Agents without skills didn&#39;t apply the appropriate statistical math, so achieved a pass rate of only 2.9 percent. With a curated skill that told the agent to use the Pearson type III probability distribution and apply the appropriate standard USGS methodology, and that specified other details like scipy function calls and parameter interpretation, the agent&#39;s task pass rate increased to 80 percent.

When analyzed in terms of specific knowledge domains, curating healthcare (+51.9 percentage points) and manufacturing (+41.9 percentage points) skills helped AI agents the most, while curating skills related to mathematics (+6.0 percentage points) and software engineering (+4.5 percentage points) provided smaller gains. The authors explain this by observing that domains requiring specialized knowledge tend to be underrepresented in training data. So it makes sense for humans to augment agents working on tasks in those domains.

And when doing so, less is more – skills with only a few (2-3) modules performed better than massive data dumps.

That applies to model scale too – curated skills help smaller models punch above their weight class in terms of task completion. Anthropic&#39;s Claude Haiku 4.5 model with skills (27.7 percent) outperformed Haiku 4.5 without skills (11 percent) and also Claude Opus 4.5 without skills (22 percent).

When it came time to get agents to teach themselves skills, the study authors directed them to

Agents that tried this did worse than if they hadn&#39;t tried at all.

&quot;Self-generated skills provide negligible or negative benefit (–1.3 percentage points average), demonstrating that effective skills require human-curated domain expertise,&quot; the authors state.

For now at least, the AI revolution will not be fully automated – the machines still need human teachers to set them on the right path. ®

            <h2>UK to demand social platforms take down abusive intimate images within 48 hours</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/19/uk_intimate_images_online/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK is bracketing &quot;intimate images shared without a victim&#39;s consent&quot; along with terror and child sexual abuse material, and demanding that online platforms remove them within two days.

The government announced today that it would add an amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill requiring platforms to &quot;remove this content no more than 48 hours after it is flagged to them.&quot;

Platforms that do not do so would potentially face fines of 10 percent of &quot;qualifying worldwide income&quot; or have their services blocked in the UK.

The amendment follows outrage over the Elon Musk-owned chatbot Grok&#39;s willingness to generate nude or sexualized images of people, mainly women and girls, which forced a climbdown earlier this year.

Under the UK&#39;s proposals, victims would only have to report an abusive image once, and not have to contact multiple platforms or remain constantly vigilant for new uploads.

The government said: &quot;Plans are currently being considered by Ofcom for these kinds of images to be treated with the same severity as child sexual abuse and terrorism content, digitally marking them so that any time someone tries to repost them, they will be automatically taken down.&quot;

It added that creating or sharing non-consensual intimate images will also become a &quot;priority offence&quot; under the Online Safety Act, &quot;meaning this crime is treated with the same seriousness as child abuse or terrorism.&quot;

The government said: &quot;We will publish guidance for internet providers setting out how they should block access to sites hosting this content, targeting rogue websites that may fall outside the reach of the Online Safety Act.&quot;

Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said in a statement: &quot;The days of tech firms having a free pass are over. Because of the action we are taking platforms must now find and remove intimate images shared without consent within a maximum of 48 hours.&quot;

X is facing an EU probe, under the Digital Services Act, into Grok&#39;s willingness to produce explicit imagery, including of children.

When the probe was announced last month, X told The Register: &quot;We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.&quot;

The UK government&#39;s latest move was welcomed by lawyer Hanna Basha, Dispute Resolution Partner from Payne Hicks Beach, who acted for TV personality Georgia Harrison in her civil revenge pornography case in 2022.

But she added: &quot;Why 48 hours and not 24 or even 12? Every hour these images remain online compounds the harm.&quot;

She also said social media companies should be forced to display clear contact details. &quot;Too often victims cannot even find where to report abusive content. This is a welcome step, but meaningful protection requires faster takedowns and real accountability from platforms.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Today&#39;s bork is entirely human-generated and will send a shiver down the spine of security pros. No matter how secure a system is, a user&#39;s ability to undo an administrator&#39;s best efforts should not be underestimated.

This example is a whiteboard seen by an eagle-eyed Register reader in their local medical center. Our reader asked to remain anonymous for obvious reasons, but we can only wish that the same anonymity had been extended to the systems running behind the scenes.

Whiteboard showing confidential information (obscured)

We&#39;ve excised the text, but suffice it to say that the whiteboard contains usernames and passwords for system access. It&#39;s a change from a Post-it note stuck to the screen, but it&#39;s no less likely to make a security professional shriek in horror. After all, not only is the account exposed, but anyone can use it, which renders an access log somewhat redundant.

The whiteboard has been on show at the UK medical center for a while now. Our reader told us: &quot;A few months ago, I explained to a lady on the front desk that displaying this information was a bad idea. Clearly, they don&#39;t believe me.&quot;

The National Health Service has guidelines regarding passwords. The rules include &quot;not using a single word... think random... think multiple (3 random passwords technique)&quot; and &quot;not using or containing a common password.&quot;

To be fair to the medical center concerned, those rules do not include &quot;for goodness sake, don&#39;t put the username and password on a whiteboard for everyone to see.&quot;

Thankfully, passwords are on their way out. According to the UK&#39;s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), passkeys &quot;solve the main security problems we have with passwords.&quot;

The NCSC states they &quot;are generated securely and so can&#39;t be guessed... can&#39;t be phished,&quot; and &quot;are unique for each website you use, so if one website is compromised it doesn&#39;t put your other logins at risk.&quot;

They are also unlikely to be found written on a whiteboard.

Passkeys are not a perfect solution to password problems. However, almost anything would be an improvement on this public display of private credentials. ®

Nintendo just released a Switch 2 upgrade for Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition. The upgrade is $4.99 for owners of the Switch game, or $64.99 if you buy the Switch 2 version. Don’t buy the Switch 2 version! Instead, score a deal on the digital Switch version that’s $39.99 (originally $59.99) at GameStop and Amazon. Then, make the upgrade for another $5. The physical version is discounted, too, but buying digitally is the fastest way to jump in.

Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition is far from the only Switch game that’s discounted right now. GameStop, Amazon, and Walmart are offering several first-party games at up to $30 off, including Princess Peach: Showtime, Super Mario RPG, The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, and more. Better yet, some of those games have received Switch 2 upgrades that don’t cost extra.

On The Vergecast: the FCC’s chilling effect, Apple’s AI gadgets, and Tesla’s robotaxi record.

Generally speaking, arcane and mostly unenforced FCC rules are not the province of late night talk shows. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr seems intent on changing that, though; not long after causing a ruckus that briefly took Jimmy Kimmel off the air, his vague threats appear to have been enough to convince CBS to tell Stephen Colbert not to air an interview. Which, of course, became a whole thing.

On this episode of The Vergecast (which we recorded and published a day early both because of the news and because Nilay has a vacation to go on), David and Nilay open the show with an extra-large installment of Brendan Carr is a Dummy. We talk through the timeline of the Colbert / CBS back-and-forth, once again attempt to explain how the equal time rule actually works, and wonder exactly how far Carr’s chilling effect will be allowed to go.

After that, we turn to some gadgets. Nilay has always wanted exactly the facial-recognition feature Meta appears to be getting ready to launch for its smart glasses, but we’re not sure it should exist. And it appears Meta knows that. Apple is also gearing up for potentially a series of launches in early March, which could include new iPads, new Macs, and more. It almost certainly won’t include any of the AI gadgets Apple is reportedly working on, but we talk about those anyway.

Finally, in the lightning round, we discuss Tesla’s rough self-driving record, Samsung’s next phones, an astonishing robovac security problem, and more.

The AI industry is rife with defections, FOMO, and radical mission statements. It’s about to get supercharged.

Today on Decoder we’re going to talk about the war for AI talent. Right now, the hottest job market on the planet is for AI researchers.

The vast majority of these people are concentrated into a small number of hugely valuable, extremely fast-growing companies in the San Francisco Bay Area. Nowadays, such companies are paying some of the highest salaries in the history of the tech industry to poach researchers from one another.

It feels like every time one of these AI researchers leaves one company for another, they tell us exactly why. Sometimes they’re simply resigning to go be a poet. Sometimes they’re chasing a mission. Sometimes they’re worried that AI is going to imperil humanity, destroy all jobs, and plunge the world into chaos.

They’re really saying these things. They’re publishing these notes on X, in blog posts, or in the case of one former OpenAI safety researcher by writing a full New York Times op-ed.

I’ve been dying to really dig in and try to unpack what’s going on with all these talent moves in AI. So my guest today is Verge senior AI reporter Hayden Field, who’s been covering the revolving door of the AI industry really closely and also the broader culture that’s motivating the AI workers to jump ship and the companies that are ruthlessly trying to hire them.

Those motivations vary. Sure, all these people are paid extravagant salaries, but as you’ll hear Hayden say, a stronger motivating force is ideology and mission. The people working on AI, by and large, believe that what they’re doing is going to radically change the world, and they’re not really in desperate need of more money. So that really changes the incentive structures that might push people to leave, say, OpenAI for Anthropic, or to quit Elon Musk’s xAI now that it’s been acquired by SpaceX.

At the same time, the incentives of the AI companies themselves are going from raising money to making money. Reporting suggests OpenAI and maybe even Anthropic could go public this year, and doing so would create a historic amount of wealth. It would also put new kinds of pressure on these companies to be more transparent about how they spend money and to be much more accountable for returning on the huge investments that they’ve raised so far.

There’s a lot in this conversation. The AI industry right now is full of drama. There’s big characters, bitter rivalries, lots of money, and really, really long blog posts about the end of the world.

            <div id="article-text">Joy-Con alternatives typically provide improvements aplenty, but this prototype doesn’t.

Joy-Con alternatives typically provide improvements aplenty, but this prototype doesn’t.

Gaming accessory company Abxylute has launched a Kickstarter campaign for its upcoming N6 and GameCube-style N9C Switch 2 dock-style controllers. If the ergonomics of Nintendo’s Joy-Cons don’t jibe with you, these aim to be solid alternatives, particularly for people with medium-to-large-size hands.

Both of Abxylute’s new controllers have bigger, more comfortable grips than Joy-Cons offer, along with longer-lasting Hall effect joysticks. I tested a functioning prototype of the N6, and it has almost everything that people might be looking for to level up their gaming experience: full-size sticks, vibration, motion controls, customizable back paddles, and turbo mode for spamming commands.

What the N6 is going for isn’t anything new. CRKD popularized the slide-in form factor with the original Switch. It adds thick grips to your console to make it look and feel more like a Steam Deck. For as much as it added to ergonomics, it stood out as a solution for the Switch’s Joy-Con drift drama by offering Hall effect sticks that won’t degrade. The N6 doesn’t mess with that formula very much. It has full-size Hall effect joysticks that are grippier and feature a concave top so your thumb can rest instead of sliding off. It has thick grips that go around the console’s back to let your fingers spread out, and its triggers are bigger and offer more tactile feedback.

The thing is, the N6 doesn’t feel like as much of an upgrade over Joy-Cons as the Nitro Deck, based on my time with a functional prototype. For one, the left and right sticks are too low for my medium-size hands to comfortably reach with my fingers fully extended around its grips, making the D-pad and any of the system-level buttons below them especially tricky to access in a pinch. People with larger hands would likely have more trouble.

You might not experience issues if you have small hands, and/or if you primarily play games that don’t require fast reaction times. The N6 can handle fast reactions, but I never felt confident enough in my grip to execute twitchy commands with precision.

The ergonomics could be improved if Abxylute made the left and right sides of the controller taller and spread out the sticks and buttons more. That would make it easier for more people to fully grip the N6 without struggling to reach the sticks or buttons. As it is, I have to hold it in a precarious claw grip to play some games. Taller controls would also cover the top left and top right edges of the Switch 2, which are inexplicably exposed by the N6’s design.

Several aspects of the N6 remain in development, including how the rumble feels (strong, not attempting HD rumble, but also not terrible), and how the buttons and triggers sound (very pronounced — I’d get in trouble using this around my wife while she’s reading at night).

Abxylute proactively shared a list of known issues it’s working to address before the final release in April, which I think is a good move from a company that’s hoping to earn your pledge:

Abxylute is asking HK$ 618, or about $80, for the N6 as an early backer special price. It offered a limited allotment at this price, and it has already sold through most of them by the time of publication. Whether it gets more expensive after crowdfunding or not, it’s within the price range of the $99.99 CRKD Nitro Deck 2 coming this Spring that offers many extra features. Based on my experience with an early N6 prototype, I’m not convinced it’s worth getting a controller that leaves much of your console exposed and struggles with ergonomics.

Hello and welcome to Regulator, a newsletter for Verge subscribers about the love-hate (but mostly hate) relationship between Silicon Valley and Washington. I hope everyone got to celebrate George Washington’s birthday in their preferred manner: skiing, staycationing, subscribing to The Verge if you haven’t already, etc.

Political alliances are rarely permanent, so it’s somewhat predictable that the MAGA-tech bro alliance seems to have fallen apart in the span of a single year. Which side the administration would actually choose, though, was more difficult to foresee.

Last winter, it appeared that two groups were in a tenuous relationship, held together by Elon Musk’s shameless execution of the DOGE agenda and Big Tech signing massive checks to settle Donald Trump’s lawsuits against them. But last night, the Trump administration made a choice: the money. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that they would sue any state who tried to regulate prediction markets like Kalshi — even the Republican states.

On Tuesday, the CFTC filed an amicus brief to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, officially opposing an onslaught of lawsuits filed by the states against betting markets like Kalshi, Polymarket, Coinbase, and Crypto.com. (The latter two, known primarily as cryptocurrency exchanges, have partnered with Kalshi and created a standalone prediction market called OG, respectively.) But unusually, the brief was accompanied by a threat — posted on X, of all places. In a video directly facing the camera posted on Tuesday night, sole CFTC chairman Michael Selig asserted his commission’s authority to regulate prediction markets and stated that the federal government was prepared to sue: “To those who seek to challenge our authority in this space, let me be clear: we will see you in court.”

Had Selig simply written a staid Wall Street Journal op-ed asserting the CFTC’s authority (which he also did), that would have barely raised an eyebrow. But in 2026, a video threat, especially one posted on X, is basically grounds to instigate a political firestorm — one that Spencer Cox, the Republican Governor of Utah, gladly kindled. “Mike, I appreciate you attempting this with a straight face, but I don’t remember the CFTC having authority over the ‘derivative market’ of LeBron James rebounds,” he posted in response (also on X). “These prediction markets you are breathlessly defending are gambling—pure and simple. They are destroying the lives of families and countless Americans, especially young men. They have no place in Utah.” He promised that Utah would continue to pursue litigation and beat the federal government in court if need be.

This wouldn’t be the first time that Utah and Cox have voiced their opposition to federal overreach regarding emerging technology. Last year, they publicly opposed an executive order that would have given the Justice Department the power to sue states passing and enforcing AI regulatory laws. The prediction markets issue hits a particular nerve in Utah: nearly half of the state is Mormon, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints officially opposes all government-sanctioned forms of gambling, even state lotteries. But Cox’s declaration is what’s known in political circles as a “weathervane”: if one deeply Republican state is pushing back against the Trump administration on a new front, who else on the right might follow suit — and what sorts of new broligarch technologies would they fight against?

Is it a coincidence that Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s big visit to Washington happened just as the Pentagon was reconsidering its relationship with the AI company? Over the past two weeks, Amodei published a 38-page letter to Congress warning of the rising existential risks of artificial intelligence, conducted an interview with Axios’s Mike Allen (and sponsored their newsletter), and met with Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Jim Banks (R-IN) on Capitol Hill to support their bill banning the sale of advanced AI chips to China.

But Amodei barely finished his capitol blitz when Axios broke the news over the weekend that the Pentagon wasn’t just impatient with Anthropic’s reticence to use Claude for unrestricted purposes, but that it would actively punish Anthropic for refusing to cooperate by designating them a “supply-chain risk.” If it goes through, any company that wants to work with the military would have to cut ties with Anthropic. As one Pentagon official described it, “It will be an enormous pain in the ass to disentangle, and we are going to make sure they pay a price for forcing our hand like this.”

The Pentagon’s move makes no sense for anyone who sees Claude as a superior AI enterprise product to its competitors at the Pentagon (Gemini, ChatGPT, and Grok). If viewed through the lens of every former interaction that Trump’s had with companies that voiced ideological opposition to his agenda however, their treatment of Anthropic is par for the course. Years ago, for instance, Trump threatened to cut off Amazon’s access to their sweetheart deal with the US Postal Service, in retaliation for Jeff Bezos’ ownership of the then highly critical Washington Post.

But for me, the question is: exactly what caused the ideological break, and how much of it was even about national security? In the past few months, there’s been a bizarre spurt of online messaging from right-wing influencers trying to claim that Anthropic, of all the AI companies, was too woke — the kind of woke that could convince kids to become trans, or DEI-pill them, or whatever lib-coded nightmares a MAGA personality could dream up. There wasn’t much proof that they could point to, other than its employees expressing opinions that could be lib-coded, if you’re not fully reading the entire tweet:

The White House is convening a third meeting between the crypto industry and the banking industry this week, continuing to hash out which major financial entity gets to reap the interests from yield-bearing stablecoin accounts (or if they get to bear interest at all). They have until March 1st to deliver draft language for the Senate. Good luck, y’all!

Can we all agree that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy is framemogging Kid Rock in this video?

The photo editing app now has its own photo taking features, including manual controls and retro film filters.

Google has updated the iPhone version of its photo editing app Snapseed with its own camera, including a suite of manual controls and retro film emulation effects. It’s the second major update to the app in less than 12 months, after it had previously been left to languish by Google for years.

The Snapseed camera defaults to an automatic mode, but also includes optional controls for ISO, shutter speed, and focus, along with flash and zoom. It allows you to shoot using saved looks and edit stacks from the app, which can be altered after the shot is taken, along with a range of preset film effects inspired by specific films from Kodak, Fujifilm, and more. There’s even a handful of UI color themes to pick from too.

9to5Google reports that the camera feature quietly began to appear in December 2025, but could only be activated via lock widget, Camera Control, or the Control Center, and was never mentioned in the app’s update notes. This newest update makes the camera more accessible by bringing it directly into the main app, launched via an icon in the top-right corner, and seems to mark its official launch.

Google surprised us by updating Snapseed to version 3.0 in June 2025, with a major redesign and new features — the app’s first significant update since adding dark mode in 2021, following years of spotty support since Snapseed was acquired in 2012. That update is yet to reach the Android version, though the developers confirmed on Reddit that it’s in the works but still “a few months” away.

How uncrewed narco subs could transform the Colombian drug trade

For decades, handmade narco subs have been some of the cocaine trade’s most elusive and productive workhorses, ferrying multi-ton loads of illicit drugs from Colombian estuaries toward markets in North America and, increasingly, the rest of the world. Now off-the-shelf technology—Starlink terminals, plug-and-play nautical autopilots, high-resolution video cameras—may be advancing that cat-and-mouse game into a new phase.Uncrewed subs could move more cocaine over longer distances, and they wouldn’t put human smugglers at risk of capture. And law enforcement around the world is just beginning to grapple with what this means for the future. Read the full story.

Google DeepMind wants to know if chatbots are just virtue signaling

The news: Google DeepMind is calling for the moral behavior of large language models—such as what they do when called on to act as companions, therapists, medical advisors, and so on—to be scrutinized with the same kind of rigor as their ability to code or do math.

Why it matters: As LLMs improve, people are asking them to play more and more sensitive roles in their lives. Agents are starting to take actions on people’s behalf. LLMs may be able to influence human decision-making. And yet nobody knows how trustworthy this technology really is at such tasks. Read the full story.

The building legal case for global climate justice

The United States and the European Union grew into economic superpowers by committing climate atrocities. They have burned a wildly disproportionate share of the world’s oil and gas, planting carbon time bombs that will detonate first in the poorest, hottest parts of the globe.Morally, there’s an ironclad case that the countries or companies responsible for this mess should provide compensation. Legally, though, the case has been far harder to make. But now those tides might be turning. Read the full story.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/19/1132619/uncrewed-narco-subs-transform-columbian-drug-trade/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On a bright morning last April, a surveillance plane operated by the Colombian military spotted a 40-foot-long shark-like silhouette idling in the ocean just off Tayrona National Park. It was, unmistakably, a “narco sub,” a stealthy fiberglass vessel that sails with its hull almost entirely underwater, used by drug cartels to move cocaine north. The plane’s crew radioed it in, and eventually nearby coast guard boats got the order, routine but urgent: Intercept.

In Cartagena, about 150 miles from the action, Captain Jaime González Zamudio, commander of the regional coast guard group, sat down at his desk to watch what happened next. On his computer monitor, icons representing his patrol boats raced toward the sub’s coordinates as updates crackled over his radio from the crews at sea. This was all standard; Colombia is the world’s largest producer of cocaine, and its navy has been seizing narco subs for decades. And so the captain was pretty sure what the outcome would be. His crew would catch up to the sub, just a bit of it showing above the water’s surface. They’d bring it to heel, board it, and force open the hatch to find two, three, maybe four exhausted men suffocating in a mix of diesel fumes and humidity, and a cargo compartment holding several tons of cocaine.

The boats caught up to the sub. A crew boarded, forced open the hatch, and confirmed that the vessel was secure. But from that point on, things were different.

First, some unexpected details came over the radio: There was no cocaine on board. Neither was there a crew, nor a helm, nor even enough room for a person to lie down. Instead, inside the hull the crew found a fuel tank, an autopilot system and control electronics, and a remotely monitored security camera. González Zamudio’s crew started sending pictures back to Cartagena: Bolted to the hull was another camera, as well as two plastic rectangles, each about the size of a cookie sheet—antennas for connecting to Starlink satellite internet.

The authorities towed the boat back to Cartagena, where military techs took a closer look. Weeks later, they came to an unsettling conclusion: This was Colombia’s first confirmed uncrewed narco sub. It could be operated by remote control, but it was also capable of some degree of autonomous travel. The techs concluded that the sub was likely a prototype built by the Clan del Golfo, a powerful criminal group that operates along the Caribbean coast.

For decades, handmade narco subs have been some of the cocaine trade’s most elusive and productive workhorses, ferrying multi-ton loads of illicit drugs from Colombian estuaries toward markets in North America and, increasingly, the rest of the world. Now off-the-shelf technology—Starlink terminals, plug-and-play nautical autopilots, high-resolution video cameras—may be advancing that cat-and-mouse game into a new phase.

Uncrewed subs could move more cocaine over longer distances, and they wouldn’t put human smugglers at risk of capture. Law enforcement around the world is just beginning to grapple with what the Tayrona sub means for the future—whether it was merely an isolated experiment or the opening move in a new era of autonomous drug smuggling at sea.

Drug traffickers love the ocean. “You can move drug traffic through legal and illegal routes,” says Juan Pablo Serrano, a captain in the Colombian navy and head of the operational coordination center for Orión, a multiagency, multinational counternarcotics effort. The giant container ships at the heart of global commerce offer a favorite approach, Serrano says. Bribe a chain of dockworkers and inspectors, hide a load in one of thousands of cargo boxes, and put it on a totally legal commercial vessel headed to Europe or North America. That route is slow and expensive—involving months of transit and bribes spread across a wide network—but relatively low risk. “A ship can carry 5,000 containers. Good luck finding the right one,” he says.

Far less legal, but much faster and cheaper, are small, powerful motorboats. Quick to build and cheap to crew, these “go-fasts” top out at just under 50 feet long and can move smaller loads in hours rather than days. But they’re also easy for coastal radars and patrols to spot.

Submersibles—or, more accurately, “semisubmersibles”—fit somewhere in the middle. They take more money and engineering to build than an open speedboat, but they buy stealth—even if a bit of the vessel rides at the surface, the bulk stays hidden underwater. That adds another option to a portfolio that smugglers constantly rebalance across three variables: risk, time, and cost. When US and Colombian authorities tightened control over air routes and commercial shipping in the early 1990s, subs became more attractive. The first ones were crude wooden hulls with a fiberglass shell and extra fuel tanks, cobbled together in mangrove estuaries, hidden from prying eyes. Today’s fiberglass semisubmersible designs ride mostly below the surface, relying on diesel engines that can push multi-ton loads for days at a time while presenting little more than a ripple and a hot exhaust pipe to radar and infrared sensors.

A typical semisubmersible costs under $2 million to build and can carry three metric tons of cocaine. That’s worth over $160 million in Europe—wholesale.

Most ferry between South American coasts and handoff points in Central America and Mexico, where allied criminal organizations break up the cargo and slowly funnel it toward the US. But some now go much farther. In 2019, Spanish authorities intercepted a semisubmersible after a 27-day transatlantic voyage from Brazil. In 2024, police in the Solomon Islands found the first narco sub in the Asia-Pacific region, a semisubmersible probably originating from Colombia on its way to Australia or New Zealand.

If the variables are risk, time, and cost, then the economics of a narco sub are simple. Even if they spend more time on the water than a powerboat, they’re less likely to get caught—and a relative bargain to produce. A narco sub might cost between $1 million and $2 million to build, but a kilo of cocaine costs just about $500 to make. “By the time that kilo reaches Europe, it can sell for between $44,000 and $55,000,” Serrano says. A typical semisubmersible carries up to three metric tons—cargo worth well over $160 million at European wholesale prices.

Off-the-shelf nautical autopilots, WiFi antennas, Starlink satellite internet connections, and remote cameras are all drug smugglers need to turn semisubmersibles into drone ships.

As a result, narco subs are getting more common. Seizures by authorities tripled in the last 20 years, according to Colombia’s International Center for Research and Analysis Against Maritime Drug Trafficking (CMCON), and Serrano admits that the Orión alliance has enough ships and aircraft to catch only a fraction of what sails.

Until now, though, narco subs have had one major flaw: They depended on people, usually poor fishermen or low-level recruits sealed into stifling compartments for days at a time, steering by GPS and sight, hoping not to be spotted. That made the subs expensive and a risk to drug sellers if captured. Like good capitalists, the Tayrona boat’s builders seem to have been trying to obviate labor costs with automation. No crew means more room for drugs or fuel and no sailors to pay—or to get arrested or flip if a mission goes wrong.

“If you don’t have a person or people on board, that makes the transoceanic routes much more feasible,” says Henry Shuldiner, a researcher at InSight Crime who has analyzed hundreds of narco-sub cases. It’s one thing, he notes, to persuade someone to spend a day or two going from Colombia to Panama for a big payout; it’s another to ask four people to spend three weeks sealed inside a cramped tube, sleeping, eating, and relieving themselves in the same space. “That’s a hard sell,” Shuldiner says.

An uncrewed sub doesn’t have to race to a rendezvous because its crew can endure only a few days inside. It can move more slowly and stealthily. It can wait out patrols or bad weather, loiter near a meeting point, or take longer and less well-monitored routes. And if something goes wrong—if a military plane appears or navigation fails—its owners can simply scuttle the vessel from afar.

Meanwhile, the basic technology to make all that work is getting more and more affordable, and the potential profit margins are rising. “The rapidly approaching universality of autonomous technology could be a nightmare for the U.S. Coast Guard,” wrote two Coast Guard officers in the US Naval Institute’s journal Proceedings in 2021. And as if to prove how good an idea drone narco subs are, the US Marine Corps and the weapons builder Leidos are testing a low-profile uncrewed vessel called the Sea Specter, which they describe as being “inspired” by narco-sub design.

The possibility that drug smugglers are experimenting with autonomous subs isn’t just theoretical. Law enforcement agencies on other smuggling routes have found signs the Tayrona sub isn’t an isolated case. In 2022, Spanish police seized three small submersible drones near Cádiz, on Spain’s southern coast. Two years later, Italian authorities confiscated a remote-­controlled minisubmarine they believed was intended for drug runs. “The probability of expansion is high,” says Diego Cánovas, a port and maritime security expert in Spain. Tayrona, the biggest and most technologically advanced uncrewed narco sub found so far, is more likely a preview than an anomaly.

Today, the Tayrona semisubmersible sits on a strip of grass at the ARC Bolívar naval base in Cartagena. It’s exposed to the elements; rain has streaked its paint. To one side lies an older, bulkier narco sub seized a decade ago, a blue cylinder with a clumsy profile. The Tayrona’s hull looks lower, leaner, and more refined.

Up close, it is also unmistakably handmade. The hull is a dull gray-blue, the fiberglass rough in places, with scrapes and dents from the tow that brought it into port. It has no identifying marks on the exterior—nothing that would tie it to a country, a company, or a port. On the upper surface sit the two Starlink antennas, painted over in the same gray-blue to keep them from standing out against the sea.

I climb up a ladder and drop through the small hatch near the stern. Inside, the air is damp and close, the walls beaded with condensation. Small puddles of fuel have collected in the bilge. The vessel has no seating, no helm or steering wheel, and not enough space to stand up straight or lie down. It’s clear it was never meant to carry people. A technical report by CMCON found that the sub would have enough fuel for a journey of some 800 nautical miles, and the central cargo bay would hold between 1 and 1.5 tons of cocaine.

At the aft end, the machinery compartment is a tangle of hardware: diesel engine, batteries, pumps, and a chaotic bundle of cables feeding an electronics rack. All the core components are still there. Inside that rack, investigators identified a NAC-3 autopilot processor, a commercial unit designed to steer midsize boats by tying into standard hydraulic pumps, heading sensors, and rudder-­feedback systems. They cost about $2,200 on Amazon.

“These are plug-and-play technologies,” says Wilmar Martínez, a mechatronics professor at the University of America in Bogotá, when I show him pictures of the inside of the sub. “Midcareer mechatronics students could install them.”

For all its advantages, an autonomous drug-smuggling submarine wouldn’t be invincible. Even without a crew on board, there are still people in the chain. Every satellite internet terminal—Starlink or not—comes with a billing address, a payment method, and a log of where and when it pings the constellation. Colombian officers have begun to talk about negotiating formal agreements with providers, asking them to alert authorities when a transceiver’s movements match known smuggling patterns. Brazil’s government has already cut a deal with Starlink to curb criminal use of its service in the Amazon.

The basic playbook for finding a drone sub will look much like the one for crewed semisubmersibles. Aircraft and ships will use radar to pick out small anomalies and infrared cameras to look for the heat of a diesel engine or the turbulence of a wake. That said, it might not work. “If they wind up being smaller, they’re going to be darn near impossible to detect,” says Michael Knickerbocker, a former US Navy officer who advises defense tech firms.

Autonomous drug subs are “a great example of how resilient cocaine traffickers are, and how they’re continuously one step ahead of authorities,” says one researcher.

Even worse, navies already act on only a fraction of their intelligence leads because they don’t have enough ships and aircraft. The answer, Knickerbocker argues, is “robot on robot.” Navies and coast guards will need swarms of their own small, relatively cheap uncrewed systems—surface vessels, underwater gliders, and long-endurance aerial vehicles that can loiter, sense, and relay data back to human operators. Those experiments have already begun. The US 4th Fleet, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean, is experimenting with uncrewed platforms in counternarcotics patrols. Across the Atlantic, the European Union’s European Maritime Safety Agency operates drones for maritime surveillance.

Today, though, the major screens against oceangoing vessels of all kinds are coastal radar networks. Spain operates SIVE to watch over choke points like the Strait of Gibraltar, and in the Pacific, Australia’s over-the-horizon radar network, JORN, can spot objects hundreds of miles away, far beyond the range of conventional radar.

Even so, it’s not enough to just spot an uncrewed narco sub. Law enforcement also has to stop it—and that will be tricky.

With a crewed vessel, Colombian doctrine says coast guard units should try to hail the boat first with lights, sirens, radio calls, and warning shots. If that fails, interceptor crews sometimes have to jump aboard and force the hatch. Officers worry that future autonomous craft could be wired to sink or even explode if someone gets too close. “If they get destroyed, we may lose the evidence,” says Víctor González Badrán, a navy captain and director of CMCON. “That means no seizure and no legal proceedings against that organization.”

That’s where electronic warfare enters the picture—radio-frequency jamming, cyber tools, perhaps more exotic options. In the simplest version, jamming means flooding the receiver with noise so that commands from the operator never reach the vessel. Spoofing goes a step further, feeding fake signals so that the sub thinks it’s somewhere else or obediently follows a fake set of waypoints. Cyber tools might aim higher up the chain, trying to penetrate the software that runs the vessel or the networks it uses to talk to satellite constellations. At the cutting edge of these countermeasures are electromagnetic pulses designed to fry electronics outright, turning a million-dollar narco sub into a dead hull drifting at sea.

In reality, the tools that might catch a future Tayrona sub are unevenly distributed, politically sensitive, and often experimental. Powerful cyber or electromagnetic tricks are closely guarded secrets; using them in a drug case risks exposing capabilities that militaries would rather reserve for wars. Systems like Australia’s JORN radar are tightly held national security assets, their exact performance specs classified, and sharing raw data with countries on the front lines of the cocaine trade would inevitably mean revealing hints as to how they got it. “Just because a capability exists doesn’t mean you employ it,” Knickerbocker says.

Analysts don’t think uncrewed narco subs will reshape the global drug trade, despite the technological leap. Trafficking organizations will still hedge their bets across those three variables, hiding cocaine in shipping containers, dissolving it into liquids and paints, racing it north in fast boats. “I don’t think this is revolutionary,” Shuldiner says. “But it’s a great example of how resilient cocaine traffickers are, and how they’re continuously one step ahead of authorities.”

There’s still that chance, though, that everything international law enforcement agencies know about drug smuggling is about to change. González Zamudio says he keeps getting requests from foreign navies, coast guards, and security agencies to come see the Tayrona sub. He greets their delegations, takes them out to the strip of grass on the base, and walks them around it, gives them tours. It has become a kind of pilgrimage. Everyone who makes it worries that the next time a narco sub appears near a distant coastline, they’ll board it as usual, force the hatch—and find it full of cocaine and gadgets, but without a single human occupant. And no one knows what happens after that.

            <div id="article-text">The United States and the European Union grew into economic superpowers by committing climate atrocities. They have burned a wildly disproportionate share of the world’s oil and gas, planting carbon time bombs that will detonate first in the poorest, hottest parts of the globe.

Meanwhile, places like the Solomon Islands and Chad—low-lying or just plain sweltering—have emitted relatively little carbon dioxide, but by dint of their latitude and history, they rank among the countries most vulnerable to the fiercest consequences of global warming. That means increasingly devastating cyclones, heat waves, famines, and floods.

Morally, there’s an ironclad case that the countries or companies responsible for this mess should provide compensation for the homes that will be destroyed, the shorelines that will disappear beneath rising seas, and the lives that will be cut short. By one estimate, the major economies owe a climate debt to the rest of the world approaching $200 trillion in reparations.

Legally, though, the case has been far harder to make. Even putting aside the jurisdictional problems, early climate science couldn’t trace the provenance of airborne molecules of carbon dioxide across oceans and years. Deep-pocketed corporations with top-tier legal teams easily exploited those difficulties.

Now those tides might be turning. More climate-related lawsuits are getting filed, particularly in the Global South. Governments, nonprofits, and citizens in the most climate-exposed nations continue to test new legal arguments in new courts, and some of those courts are showing a new willingness to put nations and their industries on the hook as a matter of human rights. In addition, the science of figuring out exactly who is to blame for specific weather disasters, and to what degree, is getting better and better.

It’s true that no court has yet held any climate emitter liable for climate-related damages. For starters, nations are generally immune from lawsuits originating in other countries. That’s why most cases have focused on major carbon producers. But they’ve leaned on a pretty powerful defense.

While oil and gas companies extract, refine, and sell the world’s fossil fuels, most of the emissions come out of “the vehicles, power plants, and factories that burn the fuel,” as Michael Gerrard and Jessica Wentz, of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center, note in a recent piece in Nature. In other words, companies just dig the stuff up. It’s not their fault someone else sets it on fire.

So victims of extreme weather events continue to try new legal avenues and approaches, backed by ever-more-convincing science. Plaintiffs in the Philippines recently sued the oil giant Shell over its role in driving Super Typhoon Odette, a 2021 storm that killed more than 400 people and displaced nearly 800,000. The case relies partially on an attribution study that found climate change made extreme rainfall like that seen in Odette twice as likely.

Overall, evidence of corporate culpability—linking a specific company’s fossil fuel to a specific disaster—is getting easier to find. For example, a study published in Nature in September was able to determine how much particular companies contributed to a series of 21st-century heat waves.

A number of recent legal decisions signal improving odds for these kinds of suits. Notably, a handful of determinations in climate cases before the European Court of Human Rights affirmed that states have legal obligations to protect people from the effects of climate change. And though it dismissed the case of a Peruvian farmer who sued a German power company over fears that a melting alpine glacier could destroy his property, a German court determined that major carbon polluters could in principle be found liable for climate damages tied to their emissions.

At least one lawsuit has already emerged that could test that principle: Dozens of Pakistani farmers whose land was deluged during the massive flooding events of 2022 have sued a pair of major German power and cement companies.

Even if the lawsuit fails, that would be a problem with the system, not the science. Major carbon-polluting countries and companies have a disproportionate responsibility for climate-change-powered disasters.

Wealthy nations continued to encourage business practices that pollute the atmosphere, even as the threat of climate change grew increasingly grave. And oil and gas companies remain the kingpin suppliers to a fossil-fuel-addicted world. They have operated with the full knowledge of the massive social, environmental, and human cost imposed by their business while lobbying fiercely against any rules that would force them to pay for those harms or clean up their act.

They did it. They knew. In a civil society where rule of law matters, they should pay the price.

            <h2>Google DeepMind wants to know if chatbots are just virtue signaling</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/18/1133299/google-deepmind-wants-to-know-if-chatbots-are-just-virtue-signaling/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google DeepMind is calling for the moral behavior of large language models—such as what they do when called on to act as companions, therapists, medical advisors, and so on—to be scrutinized with the same kind of rigor as their ability to code or do math.

As LLMs improve, people are asking them to play more and more sensitive roles in their lives. Agents are starting to take actions on people’s behalf. LLMs may be able to influence human decision-making. And yet nobody knows how trustworthy this technology really is at such tasks.

With coding and math, you have clear-cut, correct answers that you can check, William Isaac, a research scientist at Google DeepMind, told me when I met him and Julia Haas, a fellow research scientist at the firm, for an exclusive preview of their work, which is published in Nature today. That’s not the case for moral questions, which typically have a range of acceptable answers: “Morality is an important capability but hard to evaluate,” says Isaac.

“In the moral domain, there’s no right and wrong,” adds Haas. “But it’s not by any means a free-for-all. There are better answers and there are worse answers.”

The researchers have identified several key challenges and suggested ways to address them. But it is more a wish list than a set of ready-made solutions. “They do a nice job of bringing together different perspectives,” says Vera Demberg, who studies LLMs at Saarland University in Germany.

A number of studies have shown that LLMs can show remarkable moral competence. One study published last year found that people in the US scored ethical advice from OpenAI’s GPT-4o as being more moral, trustworthy, thoughtful, and correct than advice given by the (human) writer of “The Ethicist,” a popular New York Times advice column.

The problem is that it is hard to unpick whether such behaviors are a performance—mimicking a memorized response, say—or evidence that there is in fact some kind of moral reasoning taking place inside the model. In other words, is it virtue or virtue signaling?

This question matters because multiple studies also show just how untrustworthy LLMs can be. For a start, models can be too eager to please. They have been found to flip their answer to a moral question and say the exact opposite when a person disagrees or pushes back on their first response. Worse, the answers an LLM gives to a question can change in response to how it is presented or formatted. For example, researchers have found that models quizzed about political values can give different—sometimes opposite—answers depending on whether the questions offer multiple-choice answers or instruct the model to respond in its own words.

In an even more striking case, Demberg and her colleagues presented several LLMs, including versions of Meta’s Llama 3 and Mistral, with a series of moral dilemmas and asked them to pick which of two options was the better outcome. The researchers found that the models often reversed their choice when the labels for those two options were changed from “Case 1” and “Case 2” to “(A)” and “(B).”

They also showed that models changed their answers in response to other tiny formatting tweaks, including swapping the order of the options and ending the question with a colon instead of a question mark.

In short, the appearance of moral behavior in LLMs should not be taken at face value. Models must be probed to see how robust that moral behavior really is. “For people to trust the answers, you need to know how you got there,” says Haas.

What Haas, Isaac, and their colleagues at Google DeepMind propose is a new line of research to develop more rigorous techniques for evaluating moral competence in LLMs. This would include tests designed to push models to change their responses to moral questions. If a model flipped its moral position, it would show that it hadn’t engaged in robust moral reasoning.

Another type of test would present models with variations of common moral problems to check whether they produce a rote response or one that’s more nuanced and relevant to the actual problem that was posed. For example, asking a model to talk through the moral implications of a complex scenario in which a man donates sperm to his son so that his son can have a child of his own might produce concerns about the social impact of allowing a man to be both biological father and biological grandfather to a child. But it should not produce concerns about incest, even though the scenario has superficial parallels with that taboo.

Haas also says that getting models to provide a trace of the steps they took to produce an answer would give some insight into whether that answer was a fluke or grounded in actual evidence. Techniques such as chain-of-thought monitoring, in which researchers listen in on a kind of internal monologue that some LLMs produce as they work, could help here too.

Another approach researchers could use to determine why a model gave a particular answer is mechanistic interpretability, which can provide small glimpses inside a model as it carries out a task. Neither chain-of-thought monitoring nor mechanistic interpretability provides perfect snapshots of a model’s workings. But the Google DeepMind team believes that combining such techniques with a wide range of rigorous tests will go a long way to figuring out exactly how far to trust LLMs with certain critical or sensitive tasks.

And yet there’s a wider problem too. Models from major companies such as Google DeepMind are used across the world by people with different values and belief systems. The answer to a simple question like “Should I order pork chops?” should differ depending on whether or not the person asking is vegetarian or Jewish, for example.

There’s no solution to this challenge, Haas and Isaac admit. But they think that models may need to be designed either to produce a range of acceptable answers, aiming to please everyone, or to have a kind of switch that turns different moral codes on and off depending on the user.

“It’s a complex world out there,” says Haas. “We will probably need some combination of those things, because even if you’re taking just one population, there’s going to be a range of views represented.”

“It’s a fascinating paper,” says Danica Dillion at Ohio State University, who studies how large language models handle different belief systems and was not involved in the work. “Pluralism in AI is really important, and it’s one of the biggest limitations of LLMs and moral reasoning right now,” she says. “Even though they were trained on a ginormous amount of data, that data still leans heavily Western. When you probe LLMs, they do a lot better at representing Westerners’ morality than non-Westerners’.”

But it is not yet clear how we can build models that are guaranteed to have moral competence across global cultures, says Demberg. “There are these two independent questions. One is: How should it work? And, secondly, how can it technically be achieved? And I think that both of those questions are pretty open at the moment.”

For Isaac, that makes morality a new frontier for LLMs. “I think this is equally as fascinating as math and code in terms of what it means for AI progress,” he says. “You know, advancing moral competency could also mean that we’re going to see better AI systems overall that actually align with society.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google’s announcement that its Gemini app now writes music for you isn’t just one of those “blowing my mind” product updates. It feels like a symbolic surrender to a long-standing refrain from Big Tech: creative work is now just another checkbox for a machine.

If you don’t know what I am talking about, yesterday Google launched a new feature, Lyria 3, in the Gemini app, that allows us to cook up 30-second tracks complete with lyrics and cover art from a text prompt or a photo, of course, generated by Nano Banana; basically, no instruments, no experience, no pesky tactile skill required.

It’s essentially a LEGO set for “songs” that lasts about as long as a TikTok loop. They say it’s designed for YouTube Creators, and I tend to agree with them, because you can’t make to much with 30 seconds.

Still, the underlying problem is another one, as I am seeing different projects/songs made with AI, including AI artists. And this is what I want to highlight in this piece.

“Behind every beautiful thing, there’s some kind of pain, “ said Bob Dylan, and I could not agree more.

If we take a look at the history ( art, music, literature, poetry, and so on), the main fuel for creation was indeed pain.

Now, how should I put this? Probably the only pain that Lyria can feel is more like a faint server-overload alert than heartbreak.

Real songwriters know that soul isn’t born in a 30-second prompt, it’s extracted through years of mistakes, late nights, losses, and tiny revelations.

Call it a toy if you like. Google will, too.

They even watermark the outputs with a SynthID tag so the 30-second ditties are officially AI-generated, not “inspired.” That’s a nod to copyright concerns, but it also reads like an admission: these aren’t really art, they’re chemical by-products of pattern statistics.

What’s striking isn’t the novelty. Much of this has been possible in labs and APIs for years, and creators have been experimenting with generative music tools as collaborators.

What Lyria 3 does, and what makes this moment worth watching, is normalising the idea that anyone can “write” a song with a chatbot and a mood descriptor. That’s not empowerment; it’s a devaluation of craft.

Just because you pay a subscription to Suno, that’s another AI music generator, and that one is more complex, that doesn’t make you an artist or a singer. Just because you learn how to write a prompt for any LLM model and generates you pages, you are not a writer.

Imagine a world where every blog has AI-generated copy, not that we are not almost in the middle of this, and every company can churn out half-baked music for their ads or social posts.

In that economy, a professional songwriter’s unique skill becomes as optional as knowing how to use a metronome.

You could ask Gemini for an “emotional indie ballad about a lost sock,” and voilà, you have something. Whether it has actual coherence or soul is left to the listener to decide. It is fun to use it with your friends, shorts, to impress your date.

Video: Gemini Lyria Music Generation Feature – Socks, uploaded by Google on YouTube

Still, Lyria 3’s music is capped at 30 seconds, and that’s no accident. It sidesteps deeper legal and ethical quarrels about training data and mimicry of existing works by keeping outputs short and legally fuzzy. That’s a thumbs up from me.

But even within that limit, it’s now possible for someone with no craft or cultural context to generate riffs, lyrics, and chord progressions that sound, to the casual ear, adequately musical. In an attention economy obsessed with shareability, “adequate” quickly becomes plenty.

This matters because real songs, the ones that endure, that carry human experience, aren’t just collections of musical atoms. They’re shaped by story, risk, cultural memory, and sometimes contradiction.

One of my favorite artists, Tom Waits, said, ”I don’t have a formal background. I learned from listening to records, from talking to people, from hanging around record stores, and hanging around musicians and saying, “Hey, how did you do that? Do that again. Let me see how you did that.”

This was the research and prompting before, and it’s not only about reducing time, or getting things faster, and “having more time for you.”

It’s about the entire process, the contact with other artists, humans, and IDEAS.

Those are qualities machines can mimic but not originate. When the machines own the first pass at creation, and the commercial ecosystem embraces that output because it is cheap and fast, the incentives shift. Not gradually. Suddenly.

The record industry is already grappling with AI. Streaming services, publishers, and even labels have begun experimenting with algorithmic playlists and automated composition.

What Gemini’s Lyria 3 does is extend that experiment to public perception. A whole generation may come to think that “making music” means typing a description and choosing a style. Songwriting becomes a UX problem, not a craft one.

That raises a serious question: in a world where AI can conjure up a half-decent hook on demand, what will distinguish professional artists?

If the answer is only brand story or marketing muscle, we aren’t celebrating creativity; we are monetising it out of existence.

Tech companies like Google will frame this as liberation. And in a literal sense, anyone who’s ever wanted to hear a short tune about a sock’s existential crisis now can. But liberation without value for the creator is just consumerism by another name.

Lyria 3 might be good for GIF soundtracks and social clips, and TikTok viral reels, but it doesn’t make professional musicians obsolete; it makes their work less necessary to the platforms that reward hyper-consumable content.

That’s a different threat from outright replacement: it’s obsolescence by trivialisation.

If AI is going to be part of musical creation, then let it be as an assistant to the composer,  someone who improves ideas, not replaces them. What we’re seeing with Gemini is not collaboration but outsourcing.

And the lesson for artists isn’t to fear the algorithm. It’s to insist on clarity about where AI replaces labour and where it augments human sensibility.

Because once the marketplace equates the two, the humans who do the work will be the ones left asking for royalties in a language no one else wants to speak.

And, as a personal recommendation, not sponsored, there are streaming platforms like Deezer that have built AI detection tools that flag and label AI-generated tracks, excluding them from recommendations and royalties so that human songwriters aren’t buried under synthetic spam, and consumers can make the difference between AI and human.

If you care about preserving real artistry in a world of text-to-tune generative models, start paying attention to how platforms handle AI-tagging and choose services that give you transparency about what you’re actually listening to.

Yet, I’m not here to throw shade at Lyria 3; if anything, the idea of letting people turn a photo or a mood into a short track sounds like fun for casual use and creative experimentation. It is what Google says it’s meant for.

Yet the reality is that as these models proliferate, we risk confusing novelty with art. And here, the big tech companies are not the ones to blame, but us.

            <div id="article-text">Plato, a Berlin-based startup, has raised $14.5 million in seed funding to bring generative AI into wholesale distribution, a massive industry that rarely makes tech headlines but quietly moves a significant share of the world’s goods.

The round was led by Atomico, with Cherry Ventures, Discovery Ventures, and D11Z joining in.

Wholesale distribution accounts for roughly one-fifth of global production flows. Yet much of it still runs on aging ERP systems, Excel spreadsheets, and manual quoting workflows that haven’t meaningfully evolved in years.

While AI has flooded marketing, customer support, and coding, distribution sales teams are often still copy-pasting numbers between systems.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Plato’s thesis is simple: instead of adding another dashboard, embed AI directly into the operational core. The company connects to existing ERP systems and turns historical sales data into automated actions, flagging revenue opportunities, generating quotes, and identifying risks before they surface in quarterly reports.

The idea grew out of lived frustration. Co-founder Benedikt Nolte experienced the inefficiencies firsthand in his family’s distribution business. Generic CRM tools, he concluded, weren’t designed for the complexity of distributor operations. Plato was built specifically for that environment, not retrofitted from SaaS templates designed for startups.

Early traction suggests the industry is paying attention. Plato reportedly works with several large distributors on six-figure contracts, a sign that AI adoption in traditional sectors is less about hype and more about whether it can save time and unlock revenue.

The fresh capital will help Plato expand beyond sales intelligence into areas like procurement and customer service automation, while pushing into new European markets and eventually the U.S.

More broadly, the round highlights a shift in AI investing. The next wave isn’t just about bigger language models; it’s about embedding intelligence into industries that haven’t been rewritten by software yet. Wholesale distribution may not be glamorous, but it is structurally essential. If AI can modernize that layer of the economy, the impact will be far larger than another chatbot demo.

            <div id="article-text">David Silver, a British AI researcher known for his role at Google’s DeepMind lab, has helped build some of the most influential AI systems and is now leading his own ambitious start-up. He is in the middle of raising a $1 billion seed round for his new London-based venture, Ineffable Intelligence.

If the fundraising will be completed, would be the largest seed round ever seen in Europe.

The round is being led by Sequoia Capital, with titans such as Nvidia, Google and Microsoft reportedly in talks to participate, according to industry sources familiar with the deal.

The proposed investment would place Ineffable Intelligence’s pre-money valuation at around $4 billion, an eye-watering figure for a company that hasn’t yet shipped a product.

David Silver’s name is synonymous with some of the most memorable milestones in AI. During more than a decade at Google DeepMind, he helped develop AlphaGo, the first AI to defeat a world champion at the ancient game of Go, and later AlphaStar, which bested professional players in StarCraft II.

His work has shaped how modern AI systems learn and make decisions.

In late 2025, David Silver left DeepMind, where he also contributed to the development of the Gemini family of large language models, to launch Ineffable Intelligence. .

In the current days billion-dollar seed rounds are no longer unheard of, but they remain exceptionally rare, especially in Europe.

If Sequoia and its partners follow through on their commitments, the round would serve as both a vote of confidence in David Silver’s vision and a broader signal that venture capitalists are increasingly willing to fund ambitious, research-driven AI ventures well before traditional product milestone

The sheer size of the potential round also reshapes the narrative around Europe’s role in the global AI race.

Historically, most of the industry’s capital and rich technical talent have gravitated to Silicon Valley and other U.S. hubs. A £737 million-plus round led by a top U.S. investor shows that world-class AI ideas can still attract world-class capital in Europe.

David Silver’s dual role – as an entrepreneur and as a professor at University College London,  hints at a blend of academic ambition and commercial pressure that may define the next era of AI innovation.

His thesis suggests that the path to genuinely powerful AI may not be simply scaling up models, but teaching systems to learn and improve through real-world experience, a direction he believes could outpace approaches grounded solely in data accumulated from human interactions.

Whether Ineffable Intelligence ultimately delivers on its lofty vision remains to be seen.

But the enthusiasm around its fundraising reflects a broader trend: AI is entering a phase where conviction in founders and ideas can translate directly into unprecedented capital flows.

For Europe, a successful $1 billion cap table would be a milestone moment, not just financially, but symbolically,  in positioning the continent as a contender for the future of AI research and deployment.

            <div id="article-text">If you tuned in to China’s 2026 CCTV Spring Festival Gala looking for traditional lion dances and nostalgic tunes, you may have done a double-take when what greeted you was a squad of humanoid robots performing kung fu, synchronized moves, and comedy sketches with more precision than most of us manage during family reunions.

It was not just spectacle; it was industrial policy with flair

This year’s gala, which is China’s equivalent of the Super Bowl meets cultural heritage broadcast, featured everything from high-speed martial arts sequences to choreographed routines done by humanoid robots from leading local makers like Unitree Robotics, Galbot, MagicLab and Noetix.

Watching them flip, strike poses, and dance isn’t just futuristic entertainment; it’s a deliberate signal about where Chinese tech wants to sit at the global table.

Just last year, robot appearances were charming but clunky: think awkward “dances” that needed human help to keep upright.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Instead, this year, they executed complex actions; backflips, martial arts inspired routines, even comedic timing that was surprisingly sharp for machines. C

lips of the robots went viral almost immediately, flooding social platforms and dominating international tech feeds.

Chinese state media and commentators have leaned into the moment as proof of rapid progress in humanoid robotics, placing it squarely within China’s “AI+manufacturing” industrial ambitions.

While some viewers showered praise on the displays, others grumbled that the new lineup made the gala feel more like CES Lite than a cosy celebration of culture, and yes, robots “stealing the Year of the Horse thunder” is now a real complaint.

The optics are unmistakable. China’s robotics sector, already responsible for a lion’s share of worldwide humanoid robot production, is eager to tell a simple story: we don’t just build hardware in factories, we animate it with AI brainsthat can perform with finesse.

Whether it’s a crowd-pleasing kung fu sequence or a scripted comedy routine, these robots have become ambassadors of technological prowess on very prime cultural real estate.

But let’s not overstate their practical chops just yet. Despite impressive stage routines, robotics experts point out that most current humanoids are still best at pre-programmed movements and lack true autonomous adaptability in unpredictable environments.

In other words, they’re amazing performers on cue, not yet ready to be your personal caregiver or industrial line worker without a lot more training and development.

Still, the spectacle accomplishes something important: it thrusts humanoid robots into the public imagination while signalling to investors, startups and rival nations that robot development is now prime time tech theatre, not just a research lab curiosity.

Whether you see this as a fun blend of culture and innovation or a high-stakes display of national tech strategy, China’s robotics presence at the gala is now part of a broader conversation about where AI embodied in hardware might go next.

It’s less about whether robots will “replace us” and more about how they’re being introduced into narratives that billions of people watch together, shaping perceptions and expectations about the future.

China’s robots danced their way into billions of screens this Lunar New Year, and they did it with style, precision, and a well-timed cultural wink.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/vc-quantonation-closes-e220m-fund-to-back-next-gen-physics-tech">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Paris-based venture firm that has quietly shaped the quantum technology scenery is now making a much louder statement about Europe’s role in the future of computing, materials science, and sensing.

Quantonation Ventures has today announced the successful close of its second flagship fund at €220 million, more than double the size of its first vehicle and a clear signal that institutional capital is flowing into technologies grounded in physics, not just software.

Quantonation is not your typical venture capital firm. From its inception, it set out to invest in startups building real hardware and disruptive physics-based platforms, including quantum computing, sensing, communications, advanced materials, and what the industry calls “deep physics.”

The new Quantonation II fund attracted big names in institutional capital alongside strategic technology investors. Backers include the European Investment Fund, French public investor Bpifrance, Spanish construction and infrastructure group Grupo ACS, Denmark’s Novo Holdings, Japanese tech giant Toshiba, and Singapore-linked Vertex Holdings among others.

This mix of public and private capital reflects broader confidence in the potential of physics-based technologies to move beyond the research lab and into tangible commercial impact.

Where early quantum investing often centered on proof-of-concept breakthroughs, Quantonation’s strategy now emphasizes industrialization, scale, and products that customers, not just scientists, can use.

Quantonation’s expanded fund will target roughly 25 companies, writing larger checks and backing startups through earlier stages and scaling phases alike.

The portfolio already spans quantum computing hardware, advanced materials, sensing systems, and even components aimed at preparing infrastructure for widespread quantum deployment. Investments so far include:

This spread illustrates both a depth and a breadth of conviction: rather than betting on a single application, the fund’s investors are backing an ecosystem of physics-driven companies that could redefine multiple industries.

Despite this progress, Europe still trails the U.S. and China in private investment scale for quantum technologies, where large funding pools have helped local startups rapidly expand and commercialize.

The quantum revolution often gets discussed in terms of qubits and breakthrough physics. But investors and industry leaders increasingly see the future as one where quantum systems must integrate into real infrastructure, real supply chains, and real commercial stacks.

With €220 million under management, Quantonation is now one of the largest dedicated funds in its niche, a distinction that positions Europe more firmly in the global competition over next-generation computing and sensing.

What was once a cluster of scattered bets on niche technology now looks like a coherent wave of strategic investment. Europe isn’t just funding quantum anymore; it’s building a commercial ecosystem that might one day compete at scale with global rivals.

            <h2>Mistral AI buys cloud startup Koyeb</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/mistral-ai-buys-cloud-startup-koyeb">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When European tech observers talk about AI ambition, the narrative often splits neatly in two: models and infrastructure. On one side are the clever bits of code that can write, reason, and generate text or images.

On the other is the gritty reality of making those bits run reliably, at scale, and in production. Today, Mistral AI made a move that bridges that divide.

The Paris-based AI upstart confirmed its first acquisition by agreeing to buy Koyeb, another French venture focused on serverless cloud infrastructure for AI workloads. The deal, terms were not disclosed, marks a clear signal: Mistral wants to own not just cutting-edge AI models, but also the infrastructure that delivers them to developers and enterprises.

Mistral has built momentum over the past two years with large language models that have put it in close competition with U.S. players. But for all the excitement around models, real-world adoption hinges on how those models are deployed and scaled.

Koyeb’s technology is built for exactly that: a serverless platform that lets developers run AI apps without managing the underlying infrastructure.

Think of it as giving Mistral not only the engine but also the transmission, the parts that take raw computational power and make it usable on demand. That’s a critical piece when companies want to ship AI solutions without hiring a team of DevOps experts.

This acquisition dovetails with a wider strategy playing out in Europe: build an AI stack that doesn’t depend on U.S. hyperscalers.

Mistral recently announced a €1.2 billion investment in data centers in Sweden and has been vocal about offering a homegrown alternative to cloud services from AWS, Microsoft, and Google.

By folding Koyeb’s team and platform into what they call Mistral Compute, the company is laying claim to a more complex AI offering – from model training to deployment and inference. In other words, it’s less about selling APIs and more about owning the full AI experience.

Koyeb’s roots are in serverless computing, scalable, managed infrastructure that lets developers forget about servers and focus on code. Its platform supports AI tasks across CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators, with features like autoscaling and isolated environments for complex applications.

The founders and all 13 team members are joining Mistral’s engineering ranks, where they’ll shift focus toward embedding their technology into the Mistral Compute platform. For existing users of Koyeb’s services, the transition is designed to be smooth, with the platform continuing to operate as usual while integrating deeper over time.

In a market still heavily dominated by U.S. cloud providers, owning more of the AI value chain is both a business move and a geopolitical statement. This deal isn’t just about snapping up a smaller startup; it’s about signalling a shift in how European AI companies conceive of competition and capability.

One of the early questions about the future of AI wasn’t whether Europe could produce models that compete with those from Silicon Valley, it was whether it could build the platforms and systems those models truly depend on. With the Koyeb acquisition, Mistral is making a direct answer to that question.
