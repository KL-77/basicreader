            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SteamOS’s slow march across the Windows-dominated PC gaming landscape is continuing to creep along. At CES this week, Lenovo announced it will launch a version of last year’s high-priced, high-powered Legion Go 2 handheld with Valve’s gaming-focused, Linux-based OS pre-installed starting in June. And there are some intriguing signs from Valve that SteamOS could come to non-AMD devices in the not-too-distant future as well.

A new SteamOS-powered Legion Go 2 isn’t exactly shocking news given how things have been going in the world of PC gaming handhelds. Lenovo became the first non-Valve hardware maker to embrace the Windows alternative when it announced a SteamOS-compatible version of the lower-end Legion Go S almost exactly a year ago. When that version hit the market last spring, Ars testing found it actually performed better than the Windows-based version of the same hardware on many popular games.

Valve has also been working behind the scenes to expand SteamOS’s footprint beyond its own hardware. After rolling out the SteamOS Compatible software label last May, SteamOS version 3.7 offered support for manual installation on AMD-powered handhelds like the ROG Ally and the original Legion Go.

Adding the upgraded Legion Go 2 to that list will give those preferring SteamOS an option to buy in to beefier, pre-built handheld hardware without crafting their own Steam Machine from component parts. Like its Windows-based cousin, the new Legion Go 2 will come equipped with a Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor (like the ROG Ally X), 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, and an 8.8-inch 1920×1200 OLED screen. It has a hefty starting price of $1,199.

Even as SteamOS slowly spreads across the AMD-powered hardware landscape, the OS continues to be limited by a lack of compatibility with the wide world of Arm devices. That could change in the near future, though, as Valve’s upcoming Steam Frame VR headset will sport a new version of SteamOS designed specifically for the headset’s Arm-based hardware.

Over time, Valve sees that kind of support expanding to other Arm-based devices, too. “This is already fully open source, so you could download it and run SteamOS, now that we will be releasing SteamOS for Arm, you could have gaming on any Arm device,” Valve Engineer Jeremy Selan told PC Gamer in November. “This is the first one. We’re very excited about it.”

It’s an especially exciting prospect when you consider the wide range of Arm-based Android gaming handhelds that currently exist across the price and performance spectrum. While emulators like Fex can technically let players access Steam games on those kinds of handhelds, official Arm support for SteamOS could lead to a veritable Cambrain explosion of hardware options with native SteamOS support.

Valve seems aware of this potential, too. “There’s a lot of price points and power consumption points where Arm-based chipsets are doing a better job of serving the market,” Valve’s Pierre-Louis Griffais told The Verge last month. “When you get into lower power, anything lower than Steam Deck, I think you’ll find that there’s an Arm chip that maybe is competitive with x86 offerings in that segment. We’re pretty excited to be able to expand PC gaming to include all those options instead of being arbitrarily restricted to a subset of the market.”

That’s great news for fans of PC-based gaming handhelds, just as the announcement of Valve’s Steam Machine will provide a convenient option for SteamOS access on the living room TV. For desktop PC gamers, though, rigs sporting Nvidia GPUs might remain the final frontier for SteamOS in the foreseeable future. “With Nvidia, the integration of open-source drivers is still quite nascent,” Griffais told Frandroid about a year ago. “There’s still a lot of work to be done on that front… So it’s a bit complicated to say that we’re going to release this version when most people wouldn’t have a good experience.”</div>

            <h2>Japanese nuclear plant operator fabricated seismic risk data</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/japanese-nuclear-plant-operator-fabricated-seismic-risk-data/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority announced that it is halting the relicensing process for two reactors at the Hamaoka plant after revelations that the operator fabricated seismic hazard data. Japan has been slowly reactivating its extensive nuclear power plant collection after it was shut down following the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. The latest scandal is especially shocking, given that the Hamaoka plant is located on the coast near an active subduction fault—just as Fukushima Daiichi is.

The Nuclear Regulation Authority was reportedly alerted by a whistleblower in February of last year, but the issue became public this week when the regulators halted an evaluation process that could have led to a reactor restart at Hamaoka. This prompted the company that operates the plants, the Chubu Electric Power Co., to issue a press release describing in detail how the company manipulated the seismic safety data.

Based on an English translation, it appears that seismic risks were evaluated at least in part by scaling up the ground motion using data from smaller earthquakes. This is an inexact process, so the standard approach is to create a group of 20 different upscaled earthquake motions and find the one that best represents the average among the 20.

The company now acknowledges that since 2018, its staff has been generating large collections of upscaled earthquake scenarios, choosing one from among them, and then selecting another 19 so the average would make that event appear representative. The company does not mention how this process affected risk analysis, but it’s probably safe to assume that it was chosen specifically to make any risks seem more tolerable.

Given Japan’s slow and hesitant process of reactivating its fleet of nuclear plants, the decision to fudge safety evaluations is striking. But it’s especially notable given the location of the Hamaoka plant: directly on the east coast of Japan. That places it closer to the subduction zone off the coast that generates the country’s occasionally catastrophic earthquakes. It also places the site at risk of the sort of tsunami that caused the Fukushima plant to melt down. Although the falsified data doesn’t involve tsunami risks, you might expect that the company would be especially cautious about getting its safety data right.

In response to the revelation, the Chubu Electric Power Co. has appointed a committee of external lawyers to fully detail what was done and how it happened. And, as mentioned above, the country’s nuclear watchdog agency has terminated the safety evaluation that would need to be completed before the plant could be brought back into service. At this point, it’s not clear when this process might be restarted, much less when it might result in a restart of the reactor.

Its timing is also less than ideal for the Nuclear Regulation Authority, which is trying to regain public trust after accusations of regulatory capture that allowed major safety risks to go unrecognized. The day prior, Bloomberg reported that a staff member at the Nuclear Regulation Authority lost a phone carrying classified information while traveling through China.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The electric vehicle transition might not be moving ahead with the same gusto it showed in the early 2020s, but it’s still happening. According to Deloitte’s 2026 Global Automotive Consumer Study, 7 percent of US car buyers want an electric vehicle for their next car. While that might sound rather meager, it’s a 40 percent increase from 2025’s survey, which found just 5 percent of car buyers wanted an EV.

Plain old internal combustion remains Americans’ first choice, with 61 percent telling the survey that’s how their next ride will be powered. Twenty-one percent want a hybrid, up from 20 percent last year. Just 5 percent indicated a desire for a plug-in hybrid (down from 6 percent last year), with the remaining confused souls either unsure of what to buy next (4 percent) or some other option, presumably hydrogen (1 percent).

The high demand for internal combustion engines makes the US an outlier among large car-buying markets. Fewer than half of German car buyers want another gas-powered vehicle, and that number falls to just 41 percent in China, Japan, and South Korea. But those consumers aren’t all fleeing internal combustion for battery EVs. Well, they mostly are in China, where EV demand is now 20 percent. But in Japan, only 5 percent of consumers want a battery EV, versus 37 percent indicating their next car would be a hybrid.

Deloitte conducted the survey between October and November 2025, by which time the current US government’s anti-EV policies would have come into effect. These include cancelling the clean vehicle tax credit, rolling back fuel efficiency standards, and declining to prosecute automakers that exceed existing efficiency regulations, as well as the uncertainty of capricious import tariffs. Many automakers have spent the last several years building up capacity to manufacture EVs in North America for the US market, but the return on those investments is unlikely be soon.

Americans also lag behind many of their international peers when it comes to that most important condition for buying an EV or plug-in hybrid: having somewhere to plug it in at night. Fifty-three percent of US respondents said they do not have a way to charge at home. By contrast, that number was 20 percent in Germany and just six percent in China. Only Japan—where plug-ins and EVs are even less popular than in the US—had a higher rate of no charger access at home (75 percent).

While reliable charging at one’s workplace—emphasis on reliable—can make up for not being able to charge at home, 77 percent of US car buyers said they would prefer to charge at home (with just 13 percent indicating they would prefer charging at work).

For people who haven’t yet decided to switch, an underappreciated fact is just how much more efficient an electric powertrain is compared to one that burns liquid petroleum. Ford’s experiment putting an electric powertrain into its best-selling F-150 pickup truck might have turned sour, but consider the following: The V6 truck needs more than three times as much energy to travel 300 miles as the one you plug into a wall, when you consider a gallon of gasoline contains 33.7 kWh of energy.

Among the EV-convinced, this is presumably old news. More than half—52 percent of US survey respondents—said lower fuel costs were a reason for choosing an EV, beating out concern for the environment, which ranked second at 38 percent. And between $20,000 and $49,999 appears to be the pricing sweet spot, with 24 percent looking for something in the $20,000–$34,999 band (cars like the new Nissan Leaf or the soon-reborn Chevrolet Bolt) and another 24 percent looking in the $35,000–$49,999 band, which has plenty of EVs to choose from, including Mercedes-Benz’s efficient new CLA.

Just 7 percent of those EV buyers are looking to spend more than $75,000 on their electric car, but luxury EVs abound at this price point.

Meanwhile, range and charging times remain the foremost concerns among car buyers when discussing EVs, along with the cost premium. Some other fears are ill-founded, however. Thirty-eight percent said they were concerned about the cost of eventually replacing an EV’s battery. But EV batteries are proving more durable on the road than many early adopters once believed. There’s little evidence that EVs will require costly battery replacements with any more frequency than older cars require new engines, a concern that is rarely mentioned when someone wants to buy a gas-powered machine.

One of the biggest shifts in car design and manufacturing over the past few years has been the advent of the software-defined vehicle. Until now, pretty much every electronic function in a car, from an electric window to the antilock brakes, needed its own electronic control unit. Some cars can have up to two hundred discrete ECUs, some with software dating back years.

A software-defined vehicle (or SDV) goes for a clean-sheet approach. Instead of dozens and dozens of discrete black boxes, a handful of powerful computers replaces them. One usually controls the vehicle dynamics and powertrain, a second will handle driver assists and safety tech, a third is in charge of infotainment, and a fourth handles heating, cooling, and other in-car comfort. All-new code means no more legacy cruft, and the modern electronic architecture allows for regular over-the-air bug fixes and updates that add new functionality.

Anecdotally, I’ve found that the Ars Technica audience has very little interest in reading about this seismic shift, and you’re not alone. Only 41 percent of US car buyers think SDVs are useful, and one in three says they have no use for one. The concept is even less popular in the UK, Germany, and Japan, but it has far more acceptance in China, South Korea, and Southeast Asia.

Those attitudes correlate with willingness to pay extra for OTA updates. Only 7 percent of Chinese customers said they were unwilling to pay for OTA updates, and half said a car that can be updated would be worth a 6–10 percent price premium compared to a car that can’t. In the US, 39 percent said they would not pay more for a car with OTA functionality.

There’s also much less interest in using one’s car as a digital platform for other “integrated” services. More than half (53 percent) of US car buyers have no interest in such a thing, with another 19 percent indicating neutrality on the topic. Only one in five Americans said their car was a more important digital platform than their smartphone, compared to 56 percent of Chinese car buyers. Given this reality, how much longer will automakers like Rivian and General Motors keep Apple CarPlay out of their cockpits? Neither has significant export markets for its EVs, yet both believe EV drivers will eschew their smartphones over an in-vehicle solution, presumably with some kind of recurring revenue involved.</div>

            <h2>New battery idea gets lots of power out of unusual sulfur chemistry</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/new-battery-idea-gets-lots-of-power-out-of-unusual-sulfur-chemistry/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anyone paying attention to battery research sees sulfur come up frequently. That’s mostly because sulfur is a great storage material for lithium, and it could lead to lithium batteries with impressive power densities. But sulfur can participate in a wide range of chemical reactions, which has made it difficult to prevent lithium-sulfur batteries from decaying rapidly as the sulfur forms all sorts of unwanted materials. As a result, despite decades of research, very few lithium-sulfur batteries have made it to market.

But a team of Chinese researchers has managed to turn sulfur’s complex chemistry into a strength, making it the primary electron donor in a sodium-sulfur battery that also relies on chlorine for its chemistry. The result, at least in the lab, is an impressive energy per weight with extremely inexpensive materials.

Sulfur sits immediately below oxygen on the periodic table, so you might think its chemistry would look similar. But that’s not the case. Like oxygen, it can participate in covalent bonding in biological chemistry, including in two essential amino acids. Also, like oxygen, it can accept electrons from metals, as seen in some atomically thin materials that have been studied. But it’s also willing to give electrons up, forming chemical compounds with things like chlorine and oxygen.

It’s that last feature the researchers behind the new paper are most interested in. Pure sulfur forms an eight-atom complex that can give up 32 total electrons under the right conditions. The trick was finding the right conditions.

The system had a cathode of pure sulfur and an anode that was simply a strip of aluminum that acted as a current collector. The electrolytes the researchers tested contained a lot of aluminum, sodium, and chlorine (typically something like eight Molar aluminum chloride and a 4.5 Molar solution of some sodium salt). The aluminum helps stabilize the foil at the anode, while the other two chemicals participate in the reactions that power the battery.

When the battery starts discharging, the sulfur at the cathode starts losing electrons and forming sulfur tetrachloride (SCl4), using chloride it stole from the electrolyte. As the electrons flow into the anode, they combine with the sodium, which plates onto the aluminum, forming a layer of sodium metal. Obviously, this wouldn’t work with an aqueous electrolyte, given how powerfully sodium reacts with water.

To form a working battery, the researchers separated the two electrodes using a glass fiber material. They also added a porous carbon material to the cathode to keep the sulfur tetrachloride from diffusing into the electrolyte. They used various techniques to confirm that sodium was being deposited on the aluminum and that the reaction at the cathode was occurring via sulfur dichloride intermediates. They also determined that sodium chloride was a poor source of sodium ions, as it tended to precipitate out onto some of the solid materials in the battery.

The battery was also fairly stable, surviving 1,400 cycles before suffering significant capacity decay. Higher charging rates caused capacity to decay more quickly, but the battery does a great job of holding charge when not in use, maintaining over 95 percent of its charge, even when idled for 400 days.

While the researchers provide some capacity-per-weight measurements, they don’t do so for a complete battery, focusing instead on portions of the battery, such as the sulfur or the total electrode mass.

But with both electrodes considered, the energy density can reach over 2,000 Watt-hours per kilogram. While that will undoubtedly drop with the total mass of the battery, it’s difficult to imagine that it wouldn’t outperform existing sodium-sulfur or sodium-ion batteries.

Beyond the capacity, the big benefit of the proposed system appears to be its price. Given the raw materials, the researchers estimate that their cost is roughly $5 per kilowatt-hour of capacity, which is less than a tenth of the cost of current sodium batteries.

Again, there’s no guarantee that this work can be scaled up for manufacturing in a way that keeps it competitive with current technologies. Still, if materials used in existing battery technologies become expensive, it’s reassuring to have other options to explore.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A group of 773,000-year-old hominin fossils from Morocco may shed new light on when our species branched off from the ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans.

A team of anthropologists recently examined a collection of fossil hominin jawbones, teeth, and vertebrae that belong to hominins who probably lived very close in time to our species’ last common ancestor with Neanderthals and Denisovans. They reveal a little more about a murky but important moment in our evolutionary history.

Archaeologists unearthed the 773,000-year-old bones just southwest of Casablanca in a cave aptly named Grotte à Hominidés. They’re just fragments of what used to be hominins: an adult’s lower jawbone, plus the partial lower jaw from another adult and a very young child, along with a handful of teeth and vertebrae. A hominin femur from the same layer of sediment in the cave has clear gnaw marks from sharp carnivore teeth, offering a chilling clue about how the bones got there.

The layer of sediment in which the fossils lay spanned a few thousand years on either side of a long-ago flip in the polarity of Earth’s magnetic field (periodically our planet just… does that), which happened around 773,000 years ago. It’s a slice of time not quite narrow enough to say whether the three jawbones’ owners might have known each other but narrow enough to put them all at a crucial point in the story of human evolution.

Around 1.8 million years ago, a species called Homo erectus emerged in Africa and spread around most of the world (sorry, Americas and Australia). And around a million years ago, populations of Homo erectus living in different places started to evolve along their own paths. Potentially with a few species in between, this process likely gave rise to species like Homo floresiensis and Homo luzonensis in the islands of Southeast Asia.

In Europe and Asia, we got Neanderthals and Denisovans (or Homo longi, if you prefer). And our species, Homo sapiens, evolved in Africa. We, Neanderthals, and Denisovans share a branch of the hominin family tree, with the latter two splitting off from our branch sometime between 765,000 and 550,000 years ago. That timing is what makes the Grotte à Hominidés fossils so important. At 773,000 years old, they’re all that’s left of hominins who lived right around the time of that big split between our ancestors on one path and those of Neanderthals and Denisovans on another.

Max Planck Institute anthropologist Jean-Jacques Hublin and his colleagues used micro-CT imaging to build detailed digital models of all the bones and teeth. They then compared the shapes of certain features—like the boundary between enamel and dentine in the teeth or the points on the jawbone where chewing muscles would have attached—to compare the fossils to other hominin species. Archaeologists call that technique geometric morphometry, and it helps shed light on how closely related two species might be.

In this case, the results suggest that the Grotte à Hominidés hominins were a very late model of Homo erectus, already beginning to evolve in the general direction of our species.

Anthropologists still aren’t sure what our last common ancestor with Neanderthals and Denisovans looked like or where they lived because we just don’t have many African fossils of the right age. The Casablanca fossils at least bring us closer to that pivotal moment in human evolution, and they may even suggest that it happened a little earlier than we thought, closer to 800,000 years ago (although it will take more data from more fossils to be sure).

The Casablanca fossils are about the same age as hominin fossils from Spain, which belong to a species called Homo antecessor. This species has been suggested to be a likely ancestor of Neanderthals and Denisovans. Overall, it looks like the fossils from Casablanca are a North African counterpart to Homo antecessor, with the Spanish hominins eventually leading to Neanderthals and the North African ones eventually leading to us.

Both groups share some features in their teeth and lower jaws, but they’re also different in some important ways. The teeth and chins in particular share some older features with Homo erectus. But the jaws have more newfangled features in the places where chewing muscles once attached to the bone—features that Neanderthals and our species share. On the other hand, the teeth are missing some other relatively recent features that would later help define Neanderthals (and were already beginning to show up in Homo antecessor).

Altogether, it looks like the Homo erectus populations and the Neanderthals and Denisovans had been separated for a while by the time the hominins at Grotte à Hominidés lived. But not that long. These hominins were probably part of a generation that was fairly close to that big split, near the base of our branch of the hominin family tree.

Based on ancient DNA, it looks like Neanderthals and Denisovans started evolving into two separate species sometime between 470,000 and 430,000 years ago. Meanwhile, our branch would eventually become recognizable as us sometime around 300,000 years ago, or possibly earlier. At various times and places, all three species would eventually come back together to mingle and swap DNA, leaving traces of those interactions buried deep in each other’s genomes.

And 773,000 years after a predator dragged the remains of a few unfortunate hominins into its den in northern Africa, those hominins’ distant descendants would unearth the gnawed, broken bones and begin piecing together the story.

            <h2>Computer scientist Yann LeCun: “Intelligence really is about learning”</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/computer-scientist-yann-lecun-intelligence-really-is-about-learning/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I arrive 10 minutes ahead of schedule from an early morning Eurostar and see Yann LeCun is already waiting for me, nestled between two plastic Christmas trees in the nearly empty winter garden of Michelin-starred restaurant Pavyllon.

The restaurant is next to Paris’s Grand Palais, where President Emmanuel Macron kick-started 2025 by hosting an international AI summit, a glitzy showcase packed with French exceptionalism and international tech luminaries including LeCun, who is considered one of the “godfathers” of modern AI.

LeCun gets up to hug me in greeting, wearing his signature black Ray-Ban Wayfarer glasses. He looks well rested for a man who has spent nearly a week running around town plotting world domination. Or, more precisely, “total world assistance” or “intelligent amplification, if you want.” Domination “sounds scary with AI,” he acknowledges.

The last time I met him was at a summer conference in Paris, where he was unveiling the latest iteration of his vision for superintelligent machines as Meta’s chief AI scientist. Now, he is preparing to leave his longtime employer, and fundraising for a new start-up that will bring that vision to life.

LeCun’s schedule has been relentless since the Financial Times broke the news that he was leaving Meta. “It basically pushed us to accelerate the calendar,” he says. Macron sent him a WhatsApp message after the story came out. LeCun declines to tell me exactly what the president said, but does hint that he was pleased the new “worldwide” company will have a strong connection to France.

LeCun will not be the company’s chief executive, but the executive chair, allowing him the same kind of freedom to do research that he had at Meta. (Since our lunch, the FT has reported that LeCun’s new venture is called Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs and will be led by Alex LeBrun, the co-founder and chief executive of French health care AI start-up Nabla.)

“I’m a scientist, a visionary. I can inspire people to work on interesting things. I’m pretty good at guessing what type of technology will work or not. But I can’t be a CEO,” LeCun says. “I’m both too disorganized for this, and also too old!”

The waitress offers us champagne to start. I opt for a glass of alcohol-free Blanc de Blancs. LeCun, a fan of wines, is curious to try it too. We clink glasses.

Things have changed for me as well since we last met: I am pregnant. I make a joke that I too am growing my own superintelligence. “It is the most efficient way,” he says.

LeCun would know, as he has been gestating ideas for the creation of such intelligence in machines for decades. He has also been vocal about his disdain for large language models (LLMs) and their potential to reach superhuman intelligence, which is the current obsession of Silicon Valley. He argues that LLMs are useful but fundamentally limited and constrained by language. To achieve human-level intelligence, you have to understand how our physical world works too.

His solution for achieving that relies on an architecture called V-JEPA, a so-called world model. World models aim to understand the physical world by learning from videos and spatial data, rather than just language. They are also able to plan, reason, and have persistent memory. He calls this kind of intelligence Advanced Machine Intelligence, or AMI.

Born in 1960 and raised in the suburbs of Paris, LeCun has been fascinated by the question of how human intelligence emerged since he was a young boy.

It was the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, which he saw when he was 8 or 9 years old, that set him on the path he is on today. He gestures having his mind blown.

LeCun’s father, an aeronautical engineer and “a bit of an inventor,” instilled a love of building and tinkering with things. LeCun grew up constructing model aeroplanes and playing woodwind instruments such as the recorder and the crumhorn, a “weird Renaissance instrument,” which he played in a Renaissance dance music band.

We’ve both chosen the four-course “Champs-Élysées” lunch set menu. As we tuck into our starters (soft-boiled eggs, tuna tartare with smoked pike roe and croutons for LeCun, and a broth of root vegetables and horseradish ravioli with Chartreuse sauce for me), he tells me how a teacher deemed him too bad at math to study it at university, so he decided to pursue engineering.

The waitress comes to check on us, and LeCun orders a glass of Chassagne-Montrachet from Burgundy. “What Americans would call Chardonnay,” he says, jokingly.

LeCun’s lightbulb moment came as a student at the École Supérieure d’Ingénieurs en Électrotechnique et Électronique in Paris in the 1980s, when he read a book about a debate on nature versus nurture between the linguist Noam Chomsky and Jean Piaget, a psychologist. Chomsky argued that humans have an inbuilt capacity for language, while Piaget said there is some structure but most of it is learnt.

“I’m not gonna make friends saying this… ” he tells me, “but I was reading this and I thought everything that Chomsky… was saying could not possibly be true, [because] we learn everything. Intelligence really is about learning.”

AI research—or neural networks, as the technology was then called, which loosely mimic how the brain functions—was practically a dead field and considered taboo by the scientific community, after early iterations of the technology failed to impress. But LeCun sought out other researchers studying neural networks and found intellectual “soulmates” in the likes of Geoffrey Hinton, then a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon.

He later joined Hinton at the University of Toronto as a postdoc researcher. The two, along with Yoshua Bengio, went on to lay the groundwork for deep learning and modern AI, which saw them rewarded in 2018 with the Turing Award, the most prestigious prize in computer science.

The waitress lays our second, gorgeous, dish in front of us and launches into an enthusiastic description of the meal in French. I nod along equally enthusiastically, understanding nothing.

“Did you get that?” LeCun asks. “This is the foie gras, and this is the Comté soufflé, and the Comté is 18 months aged.” When in France, I think, and take a bite of the liver.

LeCun is the brain behind important early AI technologies. In the late 1980s and 1990s, while a researcher at AT&T Bell Labs in New Jersey—once known as the leading industry research lab in the world—he developed convolutional neural networks, an architecture used in image recognition technology, which he built into a system that was widely used by banks to read checks.

He had conceived of the research at Toronto, but was able to roll it out in the real world thanks to the seemingly unlimited coffers of cash and cutting-edge technology available at Bell Labs.

LeCun recounts something his boss at the time, Larry Jackel, told him when he first joined. “He said, ‘You know, at Bell Labs? You don’t get famous by saving money.’”

Our main dish arrives, a portion of cod with herbed breadcrumbs and fried capers. LeCun is in a jovial mood, and I find myself engrossed in his colorful stories about the early years of AI research.

He, along with his pharmacist wife, Isabelle, and their three sons, ended up settling in New Jersey for good, although he visits Paris every five weeks or so. America was a “culture shock,” he says.

The party at Bell Labs was destined to end. A corporate shake-up meant the lab lost significant funding and was spun off to different subsidiaries. LeCun rejoined academia and started a new project at NYU aimed at researching neural networks, frequenting Greenwich Village’s jazz clubs after his lectures.

By 2013, it was clear that deep learning was going to work, with image recognition applications showing impressive results. Google had just started Google Brain, and a year later would acquire British AI lab DeepMind.

It was also then that Mark Zuckerberg called. He wanted to start an AI unit at Facebook, and to woo LeCun invited him over for dinner at his California home. A private chef prepared “chicken with some pretty good white wine,” LeCun recalls.

LeCun agreed to join on three conditions. He wouldn’t have to quit his job at NYU. He wouldn’t move to California. And the research results of the new lab had to be made publicly available.

Zuckerberg agreed, and the deal was done. LeCun was to join Facebook, one of the biggest technology companies in the world, to set up a new AI research lab focusing on fundamental research, called Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (Fair).

Facebook was a “tabula rasa with a carte blanche,” LeCun says. “Money was clearly not going to be a problem.”

The waitress interrupts us to bring our dessert, bricelets. “Magnifique,” LeCun says, as the dish is placed in front of him.

I shift the conversation to a more tumultuous time. In early 2022, pre-ChatGPT, all the major AI labs had some version of the technology kicking around, but it was seen as largely experimental. It was a small, relatively unknown AI lab called OpenAI that kick-started today’s AI mania, when it quietly launched the technology as an easily accessible chatbot.

ChatGPT caused a frantic scramble at Meta. The company’s leadership decided to put all their chips into work developing Llama, a large language model. Zuckerberg reshuffled the organization to create a generative AI unit, which was tasked with accelerating research into products. LeCun insisted the model was released openly.

Llama 2, released with open weights for all users, meaning people could download and tweak it for free, was a “watershed” moment, which “changed the entire industry,” LeCun says. The model became the gold standard in powerful open LLMs, and championed an approach that was counter to the extreme concentration of power that Google and OpenAI were pushing. Meta was seen as the good guys in AI research.

Meta switched gears aggressively on AI last year. Zuckerberg placed more pressure on the GenAI unit to accelerate AI development and deployment, which led to a communication breakdown, LeCun says.

“We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,” he says. “When you do this, you fall behind.”

The subsequent Llama models were duds. Llama 4, which was released in April 2025, was a flop, and the company was accused of gaming benchmarks to make it look more impressive. LeCun admits that the “results were fudged a little bit,” and the team used different models for different benchmarks to give better results.

“Mark was really upset and basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved in this. And so basically sidelined the entire GenAI organization. A lot of people have left, a lot of people who haven’t yet left will leave.”

Last June, Meta invested $15 billion in data-labeling start-up Scale AI and hired its 28-year-old chief executive and co-founder Alexandr Wang. Wang took the reins of the company’s new bet on AI and its research unit, called TBD Lab. The lab is tasked with developing new frontier AI models.

Meta made headlines for trying to poach elite researchers from competitors with offers of $100 million sign-on bonuses. “The future will say whether that was a good idea or not,” LeCun says, deadpan.

LeCun calls Wang, who was hired to lead the organization, “young” and “inexperienced.”

“He learns fast, he knows what he doesn’t know… There’s no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.”

Wang also became LeCun’s manager. I ask LeCun how he felt about this shift in hierarchy. He initially brushes it off, saying he’s used to working with young people. “The average age of a Facebook engineer at the time was 27. I was twice the age of the average engineer.”

But those 27-year-olds weren’t telling him what to do, I point out.

“Alex [Wang] isn’t telling me what to do either,” he says. “You don’t tell a researcher what to do. You certainly don’t tell a researcher like me what to do.”

LeCun doesn’t mince his words about why he ultimately decided to leave Meta after more than a decade. Staying became politically difficult, he tells me. And while Zuckerberg likes LeCun’s world model research, the crowd who were hired for the company’s new superintelligence push are “completely LLM-pilled.”

This clearly alienated LeCun. “I’m sure there’s a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence,” he says. “But I’m not gonna change my mind because some dude thinks I’m wrong. I’m not wrong. My integrity as a scientist cannot allow me to do this.”

Another driver to leave was that his work with world models and AMI was also proving to have potential uses that were not interesting to Meta, such as jet engines and heavy industry. And LeCun had no trouble finding investors who were willing to bet on the next generation of AI technologies.

In his next chapter, LeCun believes that setting up a “neolab,” meaning a start-up that does fundamental research, is the new, most fertile ground. He cites OpenAI former chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines (“I hope the investors know what they do”) and OpenAI’s co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence (“There I know the investors have no idea what they do”) as good examples.

His new architecture uses videos to give AI models an understanding of the physics of our world, which will allow them to make better predictions of what will happen next. The model also relies on “emotions,” meaning past experiences and evaluations, to guide its predictions.

“If I pinch you, you’re going to feel pain. But then your mental model of me is going to be affected by the fact that I just pinched you. And the next time I approach my arm to yours, you’re going to recoil. That’s your prediction, and the emotion it evokes is fear or avoidance of pain,” he says.

LeCun says we will see “baby” versions of this within 12 months, and on a larger scale within a few years. It’s not quite yet superintelligence, but a path toward it. “Maybe there is an obstacle we’re not seeing yet, but at least there is hope.”

After three and a half hours, we are now the only customers left in the restaurant. I ask him what he wants his legacy to be.

Increasing the amount of intelligence in the world, he replies, without batting an eyelid. “Intelligence is really the thing that we should have more of,” he says, adding that with more intelligence, there’s less human suffering, more rational decisions, and more understanding of the world and the universe.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The tech industry’s insistence on cramming AI into virtually every aspect of their consumer-facing offerings, from AI apps you can’t uninstall to hallucinating assistants that nobody asked for, has been nothing short of insufferable.

Tech enthusiasts and average consumers alike have watched helplessly as software and hardware they rely on to research, work, game, and keep in touch have turned into testing grounds for unproven AI tech — often without their consent.

Tech giant Microsoft has been at the epicenter of the resulting blowback, bearing the full brunt of the rage felt by many fed up with having AI shoved down their throat. It’s inundated its Windows 11 operating system with annoying AI features following the company’s doubling down on what it calls the “AI PC” last year, frustrating countless users, and most recently spawning the pejorative of “Microslop.”

Thankfully, vendors are finally starting to pay attention. As PCGamer reports, Windows PC maker Dell admitted at this year’s CES that things have really gotten out of hand.

Their executives are willing to say the quiet part out loud — that nobody is scrambling to buy an “AI PC.”

“One thing you’ll notice is the message we delivered around our products was not AI-first,” Dell’s head of product, Kevin Terwilliger, said during a pre-CES briefing, as quoted by the publication. “So, a bit of a shift from a year ago where we were all about the AI PC.”

“We’re very focused on delivering upon the AI capabilities of a device — in fact everything that we’re announcing has an [neural processing unit] in it — but what we’ve learned over the course of this year, especially from a consumer perspective, is they’re not buying based on AI,” he admitted. “In fact I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them understand a specific outcome.”

It’s a notable change of tune, suggesting a promising sea change in the perspective of tech manufacturers. It’s a refreshing new perspective after years of companies promising us that all we needed in life was a little bit more AI.

But whether the company developing the operating system of Dell’s PCs will agree with the assessment that consumers ahve had enough remains to be seen.

In a rambling year-end post on LinkedIn, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took umbrage with the term “slop,” arguing that “[w]e need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication.”

Nadella fumed that the company’s tripling down on AI will continue to be a “messy process of discovery, like all technology and product development always is.”

Indeed, tech companies like Microsoft and Dell have a lot still to prove until they can realize on their lofty promises about what AI can do.

For now, many new AI features remain infuriatingly useless, making us wonder if all of the risk and frustration will eventually be worth it in the end.

The fact that Dell is worried its AI-first approach may be hindering it from reaching new customers and making new sales, though, is telling.

Beyond Terwilliger’s eureka moment, Dell also admitted at CES that killing off its much-beloved line of XPS laptops was a mistake, officially reviving it for 2026 — and judging by the elated reactions the move has garnered, it was likely the right move.

Now, if only the hype surrounding AI hadn’t caused an astronomical rise in PC component prices…

            <div id="article-text">Fears over a growing AI bubble that could wipe out the entire economy if it were to burst continue to mount.

For many months now, investors and even tech leaders have openly been discussing the possibility — but if or when such a collapse could take place remains a subject of heated debate.

Nonetheless, investors are already preparing for that type of major tech sell-off, the Financial Times reports. The reporting shows that plenty of fear and uncertainty remain over the untold billions of dollars being poured into wildly unprofitable AI ventures — a dynamic that’s seen AI companies’ valuations skyrocket to record heights, despite dubious prospects of ever turning a profit.

Some are pulling back on their investments in major tech stocks, while others are outright betting on eventual drops in share prices.

“Whether there are excesses… in the equity market on AI is no longer questionable, but to figure out which exact companies will be the losers and when this reckoning will happen is difficult,” fund management firm Amundi chief investment officer Vincent Mortier told the FT.

One investment fund, Blue Whale Growth, sold its Microsoft and Meta stock in the second quarter of last year, with chief investment officer Stephen Yiu telling the newspaper that “we are concerned about the return on investment in some cases, while some of the valuations are insane — especially in private markets.”

GQG Partners chair Rajiv Jain added that “AI’s massive cash burn remains elevated with very little profitability in sight.” His fund sold all of its Magnificent Seven — investor shorthand for Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia — holdings.

“Though we had less exposure to a few Mag 7 names throughout 2025, we exited our remaining positions by early November because the risks of an AI bubble blow-up are growing, in our view,” he said.

At the same time, many remain unafraid of an imminent collapse.

“We don’t believe that we are in a bubble,” BlackRock international chief investment officer Helen Jewell told the FT, “but investors should prepare for a bumpy ride in 2026.”

Despite plenty of concerns among investors, banks remain optimistic about future growth. Wall Street has predicted double-digit gains this year. The S&P 500 has surged a whopping 92 percent since October 2022, posting double-digit returns for three years in a row now.

“2026 should be another strong year for AI stocks, with capex likely to surpass expectations,” JPMorgan’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a memo.

Others are far more muted about the outlook. Three years on from OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT, some are starting to wonder how long the enormous hype surrounding AI can continue to be sustained.

In a 2025 retrospective posted on Monday, Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio warned that the tech market is “now in the early stages of a bubble.”

But a crash, some argue, may still be some ways away thanks to plenty of remaining excitement.

“A bubble likely crashes on a bear market,” Cetera Financial Group chief investment officer Gene Goldman told Bloomberg. “We just don’t see a bear market anytime soon.”

            <h2>Boston Dynamics’ Unnatural New Robot Demo Will Give You Goose Bumps</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not everybody agrees that replicating the four-limbed, bipedal shape of a human should be replicated in robot form. For one, walking with two feet is inherently less stable than four, nevermind a set of wheels. Replicating the dexterity and fine motor skills of human hands also remains a major challenge.

In a modified approach, Boston Dynamics has clearly decided to loosen up some of the restrictions of the human form. During an on-stage demonstration at this year’s CES convention in Las Vegas, Boston Dynamics showed off the agility of its humanoid Atlas robot — albeit with an unnerving degree of freedom of movement that dispels the illusion of a human entity.

Key to the demo is that the robot features clever joints that allow for “continuous rotation.” In effect, its hips, wrists, and neck can swivel a full 360 degrees unimpeded.

After confidently strutting to the front of the stage, Atlas starts twisting its hands like a drill, rotating its head like the girl in “The Exorcist,” and even turning its entire torso around in a dizzying maneuver — a clear indication that Boston Dynamics isn’t planning to be boxed in by the limitations of human anatomy.

“There’s more to it than just copying nature,” Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said during the announcement. “We can pick the best parts of what nature has to offer and do better in others.”

The demo was part of Boston Dynamics’ announcement of a production-ready version of its Atlas robot. The Hyundai-owned firm also announced a partnership with Google’s DeepMind to bring AI smarts to its bots as well.

The firm claimed that it’s already working on a robot that can be deployed in a car factory. The plan is to deploy it at Hyundai’s EV manufacturing facility by 2028.

However, pricing and an availability date for the six-foot-two, 200-pound robot have yet to be revealed.

Beyond spinning its head and hands around freely, Boston Dynamics has shown how Atlas can manipulate car parts and even perform slick breakdancing moves.

“Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works, and it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children,” Playter boasted on stage.

Yet many questions remain about the tech’s long-term viability. For one, not everybody agrees that they make the most sense when it comes to actually replacing human labor. Experts have also warned that humanoid robots could be the next financial bubble.

When or if bipedal robots will be the form factor of choice, particularly when it comes to industrial settings, remains a subject of debate.

“I think the question comes back to what are the use cases and where is the applicability of the technology,” McKinsey partner Alex Panas told NBC News. “In some cases, it may look more humanoid. In some cases, it may not.”

Judging by its latest demo, Boston Dynamics is playing it safe by taking some liberties.

            <h2>“Microslop”: Infuriating Video Sums Up How Microsoft Is Ruining Windows With AI</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-07</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you were already skeptical — if not livid — about Microsoft’s ongoing campaign to drown Windows 11 with useless AI features, you’re really going to hate this video.

In a 30 second clip uploaded over the weekend, programmer Ryan Fleury demonstrates how even using Window 11’s purportedly AI-powered search bar to do exactly what it tells you to do doesn’t come close to working as advertised.

At the start of the video, the settings page search bar, with its gleaming AI icon, recommends searching “My mouse pointer is too small.” This goes against the common search function wisdom that you should look up using keywords, not entire sentences, but whatever: AI magic can take care of that for you, right?

But as it turns out, when Fleury searches “My mouse pointer is too small,” as exactly phrased by the search suggestion, nothing turns up. He waits around ten seconds with no luck, either. But when he looks up “test” afterwards, he gets three results.

“This is not a real company,” Fleury fumed.

He was joined by dozens of netizens who jeered the misfiring feature using a tough-but-fair new pejorative: “Microslop.”

Whether you like it or not, Microsoft isn’t backing off from basting Windows 11 with AI features. It’s ended support for its old operating system, Windows 10, in the hopes that you’ll upgrade and try out its Copilot-integrated successor, its AI chatbot slash virtual assistant.

The AI transformation is intended to be so sweeping that various executives have described the pivot in terms such as turning Windows 11 into an “agentic OS,” or better yet, into a “canvas for AI.” Some of the changes include putting an icon for Copilot in the middle of your taskbar and integrating Copilot into Windows Explorer, allowing you to right-click generate summaries of documents. Other features in the works include Copilot Vision, which lets the AI analyze whatever appears on the desktop display, and Copilot Actions, which lets the AI perform tasks on your behalf.

Many users fear that the deeply woven AI integrations pose a security risk, a fear that is informed by past Windows 11 AI blunders including when earlier versions of its AI “Recall” feature, which creates a history of your computer activity by taking constant screenshots of it, was caught saving sensitive data like Social Security numbers, and storing the screenshots in an unprotected folder.

The backlash against Microsoft’s AI pivot has quickly mounted ever since it announced it’d be ending support for Windows 10, but as anti-AI sentiment at large also heightens, the outrage has recently reached a boiling point with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s recent plea that we should stop using the word “slop,” the new slang for describing low quality text, images, and videos mass produced by AI models. Unfortunately for Nadella, he unwittingly precipitated a classic case of the Streisand effect, and soon after his “slop” comments, the term “Microslop” suddenly went viral online.

“‘AI writes 90% of our code!!!!,&#39;” Fleury mocked, referring to boasts made by Nadella and other tech CEOs. “Don’t worry, we can tell.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ever since it was first spotted hurtling through the solar system, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has maintained that there’s a chance mysterious interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a technological object sent by an extraterrestrial civilization.

He’s meticulously catalogued what he claims are anomalous qualities of the object, which most of his peers believe is a natural comet from a different star system, from its unusually large suspected size to a rotation axis almost perfectly perpendicular to the Sun to a “fine-tuned” trajectory that brought it within spitting distance of Mars and Jupiter.

Loeb has also been angered at NASA’s continued insistence that 3I/ATLAS is a natural comet — which, again, is the opinion of most experts — accusing them of “arrogance” and ignoring his documented anomalies. He also accused NASA of withholding observations by its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter while 3I/ATLAS made its closest approach to the Red Planet in October, due to last year’s government shutdown. (The images were eventually released in late November.)

NASA isn’t the government institution that Loeb is taking aim at. In a new blog post, the astronomer pointed out that ufologist John Greenewald Jr.’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) inquiry for “any assessments, reports, or communications maintained by the Central Intelligence Agency referencing 3I/ATLAS” had been pointedly shut down.

The CIA told Greenewald in a formal response to his FOIA that it will “neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of records” related to the object — a non-answer that could be interpreted in strikingly different ways.

Greenewald is a well-known name in UFO circles. He founded The Black Vault, an enormous archive of millions of pages of government documents he’s uncovered via FOIA inquiries, including declassified videos of what the Pentagon describes as unidentified anomalous phenomena.

Loeb says he found the answer — and the notable level of secrecy — “surprising,” given NASA’s conclusion that “3I/ATLAS is definitely a comet of natural origin.”

“If this conclusion was clear all along to everyone within government and academia — as NASA officials presented the case, then why would the CIA treat the possible existence of records dealing with a natural comet as sensitive enough to be classified?” he asked rhetorically.

Loeb suggested the government might have investigated whether 3I/ATLAS could pose a threat to national security, perhaps over the possibility of a “black swan event,” which has fascinated the researcher.

If scientists do eventually uncover a probe sent to us by an alien civilization, it could pose a major threat to humanity, Loeb has asserted. He has previously hypothesized that the object could be “akin to a Trojan Horse, where a technological object masquerades as a natural comet.”

Discussions about such a possibility may have been “hidden from public view in order to prevent panic from taking hold for no good reason,” Loeb pondered, especially considering a “black swan event is still regarded as highly unlikely.”

However, this theory presupposes that the CIA even has anything to hide from the public to begin with. After all, in its statement to Greenewald, it didn’t rule out the “nonexistence of records.”

Besides, as more data rolls in, Loeb’s far-fetched theory that 3I/ATLAS is a piece of technology continues to be challenged.

In other words, what would there even to hide if the object does turn out to be a non-threatening lump of ice?

Either way, Loeb isn’t ready to call it just yet. He has advocated for taking a closer look once it makes its closest approach to Jupiter in March.

“Unless we check, we might never know if this swan is white or black,” he concluded in his blog.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Men do not make laws,” goes a maxim attributed to US president Calvin Coolidge. “They do but discover them.”

If that’s true, then the US attack on Venezuela just uncovered a legislative mother lode. A new law proposed by New York representative Ritchie Torres on Monday would make it illegal for government employees with access to nonpublic information from trading on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.

If that sounds like something that should probably already be illegal, Coolidge might agree, in his own laissez-faire way.

“Laws must be justified by something more than the will of the majority,” he concluded. “They must rest on the eternal foundation of righteousness.”

In any case, the “Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026,” would include new restrictions on elected officials, political appointees, and executive branch staffers, according to Forbes. It would also apply to government employees who have not yet been privy to nonpublic documents, but “may reasonably obtain such material nonpublic information in the course of performing official duties.”

The proposed legislation comes on the heels of compelling evidence that someone with inside information about the recent kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro placed a series of large bets on Polymarket on whether an attack would take place. Just two days before the surprise attack, the account in question invested over $30,000 in a prediction that either Maduro would be “out” or that US troops would set foot “in Venezuela by” January 31st.

The payout was staggering: a profit of $400,000 in less than 24 hours, as sports entrepreneur Joe Pompliano estimated.

“Seems pretty suspicious!” Pompliano wrote. “Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged.”

Beyond the Venezuela attack, prediction markets have raised serious anxiety about geopolitical strife around the world. Recent advances in the sector have made it so that crypto bros can gamble on deadly conflicts in real-time, betting thousands of dollars on questions like “will Russia capture all of Kupiansk by March 31?”

Back in October, Reuters reported that the Trump Media and Technology Group was working with Crypto.com to implement prediction market functionality into Truth Social. That came as dozens of federal investigations into crypto-based price fixing, securities fraud, and regulatory noncompliance have been dropped at the Trump administration’s urging. Two of those cases were against prediction platforms Polymarket —the very same implicated in the Venezuela allegations — and Kalshi, for selling options contracts related to congressional elections.

Whether Torres’ new bill makes it very far remains to be seen. Recent history shows that Congress has little appetite for regulation of insider trading — and for now, there doesn’t yet seem to be a wager on the outcome of the bill on either Polymarket or Kalshi.

            <div id="article-text">VC firms DST Global and Iconiq are piling into the London- and New York-based e-commerce startup Swap Commerce. On Wednesday the startup announced it raised a new $100 million round just six months after raising a $40 million Series B round led by Iconiq.

Founded in 2022, Swap Commerce offers an AI-powered platform that helps brands build web storefronts and handle cross-border transactions, inventory management, and returns. The platform has become popular with luxury clothing brands, and the company particularly targets companies looking to sell their goods globally. The company declined to comment on its latest valuation.

The fast, substantial funding from such prominent VCs marks Swap as a startup to watch, though Swap faces plenty of competition, including e-commerce behemoth Shopify.

Larco, who’s been investing in consumer and prosumer for years, thinks we’re about to see a shift in how consumers spend time online, with AI powering “concierge-like” services. The question is, will legacy consumer products like WebMD and TripAdvisor continue to exist as standalone apps, or will they just get absorbed into ChatGPT or Meta AI? And where can startups carve out an AI-powered niche for themselves

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic is gearing up to raise a fresh $10 billion at a $350 billion valuation, according to The Wall Street Journal. TechCrunch has confirmed the raise and valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The Claude maker last raised a $13 billion Series F round at a $183 billion valuation three months ago, so this raise nearly doubles the AI firm’s value. In March, Anthropic secured $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion valuation.

Coatue Management and GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, will lead the new round, per the WSJ, which cited sources familiar with the deal. Anthropic is expected to close its latest financing in the coming weeks, and the total deal amount could change.

This round would be separate from the $15 billion Nvidia and Microsoft recently committed to invest in Anthropic, a “circular” deal that would see Anthropic buying $30 billion of compute capacity from Microsoft Azure running on Nvidia’s chips.

The fresh capital comes as Anthropic continues to win over developer hearts with Claude Code, its tool designed to automate coding, powered by Claude Opus 4.5. It also comes as Anthropic prepares for a potential IPO this year alongside its main rival OpenAI. OpenAI is also in talks to raise as much as $100 billion at a valuation of up to $830 billion.

This article was updated to reflect that TechCrunch separately confirmed the round.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/skylight-debuts-calendar-2-to-keep-your-family-organized/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Skylight may have started as a digital picture frame, but today, the company is more focused on helping families stay organized with shared calendars, lists, meal planning tools, and more.

At CES 2026, the company debuted its latest product: the Skylight Calendar 2, which offers a sleeker design than the original 15-inch calendar, but smaller than the 27-inch wall-mounted Calendar Max. Like its larger counterpart, the new digital calendar app and family organizer also lets you swap out the frame for different colors to better match your home’s decor.

The biggest selling point isn’t the digital screen itself, but the underlying software and AI capabilities. The primary feature — the calendar — is actually a mashup of all your family’s calendars from whatever services you use, whether that’s Google Calendar, iCal, Microsoft, or even your kids’ sports apps, like TeamSnap.

The calendar is color-coded to see everyone’s schedules with a glance, and can even import “calendars” that are really just emails with a few key dates or flyers sent home in Junior’s backpack. (The latter is an AI feature where you snap a photo of the paper and the calendar updates with the new events.)

The company is also trying to address other pain points for families such as managing grocery lists, reminders for appointments, meal planning, and recipe discovery. Of course, it can still display your family photos too, when otherwise not in use.

The app is well-designed to be easy to read with simple navigation, pops of color, and even imagery that makes it possible for little kids to use. For instance, they can check off their chores by looking for a picture, even if they can’t yet read. Parents also like the ability to plan meals, whether that’s noting simply that Tuesday will be taco night, or going as far as finding a recipe and preparing a shopping list. Skylight’s helpful here too, as it can automatically create the shopping list of ingredients for you or even add it to your Instacart app.

Another clever AI feature lets you snap a photo of what’s in your fridge and get a recipe recommendation based on what you have on hand.

The need for such a system is clearly resonating with customers. Skylight, a bootstrapped and profitable company from day one, now has 1.3 million-plus families using its digital calendars so far, and likely more to come as the new design ships.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has introduced a new way to grab the attention of students who are avid podcast listeners. Now available in Google Classroom, teachers can use a new Gemini-powered tool that generates podcast-style audio lessons, meant to promote deeper comprehension of educational material.

To begin, educators simply go to the Gemini tab within Google Classroom. There, they can select different customization options, such as selecting the appropriate grade level, defining topics, and setting clear learning objectives. They can then further personalize the audio experience by choosing the number of speakers or selecting different conversational styles, such as interviews, roundtable discussions, or casual dialogues.

This new feature is currently available to users subscribed to Google Workspace Education Fundamentals, Standard, and Plus.

By bringing this familiar format into the classroom, teachers can tap into their students’ interests. Research shows that students spend significant time listening to podcasts, with an estimated 35 million Gen Z monthly listeners in the U.S.

Plus, the popularity of podcasts as educational resources has grown rapidly; many universities now produce their own podcasts, and students increasingly seek out popular educational series on their own time. Podcast-style lessons might also encourage independent learning, since students can replay episodes whenever they need a refresher or missed a class.

However, teachers are still grappling with integrating AI tools into their teaching practices. Many teachers express concerns about students’ increased reliance on generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to complete assignments.

Google urges teachers to practice responsible AI and carefully review and, if necessary, edit all AI-generated content to ensure accuracy and appropriateness for their specific classroom context and local policies.

Gemini for Classroom first launched in 2024, and Google has continually added new features since then. Most recently, the company rolled out major updates last June, including features that help teachers brainstorm, develop lesson plans, and customize instructional materials for their students.

            <h2>Caterpillar taps Nvidia to bring AI to its construction equipment</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/caterpillar-taps-nvidia-to-bring-ai-to-its-construction-equipment/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Caterpillar is digging deeper into incorporating AI and automation into its fleet of construction machinery through a partnership with semiconductor giant Nvidia.

The construction equipment giant is piloting an AI assistive system in its mid-size Cat 306 CR Mini Excavator. Dubbed “Cat AI,” the system was built using Nvidia’s Jetson Thor physical AI platform, and is being demoed at CES on Wednesday.

Brandon Hootman, vice president of data and AI at Caterpillar, told TechCrunch that Cat AI was built on a fleet of AI agents and can help answer a machine operator’s questions, allow them to access resources, offer safety tips, and schedule services.

One of the biggest benefits of bringing this tech into these machines is the data that these systems collect and send back out.

“Our customers don’t live in front of a laptop day in and day out; they live in the dirt,” Hootman said. “The ability to get the insights and take the action that they need while they’re doing the work is very important to them.”

Caterpillar is also piloting digital twins of construction sites using Nvidia’s Omniverse library of simulation resources to test scheduling scenarios and better calculate how much building material a project will need. Hootman said Caterpillar’s machines send roughly 2,000 messages back to the company every second. This data will help them build these simulations.

The company already has fully autonomous vehicles in the mining sector, and Hootman said that these pilot programs are a great next step as the company looks to bring more automation to its portfolio.

“The reason that we started here was it was a real challenge of our customers today that needed to be addressed, and also something that we had some real momentum on and we felt like we could bring to market pretty quickly,” Hootman said. “What we also liked is that it provided a kind of a technology foundation for us to then build upon.”

Working with companies like Caterpillar — a legacy brand that doesn’t often intertwine with the tech industry — seems to fit right into Nvidia’s physical AI strategy.

Bill Dally, Nvidia’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch in 2025 that the chipmaker considers physical AI to be the next frontier for the company and its powerful GPUs.

During its CES keynote on Monday, Nvidia laid out plans for its full-stack ecosystem for physical AI, which includes open AI models like the company’s Cosmos model family, simulation tools, and developer kits.

While some may think physical AI is just for robotics companies, Deepu Talla, the vice president of robotics and edge AI at Nvidia, told TechCrunch the company takes a much broader definition as everyone is building robotics today.

“Physical AI is the next wave of AI,” Talla said. “Nvidia is pioneering that with computers that train the models, that do the simulation to test the models and deploy the models into the robots, whether [that’s] an autonomous car or a Caterpillar machine.”

            <h2>The View From the Palisades</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2026/01/palisades-la-fire-one-year/685535/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This weekend, I stood on a bluff in the Palisades where houses used to be. Los Angeles rose to my left, and the sky had the dramatic clouds we get in the winter when it rains, as it has for a few weeks. The hillsides have turned to Irish green, but the burn scar, below, is still black. Twice, when my family drove past during the holidays, our phones blared with evacuation alerts for possible mudslides and flooding. Since last January, whenever the rain has been heavy, people living near the burn areas have had to sandbag their homes and field evacuation warnings.

Where the Pacific Coast Highway runs through the burn area, the speed limit slows to 25 miles an hour, and building equipment is scattered along the shoulder. What used to be the Malibu Feed Bin—a red barn where one could find both horse feed and a gigantic metal sculpture of a giraffe—is now a collection of temporary offices for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power’s utilities-rebuilding projects. Inside the Palisades, most of the old landmarks are gone. The Building Block—a 1920s Spanish Colonial building known for being light pink, like the inside of a conch shell—has a piece of its facade still standing.

In the year since the fire, the Army Corps of Engineers has hauled away millions of tons of debris, in what the governor’s office has called the fastest major-disaster cleanup in American history. Most lots are empty now; the city of L.A., which oversees most of the Palisades, has approved rebuilding plans for about 14 percent of the homes destroyed, according to the Los Angeles Times. Paradise moved more slowly toward rebuilding after the 2018 Camp Fire, and Santa Rosa, after the 2017 Tubbs Fire, went much more quickly. Almost 80 percent of the homes lost in the Tubbs have been rebuilt; in Paradise, about a quarter of homes have come back.

Each disaster is different, Kathryn McConnell, who studies wildfire rebuilding at the University of British Columbia, told me: Population size, socioeconomics, and land value all can influence the rate at which a community recovers. But no matter what, a year—even though it can feel like many more when you’re waiting to return home—is not very long in the timeline of disaster recovery.

I saw very few people in the Palisades this past weekend, but the community had left messages on the houses and businesses. A banner on a garden gate: Thank you to all our wonderful neighbors! We can rebuild this beautiful town together. On an elementary school: Returning in January 2028. The CVS, which was spared by the fire, still had signs up from its grand reopening in August. (Across the street, a notice from the L.A. Department of Water and Power read DO NOT DRINK THE TAP WATER.) One of the more frequent lawn signs I saw on empty lots was THEY LET US BURN, a call to come to a protest against city and state agencies that’s happening this morning. There were many FOR SALE signs, and then, over and over again, ones that read instead, This home will rise again.

Paul Horvitz, a lifelong friend of my father whose ranch home of 45 years burned in the fire, was among the first homeowners in the Palisades to get a rebuilding permit. It helped that he’s a mortgage lender and knows more about the real-estate system than many people: Once the rain ends, he will be ready to start construction on his house, which will no longer be surrounded by bougainvillea but will be made entirely of fire-resistant materials. Other Palisades Fire survivors are entering the permitting tedium that survivors of the 2018 Woolsey Fire, in Malibu, have been navigating for years—finding out, for instance, that the plans they used in the ’70s are no longer up to code, or that they’ll need to raise their coastal home higher off the sand to comply with upgraded flood-elevation guidelines. Even a wealthy place like Malibu might rebuild slowly, in part because its geography is so complicated. About 600 homes burned there last year, and about one-third of the owners have put in permit applications. As of New Year’s Eve, only 22 homes have been approved to rebuild.

But rebuilding is only one way to measure recovery. In Malibu, my childhood friends and I realized that all of the restaurants where we’d normally gather at the holidays had burned. In Altadena, a chef whose restaurant survived the Eaton Fire, told CBS that when he goes to work, he thinks, This was a neighborhood restaurant. It always has been. And now there’s no neighborhood. Jennifer Champion and her family lost their house but have moved into a condo in one of the Palisades’ more intact neighborhoods; still, she says not a day goes by that she doesn’t think about how much the fire took. Families of the 12 people killed in the Palisades Fire will gather for a ceremony today.

Everyone wants to make the next fire less brutal. Michael Rohde, an emergency-management consultant and a retired battalion chief with the Orange County Fire Authority, grew up just south of L.A., where he could see a fuel break the width of eight bulldozers on Mount Wilson. These types of clearings are meant to slow fires down by limiting the material they have to burn, but a large, indiscriminately placed fuel break like that probably won’t do much good when winds can carry embers for miles, Rohde told me. In Southern California in particular, clearing away strips of flammable brush could actually make the problem worse by inviting invasive grasses, Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist with the University of California Cooperative Extension, told me. He and other researchers have been beating this drum for decades. Already, the too-frequent fires in L.A. create an opening for these species to grow back instead of the native chaparral, Alexandra Syphard, an ecologist for the Conservation Biology Institute, told me. These are the grasses making the hills green right now, but by the summer, they dry into brown fuels that ignite more easily than the native plants.

Fuel breaks can still help during a fire, researchers and firefighters both told me, when placed along roadways and directly around housing developments where firefighters can access them. But the breaks need to be used more sparingly than they might be in forested land, and placed more deliberately. As part of the area’s recent fire-resiliency projects, public-land organizations have now been working on smaller, strategically placed breaks. Michael O’Connell, the president of Irvine Ranch Conservancy, told me that the IRC and its partners are developing some fuel breaks that replace nonnative grass with heavier, less flammable shrubs and cacti. Still, only recently has the state begun to manage Southern California fires as their own distinct problem. What works in the forests of Northern California, where fires are fueled by the forest itself, might not do as much in Southern California, where the most destructive fires are propelled by strong winds.

Those winds will return here; some of the people, homes, businesses, and routines will too. But many will not. Horvitz told me that some of his neighbors are still deciding whether they’ll come back. One who already moved away worried the place would just burn again; another had lived there for decades and took the fire as a sign it was time to go. Along one stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway, the Reel Inn (a restaurant with surfboards in its rafters, and good fish tacos), Wylie’s Bait and Tackle (a shack opened by Bill Wylie in the ’40s, now owned by his granddaughter), and the Topanga Ranch Motel (bungalows from 1929, where Malibu kids would wait for the school bus) all burned and are now behind a chain-link fence. California State Parks, which owns the land, told at least the Reel Inn that it would not be renewing the business’s lease; then, after a local uproar, it told the restaurant it wanted to figure out a path forward. For the moment, when I drive on PCH at night, silhouettes of bare bluffs and hills, just barely darker than the sky behind them, line one side of the road. On the other side used to be homes. Now I can see the ocean.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For his tireless work promoting the cause of children’s diseases, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is being inducted into the Virus Hall of Fame today. The ceremony will feature light roadkill hors d’oeuvres, goblets of beef tallow, and a sewage plunge, and will include a memorial tribute to the parasitic worm that perished after eating a portion of his brain, but whose influence continues to be deeply felt.

In announcing the honor, the viruses praised Kennedy for being the first to buck the long-standing family tradition of fighting to better children’s lives: “Where other Kennedys mindlessly rushed to broaden access to health care, advocate peace, or improve children’s circumstances, only RFK Jr. had the courage to take a step back and say, ‘Let’s hear the other side.’”

“It’s easy to love children and want what’s best for them,” a representative from the virus league explained. “It’s hard to look deeper and say, What about the virus in that child’s lung? Who’s looking out for it?”

“He’s been our guardian angel,” a weeping respiratory syncytial virus added. “We were on the brink of destruction, and—he spared us.”

The disease-spreaders commended the secretary’s work altering the schedule of childhood vaccines, noting that, although technically these are just guidelines, and states and families can still make their own decisions to vaccinate, anything that makes vaccination more confusing and difficult is a big win for viruses.

“For offering a gracious home to a parasitic brain worm, even for a time, and for his indefatigable efforts to reintroduce the noble measle back into the wild, we here at the Childhood Diseases Consortium (CDC) are proud to claim Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as one of our own,” a plaque reads. “For his work making the lives of those scientists still trying to do their jobs at the Other CDC a living nightmare, and for the many ways, large and small, that he advances the cause of viral disease, we offer this small tribute to our most ferocious advocate and strongest defender. Whether he is repeating the words gold-standard science until they lose all meaning, traveling the world with a personal holster of sauerkraut, or doing something we think is intended to be a pull-up, the secretary will always know that we’re honored to have him in our corner. Wherever we go, whomever we touch, we feel we’re carrying on his legacy.”

The evening was to feature a performance by a children’s choir, but too many of them are reportedly under the weather.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

You could almost detect the clenched teeth and pursed lips in Tulsi Gabbard’s social-media post. “President Trump promised the American people he would secure our borders, confront narcoterrorism, dangerous drug cartels, and drug traffickers,” the director of national intelligence wrote on X yesterday afternoon, days after the capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro. “Kudos to our servicemen and women and intelligence operators for their flawless execution of President Trump’s order to deliver on his promise thru Operation Absolute Resolve.”

It was Gabbard’s first and only comment on the raid. She has not always been so reticent about American pressure on Maduro. For many years, while serving as a Democratic member of the U.S. House, Gabbard was a leader of the clique that fiercely opposed American intervention abroad, casting it as part of a dark imperial history.

“The United States needs to stay out of Venezuela,” she posted in January 2019. “Let the Venezuelan people determine their future. We don’t want other countries to choose our leaders—so we have to stop trying to choose theirs.” A few weeks later: “The US needs to stop using our military for regime change & stop intervening in Venezuela’s military.” Still later that spring: “Throughout history, every time the US topples a foreign country’s dictator/government, the outcome has been disastrous. Civil war/military intervention in Venezuela will wreak death & destruction to Venezuelan people, and increase tensions that threaten our national security.” She was even clear on why the U.S. kept rattling its saber at Caracas. “It’s about the oil … again,” she wrote. (Justin Amash, another former representative and a critic of U.S. intervention, recently rounded up Gabbard’s past comments.)

Now Gabbard is a member of the administration, and the president whom she serves, Donald Trump, is saying openly that the whole thing is mostly about the oil. (Energy Secretary Chris Wright said today that the U.S. would control the Venezuelan oil industry “indefinitely.”) She’s gone from critic of imperialism to agent of it—and if she objects, she hasn’t done so publicly.

Gabbard is not alone as a noninterventionist suddenly cast into a tricky position. Steve Bannon, the president’s ex-consigliere, has also opposed U.S. military actions abroad. Bannon has neither the inclination nor, with a daily online broadcast, the ability to stay as quiet as Gabbard. Over the weekend, he praised the effectiveness of the military operation but questioned what comes next and whether Trump has planned for it: “So is this part of overall Hemispheric Defense, and we’re going to clean up this mess in Latin America? Or is this just the neocons talking him into it?” (This position puts Bannon in line with many mainstream Democrats.)

No silence has been so conspicuous as that of Vice President J. D. Vance. One of the few beliefs that he has not been quick to jettison for political advancement is his opposition to American military interventions, which he connects to his experience serving in Iraq. This spring, in a group chat to which Trump officials accidentally invited Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg, Vance grumbled to colleagues about strikes intended to preserve navigation in the Red Sea. “I just hate bailing Europe out again,” he wrote.

In recent days, though, Vance has been not only silent but absent. He was not present Friday night when the administration set up an impromptu war room at Mar-a-Lago, and he was also not part of the press conference the next day where Trump celebrated the mission and talked about taking over the Venezuelan oil industry. Instead, the front man for this operation has been Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was a foreign-policy hawk before remaking himself as a Trumpist; as it turns out, that wasn’t such a transformation after all. Rubio’s ascendance is notable because Vance and Rubio are widely understood as rivals for Trump’s mantle. (“I’ll give you $100 for every person you make look really shitty compared to me,” Vance told a Vanity Fair photographer last year. “And $1,000 if it’s Marco.”)

What all of these figures understand is the importance of staying on Trump’s good side. Bannon was exiled from the first Trump White House; he has since mastered the art of diverging just enough from the president that he sometimes takes flak but never gets banished from the fold entirely. Gabbard already saw the dangers of getting crosswise with the president when she implicitly warned against the bombing of Iran this past summer, before quickly falling back in line. One more break might get her sacked.

No one has as much to lose as Vance, though. He is clearly the front-runner to succeed Trump and is desperate to lead the MAGA movement once Trump leaves office, but yesterday’s January 6 anniversary is a reminder of how viciously Trump can turn on a vice president who doesn’t support him in all things—he even watched indifferently while a mob threatened to hang Mike Pence. Vance may not like what’s going on in Venezuela, though unless he says so, no one knows. Until then, his willingness to keep his mouth shut speaks loudly. For Vance, deeply held principles are fine, but staying in power is even more alluring.</div>

            <h2>Trump’s Heathen Heart</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-hegseth-venezuela-military/685530/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rudyard Kipling’s “Recessional” shocked its readers in 1897, when he wrote it for the complacent celebrations of Queen Victoria’s diamond jubilee. The poem read differently and more ominously after 1898, when Britain entered a wretchedly difficult and brutal three-year war in South Africa that shook imperial self-confidence as nothing had since the American Revolution.

President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth may have heard of Kipling, although it is doubtful that they have read him or any other versifier. But his words apply to them no less:

If, drunk with sight of power, we loose    Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe, Such boastings as the Gentiles use,    Or lesser breeds without the Law— Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, Lest we forget—lest we forget!

Naked imperialism is an ugly thing, and that contemptuous phrase, “lesser breeds without the Law,” unsettles any contemporary reader of “Recessional.” But for all of its ugliness, the poem also captured Kipling’s belief that imperial power was transitory, and that when exercised for nothing but ruthless self-interest, it was not only foolish, but dangerous and impious. George Orwell, whose opinion of Kipling was mixed (he called him a “good bad poet”), believed that by “lesser breeds without the Law” Kipling meant the Germans, and that the poem as a whole was “a denunciation of power politics, British as well as German.”

The American president has admitted that he has an addictive personality, which is why, to his credit, he is a teetotaler. But he and his aides are undoubtedly intoxicated with military power. “This was one of the most stunning, effective, and powerful displays of American-military might and competence in American history,” he said at the press conference following the seizure of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro. “No other country on planet Earth, and it’s not even close, could pull this kind of operation off,” Hegseth added. “And no other president has ever shown this kind of leadership, courage, and resolve. The most powerful combination the world has ever seen.” And Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller later told CNN’s Jake Tapper that “what we’ve witnessed under President Trump’s leadership this last week is one of the greatest foreign-policy and military victories this country has ever had.”

The Maduro snatch was, unquestionably, a remarkable feat of arms, and no tears need be shed about the removal of a man who was an enemy of the United States, a troublemaker in the region, and a tyrant at home. It is entirely conceivable that the outcome will be beneficial, leading to the eviction of Cuban and Iranian agents from Venezuela, much-increased pressure on the Cuban dictatorship, and even, by an unforeseen chain of events, some relief from oppression for the people of Venezuela.

The concerning thing is not Maduro’s removal, but rather the view of military power that Trump, Hegseth, and others seem to be forming. Hegseth boasted, understandably, that there were no American fatalities. There were, however, plenty of Venezuelan casualties and, according to Havana, 32 Cuban intelligence and military operatives killed. The administration’s expensively trained lawyers, high on credentials if low on scruples, may call this a law-enforcement operation, but blowing up buildings, shutting down Caracas’s electrical grid, and killing lots of uniformed people is about as warlike as it gets. And judging by what they later said, Trump and his lieutenants reveled in the combat they observed from the luxurious setting of Mar-a-Lago.

Commando raids of this type, and the units that execute them, fascinate politicians. The people are extraordinary, their actions spectacularly skilled, the hazards immense, and the immediate political payoffs great—if the raids succeed. Small wonder that the Trump White House put out its own Mar-a-Lago version of the famous Obama-administration picture of the president and his top advisers keenly watching the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. In that case, as in this one, there was precisely nothing the president and his entourage could do to affect the outcome, but it made them look like they were in charge—which, once the bullets began to fly, they were not.

Something similar holds true in limited air campaigns. Bombing offers gratification without commitment, a thing akin to the dating patterns of dissolute men, of whom the administration also has a few. These are ways of war that seem clean, limited, precise, and brief.

And so they are until they are not. The Trump administration no doubt thinks, as the Obama administration did, that by fighting this way, it can avoid getting bogged down in the kinds of counterinsurgency campaigns that the U.S. waged in Iraq and Afghanistan. The result in Barack Obama’s case was the withdrawal of most U.S. forces from Iraq—and then a new commitment to fight a deeply destructive third Iraq war against a resurgent Islamic State, and a 2011 intervention in Libya that opened the way to chaos spreading far beyond Tripoli and Benghazi.

The Trump administration also believes—a lesson, again, learned from Democratic presidents, such as Bill Clinton and Obama—that one can avoid consulting Congress before ordering U.S. forces to begin killing people. The Yugoslav wars and the Libya interventions were not preceded by authorizations of military force from Congress, unlike operations in either Afghanistan or Iraq conducted by the George W. Bush administration.

This is all dangerous stuff. Avoiding the deployment of 100,000 troops into Venezuela is no guarantee that American military action will not continue and expand, whether in response to terror counterpunches; attempts to break a de facto, if limited, blockade of Venezuela; or mere refusal to cooperate with the president’s desire to cop the profits from Venezuelan oil sales. In war, one thing leads to another.

Hubris is one of this administration’s deepest weaknesses, as is its predilection for bombast and chest-thumping. In a White House that insists on public sycophancy (and no doubt gets a full dose in private, too), the resulting chances of a misjudgment are considerable. Worse is the deliberate disconnection of the use of force from any kind of moral purpose. Miller gave the game away in his CNN interview. Americans, he said, must be “able to assert ourselves and our interests without apology,” before decrying “this whole period that happened after World War II, where the West began apologizing and groveling and begging and engaging these mass reparations schemes.”

Think about that. The United States should acknowledge no restraints, whether of law or morality, on what it does, and the policies that got us through the Cold War, the institutions we created, and the norms we asserted—unevenly, even hypocritically at times—were all for suckers. It is not surprising that Trump and his subordinates immediately began threatening a host of countries, including two of our allies, Colombia and Denmark.

Their statements, and others like them, are nothing less than a paean to force, applied when and as the United States sees fit, unconstrained by anything other than presidential whim. The situation is unlikely to end well.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">My friendships exist in silos. Each hangout is a feverish one-on-one where we share fries and eye contact, confessions, rants, gossip, and mutual attempts at amateur therapy. This patchwork of get-togethers structures my week: a Wednesday happy hour with one friend, a Saturday-morning walk-and-talk with another, a Sunday coffee date with a third. It’s exhilarating—we genuinely want to know how each other’s moms are doing.

Some days, though, I feel strangely lonely. While my social life looks like a loose archipelago of individuals, other people seem to operate in warm, robust units. I’m jealous when I see a circle of friends that looks like a miniature community. Groups seem like the norm if you watch sitcoms or use social media or just eat brunch at a restaurant. I too want to be forever laughing with half a dozen pals in one of our apartments on a random weekday, or squeezed into a dive-bar booth together.

If friend groups seem ubiquitous, so does a quiet underclass of people like me, bemoaning their lack of them. “I get really sad about it sometimes,” the lifestyle influencer Carly Silverman admitted on TikTok. A slew of companies have popped up to manufacture group hangs—essentially matchmaking strangers who are seeking a circle of friends, not just one-on-one connections. The common assumption appears to be that people with friend groups live fuller lives, or that they must have some superior qualities that attract hordes of people. “Most people who are happy have a close-knit, supportive friend group (or the equivalent like supportive/sprawling family),” one X post informed me, as I scrolled alone in a park on a sunny day, surrounded by groups of friends crowded onto picnic blankets. “Most people who are unhappy don’t.”

That sort of assertion had led me to believe that my constellation of one-on-one hangouts represented a failure to establish a crucial piece of adulthood. But friend groups, it turns out, are not the norm—research on how adult friendships are organized suggests that being part of one is a matter of luck, circumstance, and personal characteristics, such as extroversion and openness. Friend groups are real, of course. It’s just that they’re not the one and only way to avoid feeling lonely. In fact, in reporting this article, I came to realize that my lack of a friend group wasn’t making me lonely—it was more that I felt lonely because I feared that I was missing out on something everyone else had.

Loneliness is a feeling, which can make the source of it hard to pin down. It can mean different things to different people, which is one reason the highly publicized “loneliness epidemic” may not be an epidemic at all. Public conversations about loneliness tend to collapse a distinction between feeling lonely and being socially isolated—the latter is an objective state that doesn’t inevitably mean a person feels the negative emotions of loneliness. By some measures, it’s not clear that Americans are more isolated than in the past; some research suggests that they have just as many friends as they’ve always had. In 2024, the American Friendship Project, a research initiative tracking national trends in friendship over time, reported that a majority of respondents to its surveys said that they had five or more friends, which is similar to reported friendship numbers from 1970 to 2015.

Still, social scientists consider the feeling of not belonging to a friend group to be a notable contributor to loneliness. One of the most popular research tools for assessing loneliness is the UCLA Loneliness Scale, which—among other questions—asks participants to indicate how often they “feel part of a group of friends.” Cigna used the scale for a 2018 survey, which found that “most Americans are considered lonely” and that less than a third of respondents “always” felt part of a group of friends, which might indicate that a lack of friend groups can be a factor in people’s loneliness. In this sense, sweeping surveys such as this might count people like me—someone who has close friends but lacks friend groups—among the lonely.

People can experience different types of loneliness, Letitia Anne Peplau, the retired psychology professor who co-created the UCLA Loneliness Scale, told me. In the sociologist Robert Weiss’s 1973 book about loneliness, he distinguishes between “the loneliness of emotional isolation,” which he characterizes as “the absence of a close emotional attachment,” and “the loneliness of social isolation”—that is, “the absence of an engaging social network.” You might have a deeply meaningful relationship with your spouse, for example, and still feel lonely for lack of community. And the longing for a social network, he writes, “can be remedied only by access to such a network.”

Yet most friendships in the U.S. are unlikely to be the kind that involve regular, in-person hangouts with a wider group. According to the American Friendship Project, few people live with their friends, and nearly half live in a different city or state than their friends. Respondents, these data suggest, are not typically living in a Seinfeld-ian endless hang. “Friend groups seem to be increasingly rare—particularly because more people than ever leave their hometowns for college, and then leave college for hinterlands, forcing them to spread out,” Jaimie Krems, a professor and the director of the UCLA Center for Friendship Research, told me. “And yet, we study adult friendship so little, we don’t have a great handle on the extent to which this is true, for whom, and the impact.”

What some research does show is that certain personalities are more likely to seek out a crew: people who are extraverted, agreeable, and otherwise emotionally secure. Introverts, meanwhile, are more likely to cultivate friendships with fewer, but also closer, friends, because they “are very risk averse,” Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary psychologist who studies social bonds, told me. “When they go and knock on Jemima’s door in the middle of the night and say, ‘My world has fallen apart. Can you do something for me?’ they want to be absolutely certain that Jemima is going to say yes.”

The way people organize their friendships, researchers have found, tends to break down along gendered lines. In general, men seem more likely to form loose groups, while women seem more likely to have deeper, one-on-one relationships. “What matters for women’s friendships is who you are as an individual, not what you are, whether it’s what you do, or what ‘club’ you belong to,” Dunbar said. “Whereas for men’s friendships, what’s important is what ‘club’ you belong to, not who you are as an individual.”

Those who are lamenting the absence of a huge friend group should consider that the average number of close friends a person has is “very conspicuously five,” Dunbar said. The eponymous “Dunbar’s number” is his theory that there is a limit to the number of relationships a person can keep up, given the size of the human brain, and that this limit is consistent—though he’s not sure how many people have organized these five close relationships into a single circle, versus how many have created what he calls a “hub-and-spokes version” of mostly one-on-one friendships.

If friend groups aren’t required to abate loneliness, and apparently aren’t the standard, the question is why so many people still seem to want them. Some people, friendship researchers told me, could be mourning a version of friendship that exists predominantly on social media and TV. “As a general rule,” Peplau said, “feeling that we are not doing as well as others can increase our current level of distress.” This sense of FOMO is not exclusive to social-media scrollers. In the 1960s, Weiss, the sociologist, published research on married couples who moved to the Boston area from another state. The men established relationships through work, but the wives had “newcomer blues.” They wanted a version of what their husbands had, Weiss later wrote: “access to a network of women with whom they might establish and then discuss issues of common concern.”

That said, Peplau pointed out that it’s worth distinguishing between a brief pang of loneliness that comes from lingering on an influencer’s post about partying all night with their best friends and a calcified, recurring feeling of loneliness. That transient discomfort is not in the same category as feeling an aching sense of exclusion and disconnection.

Although people without friend groups aren’t automatically more lonely, having access to one can certainly help alleviate loneliness. Group friendships can offer benefits that some individual friendships cannot, social scientists told me. Dunbar cited research on social networks that suggests people in interconnected friend groups are more likely to be generous to one another, possibly out of fear of being outed as miserly to an entire group. If two people in a friend group have a conflict, in other words, the group may have enough structural support to withstand splintering. A friendship duo doesn’t always have those reinforcements.

Dunbar did tell me, though, that if you have been holding out hope for a friend group, then as long as you’re still alive, it is never too late. “There’s nothing to stop a group forming, coming together, and gelling really well at any stage,” he said. “It might be in your 80s; it might be in your 30s.” The pod, and the Sunday-night dinners, and the group trips: All of this is always possible—you might just have to engineer it. I still think it would be fun to have a friend group. But I also treasure the fact that I have versions of Dunbar’s example of close friendship: When I knock on a friend’s door in the middle of the night, I know they’ll let me in for gossip, mutual therapy, and to catch up on each other’s moms.</div>

Worse, we wedged an &quot;AI assistant&quot; into the silly thing as well.

The purpose of a screensaver was avoiding burn-in on screens prone to it, like CRTs and plasma displays.

LCDs and power saving modes mostly killed them off.

The Frame was the only TV that actually was flush against the wall.

Isn&#39;t the digital display of artwork, it&#39;s keeping advertisements out of the display.

If you get rid of all the premium seats, 100% of those people aren&#39;t going to be jammed into crappy economy seats. They&#39;ll look for other, likely more inefficient, ways to travel and they will all land on private aviation. The trend is going that way already.

Plus consider the economics, most airlines make a significant amount of their money from premium passengers. No way they&#39;ll go for this either.

Also, and highly relevant from an ancient @GSElevator Twitter joke:

Junior: Have you seen that new all-business-class airline thatâ(TM)s launching? It looks pretty great.

Junior: Well, everyone on the plane is in Business Class, so it&#39;s a better experience.

MD: Exactly. If everyone is in Business Class, then I&#39;m in Coach. Where do I sit to show I&#39;m better than you?

Exactly.  Pipe dream delusions.  I can fix this one thing without affecting anything else.

private aircraft is in nooo way comparable to a first class or any other &quot;premium&quot; seat, are you dumb?

....by getting rid of premium seats, ensuring flights are near full

So, you think that airlines are going to get rid of &quot;premium&quot; seats, which generate more profit.  Are you really that stupid and clueless?

Here in the USA, many people are obsessed with SUVs and trucks, yet they never go offroad, they don&#39;t use these vehicles for work, they just want BIG vehicles for a really stupid reason, all the other stupid people around them that insist on having a large vehicle.   Sure, there is a good use for having ONE larger vehicle in a family for when you need it, but the actual NEED for these huge vehicles is pretty low.

If you want to sell people on your &quot;save the world through misery&quot; bull***t, it has not worked, and it will not work.  It has been rejected by normal people every time it has been proposed, if not at the point of proposal, at the point where people realized the damage that those policies were going to do.

Even the EU is rolling back the ban on ICE powered cars in 2035.  Why?  First people can&#39;t afford them, and the infrastructure to charge them is lagging far behind.  Second, China is passing even Tesla in e

Second, my first response is, &quot;It&#39;s more complicated than putting more people on a plane.&quot;

-- More people = more weight = more fuel = more cost for all passengers-- Currently, coach and business class tickets pay for their extra amenities and subsidize coach/economy classes. Like toll lanes subsidizing local transit by bleeding the people willing to pay for extra convenience, they&#39;re a net benefit.

Lastly, making airline travel less GHG-intense per passenger is a good goal, b

Expect a boatload of spam from Exchange Online tenants. Followed by the imposition of rate limits.

This has been a cyclical phenomenon for several years, maybe a decade by now. Spammers abuse the system, Microsoft cracks down, Microsoft does a reorg, someone with no historical context reverses the throttling, the spammers come back, and the cycle repeats...

I wonder how many of the &quot;complaining customers&quot; were in fact astroturfing spammers.

Exchange Online customers who need to send legitimate bulk commercial email (for example, customer newsletters) should use third-party providers that specialize in these services.

Can someone translate that headline into English?

Microsoft is lowering limit on the number of external emails (outside of your domain) you can send from your Microsoft domain. If you truly need to bulk-send email, then use a 3rd party sender like Constant Contact or SendGrid.

I had a recent convo with one of our sysadmins at work recently, one of his main job duties is maintaining the servers in place for email and he had asked in a rhetorical way how long email has been around (since the 70s) and given the massive increase in spam/phishing that the Internet has seen especially in the last 1-2 years, how realistic it is to expect email to continue on as a service 15 or 20 years down the road.

It hadn&#39;t occurred to me before then that this was a possibility, but I see his point --

&quot;If you think your Mac is somehow Linux with a nice desktop and no tomfoolery, you&#39;re fooling yourself.&quot;

Who thinks that?  And is Linux the &quot;with tomfoolery&quot; option?

Making installed apps stop working?  What a controlling move, Apple.  If you think your Mac is somehow Linux with a nice desktop and no tomfoolery, you&#39;re fooling yourself.Unless Logitech did something very weird, this is likely to be a *major* bug.The whole reason for Apple requiring app signing to use a timestamping service is so that bulls**t like this doesn&#39;t happen.  Unless revoked, an app&#39;s signature is supposed to remain valid forever, so long the certificate was valid when the app was signed, even if the certificate has since expired.  If that isn&#39;t happening, then Apple needs to fix the regression in its code signature validation.

Sorry, but you are wrong: right in the original article summary &quot;Windows users were unaffected.&quot; I checked the website (https://www.logitechg.com/en-ph/innovation/g-hub.html): &quot;THERE IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH G HUB ON MACOS.

Nope, it IS UNIX with a nice desktop.  Linux is not UNIX, close but different.

Nope, it&#39;s UNIX with a castrated desktop. NeXTStep wasn&#39;t so stupid.

I only buy mice that have all configuration in the mouse itself and do not require any app or driver on the computer. Since I use both Linux and Windows machines via a KVM switch, that was a really easy decision. It was harder finding ones that match that requirement.

Personal preference? Check out Redragon (https://redragon.com/) keyboards etc. I&#39;m typing on YAMA K550. I use my KVM between OpenBSD, Linux, and Windows. Macros are stored in the keyboard and be recorded without host software. (Windows software is available, but not mandatory.) I have found the keyboard to be resilient. Their mice seem good also.

Logitech can do this, but it&#39;s kind of buried. You have to create a GHub profile with the settings you want, then transfer them to the mouse&#39;s &quot;on-board&quot; settings. This disables the ability to dynamically switch multiple profiles depending on the app that&#39;s running, though.

Signed binaries, certificate expired, MacOS won&#39;t let binary execute.

Developer certificate.Signed binaries, certificate expired, MacOS won&#39;t let binary execute.So if the developer goes out of business your apps stop working?  That&#39;s almost as good as having sketchy cloud SaaS locally on your computer!

No you just disable the option for the OS to require certificates for apps.

Obviously you need software, like a mouse driver.But, shouldn&#39;t all these features essentially be buttons. Shouldn&#39;t the OS be providing standardized interface to this?

I left windows for linux such a long time ago that news like this confuse me...

No problems with my ancient Logitech M557 on LInux.

No problems on my S100 bus CP/M machine either!

Some of the comments here show complete ignorance.  The Logitech app for their mice has zero to do with Apple!  Neither is it some &quot;consequence of using a Mac&quot;. Logitech even said, right in the original article summary, that their Windows G-Hub application was also affected!

The real problem, as I see it, is that too many utilities or applications people traditionally assume are stand-alone actually function interactively with cloud servers. When an SSL certificate expires, things break.

You don&#39;t even really need these additional software applications to use basic input devices like keyboards or mice, except 3rd. party manufacturers love to enhance these items with non-standard wheels, buttons, colored lights or sliders. The base operating systems don&#39;t recognize all of that extra stuff.

Ok, my confusion was with this statement:  &quot; Logitech has since acknowledged the situation and said that its G Hub app -- a similar management software for gaming devices under the Logitech G brand -- was also affected.&quot;

As far as I was aware, all those G branded gaming devices and the related G Hub software was primarily Windows-centric.  (Most gamers aren&#39;t using the Mac platform.)

I agree I made a false assumption there. But my original statements are still basically valid.  In this instance, they&#39;re compl

It&#39;s the same with their newer webcams - even basic functionality (e.g. zoom, focus) requires some clunky, slow, buggy &quot;Logi&quot;-branded application to be running all the time.

Probably because it saves them 4 or 5 cents a unit in manufacturing costs somehow...

I was thinking about changing my phone, the first thing I wanted to know how to avoid AI, how to disable AI, how to make sure there is no AI on my equipment. Thank you.

Not possible. Even the slowest processor can run AI algorithms, just a lot slower. No way to avoid it.

Browsers and apps can run simple inference or access remote services. This shit is going to be everywhere.

Define AI. Modern smartphones use ML tools and models everywhere, from text prediction to touch detection to voice recognition to photo processing. They&#39;re not just limited to chat bots.

If you&#39;re trying to avoid it, then that&#39;s just a software problem, not a hardware one. It&#39;s only a hardware problem if you&#39;re trying to get more of it.

A tech company with some early displays of a return to common sense.

Honest question: Could local text translation be a good use case for local ML models? Nice not having a remote translation service getting to know what text you read or write.That said, such things can probably be done OK enough without specific NPU:s.

(otherwise, agree it sounds like buzzword of the year, with usage of rather overestimated)

iOS is using on device machine learning models for text translation and dictation today.

The ads Iâ(TM)ve seen for AI tolls seem to be around word avoidance, ie having it summarize a document you were supposed to have read before the meeting. How does that create benefit for me as an employer?

That&#39;s mostly true.  I&#39;ve run some LLMs locally: they&#39;re slow and not very powerful, but there are times when having it local is nice for privacy.

I do expect this to change over time, with more operations being practical to run locally.  I would really like to have voice input be a local task, for example.

If I am getting a device that is AI enabled, what do I get? Does it do more for me? Not right now as a far as I can tell. I don&#39;t have any apps that require AI running on my device. It&#39;s because with AI the industry is putting the cart before the horse. If you buy the next gen graphics card or double memory, you know what the result is going to be. What if your device comes with an NPU? What capability does that bring to the device for a consumer? I&#39;m a techie and I know what a NPU does, but I have no reason to want one in my device other than to have one.

Now all that would change if I could add extra features and talk to my phone and have it run on the edge without having to be connected to a network. I would want an NPU if there was some cool application that required it. Right now I can&#39;t think of one.

First fix your batteries and charging systems. Every Dell laptop I&#39;ve ever had to throw out has been due to batteries that mysteriously stopped charging. And were no longer available for that model as OEM parts. Meaning I had to go with flamable Chinese after market option or relegate the device to permanent desktop duty.

I remember when floating point was the luxuriously optional silicon. I try to be welcoming to new things even if I don&#39;t know how/if I&#39;ll use them, because I think they don&#39;t really inflate the cost of the processors much. (Am I right? I don&#39;t actually know.)

Long-term, I think there&#39;s widespread consensus that integrated floating point was a good idea. Even less controversial, integrated MMUs are a critically necessary part of our modern world. (It&#39;s hard to imagine that separate chips like the 68851 used t

This is why it&#39;s so important to use Windows with a local-only login, if you must use Windows.

They&#39;re continuously making it harder to set up a new Windows computer without a Microsoft account.  At this point, someone without extensive experience and patience would be unable to do it.

Yes, they&#39;re making it almost impossible to do, but you can set it up with a Microsoft account then immediately create a local-only account, if necessary.

It&#39;s simple if you use Rufus to create the installation media, no harder than using MS&#39;s media creation tool, which if I remember correctly has a tendency to fail if you don&#39;t run it from the media that you&#39;re going to use for the image.

I disagree. What it needs is some patience and time. But it does not need deep understanding of Windows to do it. Yes, you may have to try several things and Windows installation is still surprisingly clunky and incredibly slow. But given what you win, investing a couple of  hours into it is well worth the time.

You know what they say: &quot;Windows is only free if your time has no value&quot;.

Avoid Windows Home, and it&#39;s still trivial. Just tell it during setup that you&#39;re going to join a domain, and then . . . don&#39;t. Instant local admin account. It can even be done without a password.

Not sure why anyone would ever deliberately use Home.

The TikTok that prompted the original article doesn&#39;t provide any screenshots, and I can&#39;t replicate the behavior he says happened. If you disable OneDrive Backup it clearly and simply asks you where you want to keep your files - online or local.

I understand everyone wants to hate the evil empire, but there are plenty of legitimate reasons to do so. You don&#39;t have to make stuff up.

Online can mean connected to your computer, that meaning predates the Internet.

If you have no problem with all your files being known to and used by Microsoft and being hung out to dry when their cloud has problems (again), sure.

Exactly. No such crap without a regular MS account. The additional work to install without MS account is well worth it for reliably disabling One Drive alone. Apparently other methods of disabling OneDrive are not reliable or complex.

Microsoft is really deep into enshittification these days. The crap they pull is incredible. In a sane world they would have no customers.

makes me so fucking angry... i mean it&#39;s already obviously illegal under existing laws, except that the legal system is too fucking stupid to recognize it

it&#39;s called theft, and just because it&#39;s happening on a computer doesn&#39;t mean that doesn&#39;t apply.  it&#39;s in my house, you&#39;re not allowed to come in and take shit.  Words cannot describe the level of contempt this deserves

I&#39;m 100% certain that you gave up any claims, buried somewhere in the 30 pages of user agreements that were clicked through during the installation or first run (OEM Windows).

Yeah, I&#39;ve also had problems with OneDrive automatically re-enabling itself after a Windows feature release update, and then backing up a bunch of temporary crap files and using up all of the &quot;free&quot; storage that comes with a Microsoft logon. ...and then you start getting notifications that you need to upgrade your storage. Yeah... I don&#39;t to pay extra to store a bunch of garbage temporary files. Back to the uninstaller you go!

What is this office [office.com] software you are talking about?

I&#39;m trying to learn all the new terminology, help me out here.

And if you want to turn it off, you flip a switch and everything gets put back.  No downloading, no youtube, no missing files, just a frikkin siwtch.

OneDrive wouldn&#39;t really be an effective synchronized cloud storage service if it didn&#39;t replicate a deletion.

Rather than resolving the issue by deleting files and expecting it to magically know that you&#39;re only looking to delete the online copies, you need to make sure all files are kept locally and then disable the backup (or remove your account from OneDrive). It won&#39;t delete the local files then.

I&#39;m not defending Microsoft&#39;s pushy attitude at all; that sucks.

Rather than resolving the issue by deleting files and expecting it to magically know that you&#39;re only looking to delete the online copies, you need to make sure all files are kept locally and then disable the backup And hope that a future update doesn&#39;t re-enable the backup.

It&#39;s not an &quot;effective synchronized cloud storage service&quot;, it&#39;s a virus.

A service would ask to be activated. A service would ask what you wanted to synchronize. A service would ask what you wanted to delete. A service would assume the local copy that is currently the default location would remain the default main location unless specifically changed.

There is no magic. There should be no assumption. It should be explained prior to activation and only activated by the user.

In my experience, OneDrive does ask to be activated, and it prompts you before it enables backups. It never asks what I want to delete, because it doesn&#39;t delete anything unless I&#39;ve told it to. In fact, I&#39;ve seen the reverse, OneDrive alerts me to local file deletions and ask if I&#39;m sure I want to delete those files online as well.

I&#39;m not sure a &quot;default main location&quot; makes sense for a cloud storage service that synchronizes across multiple computers and cloud storage. I want all the locations to be in sy

Microsoft&#39;s attitude is that users don&#39;t know what they want, so they&#39;ll want what Microsoft tells them they want.  That&#39;s always been their attitude and this somewhat recent notion that Microsoft isn&#39;t going as far to abuse its mo

Better yet, just uninstall OneDrive entirely when you set up a new computer. It&#39;s one of the very first steps for me.

(Yeah, you have to keep an eye on it in case it comes back during an update. But that&#39;s true of a lot of &quot;features&quot;.)

Honestly, these complaints are all self-inflicted.  You can turn onedrive off real easy.  You can prevent it from doing backups and redirecting folders with a switch.  You could even take the easy route of not connecting it in the first place.

This looks a lot like a Windows-exclusive problem. Everyone else ought to be fine.No, everyone [youtube.com] hates it.I, a macOS user, hate it even more, because I&#39;m stuck having to manage MS&#39; bullshit on relatives&#39; computers.

I have long ago moved my personal folders OUT of the stock provided directories (photos, documents, etc), initially out of convenience as I had a D: drive and wanted to keep stuff there rather than on the OS drive, but more recently it&#39;s been advantageous to stop MS from snooping around and trying to auto index my content for personal reasons or even auto-move it to OneDrive.

Learned to do that in the 00s, when windows recovery helpfuly recovered &quot;My Documents&quot; to the initial empty state.

Why haven&#39;t you just uninstalled OneDrive entirely?

OneDrive has been around a lot longer than the technology being marketed as AI.

It doesn&#39;t delete your files when you turn it off either. At least, it never has in my experience. When you disable OneDrive backup, it clearly asks you where you want the files to be kept. If you remove your account entirely, it leaves all local files in place. I find it really interesting that the TikTok at the root of the original article has no demonstration of the supposed behavior. It&#39;s just some dude ranting. I&#39;d really li

OneDrive makes it harder to move away from Microsoft and reduces the control users have over their data. That are the primary reasons MS is pushing it IMO.

What problem does OneDrive actually solve? I use it at work across multiple devices (one PC, one Mac, a Tablet, and a phone). With the file stored on the cloud, I can make changes to the file from any device and it is updated everywhere. Also if my device is lost, stolen, destroyed, bricked...all the files are safely backed-up. It is at no cost to me, and apparently unlimited storage (400 GB+ with no end in sight). In fact, work insists I store all my files there, even sensitive files (FERPA / HIPAA) rather than on the computer locally. So at least

AI is fairly secondary here, in that even if AI was not there to train on the data, MS would still prefer to be the source of truth hosting for all your personal files. This kind of surveillance far predates AI.

Their moving away from gaming hardware, and moving away from allowing people to own their software towards simply selling you a monthly pass that lets you play the games, dovetails with this. The new model where your own computer is the backup, and their cloud storage is the source of truth, isn&#39;t pr

The funny part of this is - OneDrive on MacOS is great. Seamless. Runs in the background. No issues. OneDrive on Linux - also great! Seamless. Runs in the background. Totally invisible. Never given me ANY issues at all.

It would be tragic if it wasn&#39;t so terribly funny.

You know what&#39;s better than OneDrive on Linux? It&#39;s called &quot;NAS&quot;. A spare, low-power computer with Linux and ZFS, and also OpenSSH. Combined with a cheap domain name (few bucks every couple of years) it allows me to access my files through sftp and rsync from anywhere in the world. And with sftp integration in Thunar, I can access them as if they were on a local drive from any of my machines. No headaches. And all my personal files are located on my own physical hardware.

I need a new computer and it is definitely going to be a Linux machine.

I still have no MS account on my 3 remaining Win11 installations. One of the direct benefits is that OneDrive does not work and does not mess with your files. I would remain without MS account even if that was the only benefit, because it is a pretty significant one.

Incidentally, if you pronounce &quot;OneDrive&quot; in German, it essentially becomes &quot;ohne Drive&quot;, which means &quot;without drive&quot;. Fitting somehow.

I just brought a new laptop for when I am off site. I disabled OneDrive and other such crap. Then unknown to me a windows update happened and onedrive started up copied all the files off the laptop and to some server somewhere.I only found out once I had driven 200 miles for a small weekend break, unpacked the laptop and switched on and all my files gone. Where I was was up in the mountains with no mobile signal so I could not download them, so for one day of my break I had to drive 60 miles to a local town

I had a nontechnical friend call me for help a while back when her C: drive started dying. She bought an external USB to back it up, but Windows kept giving &quot;Disk Full&quot; popup errors on this new, empty 4TB disk, and wouldn&#39;t copy any files.

I looked up the error code of the &quot;Disk Full&quot; message and found it was a OneDrive error. My friend was using File Explorer to do her backup, using drag and drop to copy to the new disk. Apparently, Windows takes this as a signal to copy the files to OneDrive, as well. But

... when Windows tried to prevent ransomware from running on your computer, rather than installing the ransomware as part of the default OS.

For a non-technical user, it is nearly impossible to know which files and directories are on OneDrive, and which ones are not. And, yes, you can disable OneDrive, only to have s later update re-enable it.

Maybe not do directly related, but I also keep tripping over more places that Windows lies to you about the file system. New example from today: a user thinks that their home directory is &quot;c:/users/Tom Smith&quot; but that doesn&#39;t work as a path. Turns out that the path is actually &quot;c:/users/toms&quot; (name change

You don&#39;t have to turn it on, it does ask.  You don&#39;t have to use it for backups, it does ask.  I just did it yesterday.

On Monday, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Adela Flores de Maduro were arraigned in a federal courthouse in New York City on charges of drug trafficking, continuing what has been a stunning first few days of 2026. The criminal proceedings—and likely trial—ahead are sure to be rocky and closely watched around the world. How exactly, though, will the Justice Department’s charges against the Maduros play in a court of law? We talked to an expert to find out.

“This is not a trumped-up case. This appears to be a real solid indictment,” Adam Pollock, a former assistant attorney general of New York and now a managing partner of the law firm Pollock Cohen, told me. Pollock believes the U.S. government has built an impressive case against the Maduros, with the indictment suggesting there are cooperating witnesses, recordings of drug deals, and direct links between the Maduros and Venezuelan drug-trafficking networks.

Still, the disturbing and complex facts of the Maduros’ arrest—during an apparently illegal military raid of the country Maduro was leading—makes this case anything but a slam dunk. While entering a plea of not guilty on Monday, the Venezuelan leader told the court that he had been “kidnapped.” “I am innocent. I’m a decent man,” Maduro said during his arraignment. The couple did not seek bail, and were transferred to a New York City jail. Their next court hearing is on March 17.

What comes next? What are all of the charges the indictment makes? What kind of defense could the Maduros use? I spoke with Pollock to get some answers to these questions and to understand the full breadth of the DOJ’s indictment. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Shirin Ali: After reading the entire indictment, how strong of a case do you think the DOJ has here against the Maduros?

Adam Pollock: This is a really robust indictment. You’re dealing with the Southern District of New York, the United States Attorney’s Office, which is a really serious office that doesn’t bring trumped-up political charges. If you compare this to the indictments of James Comey or Letitia James, that were super stamped-on details, very bare-bones, hard to know what the charges were. Why? Because those were vindictive political prosecutions. Here, we have a robust indictment full of detail, meetings, descriptions of events, and going back for, I think, almost two decades. And how do you get this information? You typically have to have either wiretaps or recording in the rooms, or what appears to be the case here is a witness who is cooperating.

There are quite a bit of allegations of actual meetings, payments, and involvement of the Maduros. This does not appear to be a case of him and his wife sitting up at the top of government and turning a blind eye to drug trafficking. To the contrary, there actually seems to be direct involvement.

Let’s start with Count 2, cocaine importation conspiracy. I was a little bit surprised here, because the State Department estimated 200 to 250 tons of cocaine were trafficked through Venezuela annually. That’s a lot of cocaine, but doesn’t strike me as a giant number. In general, the United States has had a long-held view that if you commit a crime abroad that affects Americans, then you’re subject to our jurisdiction. You can think about that in many areas, not just drugs, but financial crimes or child abuse. You can think of many areas where merely sitting abroad is not going to immunize you from the reach of American prosecution. And certainly we’ve had a long-held view that drug trafficking that affects Americans is subject to American jurisdiction. So that’s Count 2.

With Count 1, narcoterrorism conspiracy, basically what they are talking about is that the Maduro government apparently supported these rebel groups in Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia and the National Liberation Army. Those are designated terrorist groups within the United States, and it is long-standing American policy to oppose those groups and designate them as terrorists. The indictment is saying that the Maduro government supported them through helping them with drug trafficking. Count 3, possession of machine guns, sort of collapses back on itself and also gets to the question everyone’s asking: Is it lawful to arrest the sitting president of a country? Traditionally, there’s been a view in international law that it is not, and certainly that is a defense that Maduro will raise pretrial. In that trial, the United States is going to say that he was not the legitimate leader for two reasons. First, they’ll say Maduro was illegitimate because he was a drug trafficker—that is kind of a tautological argument, but it’s one that will be made. Second, they will say he stole the last two elections.

Is it lawful for heads of states to have armies that have machine guns? Probably. But if they’re really not legitimate heads of states, but actually drug traffickers, and they’re using those machine guns as part of a drug conspiracy, then that adds on as a charge. And then the last charge is the conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices, which is effectively, the same thing.

The indictment also charges Maduro’s son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra; two Venezuelan government officials; and a leader of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan transnational gang, as part of this narcoterrorism conspiracy. What exactly happens to them now?

Now you start to intersect politics with prosecution. Clearly there was a political motive to bring a large Army force to arrest Maduro and his wife. You don’t expect that a similar military operation would be mounted to arrest the other defendants. Instead, they’ll now lead a more constrained life, where they’ll need to be concerned that, if there’s a change of government, whether they’ll be continued to be protected if they travel abroad and where they can travel to. Life as an indicted felon is harsh, even if you’re abroad; you can kind of continue to live in sanctuary in Venezuela until the government changes. But eventually, there’s going to be a government, whether it’s next month or next year or next decade, that’s more friendly to the United States, and the United States will pressure that government to hand over the suspects.

Numerous times throughout the indictment, the DOJ references that the alleged crimes were committed as far back as 1999. Is there a statute of limitations the U.S. government has to work within? What should we make of this?

I noticed that, but the answer is not particularly anything to note, for two reasons. One is they’re going to argue that it’s an ongoing conspiracy. And second, even if they were unsuccessful in arguing that, they still have enough overt acts of the conspiracy within the statute limitation over the last five or six years.

What strategy do you think the prosecution will take and how do you expect the Maduros to defend themselves?

The latter is slightly more interesting, which is clearly the Maduros will argue that he should receive head-of-state immunity. They might argue that he was illegally kidnapped from Venezuela, but that’s a loser argument because the Supreme Court has been very clear since at least 1886. There is a case called Ker v. Illinois where the defendant was forcibly kidnapped from Peru and brought out to a U.S. Navy ship and then brought back to the United States for prosecution—sounds kind of familiar. The Supreme Court basically said that they’re not going to concern themselves with how the defendant reached the United States’ shores; as long as they’re here, they can be prosecuted. This Supreme Court has reaffirmed that time and time again. So can Maduro make that argument? Sure, but it’s going to lose. I think that he’ll have stronger grounds for making the head-of-state immunity argument, which is interesting when you consider ultimately how far can that argument take you. I guess to the Supreme Court, but what’s this conservative Supreme Court going to do with that? I wouldn’t expect great results for Maduro on that.

I think his best possible strategy is to challenge the evidence at trial. You’ve got to wonder; putting together a criminal drug-trafficking conspiracy case in Venezuela is a technically hard case to put together. They’ve got one cooperator, but you can cross-examine the cooperator, who’s cooperating in hopes of a more lenient sentence. Sounds like the prosecution has some recordings, and you can guess that they probably have some electronic intercepts, but my guess is that kind of old-fashioned trial defense is going to be their strategy here. Now, the prosecution strategy is the converse of that, which is roll up your sleeves and put on the evidence in the way that you would with any other drug conspiracy.

What happens next? How quickly do you foresee this case moving forward?

Not that long, although it depends a whole heck of a lot on how much evidence the government has collected. You’ll start to see that on the docket as the government makes disclosures of evidence to the defendants, known as discovery disclosures. There are cases where there are millions of pages and the defendant needs significant time to review millions of pages of emails, text messages, and listen to hundreds of hours of wiretaps. I suspect that this case is going to be light on paper, emails, and text messages, and my guess is there are not a ton of recordings, because it’s a bit more technologically challenging to get recordings in the room in drug deals in Venezuela. I think that this could be a case with relatively light evidence discovery, in which case you might see this go to trial within a year or so.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has a hard-earned skip in his step. After nearly a decade of obsequious, showy servility to the president he once warned would be the death knell of the Republican Party, Graham is getting what he wants: an interventionist Republican president merrily drawing up a list of baddies to take down, starting with captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Graham was one of the first to recognize, long ago, that Donald Trump’s policy views are determined mostly by the flattery of the last person to speak with him before a decision. For both of Trump’s presidencies, Graham has worked to flatter Trump at every turn, and to be the final person to do so. While Graham has his hands in a lot of policy jars, his passion is an interventionist foreign policy. That’s led to an ever-running proxy battle for Trump’s sympathies between himself and an ascendant noninterventionist “America First” foreign policy wing, as best represented in the Senate by Kentucky’s Rand Paul.

Graham couldn’t contain his glee on Sunday aboard Air Force One as he stood inches from Trump, shortly after the Venezuela operation.

The president was rattling through a list of countries in the Americas that would go down next. Mexico? “You have to do something with Mexico.” What about a mission in Colombia? “It sounds good to me.” And as for the big, bad hemispheric archnemesis of 70 years Cuba: “Looks like it’s ready for fall.”

“Yes!” Graham said, beaming with the glow of someone whose life had been leading to this very moment.

Aboard Air Force One, in his own remarks—which the president frequently interrupted with stray thoughts about how, for example, he would’ve taken out bin Laden before 9/11—Graham laid it on extra thick.

“We had Venezuela, we have Cuba, we have Colombia in our backyard. And these three countries have been condemned ever since I’ve been in politics,” Graham said. “Joe Biden put a $25 million bounty on Maduro’s head.” And “this commander in chief,” he added, “he did something people talked about doing.”

Graham isn’t just thinking about the “backyard” (a whole hemisphere), though. Also on Sunday—the senator was everywhere on Sunday—he appeared on Fox News with a message for another, more distant regime that he has long believed in changing. And he brought a prop.

“I pray and hope that 2026 will be”—here he paused to put on a baseball cap bearing the slogan he would then utter—“the year that we make Iran great again.”

Graham has been waiting for a moment like this for a while, ever since the failures of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars soured the public on the wisdom of nation-building. For a long time, Graham hitched his wagon to the celebrity of his friend and fellow hawk John McCain. Since McCain’s death, and with the rise of an isolationist element in the MAGA movement, Graham has been trying to work Trump in his direction. The kidnapping of one hostile foreign leader is, for Graham, a good start.

But not all is joyous in the Senate Republican conference. Just as much as Graham might sound as if he’s won the long fight for Trump’s foreign-policy orientation, Rand Paul is sounding as if he’s lost.

Paul reflected on Trump’s tenure Monday, speaking with reporters.

“Whenever I had misgivings about something else, I’d always come back and say, ‘Well, he’s the best we’ve ever had,’ much better than the Bushes, who were war-mad and wanted to be involved in all these crazy wars overseas and were going to make the world safe for democracy—I never liked any of that,” he said. “And I thought Trump was different. And so it disappoints me that he’s under the thrall of Lindsey Graham.

“There should be a law,” Paul continued, “that Lindsey Graham can only go to the White House every other week.”

How much credit does Graham give himself for persuading Trump to move in a more interventionist direction? I asked Graham this on Tuesday. He was smart enough not to bite, awarding credit for all critical thinking to the president.

“I’m just reinforcing what he told me in January 2025,” he said. “I had a talk with him. We have a drug caliphate in our backyard—look at it as a caliphate. Instead of complaining about it, let’s get rid of it. These are not, you know, unbeatable foes. And I think the American people would appreciate somebody finally stopping those who are poisoning Americans and making billions of dollars.” (Also: Get rid of Iran.)

Both Graham and Paul had throngs of reporters following them in the Capitol Tuesday, getting their sides of the long-running foreign-policy feud that had now swung dramatically in one direction. Paul was talking on the level of legality, and about how the administration’s arguments that Maduro’s capture was a law-enforcement operation, and thus not a military operation requiring congressional input, made no sense.

“If you say that we don’t have to declare war because this is a criminal” case, he told reporters, “it would basically be an argument you could go to any country where you had a beef, that you could get an indictment for them” and run a military operation to decapitate the state.

Rand Paul might have the law, but Lindsey Graham has Trump. I asked Graham if he felt that he had won the battle against Paul in favor of interventionism. Graham took issue with the term itself.

“This is not intervention,” he said. “This is protecting America. It’s not like ‘Hey, what are you doing today? Let’s go to Venezuela. Seems like nice beaches, good-looking people. Let’s take it.’ This is protecting America from threat.”

“Rand Paul”—he paused for a second and ever so slightly rolled his eyes, considering his words—“doesn’t believe that radical Islam is a threat. He would withdraw, he’d be America Fortress, America Fortress. There’d be no troops anywhere. Trump wants to protect the country.

“America First,” he summed it up, “is taking countries that hurt America and change them. Interventionism is going somewhere without a real good reason.”

That’s his story, and he’s sticking to it.

Since the demise of Roe v. Wade, red-state lawmakers have been looking for political cover for unpopular criminal abortion bans, and a simple strategy has emerged: stressing that bans in theory afford access in exceptional cases that voters overwhelmingly support, such as medical emergencies. The goal of this maneuver is straightforward. For voters who are conflicted about abortion, a focus on exceptions makes bans moderate and reasonable. But a major decision on Tuesday by the Wyoming Supreme Court striking down the state’s abortion ban suggests that abortion exceptions are fast becoming a Catch-22 for the GOP—a potential political lifeline that can create real trouble in court.

To appreciate why abortion exceptions can create legal headaches for Republicans, it helps to understand the Wyoming litigation. A group of patients, doctors, and advocates challenged the constitutionality of the state’s abortion bans under Article 1, Section 38 of the Wyoming Constitution, passed as part of the backlash to President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The amendment recognizes a right to make health care decisions. The plaintiffs argued that this right was fundamental and encompassed people’s decision to terminate a pregnancy. The state responded that abortion wasn’t health care—it was the intentional taking of human life—and that even if abortion were health care, the state’s interest in protecting prenatal life was enough to justify its ban. This focus on protecting life made strategic sense; all five justices on the Wyoming Supreme Court were appointed by Republicans, and polls suggest that even Americans who support legal abortion think fetal life has value, despite their opposition to the sweeping criminalization of decisions about pregnancy.

That’s where the plaintiffs pointed to the state law’s abortion exceptions: If the state really valued protecting fetal life, and if abortion wasn’t health care, the plaintiffs argued, these specific exceptions were a funny way of showing it.

Take the state’s exceptions for fatal fetal abnormalities, which apply only if a physician expects that a newborn’s death will occur within days of a live birth. The court asked how this exception made any sense. How did the state protect life by making women in other cases when death of the newborn was just as certain—but who had a longer timeline to sit with that doomed outcome—carry their pregnancies to term? Given that pregnancy could pose risks to abortion seekers, the justices thought the fetal-abnormality exception threatened patients’ health without advancing the state’s supposed goals.

The same was true of Wyoming’s exceptions for medical emergencies, which explicitly excluded mental health crises, such as depression or psychosis, during pregnancy. The state presented no evidence that mental health wasn’t an issue during pregnancy—and no wonder: Mental health conditions accompany a significant number of pregnancies and can lead to seriously adverse outcomes.

Even the state’s rape and incest exception was a problem. The court’s justices didn’t see any connection between the state’s supposed goal of protecting all life in the womb and allowing abortions in cases of sexual abuse, and neither should anyone else. If the state believes that life or even rights begin at fertilization, it’s hard to comprehend why that wouldn’t be true in instances of sexual assault too.

That Wyoming’s abortion exceptions were weird and incoherent shouldn’t be a great surprise. In recent years, any abortion-ban exception reflects an inherently odd compromise between the demands of anti-abortion lobbyists and the electoral needs of GOP lawmakers. Republicans want to win election. That requires keeping a lid on the most heartbreaking stories, narratives that can shape the vote well outside the state where a tragedy has occurred. Abortion opponents want as many abortions as possible stopped, with the exception of a vanishingly small number of serious threats to life.

Conservative lawmakers thus propose exceptions to make abortion bans seem less harsh. Exceptions, ultimately, are a mere messaging strategy, one that undermines the legal case for abortion bans.

That’s reflected in the oddball design of many exceptions. Medical-emergency exceptions, for example, are meant not so much to give physicians real discretion in addressing urgent conditions as to rule out certain cases (such as threats to mental health) that abortion foes dismiss as “abortion on demand.” Rape-and-incest exceptions, like Wyoming’s, often contain reporting requirements intended to ferret out patients who “cry rape,” a solution in search of a problem in a culture in which sexual violence is massively underreported and rarely prosecuted. In a big-picture sense, exceptions are intended to broadcast that abortion bans are far less harsh than they appear, but on closer examination, they’re designed as much to reassure conservative lawmakers that people won’t be able to get abortions anyway.

And exceptions don’t work—by design. Historically, very few patients have sought out abortions under exceptions. That trend has continued—so much so that red states like Texas and Kentucky have passed laws said to clarify that some abortions are justified under state law. That state of affairs suits conservative lawmakers, who seek the political benefits of exceptions with none of the real abortion access they might afford.

The Wyoming Supreme Court’s ruling in State v. Johnson sends a message that this have-it-both-ways strategy on exceptions won’t always work as Republicans expect. The court saw the very same inconsistencies of exceptions as a sign that they didn’t deliver on the state’s purported goals.

It’s not clear what will come next in fights about abortion exceptions. More challenges like Johnson might come before state supreme courts, given that a number of conservative states, including Oklahoma, Ohio, Alabama, and Florida, have similar health amendments in their constitutions. But Republicans are doubling down on exceptions as a strategy: In Missouri, for example, voters will decide on whether to repeal a reproductive rights amendment passed in 2024. GOP lawmakers have tried to package the repeal amendment as allowing abortion in exceptional cases, like medical emergencies.

Republicans may think this strategy is working; some polls suggest that supporters of abortion rights are less passionate about the issue than they once were. That likely has much more to do with conservatives’ struggles to enforce abortion bans—abortion seems more, not less, common in many ban states since the fall of Roe—than with exceptions. But even when voters are willing not to look hard at what an exception really says and does, the Wyoming decision shows that the same might not be true of courts.

The Trump administration’s justifications for bombing Venezuela and arresting its president shifted in real time this weekend. Was this a national security–related counternarcotics operation, an oil heist, or a regime-change play to topple a dictator?

That lack of clarity—combined with the administration’s propensity to, well, tell a lot of lies—only added to the mass confusion over what’s really going on. After all, Donald Trump’s Venezuela adventure isn’t an isolated incident, and it’s best understood in proper historical context: the long tail of U.S. intervention in Latin America.

To help make sense of what just happened, and to get answers on what might happen next, I turned to Tiziano Breda. He’s a senior analyst covering Latin America and the Caribbean at ACLED, the independent conflict-monitoring organization that tracks political violence and protests worldwide. Breda has spent more than a decade studying Latin American politics and security.

In our conversation, he unpacks how this operation fits into the long arc of U.S. intervention in the region, the internal dynamics of Venezuela’s ruling “Chavista” coalition, the role of oil, and why the most dangerous consequence of this moment may not be what happens next in Caracas, but what it signals across the world. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Aymann Ismail: There’s so much in flux right now. What are the most important things we still don’t know about what’s happening between the United States and Venezuela?

Tiziano Breda: There are at least three variables that remain unclear. The first is how this will play out inside Venezuela now that Maduro has been removed. What has this generated within the Chavista power structure—in the government, the military, and across different sectors of society? What comes next depends on factors like whether Delcy Rodríguez [Venezuela’s acting president] can ensure continuity for the Chavistas while at the same time becoming somewhat more lenient toward U.S. interests.

The second is how this strike is being received in the United States. There has been backlash from Congress. The Trump administration has framed it as a law enforcement operation, but lawmakers say they were bypassed and are questioning the legality of the operation. The key question is how this lands with a Trump support base that is, in principle, uninterested in foreign interventions.

And third, at the international level, it’s still unclear how other major powers are interpreting this—whether they oppose it or see an opportunity. For countries like Russia and China, the question is whether this represents the loss of an ally, a precedent that could be applied in their own spheres of influence. For China in particular, it would mean not recovering the billions of dollars it still has as credit with Venezuela.

This didn’t come out of nowhere. There were months of escalating tensions. How does this moment fit into the longer U.S.–Venezuela standoff? Were you surprised when Trump announced the U.S. captured Maduro?

When Trump took office, his administration was mostly focused on immigration. Marco Rubio struggled with Richard Grenell over whose voice would be more influential in the White House on Venezuela. For the first few months Grenell seemed to have the upper hand: There were prisoner exchanges, deportation flights, Chevron’s license was renewed. But in 2025, Rubio established himself as a key strategic adviser on Venezuela. There was a noticeable shift: military buildup in the Caribbean, harsher rhetoric and labeling organized crime groups as terrorist organizations, allegations tying Maduro to some of them.

That framing was used to justify strikes against suspected drug-trafficking vessels—at least 34 so far with over 110 confirmed fatalities—not only in the Caribbean, but also in the Pacific. When that didn’t produce cracks within Maduro’s administration, we saw an escalation: oil tankers seized or chased, and a blockade on Venezuelan oil. That caused much more damage to the Maduro government’s ability to keep revenues afloat, yet there were still no cracks in Maduro’s network of alliances. So Trump was left with two options: either back down and strike some kind of deal or escalate. There had already been a CIA strike in late December, but I did not expect an operation of this kind.

The U.N. has already said this violates international law. Is there any real ambiguity here?

I’m not an expert on international law, but it’s my understanding that the U.S. does have the right to try someone in the United States for crimes that may have affected the U.S., such as drug trafficking. Thousands of drug traffickers have gone through this process. But I’m much less sure that this means the U.S. has the authority to go and extract Maduro from another country. Usually, the United States would request the extradition of a person believed to have committed a crime in the U.S. I’d say there are serious deficiencies in the legality of the operation.

The closest precedent, at least in Latin America, is the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989, to capture and extract President Noriega on drug-trafficking charges. That operation was on a much larger scale and far more costly in terms of lives, duration, and scope. But it occurred in the context of the Cold War—a moment in history that preceded the era of multilateralism, international governance, and the development of international human rights norms. I’m concerned, seeing a return of this practice in 2026. It suggests much of what was built after that period is now unraveling, or being dismantled by the United States.

So what does the future of Venezuela look like? Rodríguez seems to be in control. Rubio is saying that she’s illegitimate. Do you see regime change on the horizon? Not in the short term, unless Rodríguez is unable to do two things. She needs to avoid taking a confrontational stance toward the United States, and instead strike deals and make concessions in the oil sector. Simultaneously, she needs to project an image of someone who remains loyal to Chavismo principles—respect for national sovereignty, resistance to excessive U.S. imperial practices, and so on. If she manages this balancing act, avoiding further U.S. strikes while preventing fractures within the Chavista ranks—both in the military and in social networks—Venezuela can stabilize in the short term. But if either of these fails, I think more violence is likely.

The United States has declared they intend to run the country. How will that complicate Rodríguez’s ability to stabilize Venezuela?

The U.S. is looking to ensure that this removal leads to more functional agreements with the Venezuelan government—guaranteeing U.S. companies can get in more freely, invest, settle, and sell all the oil they can pump. A full-fledged regime change does not seem to be the main goal of the Trump administration in the short term. They are aware that the [Venezuelan, anti-Maduro] opposition may have popular support, but they do not have the buy-in of the military in particular. Installing a government without military support would carry the risk of throwing the country into chaos.

Is there something about the way that the Venezuelan government is set up that will make it particularly challenging for Rodríguez to consolidate?

Like all governments and political forces, the Maduro government—the Chavistas—has its own internal currents and branches. Maduro, and particularly Cilia Flores, are relevant here. Their removal matters because Maduro and Cilia Flores had managed to pacify the different factions within Chavismo and build a system in which elites could extract wealth from Venezuela.

For example, the military benefited from revenues from the gold-mining sector. The security sector, some would say, participated in illegal drug trafficking, and of course benefited from oil and shipping. There was a balance, and wealth was distributed among military, economic, and political elites in a way that kept the system stable. Rodríguez may try to replicate this, but she will be dealing with a very different level of U.S. pressure than Maduro faced. There may also be Maduro loyalists who obstruct her government. So even if the overall architecture remains in place, simply replacing the person at the top will have repercussions across the entire government.

What role does oil actually play in all of this? I look at a country like Saudi Arabia and think, Wow, they got lucky they have so much oil. Why was this not necessarily possible for a place like Venezuela?

The key difference between Maduro and Chávez is that Maduro politicized the oil sector too heavily. When Chávez was in power, Venezuela benefited from a boom in energy prices in the mid-2000s. He also appointed people with technical expertise to manage the oil sector. When Maduro came to power in 2013, in a quest to consolidate his authority, he replaced almost all the Chavistas he didn’t trust—including the minister of oil—and replaced them with loyalists who lacked knowledge of the sector. That lack of understanding began to create problems with maintenance, delays, production failures, and so on.

Then you had the plummeting of oil prices about 10 years ago, which hurt Venezuela’s revenue. Even before the U.S. sanctioned the oil sector in 2019, under the first Trump administration, the sector was already collapsing due to corruption and overall mismanagement. They could still maintain significant production—almost a million barrels a day—but that was down from 3 million about 15 years earlier. With that, they had enough money to sustain the elites, but the rest of society and the broader economy collapsed. That’s why you had around 8 million Venezuelans fleeing the country, as the government itself remained intact.

Up until last week, Nicolas Maduro was challenging the United States to invade, publishing videos of his military conducting drills. I know a little bit about his background, that he was originally a bus driver. What can you tell me about his character?

The role of Cilia Flores [Maduro’s wife, who was also arrested] is often overlooked. Some people refer to her as the power in the shadows, operating behind the scenes. Maduro did not reach his position alone. Flores was a key figure in liaising with the different branches of the Chavismo project. She has been head of the National Assembly, a deputy, and a minister. Her political trajectory was similar to Maduro’s, even though it was Maduro who was appointed by Chávez as his political heir. Maduro relied heavily on Cilia Flores, who played a key role in holding his government together.

Maduro also made use of humor and self-parody as a political tactic. He presents himself as a funny, silly, good guy. He even created a cartoon version of himself called “Súper Bigote,” or “Super Mustache.” I can’t think of another leader who has leaned so heavily into laughing at himself. He uses that strategy to conceal the authoritarian nature of his government, to soften accusations of massive human rights violations, suppression of dissent, waves of political arrests, extrajudicial killings, and so on.

And then you see the images of him being detained in the United States. He has a big grin, giving two thumbs up. What explains that?

There was also an attempt to keep the character going, to play on the empathy of the audience, watching a guy who, in another context, might greet you with a thumbs-up and say “Happy New Year.” He appears certain of his innocence, as though he believes he will be released once the truth comes out. While the aim of the United States might have been to show that a man who had been in power since 2013—so for over a decade—who had seemed untouchable was being brought down to the level of a common criminal.

I haven’t seen much from inside Venezuela. How are Venezuelans reacting inside the country?

At ACLED, we have so far recorded only two protests inside Venezuela, and both were in favor of Maduro. It’s not only that there are no protests, there has also been a decrease in traffic and economic activity over the past couple of days. Inside the country, the government has imposed a state of emergency and deployed military forces to the streets, which has disincentivized mobilization. Uncertainty is also playing a key role. There have been mixed messages coming from the United States—the sidelining of María Corina Machado [prominent opposition leader and recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize], the attempt to reach an agreement with Rodríguez, who is part of the same system as Maduro, and the broader fear that if this doesn’t work out, it could trigger chaos within the Chavista ranks and lead to violence. So I think people are avoiding the public sphere.

And what about abroad? How are Venezuelans in the diaspora reacting to this?

The vast majority of Venezuelans abroad have celebrated Maduro’s removal from power, though not as many agree with the way it happened through the bombing of Caracas. Most Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years did so either because of political persecution or because of the economic collapse caused by the Maduro administration.

It’s strange to see people celebrating the bombing of their own country.

It is. But it’s a testament to the level of discontent and anger toward an administration that has effectively dismantled the country’s economy. Twenty years ago, Venezuela was the wealthiest country in South America. Today, roughly a quarter of the population has been forced to leave because the economy collapsed. The relief—if not outright celebration—among many Venezuelans reflects that deep discontent with the Maduro administration.

How are other leaders and peoples in Latin America reacting to this?

There has been a mixed reaction. Leftist governments like Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico have strongly condemned the U.S. action. On the other hand, more right-wing governments like Argentina, Ecuador, and the newly elected president of Honduras have been more supportive, and in some cases even enthusiastic about the operation. The divisions have been quite clear along ideological lines.

For people particularly in countries that have been most affected by the influx of Venezuelan migrants and refugees—Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Chile—the arrival of Venezuelans has strained public resources, and in some cases it has been instrumentalized by xenophobic political figures, creating a stigma.

Maduro is widely perceived as the main cause of Venezuelan migration and is deeply unpopular. There was polling showing that, across Latin America, and particularly in the countries most affected by Venezuelan migration, many people were already in favor of major intervention in Venezuela, even before this happened.

The U.S. seems to be configuring the reasoning for capturing Maduro in real time, offering conflicting information. What do you think is really driving the U.S. here, and what’s bullshit?

There are three reasons. First, reasserting U.S. dominance in the hemisphere, especially actors seen as being in cahoots with the U.S.’s main global competitors, Russia and China. Second, widening U.S. access to energy and other resources. Venezuela is rich in gas, minerals, and gold, and expanding U.S. access to those sectors is strategically important for the American economy. Third is migration. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans live in the United States, and millions more across the region. By removing what is perceived to be the country’s main problem—Maduro—and projecting the image that the U.S. will now invest in Venezuela, the administration is trying to create a picture that things have improved and encourage Venezuelans living in the U.S. without legal status to return.

The BS part is drug trafficking, which is paradoxically the legal rationale being used to bring Maduro to justice. He’s being charged with drug trafficking, terrorism, and weapons offenses. But the narrative that Maduro himself is a central drug-trafficking threat—and that attacks on drug vessels or even Maduro’s trial will significantly reduce the flow of drugs to the U.S. or elsewhere—doesn’t really hold up.

This is a return to a more assertive U.S. approach toward Latin America. It’s something that had waned over the years and been replaced by a greater emphasis on regional cooperation through institutions like the Organization of American States, and by U.S. soft power projected through development projects. This attack marks a clear end to that era and a return to one in which the United States is willing to use its full power—economic, diplomatic, and military—to ensure that its preferences materialize in the region. It’s somewhat anachronistic, but it’s a renewed version of the Monroe Doctrine, which held that the U.S. has a responsibility to influence and direct political, economic, and military developments in the hemisphere, and to keep external forces from undermining its interests.

Does the speed at which Donald Trump pivoted to Greenland and Mexico reveal anything about how he might be thinking about Venezuela?

Trump may feel emboldened because it has cost the United States little in terms of human lives and equipment, which he emphasized repeatedly during his press conference on Saturday. Let’s see what the U.N. Security Council says and what comes next, but for now the international cost also appears limited. Whether more action happens in the immediate future will depend on how the situation in Venezuela unfolds. If it triggers domestic turmoil, violence between different factions of Chavismo, or broader social unrest, then it becomes less likely that this approach would be applied elsewhere. Paradoxically, if it works, there is a risk that it could be repeated in other contexts.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">exclusive The European Space Agency on Wednesday confirmed yet another massive security breach, and told The Register that the data thieves responsible will be subject to a criminal investigation. And this could be a biggie.

Earlier in the week, Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters told us that they gained initial access to ESA&#39;s servers back in September by exploiting a public CVE, and stole 500 GB of very sensitive data. This, we&#39;re told, includes operational procedures, spacecraft and mission details, subsystems documentation, and proprietary contractor data from ESA partners including SpaceX, Airbus Group, and Thales Alenia Space, among others.

And, according to the crims, the security hole remains open, giving them continued access to the space agency&#39;s live systems.

&quot;ESA is in the process of informing the judicial authorities having jurisdiction over this cyber incident to initiate a criminal inquiry,&quot; an ESA spokesperson said via email. The agency declined to answer The Register&#39;s specific questions about the intruders&#39; claims.

This comes about a week after ESA copped to a December security incident that saw a crim list more than 200 GB of ESA data for sale on the still-not-dead BreachForums.

According to a Shiny Lapsus$ Hunters spokesperson and sample files seen by The Register, the stolen goods appear to include both internal files and documents originating from contractors. This spans operational procedures, contingency plans, system capabilities and security protocols, spacecraft tolerances and failure modes, Earth Observation (EO) satellite constellation details, and other documents related to managing satellite orientation and position.

Contractor data allegedly exfiltrated in the breach belongs to SpaceX, Airbus Group, Thales Alenia Space, OHB System AG, EUMETSAT, Sener, Teledyne, Leonardo, Deimos Imaging, Sitael, SkyLabs, ISISPACE, and others.

Plus, the stolen files allegedly include sensitive information about various space programs and ESA missions such as Greece&#39;s national space program, ESA&#39;s Next Generation Gravity Mission, its FORUM (Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring) Earth Explorer Mission, and TRUTHS (Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Terrestrial- and Helio-Studies).

According to the extortionist crew, ESA has known about the breach for at least a week and also downloaded the sample data.

This is not ESA&#39;s first – or even second or third – security snafu. The space agency&#39;s incidents have been piling up since at least 2011.

In addition to the post-Christmas data dump last month, attackers hit its online store was in 2024 shortly before the holiday, with miscreants inserting a fake payment page to nab customer info belonging to users shopping for space-themed Christmas presents.

At the time, ESA said that it&#39;s not in charge of its own online store.

Additionally, a trio of ESA domains were compromised in 2015 via an SQL vulnerability, resulting in the theft and leak of information belonging to thousands of subscribers and some ESA staff.

And in 2011, someone broke into ESA&#39;s systems and then published administrator, content management, FTP login credentials, and Apache server config files online – although the agency said this didn&#39;t affect its internal networks. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US government has secured a guilty plea from a stalkerware maker in federal court, marking just the second time in more than a decade that the US has managed to prosecute a consumer spyware vendor successfully.

Bryan Fleming, creator of stalkerware called pcTattletale, pled [PDF] guilty in the Southern District of California federal court on Tuesday to one count of selling software designed with the primary purpose of intercepting communications, with an interstate commerce element, in violation of federal law.

According to the plea agreement, Fleming sold the stalkerware from Michigan. In at least one instance, it was purchased by a buyer in the Southern District of California, allowing the case to be filed there. The plea agreement states that Fleming started advertising pcTattletale in 2017 &quot;to persons wanting to spy on spouses or partners without their knowledge.&quot;

Like other forms of stalkerware, which are essentially consumer-grade spyware like the type used with impunity by nation-states, pcTattletale was designed to be installed on both computers and mobile devices, delivering copies of text messages, emails, phone calls, geolocation information, and web browsing history to an online portal where buyers could monitor a target&#39;s activity without that person&#39;s knowledge.

In the case of pcTattletale, court documents indicate that the stalking was performed via video capture, with the software recording the victims&#39; every move whenever their device was unlocked.

As reported by the Detroit News in December, federal law enforcement agents with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement&#39;s Homeland Security Investigations division had been investigating Fleming since at least 2021. pcTattletale was singled out because it was specifically marketed for unlawful spying on partners and spouses, an HSI agent wrote in a search warrant affidavit for Fleming&#39;s home filed in November 2022, but not unsealed until last month.

There are a number of stalkerware companies operating in the United States, and their use has surged in recent years despite sloppy coding leading to security incidents that leaked the details of hundreds of thousands of customers, like what happened to mSpy (multiple times), Catwatchful, and - you guessed it - pcTattletale.

Fleming&#39;s company went bust in 2024 when it was hacked, leading to the exposure of 138,751 customer accounts, along with device information, IP addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, text messages, and a good deal of victim information as well.

Fleming is due to be sentenced later this year, when he&#39;ll be facing up to 15 years in prison, a fine of $250,000, forfeiture of all property that was involved in the offense, and additional penalties.

As noted above, this is only the second time since 2014 that the US government has secured a guilty plea in a stalkerware case. In the prior instance, Hammad Akbar pled guilty to distributing stalkerware called StealthGenie.

Whether two guilty pleas in 12 years will be enough to stem the stalkerware tide is questionable, but a second case on similar grounds - selling software designed to snoop on people without their knowledge - at least suggests victims have recourse and that federal law enforcement has found a solid justification for bringing charges.

We reached out to several anti-stalkerware advocates for comment and will update this story if we hear back with their analysis. ®

            <h2>FAA signs radar deals to drag US air traffic control out of the 1980s</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/07/faa_radar_atc_deals/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US government has announced contracts for new radar infrastructure as part of its long-running effort to replace the country&#39;s aging air traffic control system.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) disclosed that contracts have been signed with both Indra Group and RTX Corporation, formerly Raytheon Technologies, to deliver modern radar systems for the overhauled system.

Separately, RTX said that its subsidiary, Collins Aerospace, has secured $438 million to support the Radar System Replacement program, while Indra indicated it has been awarded $342 million to manufacture next-generation air traffic surveillance radars.

RTX already develops the AN/SPY-6 family of radar kit used by US Navy ships, and various other military radar systems.

The news follows the announcement in December that security and technology services company Peraton had been chosen as the prime integrator, with overall responsibility for building the imaginatively named Brand New Air Traffic Control System (BNATCS).

US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy exclaimed at the time that he was &quot;thrilled&quot; to be working with Peraton because they &quot;share President Trump&#39;s drive to modernize our skies safely at record speed.&quot;

Commenting on the announcement, FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said: &quot;Our radar network is outdated and long overdue for replacement. Many of the units have exceeded their intended service life, making them increasingly expensive to maintain and difficult to support.&quot;

The FAA expects RTX and Indra to deliver replacements for up to 612 sites by June 2028 with modern, commercially available surveillance radar sets. It claims that the first installations are scheduled to begin this quarter, and upgrades will then proceed on a rolling basis, prioritizing high-traffic areas.

As well as replacing the radar, the FAA aims to consolidate the 14 different configurations in the current National Airspace System in order to simplify maintenance and logistics.

While the US likes to claim that its air traffic system is the safest in the world, it is antiquated, with much of the infrastructure dating to the 1980s or even earlier. There were revelations last year that the system was still running with floppy disks and information on scraps of paper.

Previous attempts at an upgrade proceeded at a snail&#39;s pace, with the expectation that they would not be complete before 2030.

Last year, Duffy unveiled ambitious plans to accelerate the overhaul after a report revealed that more than a third of the air traffic control systems were in an &quot;unsustainable&quot; state.

Funding for this was approved as part of President Trump&#39;s budget bill last year, which allotted $12.5 billion for the BNATCS program. It is expected that another $20 billion will be required to finish the job.

Welcoming the move, Indra said it was fully aligned with the FAA, the US Department of Transportation, Congress, and the Trump administration in delivering a safer, more resilient, and future-ready National Airspace System.

Nate Boelkins, president of Avionics at Collins Aerospace, commented: &quot;As a trusted supplier to the FAA for more than 70 years, Collins is ready to rapidly deploy next-generation radar systems that replace outdated technology with a single, modern and interoperable solution.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">With less than a month to go until NASA attempts to send astronauts around the Moon, the agency is demolishing facilities that got it there the first time around.

Twenty-five structures at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama are slated for removal, with two test stands set for controlled implosion no earlier than sunrise on January 10, 2026.

Propulsion and Structural Test Facility (credit: MSFC, photographer: Fred Deaton)

The Propulsion and Structural Test Facility - also known as the T-tower - was built in 1957 by the US Army Ballistic Missile Agency and transferred to NASA in 1960. It played a role in the development of the F-1 engine, which powered the first stage of the Saturn V, as well as the S-IC itself. It was also used to test the Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters.

Also on the chopping block is the Dynamic Test Stand, which, at 360 feet, was tall enough for full-scale tests of the Saturn V rocket and was the first location where all Space Shuttle elements – the external tank, solid rocket boosters, and orbiter – were integrated.

Crews have already begun demolition of the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator – a 1960s-era underwater facility where astronauts could be dunked to simulate near-weightlessness and test hardware procedures (including those required for servicing the Hubble Space Telescope). It&#39;s long been replaced by a facility at Johnson Space Center in Houston.

All three were designated National Historic Landmarks in 1985, but maintaining them is no longer economically viable.

&quot;These structures are not safe,&quot; said acting center director Rae Ann Meyer. &quot;By removing these structures that we have not used in decades, we are saving money on upkeep of facilities we can&#39;t use.&quot;

The facilities have been documented in detail, but it&#39;s still a loss of a tangible connection to NASA&#39;s past.

NASA warned communities near Redstone Arsenal to expect a &quot;loud noise associated with the demolition on the morning of Jan. 10.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Fancy having an AI system packed with Nvidia H200 GPUs that you can take with you from place to place? According to hardware maker Odinn, now you can, so long as you don&#39;t mind carrying a 35 kg (77 pound) box around.

At CES this week, Odinn is showcasing its Omnia system that combines AMD EPYC 9965 CPUs with up to four Nvidia H200 NVL GPUs and 6 TB of memory, all in a single enclosure with a 23.8-inch display – and carry handles.

This it describes as &quot;roughly the size of a carry-on suitcase,&quot; though we wouldn&#39;t like to try lifting a 77 pound weight up to an overhead locker and wedging it in, and we doubt there are many airlines that would let you.

But Odinn isn&#39;t pitching Omnia as a portable PC or even a mobile workstation. Instead, it styles the system as a portable datacenter.

&quot;As the laptop freed the desktop, Omnia frees the datacenter,&quot; its website proclaims.

This is pushing things a bit far, as most datacenters have hundreds, if not thousands, of servers in them, and any single AI server is likely to have double the maximum number of GPUs that the Omnia can have fitted.

It does, however, have built-in cooling and a redundant power supply unit (PSU) configuration with Platinum-rated units, so it is definitely workstation or server-grade hardware.

Who would want a portable datacenter, and why? Odinn lists four potential configurations of the box on its website, covering AI, Creator, Search, or Omnia X, the most powerful. The uses for these include mission-critical inferencing at the edge, film crews and postproduction houses who need a self-contained mobile workstation, military AI missions, and enterprise-grade simulations.

And there is more. The firm says that, for anyone needing even greater scale (What? More than one datacenter?), Omnia is designed to work as a building block. Multiple units can be clustered to form Infinity Racks, it claims, delivering large GPU clusters on-site.

None of this will come cheap - a single Nvidia H200 is estimated to set you back around $32,000. It&#39;s hard to imagine many companies would let employees walk out with something so valuable and easily stolen.

However, Odinn doesn&#39;t offer any hint of pricing on its website. We asked, and will update the article if it responds.

With its built-in screen and flip-down keyboard, the Omina reminds us of something from the early days of portable computing: the famous Osborne 1 or the Compaq Portable.

Neither of those weighed anything close to 77 pounds, despite containing a CRT screen, but were arm-stretching enough to be regarded as &quot;luggables&quot; rather than true portables. Perhaps the Omnia should be seen as the successor to these – only much, much more powerful. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has backed away from planned changes to Exchange Online after customers objected to limits designed to curb outbound email abuse.

In its cancellation announcement, Microsoft said: &quot;Customers have shared that this limit creates significant operational challenges, especially given the limited capabilities of bulk sending offerings available today.

&quot;Your feedback matters, and we&#39;re committed to solutions that balance security and usability without causing unnecessary disruption.&quot;

The plan, announced in 2024, would impose daily restrictions to Exchange Online. New tenants&#39; cloud-hosted mailboxes would face an external recipient rate (ERR) limit of 2,000 recipients per 24 hours, applied per user/mailbox to &quot;help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources.&quot;

The restrictions also aimed to curb spam flowing from compromised Exchange Online accounts.

The original blueprint targeted newly created tenants starting January 1, 2025, with existing tenants&#39; cloud-hosted mailboxes facing limits between July and December 2025. As customers struggled to adapt, however, Microsoft repeatedly delayed the timeline into 2026. Now, the company has scrapped those plans entirely as it develops a better approach to the issue.

The problem is that customers have legitimate reasons to exceed the limit - some integrations would fail under the restrictions, making the proposal a blunt instrument.

Nevertheless, Microsoft isn&#39;t abandoning the effort. &quot;We plan to address these issues in ways that are less disruptive to your business workflows,&quot; the company said.

&quot;This means smarter, more adaptive approaches that protect the service while respecting your operational needs.&quot;

Exchange Online already enforces a recipient rate limit of 10,000, and the 2,000 external recipient limit was designed as a sub-limit within that.

Other email vendors have also imposed limits to curb abuse. In 2024, Google added requirements for senders of 5,000+ daily messages to Gmail accounts, including mandatory unsubscribe options for marketing emails.

Microsoft deserves credit for responding to customer concerns – it suggested Azure Communication Services for Email as an alternative, but that clearly didn&#39;t meet every customer&#39;s business needs. The counting method also proved problematic. Microsoft said: &quot;If you sent 100 emails to the same 5 external recipients, it would count as 500 external recipients,&quot; which could easily cause integration headaches for sysadmins.

So while the company gets a thumbs-up for stepping back from its initial plans, it gets two thumbs down for a lack of detail on what it will do next. Administrators with solutions that violate the service restrictions should consider themselves warned. This problem isn&#39;t going away, and Microsoft will be back with an alternative strategy soon enough. ®

Feel free to surprise us, Samsung, but this BB-8-like rolling robot buddy is a CES ghost story.

Samsung’s spherical Ballie robot may be rolling off into the sunset, less than a year after its retail launch was announced. The smart home robot has made an appearance at CES almost every year since it was first announced in 2020, but was notably absent at CES 2026. Unfortunately, its disappearance may be because Ballie has been shelved.

In a statement emailed to Bloomberg, Samsung said Ballie is an “active innovation platform,” and “continues to inform how Samsung designs spatially aware, context-driven experiences, particularly in areas like smart home intelligence, ambient AI and privacy-by-design.”

However, there was no mention of the robot’s consumer release. There was a flood of AI robots at CES this year, like Samsung rival LG’s CLOiD robot. Ballie, a bright yellow soccer ball-sized robot with a built-in projector and Google Gemini, would have fit right in, but it seems like Samsung probably isn’t releasing the BB-8 look-a-like after all.

            <div id="article-text">But it’s “not intended for diagnosis or treatment.”

But it’s “not intended for diagnosis or treatment.”

OpenAI has been dropping hints this week about AI’s role as a “healthcare ally” — and today, the company is announcing a product to go along with that idea: ChatGPT Health.

ChatGPT Health is a sandboxed tab within ChatGPT that’s designed for users to ask their health-related questions in a more secure and personalized environment, with a separate chat history and memory feature than the rest of ChatGPT. The company is encouraging users to connect their personal medical records and wellness apps, such as Apple Health, Peloton, MyFitnessPal,Weight Watchers, and Function, “to get more personalized, grounded responses to their questions.” It suggests connecting medical records so that ChatGPT can analyze lab results, visit summaries, and clinical history; MyFitnessPal and Weight Watchers for food guidance; Apple Health for health and fitness data, including movement, sleep, and activity patterns”; and Function for insights into lab tests.

“ChatGPT can help you understand recent test results, prepare for appointments with your doctor, get advice on how to approach your diet and workout routine, or understand the tradeoffs of different insurance options based on your healthcare patterns,” OpenAI writes in the blog post. On the medical records front, OpenAI says it’s partnered with b.well, which will provide back-end integration for users to upload their medical records, since the company works with about 2.2 million providers.

For now, ChatGPT Health requires users to sign up for a waitlist to request access, as it’s starting with a beta group of early users, but the product will roll out gradually to all users regardless of subscription tier.

In a blog post, OpenAI wrote that based on its “de-identified analysis of conversations,” more than 230 million people around the world already ask ChatGPT questions related to health and wellness each week. OpenAI also said that over the past two years, it’s worked with more than 260 physicians to provide feedback on model outputs more than 600,000 times over 30 areas of focus, to help shape the product’s responses.

The company makes sure to mention in the blog post that ChatGPT Health is “not intended for diagnosis or treatment,” but it can’t fully control how people end up using AI when they leave the chat. By the company’s own admission, in underserved rural communities, users send nearly 600,000 healthcare-related messages weekly, on average, and seven in 10 healthcare conversations in ChatGPT “happen outside of normal clinic hours.” In August, physicians published a report on a case of a man being hospitalized for weeks with an 18th-century medical condition, after taking ChatGPT’s alleged advice to replace salt in his diet with sodium bromide. Google’s AI Overview made headlines for weeks after its launch over dangerous advice, such as putting glue on pizza, and a recent investigation by The Guardian found that dangerous health advice has continued, with false advice for liver function tests, women’s cancer tests, and recommended diets for those with pancreatic cancer.

One part of health that OpenAI seemed to carefully avoid mentioning in its blog post: mental health. There are a number of examples of adults or minors dying by suicide after confiding with ChatGPT, and in the blog post, OpenAI stuck to a vague mention that users can customize instructions in the Health product “to avoid mentioning sensitive topics.” When asked during a Wednesday briefing with reporters whether ChatGPT Health would also summarize mental health visits and provide advice in that realm, OpenAI’s CEO of Applications Fidji Simo said, “Mental health is certainly part of health in general, and we see a lot of people turning to ChatGPT for mental health conversations,” adding that the new product “can handle any part of your health including mental health … We are very focused on making sure that in situations of distress we respond accordingly and we direct toward health professionals,” as well as loved ones or other resources.

It’s also possible that the product could worsen health anxiety conditions, such as hypochondria. When asked whether OpenAI had introduced any safeguards to help prevent people with such conditions from spiraling while using ChatGPT Health, Simo said, “We have done a lot of work on tuning the model to make sure that we are informative without ever being alarmist and that if there is action to be taken we direct to the healthcare system.”

When it comes to security concerns, OpenAI says that ChatGPT Health “operates as a separate space with enhanced privacy to protect sensitive data” and that the company introduced several layers of purpose-built encryption (but not end-to-end encryption), according to the briefing. Conversations within the Health product aren’t used to train its foundation models, by default, and if a user begins a health-related conversation in regular ChatGPT, the chatbot will suggest moving it into the Health product for “additional protections,” per the blog post. But OpenAI has had security breaches in the past, most notably a March 2023 issue that allowed some users to see chat titles, initial messages, names, email addresses, and payment information from other users. In the event of a court order, OpenAI would still need to provide access to the data “where required through valid legal processes or in an emergency situation,” OpenAI head of health Nate Gross said during the briefing.

When asked if ChatGPT Health is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Gross said that “in the case of consumer products, HIPAA doesn’t apply in this setting — it applies toward clinical or professional healthcare settings.”

The smart shopping cart adds a more responsive scanner that’s easier to spot.

Amazon is launching a revamped version of its smart shopping cart, which it plans to bring to dozens of Whole Foods locations by the end of this year, according to an announcement on Wednesday. The new Dash Cart features a “more responsive” item scanner that’s now located next to the built-in display, along with a new NFC reader that lets you tap to pay with your credit card or phone.

Amazon’s previous Dash Cart design put scanners beneath and in front of the handle, potentially making them harder to spot. It also only let you pay with the credit card attached to your Amazon account.

With the upgraded Dash Cart, you’ll find a new scale alongside the cart’s handle, which Amazon says “works in tandem with on-cart cameras, weight sensors, and deep learning models to ensure accurate pricing for every item.” The upgraded Dash Cart eliminates the large sensors facing inside the cart as well, offering a 40 percent larger capacity and a 25 percent lighter weight.

The Dash Cart shows an interactive map of the store on its display, similar to Instacart’s smart Caper Cart. You can sync your shopping list created with Alexa, too, and see how much you’re spending as you add more items to your cart. The cart uses built-in sensors and computer vision to detect when you’ve removed an item, allowing it to automatically update your total. When you’re done shopping, you can skip the checkout line and leave the store in a designated Dash Cart lane.

Amazon is launching its new Dash Cart as the company shakes up its grocery business, which has tied Whole Foods more closely to the Amazon brand. The company has already brought its new Dash Cart to three Whole Foods stores in McKinney, Texas; Reston, Virginia; and Westford, Massachusetts, along with two Amazon Fresh stores.

The Mini Evo Cinema also features a unique design inspired by the vintage Fujica Single-8 8mm film camera that Fujifilm introduced in 1965. It will be released in Japan on January 30th, 2026, but pricing, and wider availability, haven’t been announced yet.

The Mini Evo Cinema’s functionality is similar to Fujifilm’s other Instax cameras. You can still use it to take photos, and it doubles as a wireless printer for images snapped on your smartphone. But instant prints now pop out of the top of the camera, and its multifunction shutter button is positioned below its lens. A single press snaps a photo, while holding the shutter button captures video until you release it.

On the side of the camera is a dial that simplifies selecting video effects. Fujifilm calls it the Eras Dial because its 10 different effects are organized into 10 different decades dating from 1930 to 2020. Selecting 1960 applies an effect making your footage look like it was captured by an 8mm film camera, for example, while 1970 evokes the look of older CRT color TVs. The effects also add “distinctive sound characteristics” to the audio you capture, and some of them will even play sound effects like a mechanical film shutter while you record.

You can share your videos to social media using Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Evo mobile app, but you can also print out still frames (with cute movie poster-inspired enhancements) embedded with a QR code that others can use to access the clip online. You’ll need to upload the video to Fujifilm’s servers through the app first, which will store and keep them accessible for up to two years without any additional fees.

The holidays — and the copious amounts of binge-watching that come with them — are very much behind us at this point, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be time to catch up on the movies from last year (and beyond) you might have missed. Thankfully, Amazon has brought back one of the better promos we’ve seen in recent years, allowing you to snag three 4K UHD Blu-ray discs for $33 through January 19th.

It should go without saying that you’ll need a 4K Blu-ray player like Panasonic’s UB820-K or step-down DP-UB420-K to take full advantage of the discs; however, a disc-based Xbox Series X or PS5 will also work just fine, even if they’re not quite as capable when it comes to features as a dedicated option. As for the promo, Amazon’s discounted catalog includes more than 150 Blu-ray titles, including newer films like F1 The Movie, Wicked, and James Gunn’s latest Superman entry. You can also save on an expansive list of older films, from Inception to classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey, all available for $11 at checkout (as long as you buy three).

Dell is now shifting it focus this year away from being ‘all about the AI PC.’

Dell has revealed that consumers aren’t buying PCs for AI features right now. In an interview with PC Gamer ahead of CES, Dell has made it clear its 2026 products aren’t all about being AI-first, and it’s moving beyond being “all about” AI PCs.

“We’re very focused on delivering upon the AI capabilities of a device—in fact everything that we’re announcing has an NPU in it — but what we’ve learned over the course of this year, especially from a consumer perspective, is they’re not buying based on AI,” admits Kevin Terwilliger, Dell’s head of product, in the PC Gamer interview. “In fact I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them understand a specific outcome.”

It’s a surprisingly honest admission from one of Microsoft’s biggest PC partners, especially as the software giant continues to push AI features into Windows and try and convince consumers to buy Copilot Plus PCs. Dell was one of Microsoft’s partners for the initial Copilot Plus PC launch in 2024, adding Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chips to its popular XPS 13 and Inspiron line of laptops. Dell even added Qualcomm’s Cloud AI chips to its high-end laptops last year, boosting AI performance for local models.

But most of the benefits in Copilot Plus PCs come from the improved battery life and performance of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chips, instead of AI features alone.

Microsoft even struggled to launch its Recall flagship AI feature for Copilot Plus PCs. The controversial feature eventually launched nearly a year after it was originally scheduled, because the feature was delayed following concerns raised by security experts.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/07/1129490/deploying-a-hybrid-approach-to-web3-in-the-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the concept of “Web 3.0” first emerged about a decade ago the idea was clear: Create a more user-controlled internet that lets you do everything you can now, except without servers or intermediaries to manage the flow of information.

Where Web2, which emerged in the early 2000s, relies on centralized systems to store data and supply compute, all owned—and monetized by—a handful of global conglomerates, Web3 turns that structure on its head. Instead, data and compute are decentralized through technologies like blockchain and peer-to-peer networks.

What was once a futuristic concept is quickly becoming a more concrete reality, even at a time when Web2 still dominates. Six out of ten Fortune 500 companies are exploring blockchain-based solutions, most taking a hybrid approach that combines traditional Web2 business models and infrastructure with the decentralized technologies and principles of Web3.

Popular use cases include cloud services, supply chain management, and, most notably financial services. In fact, at one point, the daily volume of transactions processed on decentralized finance exchanges exceeded $10 billion.

Among the advantages of Web3 for the enterprise are greater ownership and control of sensitive data, says Erman Tjiputra, founder and CEO of the AIOZ Network, which is building infrastructure for Web3, powered by decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), blockchain-based systems that govern physical infrastructure assets.

More cost-effective compute is another benefit, as is enhanced security and privacy as the cyberattack landscape grows more hostile, he adds. And it could even help protect companies from outages caused by a single point of failure, which can lead to downtime, data loss, and revenue deficits.

But perhaps the most exciting opportunity, says Tjiputra, is the ability to build and scale AI reliably and affordably. By leveraging a people-powered internet infrastructure, companies can far more easily access—and contribute to—shared resource like bandwidth, storage, and processing power to run AI inference, train models, and store data. All while using familiar developer tooling and open, usage-based incentives.

“We’re in a compute crunch where requirements are insatiable, and Web3 creates this ability to benefit while contributing,” explains Tjiputra.

In 2025, AIOZ Network launched a distributed compute platform and marketplace where developers and enterprises can access and monetize AI assets, and run AI inference or training on AIOZ Network’s more than 300,000 contributing devices. The model allows companies to move away from opaque datasets and models and scale flexibly, without centralized lock in.

Despite the promise, it is still early days for Web3, and core systemic challenges are leaving senior leadership and developers hesitant about its applicability at scale.

One hurdle is a lack of interoperability. The current fragmentation of blockchain networks creates a segregated ecosystem that makes it challenging to transfer assets or data between platforms. This often complicates transactions and introduces new security risks due to the reliance on mechanisms such as cross-chain bridges. These are tools that allow asset transfers between platforms but which have been shown to be vulnerable to targeted attacks.

“We have countless blockchains running on different protocols and consensus models,” says Tjiputra. “These blockchains need to work with each other so applications can communicate regardless of which chain they are on. This makes interoperability fundamental.”

Regulatory uncertainty is also a challenge. Outdated legal frameworks can sit at odds with decentralized infrastructures, especially when it comes to compliance with data protection and anti-money laundering regulations.

“Enterprises care about verifiability and compliance as much as innovation, so we need frameworks where on-chain transparency strengthens accountability instead of adding friction,” Tjiputra says.

And this is compounded by user experience (UX) challenges, says Tjiputra. “The biggest setback in Web3 today is UX,” he says. “For example, in Web2, if I forget my bank username or password, I can still contact the bank, log in and access my assets. The trade-off in Web3 is that, should that key be compromised or lost, we lose access to those assets. So, key recovery is a real problem.”

Although such systemic challenges won’t be solved overnight, by leveraging DePIN networks, enterprises can bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, without making a wholesale switch. This can minimize risk while harnessing much of the potential.

AIOZ Network’s own ecosystem includes capacity for media streaming, AI compute, and distributed storage that can be plugged into an existing Web2 tech stack. “You don’t need to go full Web3,” says Tjiputra. “You can start by plugging distributed storage into your workflow, test it, measure it, and see the benefits firsthand.”

The AIOZ Storage solution, for example, offers scalable distributed object storage by leveraging the global network of contributor devices on AIOZ DePIN. It is also compatible with existing storage systems or commonly used web application programming interfaces (APIs).

“Say we have a programmer or developer who uses Amazon S3 Storage or REST APIs, then all they need to do is just repoint the endpoints,” explains Tjiputra. “That&#39;s it. It’s the same tools, it&#39;s really simple. Even with media, with a single one-stop shop, developers can do transcoding and streaming with a simple REST API.”

Built on Cosmos, a network of hundreds of different blockchains that can communicate with each other, and a standardized framework enabled by Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), AIOZ Network has also prioritized interoperability. “Applications shouldn’t care which chain they’re on. Developers should target APIs without worrying about consensus mechanisms. That’s why we built on Cosmos and EVM—interoperability first.”

This hybrid model, which allows enterprises to use both Web2 and Web3 advantages in tandem, underpins what Tjiputra sees as the longer-term ambition for the much-hyped next iteration of the internet.

“Our vision is a truly peer-to-peer foundation for a people-powered internet, one that minimizes single points of failure through multi-region, multi-operator design,” says Tjiputra. “By distributing compute and storage across contributors, we gain both cost efficiency and end-to-end security by default.

“Ideally, we want to evolve the internet toward a more people-powered model, but we’re not there yet. We’re still at the starting point and growing.”

Indeed, Web3 isn’t quite snapping at the heels of the world’s Web2 giants, but its commercial advantages in an era of AI have become much harder to ignore. And with DePIN bridging the gap, enterprises and developers can step into that potential while keeping one foot on surer ground.

Europe’s drone-filled vision for the future of war

Last spring, 3,000 British soldiers deployed an invisible automated intelligence network, known as a “digital targeting web,” as part of a NATO exercise called Hedgehog in the damp forests of Estonia’s eastern territories.The system had been cobbled together over the course of four months—an astonishing pace for weapons development, which is usually measured in years. Its purpose is to connect everything that looks for targets—“sensors,” in military lingo—and everything that fires on them (“shooters”) to a single, shared wireless electronic brain.Eighty years after total war last transformed the continent, the Hedgehog tests signal a brutal new calculus of European defense. But leaning too much on this new mathematics of warfare could be a risky bet. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: How one controversial startup hopes to cool the planet

Stardust Solutions believes that it can solve climate change—for a price.The Israel-based geoengineering startup has said it expects nations will soon pay it more than a billion dollars a year to launch specially equipped aircraft into the stratosphere. Once they’ve reached the necessary altitude, those planes will disperse particles engineered to reflect away enough sunlight to cool down the planet, purportedly without causing environmental side effects.

But numerous solar geoengineering researchers are skeptical that Stardust will line up the customers it needs to carry out a global deployment in the next decade. They’re also highly critical of the idea of a private company setting the global temperature for us.

Inside the decades-long fight over Yahoo’s misdeeds in ChinaWhen you think of Big Tech these days, Yahoo is probably not top of mind. But for Chinese dissident Xu Wanping, the company still looms large—and has for nearly two decades.In 2005, Xu was arrested for signing online petitions relating to anti-Japanese protests. He didn’t use his real name, but he did use his Yahoo email address. Yahoo China violated its users’ trust—providing information on certain email accounts to Chinese law enforcement, which in turn allowed the government to identify and arrest some users.Xu was one of them; he would serve nine years in prison. Now, he and five other Chinese former political prisoners are suing Yahoo and a slate of co-defendants—not because of the company’s information-sharing (which was the focus of an earlier lawsuit filed by other plaintiffs), but rather because of what came after.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what’s coming next. You can read more from the series here.

I am writing this because one of my editors woke up in the middle of the night and scribbled on a bedside notepad: “What is a parameter?” Unlike a lot of thoughts that hit at 4 a.m., it’s a really good question—one that goes right to the heart of how large language models work. And I’m not just saying that because he’s my boss. (Hi, Boss!)

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

Think back to middle school algebra, like 2a + b. Those letters are parameters: Assign them values and you get a result. In math or coding, parameters are used to set limits or determine output. The parameters inside LLMs work in a similar way, just on a mind-boggling scale.

Short answer: an algorithm. When a model is trained, each parameter is set to a random value. The training process then involves an iterative series of calculations (known as training steps) that update those values. In the early stages of training, a model will make errors. The training algorithm looks at each error and goes back through the model, tweaking the value of each of the model’s many parameters so that next time that error is smaller. This happens over and over again until the model behaves in the way its makers want it to. At that point, training stops and the values of the model’s parameters are fixed.

In theory! In practice, because LLMs are trained on so much data and contain so many parameters, training them requires a huge number of steps and an eye-watering amount of computation. During training, the 175 billion parameters inside a medium-size LLM like GPT-3 will each get updated tens of thousands of times. In total, that adds up to quadrillions (a number with 15 zeros) of individual calculations. That’s why training an LLM takes so much energy. We’re talking about thousands of specialized high-speed computers running nonstop for months.

There are three different types of parameters inside an LLM that get their values assigned through training: embeddings, weights, and biases. Let’s take each of those in turn.

An embedding is the mathematical representation of a word (or part of a word, known as a token) in an LLM’s vocabulary. An LLM’s vocabulary, which might contain up to a few hundred thousand unique tokens, is set by its designers before training starts. But there’s no meaning attached to those words. That comes during training.

When a model is trained, each word in its vocabulary is assigned a numerical value that captures the meaning of that word in relation to all the other words, based on how the word appears in countless examples across the model’s training data.

Yeah. But there’s a bit more to it. The numerical value—the embedding—that represents each word is in fact a list of numbers, with each number in the list representing a different facet of meaning that the model has extracted from its training data. The length of this list of numbers is another thing that LLM designers can specify before an LLM is trained. A common size is 4,096.

Yup, that’s an embedding. And each of those numbers is tweaked during training. An LLM with embeddings that are 4,096 numbers long is said to have 4,096 dimensions.

It might look like a strange number. But LLMs (like anything that runs on a computer chip) work best with powers of two—2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. LLM engineers have found that 4,096 is a power of two that hits a sweet spot between capability and efficiency. Models with fewer dimensions are less capable; models with more dimensions are too expensive or slow to train and run.

Using more numbers allows the LLM to capture very fine-grained information about how a word is used in many different contexts, what subtle connotations it might have, how it relates to other words, and so on.

Back in February, OpenAI released GPT-4.5, the firm’s largest LLM yet (some estimates have put its parameter count at more than 10 trillion). Nick Ryder, a research scientist at OpenAI who worked on the model, told me at the time that bigger models can work with extra information, like emotional cues, such as when a speaker’s words signal hostility: “All of these subtle patterns that come through a human conversation—those are the bits that these larger and larger models will pick up on.”

The upshot is that all the words inside an LLM get encoded into a high-dimensional space. Picture thousands of words floating in the air around you. Words that are closer together have similar meanings. For example, “table” and “chair” will be closer to each other than they are to “astronaut,” which is close to “moon” and “Musk.” Way off in the distance you can see “prestidigitation.” It’s a little like that, but instead of being related to each other across three dimensions, the words inside an LLM are related across 4,096 dimensions.

It’s dizzying stuff. In effect, an LLM compresses the entire internet into a single monumental mathematical structure that encodes an unfathomable amount of interconnected information. It’s both why LLMs can do astonishing things and why they’re impossible to fully understand.

A weight is a parameter that represents the strength of a connection between different parts of a model—and one of the most common types of dial for tuning a model’s behavior. Weights are used when an LLM processes text.

When an LLM reads a sentence (or a book chapter), it first looks up the embeddings for all the words and then passes those embeddings through a series of neural networks, known as transformers, that are designed to process sequences of data (like text) all at once. Every word in the sentence gets processed in relation to every other word.

This is where weights come in. An embedding represents the meaning of a word without context. When a word appears in a specific sentence, transformers use weights to process the meaning of that word in that new context. (In practice, this involves multiplying each embedding by the weights for all other words.)

Biases are another type of dial that complement the effects of the weights. Weights set the thresholds at which different parts of a model fire (and thus pass data on to the next part). Biases are used to adjust those thresholds so that an embedding can trigger activity even when its value is low. (Biases are values that are added to an embedding rather than multiplied with it.)

By shifting the thresholds at which parts of a model fire, biases allow the model to pick up information that might otherwise be missed. Imagine you’re trying to hear what somebody is saying in a noisy room. Weights would amplify the loudest voices the most; biases are like a knob on a listening device that pushes quieter voices up in the mix.

Here’s the TL;DR: Weights and biases are two different ways that an LLM extracts as much information as it can out of the text it is given. And both types of parameters are adjusted over and over again during training to make sure they do this.

No, neurons are more a way to organize all this math—containers for the weights and biases, strung together by a web of pathways between them. It’s all very loosely inspired by biological neurons inside animal brains, with signals from one neuron triggering new signals from the next and so on.

Each neuron in a model holds a single bias and weights for every one of the model’s dimensions. In other words, if a model has 4,096 dimensions—and therefore its embeddings are lists of 4,096 numbers—then each of the neurons in that model will hold one bias and 4,096 weights.

Neurons are arranged in layers. In most LLMs, each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the layer above. A 175-billion-parameter model like GPT-3 might have around 100 layers with a few tens of thousands of neurons in each layer. And each neuron is running tens of thousands of computations at a time.

When an LLM processes a piece of text, the numerical representation of that text—the embedding—gets passed through multiple layers of the model. In each layer, the value of the embedding (that list of 4,096 numbers) gets updated many times by a series of computations involving the model’s weights and biases (attached to the neurons) until it gets to the final layer.

The idea is that all the meaning and nuance and context of that input text is captured by the final value of the embedding after it has gone through a mind-boggling series of computations. That value is then used to calculate the next word that the LLM should spit out.

It won’t be a surprise that this is more complicated than it sounds: The model in fact calculates, for every word in its vocabulary, how likely that word is to come next and ranks the results. It then picks the top word. (Kind of. See below …)

That word is appended to the previous block of text, and the whole process repeats until the LLM calculates that the most likely next word to spit out is one that signals the end of its output.

LLM designers can also specify a handful of other parameters, known as hyperparameters. The main ones are called temperature, top-p, and top-k.

Temperature is a parameter that acts as a kind of creativity dial. It influences the model’s choice of what word comes next. I just said that the model ranks the words in its vocabulary and picks the top one. But the temperature parameter can be used to push the model to choose the most probable next word, making its output more factual and relevant, or a less probable word, making the output more surprising and less robotic.

Top-p and top-k are two more dials that control the model’s choice of next words. They are settings that force the model to pick a word at random from a pool of most probable words instead of the top word. These parameters affect how the model comes across—quirky and creative versus trustworthy and dull.

That’s one of the hottest questions in AI right now. There are a lot of different ways it can happen. Researchers have found that the amount of training data makes a huge difference. First you need to make sure the model sees enough data: An LLM trained on too little text won’t make the most of all its parameters, and a smaller model trained on the same amount of data could outperform it.

Another trick researchers have hit on is overtraining. Showing models far more data than previously thought necessary seems to make them perform better. The result is that a small model trained on a lot of data can outperform a larger model trained on less data. Take Meta’s Llama LLMs. The 70-billion-parameter Llama 2 was trained on around 2 trillion words of text; the 8-billion-parameter Llama 3 was trained on around 15 trillion words of text. The far smaller Llama 3 is the better model.

A third technique, known as distillation, uses a larger model to train a smaller one. The smaller model is trained not only on the raw training data but also on the outputs of the larger model’s internal computations. The idea is that the hard-won lessons encoded in the parameters of the larger model trickle down into the parameters of the smaller model, giving it a boost.

In fact, the days of single monolithic models may be over. Even the largest models on the market, like OpenAI’s GPT-5 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini 3, can be thought of as several small models in a trench coat. Using a technique called “mixture of experts,” large models can turn on just the parts of themselves (the “experts”) that are required to process a specific piece of text. This combines the abilities of a large model with the speed and lower power consumption of a small one.

But that’s not the end of it. Researchers are still figuring out ways to get the most out of a model’s parameters. As the gains from straight-up scaling tail off, jacking up the number of parameters no longer seems to make the difference it once did. It’s not so much how many you have, but what you do with them.

You want to see a parameter? Knock yourself out: Here&#39;s an embedding.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-07</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/07/1129748/aadhaar-nandan-nilekani-india-digital-biometric-identity-data/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nandan Nilekani can’t stop trying to push India into the future. He started nearly 30 years ago, masterminding an ongoing experiment in technological state capacity that started with Aadhaar—the world’s largest digital identity system. Aadhaar means “foundation” in Hindi, and on that bedrock Nilekani and people working with him went on to build a sprawling collection of free, interoperating online tools that add up to nothing less than a digital infrastructure for society. They cover government services, digital payments, banking, credit, and health care, offering convenience and access that would be eye-popping in wealthy countries a tenth of India’s size. In India those systems are called, collectively, “digital public infrastructure,” or DPI.

At 70 years old, Nilekani should be retired. But he has a few more ideas. India’s electrical grid is creaky and prone to failure; Nilekani wants to add a layer of digital communication to stabilize it. And then there’s his idea to expand the financial functions in DPI to the rest of the world, creating a global digital backbone for commerce that he calls the “finternet.”

“It sounds like some crazy stuff,” Nilekani says. “But I think these are all big ideas, which over the next five years will have demonstrable, material impact.” As a last act in public life, why not Aadhaarize the world?

Today, a farmer in a village in India, hours from the nearest bank, can collect welfare payments or transfer money by simply pressing a thumb to a fingerprint scanner at the local store. Digitally authenticated copies of driver’s licenses, birth certificates, and educational records can be accessed and shared via a digital wallet that sits on your smartphone.

In big cities, where cash is less and less common (just trying to break a bill can be a major headache), mobile payments are ubiquitous, whether you’re buying a TV from a high-street retailer or a coconut from a roadside cart. There are no fees, and any payment app or bank account can send money to any other. The country’s chaotic patchwork of public and private hospitals have begun digitizing all their medical records and uploading them to a nationwide platform. On the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), people can do online shopping searches on whatever app they want, and the results show sellers from an array of other platforms, too. The idea is to liberate small merchants and consumers from the walled gardens of online shopping giants like Amazon and the domestic giant Flipkart.

In the most populous nation on Earth—with 1.4 billion people—a large portion of the bureaucracy anyone encounters in daily life happens seamlessly and in the cloud.

At the heart of all these tools is Aadhaar. The system gives every Indian a 12-digit number that, in combination with either a fingerprint scan or an SMS code, allows access to government services, SIM cards, basic bank accounts, digital signature services, and social welfare payments. The Indian government says that since its inception in 2009, Aadhaar has saved 3.48 trillion rupees ($39.2 billion) by boosting efficiency, bypassing corrupt officials, and cutting other types of fraud. The system is controversial and imperfect—a database with 1.4 billion people in it comes with inherent security and privacy concerns. Still, in the most populous nation on Earth, a big portion of the bureaucracy anyone might encounter in daily life just happens in the cloud.

Nilekani was behind much of that innovation, marshaling an army of civil servants, tech companies, and volunteers. Now he sees it in action every day. “It reinforces that what you have done is not some abstract stuff, but real stuff for real people,” he says.

By his own admission, Nilekani is entering the twilight of his career. But it’s not over yet. He’s now “chief mentor” for the India Energy Stack (IES), a government initiative to connect the fragmented data held by companies responsible for generating, transmitting, and distributing power. India’s grids are unstable and disparate, but Nilekani hopes an Aadhaar-like move will help. IES aims to give unique digital identities not only to power plants and energy storage facilities but even to rooftop solar panels and electric vehicles. All the data attached to those things—device characteristics, energy rating certifications, usage information—will be in a common, machine-readable format and shared on the same open protocols.

Ideally, that’ll give grid operators a real-time view of energy supply and demand. And if it works, it might also make it simpler and cheaper for anyone to connect to the grid—even everyday folks selling excess power from their rooftop solar rigs, says RS Sharma, the chair of the project and Nilekani’s deputy while building Aadhaar.

Nilekani’s other side hustle is even more ambitious. His idea for a global “finternet” combines Aadhaarization with blockchains—creating digital representations called tokens for not only financial instruments like stocks or bonds but also real-world assets like houses or jewelry. Anyone from a bank to an asset manager or even a company could create and manage these tokens, but Nilekani’s team especially hopes the idea will help poor people trade their assets, or use them as loan collateral—expanding financial services to those who otherwise couldn’t access them.

It sounds almost wild-eyed. Yet the finternet project has 30 partners across four continents. Nilekani says it’ll launch next year.

Nilekani was born in Bengaluru, in 1955. His family was middle class and, Nilekani says, “seized with societal issues and challenges.” His upbringing was also steeped in the kind of socialism espoused by the newish nation’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.

After studying electrical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, in 1981 Nilekani helped found Infosys, an information technology company that pioneered outsourcing and helped turned India into the world’s IT back office. In 1999, he was part of a government-appointed task force trying to upgrade the infrastructure and services in Bengaluru, then emerging as India’s tech capital. But Nilekani was at the time leery of being viewed as just another techno-optimist. “I didn’t want to be seen as naive enough to believe that tech could solve everything,” he says.

Seeing the scope of the problem changed his mind—sclerotic bureaucracy, endemic corruption, and financial exclusion were intractable without technological solutions. In 2008 Nilekani published a book, Imagining India: The Idea of a Renewed Nation. It was a manifesto for an India that could leapfrog into a networked future.

And it got him a job. At the time more than half the births in the country were not recorded, and up to 400 million Indians had no official identity document. Manmohan Singh, the prime minister, asked Nilekani to put into action an ill-defined plan to create a national identity card.

Nilekani’s team made a still-controversial decision to rely on biometrics. A system based on people’s fingerprints and retina scans meant nobody could sign up twice, and nobody had to carry paperwork. In terms of execution, it was like trying to achieve industrialization but skip a steam era. Deployment required a monumental data collection effort, as well as new infrastructure that could compare each new enrollment against hundreds of millions of existing records in seconds. At its peak, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the agency responsible for administering Aadhaar, was registering more than a million new users a day. That happened with a technical team of just about 50 developers, and in the end cost slightly less than half a billion dollars.

Buoyed by their success, Nilekani and his allies started casting around for other problems they could solve using the same digitize-the-real-world playbook. “We built more and more layers of capability,” Nilekani says, “and then this became a wider-ranging idea. More grandiose.”

While other countries were building digital backbones with full state control (as in China) or in public-private partnerships that favored profit-seeking corporate approaches (as in the US), Nilekani thought India needed something else. He wanted critical technologies in areas like identity, payments, and data sharing to be open and interoperable, not monopolized by either the state or private industry. So the tools that make up DPI use open standards and open APIs, meaning that anyone can plug into the system. No single company or institution controls access—no walled gardens.

Of course, another way to look at putting financial and government services and records into giant databases is that it’s a massive risk to personal liberty. Aadhaar, in particular, has faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned about the potential for surveillance. Several high-profile data breaches of Aadhaar records held by government entities have shaken confidence in the system, most recently in 2023, when security researchers found hackers selling the records of more than 800 million Indians on the dark web.

Technically, this shouldn’t matter—an Aadhaar number ought to be useless without biometric or SMS-based authentication. It’s “a myth that this random number is a very powerful number,” says Sharma, the onetime co-lead of UIDAI. “I don’t have any example where somebody’s Aadhaar disclosure would have harmed somebody.”

One problem is that in everyday use, Aadhaar users often bypass the biometric authentication system. To ensure that people use a genuine address at registration, Aadhaar administrators give people their numbers on an official-looking document. Indians co-opted this paperwork as a proof of identity on its own. And since the document—Indians even call it an “Aadhaar card”—doesn’t have an expiration date, it’s possible for people to get multiple valid cards with different details by changing their address or date of birth. That’s quite a loophole. In 2018 an NGO report found that 67% of people using Aadhaar to open a bank account relied on this verification document rather than digital authentication. That report was the last time anyone published data on the problem, so nobody knows how bad it is today. “Everybody’s living on anecdotes,” says Kiran Jonnalagadda, an anti-Aadhaar activist.

In other cases, flaws in Aadhaar’s biometric technology have caused people to be denied essential government services. The government downplays these risks, but again, it’s impossible to tell how serious the problem is because the UIDAI won’t disclose numbers. “There needs to be a much more honest acknowledgment, documentation, and then an examination of how those exclusions can be mitigated,” says Apar Gupta, director of the Internet Freedom Foundation.

Beyond the potential for fraud, it’s also true that the free and interoperable tools haven’t reached all the people who might find them useful, especially among India’s rural and poorer populations. Nilekani’s hopes for openness haven’t fully come to pass. Big e-commerce companies still dominate, and retail sales on ONDC have been dropping steadily since 2024, when financial incentives to participate began to taper off. The digital payments and government documentation services have hundreds of millions of users, numbers most global technology companies would love to see—but in a country as large as India, that leaves a lot of people out.

The usually calm Nilekani bristles at that criticism; he has heard it before. Detractors overlook the dysfunction that preceded these efforts, he says, and he remains convinced that technology was the only way forward. “How do you move a country of 1.4 billion people?” he asks. “There’s no other way you can fix it.”

The proof is self-evident, he says. Indians have opened more than 500 million basic bank accounts using Aadhaar; before it came into use, millions of those people had been completely unbanked. Earlier this year, India’s Unified Payments Interface overtook Visa as the world’s largest real-time payments system. “There is no way Aadhaar could have worked but for the fact that people needed this thing,” Nilekani says. “There’s no way payments would have worked without people needing it. So the voice of the people—they’re voting with their feet.”

That need might be present in countries beyond India. “Many countries don’t have a proper birth registration system. Many countries don’t have a payment system. Many countries don’t have a way for data to be leveraged,” Nilekani says. “So this is a very powerful idea.” It seems to be spreading. Foreign governments regularly send delegations to Bengaluru to study India’s DPI tools. The World Bank and the United Nations have tried to introduce the concept to other developing countries equally eager to bring their economies into the digital age. The Gates Foundation has established projects to promote digital infrastructure, and Nilekani has set up and funded a network of think tanks, research institutes, and other NGOs aimed at, as he says, “propagating the gospel.”

Still, he admits he might not live to see DPI go global. “There are two races,” Nilekani says. “My personal race against time and India’s race against time.” He worries that the economic potential of its vast young population—the so-called demographic dividend—could turn into a demographic disaster. Despite rapid growth, gains have been uneven. Youth unemployment remains stubbornly high—a particularly volatile problem in a large and economically turbulent country.

“Maybe I’m a junkie,” he says. “Why the hell am I doing all this? I think I need it. I think I need to keep curious and alive and looking at the future.” But that’s the thing about building the future: It never quite arrives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Water shortages in Southern California made an indelible impression on Evelyn Wang ’00 when she was growing up in Los Angeles. “I was quite young, perhaps in first grade,” she says. “But I remember we weren’t allowed to turn our sprinklers on. And everyone in the neighborhood was given disinfectant tablets for the toilet and encouraged to keep flushing to a minimum. I didn’t understand exactly what was happening. But I saw that everyone in the community was affected by the scarcity of this resource.”

Today, as extreme weather events increasingly affect communities around the world, Wang is leading MIT’s effort to tackle the interlinked challenges of a changing climate and a burgeoning global demand for energy. Last April, after wrapping up a two-year stint directing the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E), she returned to the campus where she’d been both an undergraduate and a faculty member to become the inaugural vice president for energy and climate.

“The accelerating problem of climate change and its countless impacts represent the greatest scientific, technical, and policy challenge of this or any age,” MIT President Sally Kornbluth wrote in a January 2025 letter to the MIT community announcing the appointment. “We are tremendously fortunate that Evelyn Wang has agreed to lead this crucial work.”

MIT has studied and worked on problems of climate and energy for decades. In recent years, with temperatures rising, storms strengthening, and energy demands surging, that work has expanded and intensified, spawning myriad research projects, policy proposals, papers, and startups. The challenges are so urgent that MIT launched several Institute-wide initiatives, including President Rafael Reif’s Climate Grand Challenges (2020) and President Kornbluth’s Climate Project (2024).

But Kornbluth has argued that MIT needs to do even more. Her creation of the new VP-level post that Wang now holds underscores that commitment.

Wang is well suited for the role. The Ford Professor of Engineering at MIT and former head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, she joined the faculty in 2007, shortly after she completed her PhD at Stanford University. Her research centers on thermal management and energy conversion and storage, but she also works on nano-engineered surfaces and materials, as well as water harvesting and purification. Wang and her colleagues have produced a device based on nanophotonic crystals that could double the efficiency of solar cells—one of MIT Technology Review’s 10 breakthrough technologies of 2017. And the device she invented with Nobel laureate Omar Yaghi for extracting water from very dry air was named one of 2017’s top 10 emerging technologies by Scientific American and the World Economic Forum, and in 2018 earned her the Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz International Prize for Water. (See story on this water harvesting research in the January/February issue of MIT Technology Review.)

Wang has a deep knowledge of the Institute—and even deeper roots here. (See “Family Ties,” MIT Alumni News, March/April 2015.) Her parents met at MIT as PhD students from Taiwan in the 1960s; they were married in the MIT chapel. When Wang arrived at MIT in 1996 as a first-year student, her brother Alex ’96, MEng ’97, had just graduated and was working on a master’s degree in electrical engineering. Her other brother, Ben, would earn his PhD at MIT in 2007. She even met her husband, Russell Sammon ’98, at MIT. Apart from her time at ARPA-E, a very brief stint at Bell Labs, and sabbatical work at Google, she has spent her entire professional career at the Institute. So she has a rare perspective on the resources MIT can draw on to respond to the climate and energy challenge.

“The beating heart of MIT is innovation,” she says. “We are innovators. And innovation is something that will help us leapfrog some of the potential hurdles as we work toward climate and energy solutions. Our ability to innovate can enable us to move closer toward energy security, toward sustainable resource development and use.”

The prevailing innovative mindset at MIT is backed by a deep desire to tackle the problem.Many people on campus are passionate about climate and energy, says Wang. “That is why President Kornbluth made this her flagship initiative. We are fortunate to have so many talented students and faculty, and to be able to rely on our infrastructure. I know they will all step up to meet the challenges.” But she is quick to point out that the problems are too large for any one entity—including MIT—to address on its own. So she’s aiming to encourage more collaboration both among MIT researchers and with other institutions.

“If we want to solve this problem of climate change, if we want to change the trajectory in the next decade, we cannot continue to do business as usual,” she says. “That is what is most exciting about this problem and, frankly, is why I came back to campus to take this job.”

The coupling of climate and energy in Wang’s portfolio is strategic. “Energy and climate are two sides of the same coin,” she explains. “A major reason we are seeing climate change is that we haven’t deployed solutions at a scale necessary to mitigate the CO2 emissions from the energy sector. The ways we generate energy and manage emissions are fundamental to any strategy addressing climate change. At the same time, the world demands more and more energy—a demand we can’t possibly meet through a single means.”

“Zero-emissions and low-carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate … We need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”

What’s more, she contends that switching from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, while fundamental, is only part of the solution. “Zero-emissions and low-­carbon approaches will not be enough to supply the necessary energy or to reverse our impact on the climate,” she says. “We need to consider the environmental impacts of these new fuels we develop and deploy. We need to use data analysis to move goods and energy more efficiently and intelligently. We need to consider raising more of our food in water and using food by-products and waste to help sequester carbon. In short, we need to do something truly transformational. That is the heart of the challenge.”

That challenge seems destined to grow more daunting in the coming years. There are still, Wang observes, areas of “energy poverty”—places where people cannot access sufficient energy to sustain their well-being. But solving that problem will only drive up energy production and consumption worldwide. The explosive growth of AI will likely do the same, since the huge data centers that power the technology require enormous quantities of energy for both computation and cooling.

Wang believes that while AI will continue to drive electricity demand, it can also contribute to creating a more sustainable future.“We can use AI to develop climate and energy solutions,” she says. “AI can play a primary role in solution sets, can give us new and improved ways to manage intermittent loads in the energy grid. It can help us develop new catalysts and chemicals or help us stabilize the plasma we’ll use in nuclear fusion. It could augment climate and geospatial modeling that would allow us to predict the impact of potential climate solutions before we implement them. We could even use AI to reduce computational needs and thereby ease cooling demand.”

MIT was humming with climate and energy research long before Wang returned to campus in 2025 after wrapping up her work at ARPA-E. Almost 400 researchers across 90% of MIT’s departments responded to President Reif’s 2020 Climate Grand Challenges initiative. The Institute awarded $2.7 million to 27 finalist teams and identified five flagship projects, including one to create an early warning system to help mitigate the impact of climate disasters, another to predict and prepare for extreme weather events, and an ambitious project to slash nearly half of all industrial carbon emissions.

About 250 MIT faculty and senior researchers are now involved in the Climate Project at MIT, a campus-wide initiative launched in 2024 that works to generate and implement climate solutions, tools, and policy proposals. Conceived to bolster MIT’s already significant efforts as a leading source of technological, behavioral, and policy solutions to global climate issues, the Climate Project has identified six “missions”: decarbonizing energy and industry; preserving the atmosphere, land, and oceans; empowering frontline community action; designing resilient and prosperous cities; enabling new policy approaches; and wild cards, a catch-all category that supports development of unconventional solutions outside the scope of the other missions. Faculty members direct each mission.

With so much climate research already underway,a large part of Wang’s new role is to support and deepen existing projects. But to fully tap into MIT’s unique capabilities, she says, she’s aiming to foster some cultural shifts. And that begins with identifying ways to facilitate cooperation—both across the Institute and with external partners—on a scale that can make “something truly transformational” happen, she says. “At this stage, with the challenges we face in energy and climate, we need to do something ambitious.”

In Wang’s view, getting big results depends on taking a big-picture, holistic approach that will require unprecedented levels of collaboration. “MIT faculty have always treasured their independence and autonomy,” she says. “Traditionally, we’ve tried to let 1,000 flowers bloom. And traditionally we’ve done that well, often with outstanding results. But climate and energy are systems problems, which means we need to create a systems solution. How do we bring these diverse faculty together? How do we align their efforts, not just in technology, but also in policy, science, finance, and social sciences?”

To encourage MIT faculty to collaborate across departments, schools, and disciplines, Wang recently announced that the MIT Climate Project would award grants of $50,000 to $250,000 to collaborative faculty teams that work on six- to 24-month climate research projects. Student teams are invited to apply for research grants of up to $15,000.“We can’t afford to work in silos,” she says. “People from wildly diverse fields are working on the same problems and speaking different professional languages. We need to bring people together in an integrative way so we can attack the problem holistically.”

Wang also wants colleagues to reach beyond campus. MIT, she says, needs to form real, defined partnerships with other universities, as well as with industries, investors, and philanthropists. “This isn’t just an MIT problem,” she says. “Individual efforts and 1,000 flowers alone will not be enough to meet these challenges.”

Thinking holistically—and in terms of systems—will help focus efforts on the areas that will have the greatest impact. At a Climate Project presentation in October, Wang outlined an approach that would focus on building well-being within communities. This will begin with efforts to empower communities by developing coastal resilience, to decarbonize ports and shipping, and to design and build data centers that integrate smoothly and sustainably with nearby communities. She encouraged her colleagues to think in terms of big-picture solutions for the future and then to work on the components needed to build that future.

“As researchers, we sometimes jump to a solution before we have fully defined the problem,” she explains. “Let’s take the problem of decarbonization in transportation. The solution we’ve come up with is to electrify our vehicles. When we run up against the problem of the range of these vehicles, our first thought is to create higher-density batteries. But the real problem we’re facing isn’t about batteries. It’s about increasing the range of these vehicles. And the solution to that problem isn’t necessarily a more powerful battery.”

“Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom … The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing?”

Wang is confident that her MIT colleagues have both the capacity and the desire to embrace the holistic approach she envisions. “When I was accepted to MIT as an undergraduate and visited the campus, the thing that made me certain I wanted to enroll here was the people,” she recalls. “They weren’t just talented. They had so many different interests. They were passionate about solving big problems. And they were eager to learn from one another. That spirit hasn’t changed. And that’s the spirit I and my team can tap into.”

Wang believes MIT and other institutions working on climate and energy solutions also need to change how we talk about the challenge. “Too often the narrative around climate is steeped in doom and gloom,” she says. “The underlying issue here is our well-being. That’s what we care about, not the climate. The goal of any climate project is to build and protect well-being. How can we help communities thrive, empower people to live as they wish, even as the climate is changing? How can we create conditions of resilience, sustainability, and prosperity? That is the framework I would like us to build on.” For example, in areas where extreme weather threatens homes or rising temperatures are harming human health, we should be developing affordable technologies that make dwellings more resilient and keep people cooler.

Wang’s colleagues at MIT concur with her assessment of the mission ahead. They also have a deep respect for her scholarship and leadership. “I couldn’t think of a better person to represent MIT’s diverse and powerful ability to attack climate,” says Susan Solomon, the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professor of Environmental Studies at MIT and recipient of the US National Medal of Science for her work on the Antarctic ozone hole. “Communicating MIT’s capabilities to provide what the nation needs—not only in engineering but also in … economics, the physical, chemical, and biological sciences, and much more—is an immense challenge.” But she’s confident that Wang will do it justice. “Evelyn is a consummate storyteller,” she says.

“She’s tremendously quick at learning new fields and driving toward what the real nuggets are that need to be addressed in solving hard problems,” says Elsa Olivetti, PhD ’07, the Jerry McAfee Professor in Engineering and director of the MIT Climate Project’s Decarbonizing Energy and Industry mission. “Her direct, meticulous thinking and leadership style mean that she can focus teams within her office to do the work that will be most impactful at scale.”

Wang’s experience at ARPA-E is expected to be especially useful. “The current geopolitical situation and the limited amount of research funding available relative to the scale of the climate problem pose formidable challenges to bringing MIT’s strengths to bear on the problem,” says Rohit Karnik, director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) and a collaborator with Wang on numerous projects and initiatives since both joined the mechanical engineering faculty in 2007. “Evelyn’s leadership experience at MIT and in government, her ability to take a complex situation and define a clear vision, and her passion to make a difference will serve her well in her new role.”

Wang’s new MIT appointment is seen as a good thing beyond the Institute as well. “A role like this requires a skill set that is difficult to find in one individual,” says Krista Walton, vice chancellor for research and innovation at North Carolina State University. Walton and Wang collaborated on multiple projects, including the DARPA work that produced the device for extracting water from very dry air based on the original prototype Wang co-developed. “You need scientific depth, an understanding of the federal and global landscape, a collaborative instinct and the ability to be a convener, and a strategic vision,” Walton says—and she can’t imagine a better pick for the job.

“Evelyn has an extraordinary ability to bridge fundamental science with real-world application,” she says. “She approaches collaboration as a true partnership and not as a transaction.”

Climate scientists explore broad swaths of time, tracking trends in temperature, greenhouse gases, volcanic activity, vegetation, and more across hundreds, thousands, and even millions of years. Even average temperatures and precipitation levels are calculated over periods of three decades.

But in the realm of politics, change happens much faster, prompting sudden and sometimes startling shifts in culture and policy. The current US administration has proposed widespread budget cuts in climate and energy research. These have included slicing more than $1.5 billion from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), canceling multiple climate-related missions at NASA, and shuttering the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), the agency responsible for publishing the National Climate Assessment. The Trump administration submitted a budget request that would cut the National Science Foundation budget from more than $9 billion to just over $4 billion for 2026. The New York Times reported that NSF grant funding for STEM education from January through mid-May 2025 was down 80% from its 10-year average, while NSF grant awards for math, physics, chemistry, astronomy, and materials science research were down 67%. In September, the US Department of Energy announced it had terminated 223 projects that “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Among the agencies affected is ARPA-E, the agency Wang directed before returning to MIT. Meanwhile, MIT research programs that rely on government sources of funding will also feel the impact of the cuts.

Acknowledging the difficulties she and MIT may face in the present moment, Wang still prefers to look forward. “Of course this is a challenging time,” she says. “There are near-term challenges and long-term challenges. We need to focus on those long-term challenges. As President Kornbluth has said, we need to continue to advocate for research and education. We need to pursue long-term solutions, to follow our convictions in addressing problems in energy and climate. And we need to be ready to seize the opportunities that reside in these long-term challenges.”

Wang also sees openings for short-term collaboration—areas where MIT and the current administration can find common ground and goals. “There is still a huge area of opportunity for us to align our interests with those of this administration,” she says. “We can move the needle forward together on energy, on national security, on minerals, on economic competitiveness. All these are interests we share, and there are pathways we can follow to meet these challenges to our nation together. MIT is a major force in the nuclear space, in both fission and fusion. These, along with geothermal, could provide the power base we need to meet our energy demands. There are significant opportunities for partnerships with this or any administration to unlock some of these innovations and implement them.”

While she views herself as a researcher and an academic, Wang’s relevant government experience should prove especially useful in her VP role at MIT. In her two years as director of ARPA-E, she coordinated a broad array of the US Department of Energy’s early-stage research and development in energy generation, storage, and use. “I think I had the best job in government,” she says. Designed to operate at arm’s length from the Department of Energy, ARPA-E searches for high-risk, high-reward energy innovation projects. “More than one observer has called ARPA-E a moonshot factory,” she says.

Seeking out and facilitating “moonshot”-­worthy projects at a national and sometimes global scale gave Wang a broader lens through which to view issues of energy and climate. It also taught her that big ideas do not translate into big solutions automatically. “I learned what it takes to make an impact on energy technology at ARPA-E and I will be forever grateful,” she says. “I saw how game-changing ideas can take a decade to go from concept to deployment. I learned to appreciate the diversity of talent and innovation in the national ecosystem composed of laboratories, startups, and institutions. I saw how that ecosystem could zero in to identify real problems, envision diverse pathways, and create prototypes. And I also saw just how hard that journey is.”

MIT researchers are tackling climate and energy issues from multiple angles, working on everything from decarbonizing energy and industry to designing resilient and prosperous cities. Find out more at climateproject.mit.edu.

While MIT is already an important element in that ecosystem, Wang and her colleagues want the Institute to play an even more prominent role. “We can be a convener and collaborator, first across all of MIT’s departments, and then with industry, the financial world, and governments,” she says. “We need to do aggressive outreach and find like-minded partners.”

“Although the problems of climate and climate change are global, the most effective way MIT can address them is locally,” said Wang at the October presentation of the MIT Climate Project. “Working across schools and disciplines, collaborating with external partners, we will develop targeted solutions for individual places and communities—solutions that can then serve as templates for other places and communities.” But she also cautions against one-size-fits-all solutions. “Solar panels, for example, work wonderfully, but only in areas that have sufficient space and sunlight,” she explains. “Institutions like MIT can showcase a diversity of approaches and determine the best approach for each individual context.”

Most of all, Wang wants her colleagues to be proactive. “Because MIT is a factory of ideas, perhaps even a moonshot factory, we need to think boldly and continue to think boldly so we can make an impact as soon as possible,” she says. She also wants her colleagues to stay hopeful and not feel daunted by a challenge that can at times feel overwhelming. “We will build pilots, one at a time, and demonstrate that these projects are not only possible but practical,” she says. “And that is how we will build a future everyone wants to live in.”

            <div id="article-text">Few people, if any, contemplate stars—celestial or cinematic—the way Aomawa Shields does.

An astronomer and astrobiologist, Shields explores the potential habitability of planets beyond our solar system. But she is also a classically trained actor—and that’s helped shape her professional trajectory in unexpected ways.

Today, Shields is an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Irvine, where she oversees a research team that uses computer models to explore conditions on exoplanets, or planets that revolve around stars other than the sun. But while searching for life many light-years away is her day job, creative endeavors round out her purpose on Earth.

In 2023 Shields published a memoir, Life on Other Planets: A Memoir of Finding My Place in the Universe. She has started an influential educational program that encourages young girls to explore space, given a hugely popular TED Talk about how we’ll find life on other planets, and won a string of prestigious academic awards, honors, and grants. She also plays the violin, cooks, practices yoga, and is a mom. And as what she calls a “rest leader”—a professional proponent of slowing down—Shields has somehow managed the seemingly impossible: She makes time.

Her unorthodox path began on the screen, in the realm of make-believe.

“I wanted to become an astronaut. That dream started very early in my life, at the age of 12, after seeing a movie that dramatized kids getting launched into space,” she says, referring to SpaceCamp, an ’80s kids’ comedy about an accidental space shuttle flight.

The next bit of cinematic inspiration cemented her interest.

“Charlotte Blackwood was an astrophysicist, and she was very glamorous, too,” Shields says, smiling at how she was captivated by the heroine in Top Gun. “There’s an iconic scene where she’s walking down the aisle between Tom Cruise and other pilot trainees, and she just kind of whips off her glasses and just looks like such a badass.”

A high-achieving student while growing up in California, Canada, and Massachusetts, Shields made her way to Phillips Exeter Academy, in large part drawn by its state-of-the-art astronomical observatory. Once there, she got pulled into acting in a serious way. “Enter a new dream,” she says.

Throughout high school her astronomy and acting aspirations “kind of danced beside each other,” Shields remembers. “But I held firm to the first one and went to MIT because I understood that it’s the best science school in the country. I learned that at the age of 12—that’s where I’m going to go.”

At MIT, Shields struggled academically at first and took refuge in the creative arts. She was chosen to participate in the Burchard Scholars Program, whose monthly dinner seminars bring faculty members together with students who excel in the arts, social sciences, and humanities. She sang in the a cappella group the Muses and performed in lots of plays. At the end of her senior year, she found herself wondering: “Do I go to grad school in acting or astronomy?”

“There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD.”

The latter won out, but not for long. Shields headed to a graduate program in astronomy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “During that year, I had a white male professor tell me to consider other career options, and that was hard to hear,” she says. She remembers thinking, “I’m going to the other dream because clearly someone’s telling me that I don’t belong here. Maybe they’re right.”

So she applied to UCLA, where she got an MFA in acting, leaving astronomy for more than a decade. But then, when Shields was working odd jobs to supplement her acting gigs, a mentor from her undergraduate years encouraged her to look on a Caltech-operated job website. She saw an opening for a help desk operator at the Spitzer Space Telescope, an infrared telescope that is particularly adept at viewing the formation of young stars—and it only required a bachelor’s degree. “I’d refer the harder questions to the PhDs,” she says. “But by taking that job, I got to go to astronomy talks again … This field of exoplanets had just exploded during the time I’d been away.”

Shields had some success in acting, including a part in a film called Nine Lives, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival. But a big break—and then heartbreak—came after she was cast as the host of the show Wired Science, only to lose the job when the producers decided to change presenters. It was a “devastating moment,” she says.

Soon after, she emailed the astrophysicist and science communications luminary Neil deGrasse Tyson, whom she’d been introduced to over email by an astronomer working with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and relayed what had happened. He replied that he’d seen her in the pilot and told her that “without a PhD you don’t have that street cred if you want to do science television,” she recalls. Meanwhile, she had applied to NASA’s astronaut candidate program but didn’t make it past the first level. (She did, however, get to play an astronaut in a recent Toyota ad.) “There were a lot of these things that seemed to be aligning—that were telling me: Go back and get that PhD,” she says. So she did, earning her doctorate in astronomy and astrobiology in 2014 from the University of Washington.

Astrobiology, Shields explains, is a relatively new field that studies the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the universe: “It’s about how life got started on Earth.”

Astrobiologists might focus on the habitability of planets, or on methods for exploring life on other planets, or on liquids other than water that could support life. It’s a highly interdisciplinary field. “There are astronomers that are looking for these planets and are using their particular field of expertise to answer that question: Are we alone?” Shields explains. Some of them are “also chemists and biologists and oceanographers and geologists who tackle these questions from their own lens and specific area of expertise,” she says. “That’s why I love it. As an astrobiologist, we don’t have to get 15 PhDs. We get to collaborate with people in different departments who lend their own expertise … on those science questions.”

Shields is trying to answer a question sparked by the night sky—one that’s deeply personal yet universal in both the astronomical and the colloquial sense. “Ever since I was a little girl, I would look up at the sky and wonder what was out there,” she says. “It comes from a sense of wonder for me. I still have that feeling when I look up at the night sky and I see these little pinpoints of light. I wonder: Is there anyone looking back at me? … How far does space go?”

There are, she explains, 100 billion stars in our galaxy, most orbited by at least one planet, and over 100 billion galaxies beyond ours. That’s about 1022 stars in the universe. The likelihood that only Earth was able to produce life “I think is pretty low,” Shields says.

“I’m looking for planetary environments that could be conducive to life beyond Earth,” she says. “And my team does that largely using climate models. These are the same kinds of models that can predict climate and weather on Earth.”

Shields plugs information gathered by observational astronomers into such models, along with different potential combinations of other, unknown variables—like the type of light a planet receives from its host star, the composition of its atmosphere and surface, and certain orbital information. “There’s only so much that you can really tell about a planet from the telescope information that you get,” she explains. “We can explore that parameter space with climate models and say: Okay, if it has this surface composition, this is what the temperature would be like on this planet. If it has this atmospheric composition, this type of orbit, this is what the climate would be like, and this is how habitable it would be across its surface.”

Since the early 1990s, astronomers have discovered 6,000 exoplanets. Shields says those in Earth’s size range—in which she’s most interested—number in the hundreds. A smaller subset of those are orbiting in what’s called the “habitable zone” of their star, creating warm enough conditions to maintain water in liquid form—the key to life. So far, as many as 100 or so planets that fall into that category have been identified, but the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, could find even more potentially habitable planets by detecting “biosignatures” suggesting a biological presence, such as particular gases in their atmospheres or glints that might be reflections of water on the planetary surface.

Being able to detect more of these sorts of signals, Shields says, is the next “big mission” in astronomy.

Today, in her academic work, her mind hurtles to the farthest reaches of the universe. But in her precious hours outside of academia, she has learned to be still. When her work schedule started to overwhelm her, Shields’s health began to suffer. Then she discovered the practice of yoga nidra—an ancient form of meditation in which practitioners are guided into a deeply restful “yogic sleep.” Shields read the book Do Less: A Revolutionary Approach to Time and Energy Management for Ambitious Women, which claims that 20 or 30 minutes of yoga nidra “feels like three hours of sleep in your body,” she says. “And as the mother of a young child, I was like: Okay, sign me up!”

Last year she trained with Karen Brody, author of Daring to Rest: Reclaim Your Power with Yoga Nidra Rest Meditation, and became a certified facilitator. “It’s been important to me to share it broadly and to really try to do my part to introduce the culture of academia, in particular, to this notion of resting as a daily practice,” she says. Now she’s at work on a book about her attempt to moderate—to resist the temptation to take on too much. She has learned to decline invitations and put firm boundaries between her work and personal life.

Shields has realized that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Combining them makes her a more effective educator.

On a weekday in August, an ayurvedic soup simmers on her kitchen stove. A music stand occupies the corner of a room where she sometimes picks up her violin and plays fiddle tunes. (Her parents, both professional musicians, derived her name from a chant of vowel sounds they made up.) She mentions the poem “swim | women of color”by Nayyirah Waheed and recites it in a soft, rich voice. Part of it goes: “This structure counts on your inability to say no. mean no. they take no from our first breath. go back and return it to your mouth. your heart. your light.”

“I need to graciously let go or say no—make room for someone else to say yes,” Shields says. “That allows me to have more spaciousness in my schedule, because one thing I’ve discovered is that women of color, as we proceed up the academic ladder, the requests just exponentially increase, and so saying no is not simply an important skill—it’s a survival skill.”

Along the way, Shields has come to realize that her seemingly disparate interests in astronomy and acting don’t have to be mutually exclusive. In fact, combining them—and sharing her passion for both—makes her a more effective educator. Her training as an actor helps her craft lectures that keep students engaged and animates her presentations, including her TED Talk, in a way that resonates with nonscientists.

Shields is also tapping into her love of acting to inspire the next generation of scientists who will help answer astronomy’s big questions. As part of a postdoctoral fellowship through the National Science Foundation, she was asked to design an educational outreach component. “I was like: Is there a scenario in which I could use acting to teach astronomy?” she says. “And I looked it up. There was precedent for that. Astronomy education journals had shown that when you involve girls in creative arts—theater, writing—and you incorporate that into astronomy education, you increase girls’ confidence in both asking and answering questions.”

The finding resonated with her own experience. After all, it was acting—which she turned to when her professor discouraged her from studying astronomy—that gave her the confidence to pursue astronomy again. “I looked at acting as this outlet, this safe space,” she says. “Nobody could tell me that I was wrong as an actor.”

With that in mind, Shields launched Rising Stargirls, which holds workshops using the creative arts to teach astronomy to ­middle-school-aged girls of all backgrounds. She and her colleagues have since published a study showing that girls who attended the program reported being more excited to take science classes and were more likely to believe they could do well in science.

“We want them to know that who they are is inherently pivotal and critical to their study and practice of astronomy,” Shields says. “The sciences are incredibly creative, and they get to bring that creative imagination and creative inspiration they find through the arts into learning about the universe.”

That same exchange has played out in Shields’s life, but it’s only recently that she’s come to see similarities between her roles as an astronomer and an actor. “They’re both about story,” she says.

Actors have to convey the arc or evolution of a story through the lives of their characters. “Stars, ­planets—they have lives, too,” Shields says. “They have births, they have evolution, and they die. It’s my job as a scientist to unveil the story—to discover the story of whether there’s life elsewhere.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.
