            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’re human, you’ve probably hollered a curse word or two (or three) when barking your shin on a table edge or hitting your thumb with a hammer. Perhaps you’ve noticed that this seems to lessen your pain. There’s a growing body of scientific evidence that this is indeed the case. The technical term is the “hypoalgesic effect of swearing.” Cursing can also improve physical strength and endurance, according to a new paper published in the journal American Psychologist.

As previously reported, co-author Richard Stephens, a psychologist at Keele, became interested in studying the potential benefits of profanity after noting his wife’s “unsavory language” while giving birth and wondered if profanity really could help alleviate pain. “Swearing is such a common response to pain. There has to be an underlying reason why we do it,” Stephens told Scientific American after publishing a 2009 study that was awarded the 2010 Ig Nobel Peace Prize.

For that study, Stephens and his colleagues asked 67 study participants (college students) to immerse their hands in a bucket of ice water. They were then instructed to either swear repeatedly using the profanity of their choice or chant a neutral word. Lo and behold, the participants said they experienced less pain when they swore and were also able to leave their hands in the bucket about 40 seconds longer than when they weren’t swearing. It has been suggested that this is a primitive reflex that serves as a form of catharsis.

The team followed up with a 2011 study showing that the pain-relief effect works best for subjects who typically don’t swear that often, perhaps because they attach a higher emotional value to swears. They also found that subjects’ heart rates increased when they swore. But it might not be the only underlying mechanism. Other researchers have pointed out that profanity might be distracting, thereby taking one’s mind off the pain rather than serving as an actual analgesic.

So in 2020, the Stephens team conducted a follow-up study, using the same methodology as they had back in 2009, asking participants to either chant the F-word or the fake swears “fouch” and “twizpipe.” (Fun fact: the earliest known appearance of the F-word in the English language is “Roger F$#%-by-the-Navel” who appears in some court records from 1310-11. )

The result: Only the F-word had any effect on pain outcomes. The team also measured the subjects’ pain threshold, asking them to indicate when the ice water began to feel painful. Those who chanted the F-word waited longer before indicating they felt pain—in other words, the swearing increased their threshold for pain. Chanting “fouch” or “twizpipe” had no effect on either measure.

For this latest study, Stephens was interested in investigating potential mechanisms for swearing as a possible form of disinhibition (usually viewed negatively), building on his team’s 2018 and 2022 papers showing that swearing can improve strength in a chair push-up task. “In many situations, people hold themselves back—consciously or unconsciously—from using their full strength,” said Stephens. “By swearing, we throw off social constraint and allow ourselves to push harder in different situations. Swearing is an easily available way to help yourself feel focused, confident and less distracted, and ‘go for it’ a little more.”

In two separate experiments, participants were asked to select a swear word they’d normally use after, say, bumping their head, and a more neutral word to describe an inanimate object like a table. They then performed the aforementioned chair push-up task: sitting on a sturdy chair and placing their hands under their thighs with the fingers pointed inwards. Then they lifted their feet off the floor and straightened their arms to support their body weight for as long as possible, chanting either the swear word or the neutral word every two seconds. Afterward, subjects competed a questionnaire to assess various aspects of their mental state during the task.

The results: Subjects who swore during the task could support their body weight much longer than those who merely repeated the neutral word. This confirms the reported results of similar studies in the past. Furthermore, subjects reported increases in their sense of psychological “flow,” distraction, and self-confidence, all indicators of increased disinhibition.

“These findings help explain why swearing is so commonplace,” said Stephens. “Swearing is literally a calorie-neutral, drug-free, low-cost, readily available tool at our disposal for when we need a boost in performance.” The team next plans to explore the influence of swearing on public speaking and romantic behaviors, since these are situations where most people are more hesitant and less confident in themselves, and hence more likely to hold back.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While not quite a separate dialect, Formula 1-speak can be heavy on the jargon at times. They say “box” instead of pit, “power unit” to describe the engine and hybrid system, and that’s before we get into all the aerodynamics-related expressions like “outwash” and “dirty air.” Next year is a big technical shakeup for the sport, and it seems we’re getting some new terminology to go with it. So forget your DRS and get ready to talk about Boost mode instead.

The F1 car of 2026 will be slightly narrower and slightly lighter than the machines that raced for the last time earlier this month. But not by a huge amount: minimum weight is decreased by 30 kg to 724 kg, the wheelbase is 200 mm shorter at 3,400 mm, and the car’s underfloor is 150 mm narrower than before.

The front wing is 100 mm narrower and has just two elements to it, although for the first time in F1 history, this is now an active wing, which works in conjunction with the three-element active rear wing. Active rear wings have been a thing in F1 since the introduction of DRS—the drag reduction system—in 2011, but now there’s a philosophical change to how they’ll work.

With DRS, a driver could activate it to reduce their car’s drag if they were within a second of a car in front and at one of the marked DRS zones on track. From next year, the cars will have Straight Mode, which lowers both front and rear wings to decrease drag—this will be allowed for any drive on any of the designated straights, regardless of whether they’re close to another car or not.

And there’s corner mode, where the wings are in their raised position, generating downforce and making the cars corner faster. Those names are better than X-mode and Z-mode, which is what they were being called last year.

At the start of the season, expect overall downforce to be reduced by around 30 percent compared to this year’s machinery. However, the cars should also produce around 55 percent less drag, says the sport’s organizers, the FIA. The reason for the big decrease in drag down the straights is because of the new powertrains. The complicated and expensive MGU-H that recovered energy from an F1 engine’s turbocharger is gone, and there’s a more powerful MGU-K that drives the wheels together with the V6.

Now, the power split of V6 to MGU-K is 400 kW and 350 kW, but there will be times when the battery pack is not fully charged and the electric motor will contribute much less power. Making the cars slipperier through the air, then, is a way to ameliorate that impinging too much on the show.

Allowing cars to follow each other closely through corners was a big motivating factor for the 2022 rules change that reintroduced ground effect downforce to the sport, although some of those gains were erased by the teams as they developed their cars. So it’s good to know that remains a priority for the 2026 ruleset, too.

“The 2022 cars started off with a significant improvement in their wake characteristics,” said Nicholas Tombazis, FIA single seater director. “I don’t remember the exact numbers, but downforce at approximately 20 metres behind went from about 50 percent on the previous generation of cars to about 80 or 85 percent to start with on the 2022 cars. And then that gradually decayed during the regulation cycle to what it is now, where we are probably talking about 70 percent. We believe that the start of the new cycle will be more like 90 percent, better than it’s ever been.”

Tombazis added that “the front wing end plates morphed into shapes that permitted quite a lot of outwash, while the inside of the front brake drums also worsened the characteristics, as did the side of the floor. We learned a lot from that, and in developing the regulations for 2026 we hope we will maintain the good characteristics for a longer period or hopefully not have this decay again.”

Instead of using DRS as an overtaking aid, the hybrid power units will now fulfill that role. Overtake mode, which can be used if a driver is within a second of a car ahead, gives them an extra 0.5 MJ of energy and up to 350 kW from the electric motor up to 337 km/h—without the Overtake mode, the MGU-K tapers off above 290 km/h. There’s also a second Boost mode, which drivers can use to attack or defend a position, that gives a short burst of maximum power.

Change can often be unsettling, and over the past couple of years, there has been criticism of the rules, specifically the emphasis on so much hybrid power, which now requires active aero to not make the cars too slow. Some have even suggested a swifter end to the incoming rules and then a switch to naturally aspirated engines, although that now seems very unlikely.

F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali rejected that idea. “F1 needs to be relevant. And in terms of technical development, the fact that we receive new manufacturers in our sport means that the relevancy, from the technical perspective I’m talking, of course, it has been more important, has been achieved,” Domenicali told me. “Therefore, as always when there is such a technical change, it is quite massive. Like you said, it is not only a new power unit that you’re managing, it’s a new car, it’s a new way to race.”

As Domenicali said, the new technical regulations certainly have been a success in attracting new manufacturers to the sport. In addition to Audi joining the sport—we spoke with him at the Audi launch last month—Cadillac is entering as a new team as well (albeit without their own engines until 2029). After pulling back from the sport, Honda has recommitted. And Ford has signed up, too, providing the hybrid side of the power unit that will go into next year’s Red Bull and Racing Bull cars.

The first preseason test gets underway on January 26, with the first race weekend in Australia March 6–8.</div>

            <h2>The inside story of SpaceX’s historic rocket landing that changed launch forever</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/12/ten-years-ago-spacex-turned-tragedy-into-triumph-with-a-historic-rocket-landing/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Dec. 21, 2015, SpaceX launched the Orbcomm-2 mission on an upgraded version of its Falcon 9 rocket. That night, just days before Christmas, the company successfully landed the first stage for the first time. The story behind this remarkable achievement is nowhere more fully told than in the book Reentry, authored by Ars Technica Senior Space Editor Eric Berger and published in 2024. To mark the tenth anniversary, Ars is reprinting a slightly condensed chapter from the book that tells the inside story of this landing. The chapter begins in June 2015 with a tragedy, the disintegration of a Falcon 9 rocket carrying the CRS-7 cargo supply mission for NASA. It was the first time a Falcon 9 had been lost in flight.

Seconds after the Dragon-bearing Falcon 9 rocket broke apart over the Atlantic Ocean, David Giger shouted into his headset, “Dragon is alive!”

In the decade since he joined the company straight out of graduate school, Giger had taken on management of the entire Dragon program, reporting directly to Elon Musk. He watched the CRS-7 launch from mission control in Hawthorne not with a particular role, but rather providing a leadership presence. Giger could sense the Dragon mission team, mostly younger engineers, freeze up as video showed debris from the rocket showering back to Earth. A lot of the people involved in the hairy early flights of Dragon, including the C2 mission in 2012, had moved on to other positions at SpaceX or departed.

“They were a great team, but I think everyone assumed it was over,” Giger said. Unlike a lot of his colleagues, Giger had endured some trying times at SpaceX, including three failures of the Falcon 1 rocket. After the Falcon 9 shattered, Giger noticed that Dragon continued to send data back. It had separated from the rocket and was flying some thirty miles above the Atlantic Ocean.

The key to saving Dragon was opening its parachutes before it got too close to the ground. SpaceX had not anticipated such a contingency, nor planned to send commands to Dragon as it rode on the Falcon 9 rocket. But in an emergency, the Dragon control center could talk to Dragon using ground-based antennas. So controllers in California frantically worked to configure this communications system and command the two drogue parachutes to open. These are the small, precursor parachutes that stabilize the vehicle prior to deployment of Dragon’s three main parachutes.

The command was sent, but nothing happened. Dragon continued to dive.

For about two minutes after the rocket’s breakup, the plucky spacecraft faithfully relayed data. Then, less than a mile above the ocean, below the horizon from the Florida coast, the data stopped. The spacecraft and its 4,000 pounds of cargo plunged into the sea.

Opening the parachutes was not as simple as pressing a button. It required operators to send more than a dozen specific commands, in the correct order, to manually deploy the parachutes. In their haste—the operators had only seconds to act before the spacecraft fell too close to the ocean for its parachutes to have a meaningful effect—they had forgotten to turn on power for parachute deployment.

The unnecessary loss of Dragon was one lesson SpaceX took away from the failure of the nineteenth launch of the Falcon 9 rocket. In the aftermath of this CRS-7 failure, during long and intense meetings, Musk focused most of his time and energy on the rocket. But more than a few times, Musk would turn toward Giger and other Dragon officials and complain about its loss. “Dragon shouldn’t be fucking stupid,” Musk would admonish the team. “It should have saved itself.” By the next Dragon mission, this emergency scenario would be baked into the rocket’s launch procedures. If need be, Cargo Dragon could be saved.

The high-profile failure of the CRS-7 mission in June 2015 hit SpaceX hard. After five years, of challenging work with Falcon 9 and Dragon, the company had started to hit its stride. The Falcon 9 won a string of lucrative commercial satellite contracts. NASA, too, invested billions of dollars in SpaceX to launch humans onboard Dragon one day. Then it all fell apart. Carrying cargo for its most important customer, SpaceX blew up its rocket in spectacular fashion.

The loss of CRS-7 came at an inopportune time for NASA, as well. Half a year earlier the space agency’s other commercial provider of cargo services, Orbital Sciences, lost a NASA mission when its Antares rocket exploded just above the launch pad. Critics of the agency’s support for commercial spaceflight reemerged in Congress, underscoring the severity of the setback and raising questions about whether private companies could be trusted with human spaceflight.

In the first three years SpaceX flew the Falcon 9 rocket, from mid-2010 to mid-2013, it launched just five times. This flight rate was completely unacceptable to Musk, and after introducing version 1.1 of the rocket, he expected this cadence to increase substantially. He charged the Florida site director, Brian Mosdell, with delivering the capability of launching more than one Falcon 9 rocket a month.

But that was not Mosdell’s only task. He also spent much of 2013 spearheading SpaceX’s charge to obtain a lease for a second launch pad in Florida. This was to be none other than the most historic launch pad in the Western hemisphere, NASA’s Launch Complex 39A. Surrounded by swampland and rising just a few feet above the Atlantic Ocean, the sprawling 200-acre site includes the hallowed ground where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took their last steps on terra firma before walking on the Moon. Later, dozens of shuttle missions also launched from there.

Following retirement of the shuttle in 2011, NASA no longer had any use for the launch site. The agency’s inspector general characterized the pad as “unneeded infrastructure,” and leasing the facility to a commercial launch company would offload millions of dollars a year in maintenance costs. SpaceX, already flying, seemed like the obvious choice as it sought a suitable site for Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches and eventually crew flights for NASA. However, in the spring of 2013, another bidder emerged. Jeff Bezos held a reverent fondness for space history and sought to lease the site for Blue Origin and its New Glenn rocket.

To sweeten his proposal, Bezos offered to share the launch complex with SpaceX or another company. While this was a generous offer, Blue Origin did not have an orbital rocket in 2013, nor was it close to having one. Because of this, NASA awarded a twenty-year lease to SpaceX in September.

Musk was giddy after winning, having secured the landmark site. But he was also tweaked by Bezos’s bid, which he believed was intended to block his access. In an email to Space News, Musk mocked his would-be competitor. “If they do somehow show up in the next five years with a vehicle qualified to NASA’s human rating standards that can dock with the space station, which is what Pad 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs,” Musk wrote. “Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.”

Musk also mocked Blue Origin during internal meetings at SpaceX. He would say things like, “A company must really stink to call themselves BO.” History vindicated him. Blue Origin did not have an orbital rocket ready to fly from Launch Complex 39A within five years. Or ten. As of the writing of this book, the company’s New Glenn orbital rocket has yet to make a single launch attempt (Editors note: Blue Origin did launch New Glenn for the first time in early 2025). SpaceX, in the meantime, has launched more than 100 rockets from the old NASA pad.

Mosdell wrote a majority of SpaceX’s proposal to win the lease for 39A, including all of its technical materials, its schedule, and its budget considerations. After the company acquired the lease, he fully understood all of the work entailed in demolishing the old shuttle infrastructure and building a launch tower capable of supporting the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.

His relatively small staff included seventy-two full-time employees and about eighty welders and other contract hires working on a new transporter. They already were maxed out by Musk’s push to launch monthly from SLC-40, putting in 80- to 100-hour weeks to keep up. Accordingly, Mosdell traveled to Hawthorne in January 2014 to meet with Musk and Shotwell about staffing up his operations for the buildout of Launch Complex 39A. During the meeting, Mosdell outlined what he believed to be a “lean” team to complete the design, procurement, building, and testing of the site. He then asked to hire sixty-eight people over the next six months.

Musk rejected the idea. The meeting spiraled downward from there, and Musk’s parting words to Mosdell were, “Go home and work harder.”

As a leader, Mosdell keenly felt the demands he placed on his team with intense work schedules. Eventually they would burn out and leave, or the quality of their work would suffer. When he raised these concerns with Musk and Shotwell, they would always say the money was tight, and if Florida could just buckle down and get the next payment milestone, some of the burden could be lifted off the team. Mosdell’s meeting in Hawthorne convinced him things really were never going to change. SpaceX would never enter a cruise phase; it would only accelerate.

“There was not going to be a genuine effort to fix the problem,” he said. “This was going to be a shut up, go home, and color kind of thing. And I decided I was no longer going to go to the Cape and tell my team to just keep going because things would change. Because I knew it was bullshit.”

During his six years at SpaceX, Mosdell had delivered. He built the team that scrappily built the SLC-40 launch pad for about a tenth the cost of SpaceX’s competitors. He worked as a launch director for six missions. They started with almost entirely manual launch operations, and by the end of 2013 reached the point where about 90 percent of the countdown was automated. Under Mosdell’s watch, the launch site had a perfect record. He also led the campaign to win NASA’s competition for its historic LC-39A site. He had laid the foundation for the success that ultimately awaited SpaceX in Florida.

Musk was not displeased. In his mind, Mosdell and the team at Cape Canaveral had not gone hardcore enough. Launching once a month was not enough. Musk believed Falcon 9 rockets should be flying from Florida once a week. In hindsight, this is a cadence the company would not reach for nearly a decade.

To fill Mosdell’s role, Musk turned to one of his people. Ricky Lim had joined SpaceX in 2008, spending months on Kwajalein during the final three flights of the Falcon 1 rocket. He came of age during the early years at SpaceX, surviving the crucible of the Falcon 1 and near death of the company. He then helped out at Vandenberg, alongside Zach Dunn and Lee Rosen. In the wake of Mosdell’s departure, Lim was asked to fill in as site director at Cape Canaveral for a few weeks. Three weeks would turn into six years.

The launch team at the Cape consisted of two halves. One was built from converts from the legacy rocket companies, including United Launch Alliance, where Mosdell had come from. The other half consisted of young engineers who had typically taken their first job with SpaceX. Musk felt Mosdell was too closely aligned with the legacies. Lim, he felt, would rally the younger blood.

And so he did. From mid-2014 onward, SpaceX started to hit a groove at the Cape. There were bumps along the way, of course, and eventually SpaceX would hire not sixty-eight additional employees as Mosdell had requested, but hundreds more for launch and pad rebuild work in Florida. Yet by April 2015, Lim and his team managed to launch a pair of missions—the sixth operational cargo mission for NASA and a Turkish communications satellite—within just thirteen days of one another from Florida. Eagerly, they moved to the next mission on the manifest, another cargo supply mission for NASA: CRS-7.

On the morning that CRS-7 lifted off, Lim set aside his site leadership role to serve as launch director. All went well for the first two minutes of the flight. However, at 2 minutes and 19 seconds, Lim started to hear chatter on the network about “data drops” from the second stage. He glanced up at a video showing the rocket far down range, a white streak climbing into an azure sky. While there was some sort of vapor cloud around the upper stage, the rocket’s nine engines were burning just fine.

“It was surreal,” Lim said. “What we saw in the data did not match what we were seeing. The first stage was still going. On the long-range cameras, it looked a lot like prior launches. I thought the second stage people were mistaken, to be honest.”

He believed it might be a ground software display issue or some other minor problem. A second or two more clarified matters. The large white cloud expanded, engulfing the rocket. As it dissipated, the tracking camera showed a shower of debris as pieces of the rocket began tumbling back to Earth. A hushed silence fell over the flight control room.

Musk watched the launch from England, where he was celebrating his forty-fourth birthday. Seeing his rocket disintegrate was a lousy birthday present. His first call was to Dunn. After working for five years launching rockets, Dunn had taken over running SpaceX’s propulsion department just a few months earlier and observed the launch from inside the Mission Control Center in Hawthorne. Dunn told Musk he did not have an immediate explanation for the failure and passed his phone to Jon Edwards, an engineer supervising the launch. Edwards said it looked as though some kind of pressure event had occurred on the second stage.

During past traumatic moments, Dunn had felt empowered to take immediate action. When a Falcon 1 rocket had started imploding during transport on a C-17 rocket over the Atlantic Ocean, Dunn had risked his life to climb inside the booster to open a pressure valve. But this was different. “In this case, I didn’t really know what to do immediately,” he said. “That was kind of the creepy thing about it. We knew we had to go and see if there was any debris in the ocean. But there was not a ton of immediate action other than starting to figure out what took place. It was a really painful, shocking moment.”

Dunn walked out of mission control and back to the propulsion area of the office. He called his team together and gave a quick talk about what had just happened. Like Giger, Dunn was now one of SpaceX’s veterans and had persevered through the Falcon 1 failures. He explained that launching rockets was a high-risk business and that the way to get through this challenge was to work methodically to find out what happened, fix the problem, and fly again.

Musk returned to California and dove into the accident investigation with frenzied energy. At least daily, and often multiple times a day, he convened meetings in his executive conference room on the first floor of the company’s headquarters. A black conference table dominated the middle of the room, around which nine chairs were situated in a large U. People presenting at the meeting filled the chairs. More engineers sat or stood around the sides of the room. Musk always stationed himself at one end of the table closest to the door, facing a wall that featured a large canvas print of the Falcon 1 rocket launching from Omelek Island, a cautionary tale of the company’s desperate roots.

“The vast majority of the people at the company today have only ever seen success, and so you don’t fear failure quite as much,” Musk said after the accident, which he publicly described as a “huge blow” to SpaceX. “To some degree I think the company as a whole maybe became a little complacent.”

Indeed, the company had grown ten-fold since its last failure in 2008. As the Falcon 9 had streaked through its first eighteen launches, some of the Kwajalein veterans like Dunn and Lim would discuss how few of the company’s employees had experienced the pain of launch failure. By the time of the CRS-7 mission, only about 5 percent of employees had that experience, so they were somewhat numb to Musk’s mantra that “only the paranoid survive.” Before every Falcon 9 launch, Musk would email the entire company and say that if anyone had a serious concern about the upcoming launch, he wanted to hear it. And he was genuine about this. He wanted to hear risks and, if they sparked wider concern, act on them.

Because of SpaceX’s growing size, downtime was expensive. With a staff of approximately 4,000 employees at the time of the failure, SpaceX needed to fly frequently to pay the bills. Personnel costs alone exceeded $70 million a month. So Musk pushed for a thorough, but rapid, investigation. During the CRS-7 failure analysis meetings, he would listen as department leads shared their latest information on the investigation. Often he interrupted with a question, a comment, or a sharp critique. These were tense and frustrating and difficult discussions because the true cause of the accident remained a mystery for several weeks. Underlying it all was a sense of unease and uncertainty about the fate of SpaceX.

“Elon brought a tremendous amount of energy to those meetings,” Dunn said. “You always have to bring your best with Elon, but in these sort of tense moments you had to be right there. One hundred percent focus. No bullshit. You better be able to explain what you know, what you don’t know, take direction very crisply, and understand what he means with precision. If not, he pounced.”

The responsibility for investigating the failure fell on one of Musk’s oldest and most trusted lieutenants, Hans Koenigsmann. At the time, Koenigsmann served as vice president of Flight Reliability and Mission Assurance, which essentially meant ensuring safe and successful launches.

“I feel like if I’m responsible for the risk, I’m also responsible for when it goes wrong,” he said. “It took five months, and I worked around the clock. I took one weekend off, I think. Otherwise, I worked every single day of those months. I worked my ass off, and my team did, too.”

Part of the challenge in understanding what had gone wrong is that the rocket had gone from flying normally to a conflagration in just 800 milliseconds. Koenigsmann’s team knew almost immediately that the problem originated on the second stage, which had not yet separated from the first stage. But it had all happened so fast, in a fraction of a second. As a result, engineers and scientists from SpaceX and NASA had just 115 pieces of telemetry data (that is, measurements from various sensors onboard the rocket during that critical second when the upper stage failed). From this, they ultimately determined that the liquid oxygen tank had ruptured after a container containing pressurized helium broke free inside the tank.

Why are there bottles of helium in the LOX tank? As a rocket launches into space, it steadily burns propellant and oxidizer. As these fluids drain, helium gas is released to fill the vacated volume and maintain a downward pressure. This ensures that propellant and oxidizer continue to flow into the engines. The helium container is called a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV, because a strong fiber is wrapped around a metallic container to ensure its integrity. The more difficult question for Koenigsmann, therefore, became understanding why a COPV bottle containing helium had broken loose and struck the upper dome of the oxygen tank with catastrophic effect.

Eventually, some structures engineers pinned the cause of the failure down to a small $4 part about the size of a Tootsie Pop. This stainless steel eye bolt, also known as a rod end, helped secure the COPV to the wall of the oxygen tank. It had broken during the rocket’s ascent. Koenigsmann said these rod ends were rated to withstand 10,000 pounds of force, but one of them inside the ill-fated upper stage had broken under less than 2,000 pounds of force.

Nearly all rockets and spacecraft undergo a rigorous design process. The last checkpoint before a project moves into fabrication is known as “critical design review.” During this review for the Falcon 9, SpaceX had required the use of a more expensive rod end, Koenigsmann said. This part costs about $50. Somewhere between this design review and the actual flight, however, a cheaper rod end had been substituted. This steel rod end cost significantly less and was manufactured by a casting process. This meant it was made by pouring steel into a mold, where it solidified, and then was ejected from the mold. The more expensive rod ends worked fine at cryogenic temperatures inside the liquid oxygen tank, but cast materials were more problematic when pulled under the force of tension as they could have unknown flaws hiding inside.

SpaceX tried to find the actual rod end that had broken, to ensure it had nailed down the original cause of the failure. Searching for a thumbsized part fifty miles off the coast of Florida, hundreds of feet below the surface of the ocean, proved to be a rather Don Quixote–like quest. The company even hired a remotely operated submarine to look for wreckage. In the process, it found long-lost hardware from the Apollo and Space Shuttle Programs, but no Falcon 9 parts. However, Koenigsmann was confident that a cast rod end was the culprit because SpaceX tested similar parts from the same purchase order and found they were subject to breaking under cryogenic conditions.

So why had SpaceX switched to a cheaper cast rod end? Musk had instilled a culture of always looking to cut costs. Someone decided that a $50 rod end was too expensive and would be substituted with a cheaper part. Every strut on the rocket used rod ends, so there were hundreds of them on the vehicle, meaning this single change saved more than a thousand dollars on a launch vehicle. In their zeal to control costs, Musk and his lieutenants made such decisions thousands of times. Had Musk not been so judicious about costs, the price of a Falcon 9 would have ballooned. And in nearly every case, the approach worked—except this one.

In the fall of 2015, Koenigsmann wrote a detailed report about SpaceX’s findings and presented it to NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration. The report concluded that “material defects” were the most probable cause for the broken rod end. This essentially put the blame on the rod end’s supplier. NASA’s own, independent findings leveled a harsher judgment more directly on SpaceX. NASA attributed the failure to a “design error” by SpaceX. The space agency also said SpaceX’s quality control process should have identified the substandard rod ends before they were installed on the rocket.

“The implementation was done without adequate screening or testing of the industrial grade part, without regard to the manufacturer’s recommendations for a 4:1 factor of safety when using their industrial grade part in an application, and without proper modeling or adequate load testing of the part under predicted flight conditions,” the report stated.

In other words, NASA said SpaceX had messed up, not the supplier. Koenigsmann said he accepts that SpaceX should have done a better job screening the rod ends. But he said the supplier deserves blame as well. “SpaceX and the supplier screwed up,” he said.

Koenigsmann still keeps one of these rod ends in a desk drawer at home, to not forget the lessons of CRS-7.

Despite disagreeing over the fundamental cause of the supply mission failure, NASA and SpaceX continued to work together well. When Dragon sank into the ocean, NASA lost $118 million in cargo, including a crucial docking adapter needed to enable future astronaut missions to the space station. The failure also increased the US space agency’s reliance on Russia. For several months, the only means America had of getting its astronauts to the space station, and feeding them, came via a pair of small spacecraft designed during the Soviet era that launched from Kazakhstan.

Publicly, however, NASA did not chastise SpaceX for these problems. Rather, its officials remained supportive. During a US Senate hearing in 2016, when some elected officials would have celebrated an opportunity to lambaste the company, NASA’s chief of human spaceflight stood up for SpaceX when asked about the failure.

“They turned around very quickly,” the official, Bill Gerstenmaier, told Congress. “Within a matter of days, they were actually in a test facility on the ground testing the failure that they thought had occurred. That getting into test was much faster than I could have ever done on a NASA side. By the time I would have had the ability to get contracts written and done the proposals and put the test sequence in place, it would have been a half a year.”

SpaceX, in turn, sought to make NASA whole for its losses. A few months after the accident, the company quietly agreed to fly five future cargo missions, its sixteenth through twentieth flights to the space station, at discounted prices. SpaceX also increased the amount of cargo each Dragon mission would carry, giving NASA more bang for its buck.

This assumed, however, that SpaceX could get the Falcon 9 rocket flying safely once again.

Even had the cargo mission not failed, the Falcon 9 still faced months of downtime during the second half of 2015. Musk had decided the rocket needed another significant upgrade, to version 1.2, which later became known as Falcon 9 Full Thrust. This represented a massive evolution to the rocket’s capabilities. Drone ship landings were essential to making the economics of first stage reuse work, but they were not the only step. SpaceX also needed to squeeze every ounce of performance out of the rocket. No part of the Falcon 9 was spared a ruthless revision, and in the end, SpaceX engineers produced a new machine that increased the lift capability of the Falcon 9 by nearly one-third.

The propulsion department designed an upgraded version of the Merlin 1D engine that raised the thrust of each engine by about 15 percent. The structures department built a lighter rocket that was easier to manufacture. And all of the lessons learned from the Grasshopper program and landing attempts in the Atlantic Ocean were poured into the design of the new rocket legs and control systems.

However, the real linchpin of the upgrade involved a technology known as propellant densification, or squeezing as much fuel as possible onto the rocket. This sounds wonky and wholly uninteresting—but it is not. The science and engineering of super-chilling rocket fuel is fascinating, and its implementation tremendously risky. Within a year of seriously starting work on densification, SpaceX would blow up a rocket, destroy a launch pad, and lose a $195 million Israeli satellite. Some former Apollo astronauts viewed SpaceX’s approach as so dangerous they urged NASA to never let its astronauts fly on rockets fueled this way. Musk knew the risks, he accepted the risks, and in the end, SpaceX beat the risks.

Densification, however, was a tremendous challenge heaped on SpaceX at the same time the company’s employees were scrambling to recover from the loss of the CRS-7 mission, satisfy NASA’s concerns, and work through the finer points of landing first stages.

“Elon grasped the essentials of the reuse problem,” (senior SpaceX engineer) John Muratore said. “He kept telling us we’ve got to get more performance. We’ve got to get the liquid oxygen colder. He just kept driving us.” Somewhat understatedly, Muratore added, “It was quite an intense time.”

SpaceX densified both oxygen and kerosene, but since the former had to be chilled to much colder temperatures, it was far more difficult to handle. Oxygen is the most abundant element on Earth and essential for life. Humans cannot breathe without it, and in our bodies, it chemically reacts with molecules from food to produce energy. Similarly, this process of oxidation occurs when oxygen combines with a fuel. Firewood, for example, cannot burn without oxygen. And so oxygen is an essential component of producing combustion within a rocket engine. In fact, most rockets burn more oxygen than fuel on the way to orbit. Onboard the Falcon 9, in terms of mass, there is more liquid oxygen than kerosene fuel.

Musk reasoned that by packing more liquid oxygen into the rocket, it could get better gas mileage. He was certainly not the first person to think about forcing oxygen into a denser state and thereby increasing the amount that a rocket’s tanks could hold; NASA had previously studied propellant densification over the decades.

Recently, the agency had dismissed it, yet again, for the Constellation Program. But this decision was not based solely on physics. Rather, it was due to politics and rivalries between the agency’s field centers. Marshall Space Flight Center, in Alabama, already had its bread and butter with existing propulsion technology. And NASA management had little appetite for the exploding test articles that would necessarily accompany densification development. Neither of these were barriers at SpaceX, which could afford to fail—and indeed publicly celebrated its test failures as evidence of pushing beyond the bleeding edge.

By densifying liquid oxygen and kerosene onboard Falcon 9, SpaceX could squeeze an extra 8 to 10 percent of performance out of the vehicle. This was not trivial. It meant carrying two more tons of payload to orbit. This was extremely important for a reusable rocket, which was paying a significant mass penalty for returning to Earth due to its landing gear and other added components. For economic viability, therefore, Musk believed densification was as important as drone ship landings. If he could accomplish both, the Falcon 9 could truly be the world’s first twenty-first- century rocket—reusable, high-performing, and cost-effective.

So how does one densify oxygen? One way is to use liquid oxygen instead of gas. Liquid oxygen has a pale blue, ghostly color. It condenses at –297.33 degrees Fahrenheit (–182.96 degrees Celsius), far, far colder than the coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth in Antarctica. It is colder than even the darkest areas of the Moon that never see sunlight. This makes working with liquid oxygen difficult. However, the upside for rockets is worth it: Liquid oxygen is 1,000 times more dense than gaseous oxygen, so most rockets use liquids.

What Musk wanted to do was make this liquid oxygen still more dense by chilling it down, almost to a solid. This is basic chemistry, as the cooler a substance gets the more its constituent molecules slow down, thereby bringing them slightly closer together. So the colder SpaceX could get its liquid oxygen, the more that could be packed onto the rocket.

This is how one day, in 2015, Muratore and another engineer named Vincent Werner found themselves on the phone with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a Maryland-based agency that is the world leader in measuring physical properties. Werner and a handful of SpaceX engineers had been poring over tables published by the agency that showed the various temperatures and pressures at which oxygen, nitrogen, and liquid air—a mixture of mostly oxygen and nitrogen— turned into solids.

“We called them because they had generated the tables,” Muratore said. “And they were like, ‘You know, guys, these were extrapolated tables. Nobody’s ever worked down here before. The tables are approximately accurate, but they could be off by a degree or two, or a psi or two.&#39;”

SpaceX was not just looking to experiment with liquid oxygen at its coldest temperatures; it planned to produce vast quantities of the stuff. For a single rocket launch, the company needed to make hundreds of thousands of gallons. The actual work of producing densified oxygen fell to a small team of about eight engineers in Cape Canaveral, including Phillip Rench.

He seemed an unlikely hire for SpaceX. Rench earned a degree in mathematics from Southern New Hampshire University, which is not known for aerospace greatness. Rench then spent nearly a decade working at SeaWorld in Orlando, where he performed an odd assortment of jobs, from underwater maintenance to fixing amusement park rides. While working at SeaWorld, Rench discovered a knack for devising solutions to challenging problems. In 2010, a veteran trainer at the park, Dawn Brancheau, was dragged to her death by a killer whale named Tilikum while gently rubbing the creature. After the incident, Rench helped build a giant submersible floor that lifted the whales out of the water, to make it safer for trainers to interact with the creatures. It was Rench’s first time working with complex valves and other components used in control systems.

After seeing a promotional video that depicted a Falcon 9 rocket launching and landing in Florida, Rench was blown away. So he applied to SpaceX and was hired early in 2014 to help modify Launch Complex 39A. Rench watched the fateful CRS-7 launch from the vantage point of this pad, alongside the other engineers, technicians, and interns working on the old NASA site.

“Everyone was super depressed,” he said. “But the next day we came back at 150 percent, with energy and passion. You know the five stages of grief? Yeah, we went through that really quick.”

Engineers at McGregor had performed preliminary densification tests, and some of the early work in Florida was led by Brian Childers and Gavin Petit. Rench worked with a team that included Petit, David Ball, Chris Wallden, and others. Because the Florida crew had no practical experience with super-chilled oxygen, they more or less just started connecting equipment and seeing what happened. SpaceX used liquid nitrogen to chill liquid oxygen because the colorless gas turns into a liquid at –320 degrees Fahrenheit (–196 degrees Celsius), below that of LOX. To further chill the liquid oxygen, the engineering team flowed it through a pipe, around which was wrapped a coil of tubing filled with liquid nitrogen. The two never mixed, but the warmer LOX would shed heat into the liquid nitrogen. As this heat moved in, some of the warmer bits of nitrogen started to boil off. SpaceX used very powerful vacuum pumps to suck this heat away. Over time, as the pressure dropped, the temperature of nitrogen fell below –340 degrees, and the liquid oxygen followed. They could not go much colder, as nitrogen freezes at –346 degrees Fahrenheit (–210 degrees Celsius).

Rench loved the work. He had spent years working on valves and other systems to control the flow, temperature, and pressure of liquids. When his team was pushing liquid oxygen to its extreme, it was not so different from SeaWorld. Over the course of a few weeks, he and the other engineers developed procedures by which this super-chilled LOX could be made and stored in a large, insulated tank at the LC-39A launch pad. They worked in pairs, for eight-hour shifts, seven days a week. The nights were eerie, with a soundtrack from purgatory.

“Liquid oxygen does not want to be densified,” Rench said. “Densification makes this low, horrible growl. When we first started densifying LOX, the Praxair delivery drivers would be pumping the warm LOX into the sphere and it would make all kinds of crazy noises. They were getting nervous to be around it, and these are people who have worked with liquid oxygen for pretty much their entire lives.”

NASA had been skeptical about SpaceX’s plans for densification at Launch Complex 39A, so it asked for a demonstration. After Rench’s team delivered and NASA signed off, the fluids team at the launch pad started stripping the parts and pumps away from the LOX chiller system. They were needed at SLC-40 to make the densified propellant for the debut flight of the Falcon 9 Full Thrust.

After two failed drone ship landings, Musk felt ready to try landing on land. This had a major advantage over the ocean, as the rocket need not contend with high seas. Ground was ground—flat and unmoving. But there was a major disadvantage, too. In returning the Falcon 9 rocket to land, it would fly near cruise ships in Port Canaveral, the National Reconnaissance Office’s multibillion-dollar Eastern Processing Facility, and numerous other launch pads and valuable assets.

SpaceX acquired an old Cape pad, Launch Complex 13, in February 2015 for the purpose of returning the rocket. Trip Harriss, who had been with the company since its days on Kwajalein and the Falcon 1, now bore responsibility for Falcon recovery efforts and led the build-out of Landing Zone 1. He and Bala Ramamurthy also worked to convince the Range commander that SpaceX should be allowed to aim rockets at the Air Force station, a first.

“As the Range commander, you’re used to rockets going away from you,” said General Wayne Monteith, who commanded the 45th Space Wing at Cape Canaveral from 2015 to 2018. “So when you see one that’s 180 feet tall and coming back, as the person responsible for the safety of everyone on that installation, you start to get a little worried. Your career dissipation light starts blinking.”

Harriss and SpaceX provided data to convince Monteith and other Air Force officials of the project’s safety. It helped that the ocean landings, although not successful, came close to hitting the drone ship. So Monteith felt confident that if SpaceX damaged any property at the Cape, it would be the company’s own equipment. SpaceX also demonstrated that the vast majority of the booster’s return flight profile was over water. If something went wrong, a destruct signal could be sent to the first stage before it threatened anything on shore.

Before he signed off on a landing attempt, however, Monteith had to convince his supervisors the plan was safe. As the weeks ticked down toward SpaceX’s return to flight, opposition started to get louder from the National Reconnaissance Office, which was concerned that vibrations from the rocket’s sonic boom—as it slowed from supersonic to subsonic speeds—would damage the delicate work being done in its payload processing facility.

Range safety analysts predicted the Falcon 9 flyback would produce a sonic boom comparable to the major 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor event in Russia, damaging buildings and homes in the Cape Canaveral area and causing widespread damage. There was little data to refute these claims, which came as part of a lengthy and official-looking 100-page report defending the analysis. Alongside those claims came a stark warning that the United States would lose assured access to space, possibly for years, due to damage of critical launch facilities.

Why was there such caution? Unless the military is in the midst of a war, it is a risk-averse operation. Asses are on the line if there is a screwup. Monteith knew the buck stopped with him and that by making the call to allow SpaceX to land at Cape Canaveral, it was his particular ass in the line of fire.

“During a meeting, a commander’s call, I stood up and said I believed this was the right thing to do,” Monteith said. “In doing so I understood that if anything went wrong, I would be fired.”

In early December, SpaceX received a green light from the Air Force to not just launch a missile, but to bring one back to the station. This is pretty remarkable, as SpaceX was flying a brand-new version of its Falcon 9 rocket, which was returning to flight after a launch failure, with densified propellant onboard for the first time.

Predictably, the run-up to the launch was chaotic. After SpaceX solved the rod end issue with NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration and obtained permission from the Air Force to dive-bomb its rocket back to the Cape, it still had to refine new procedures for densified oxygen.

One challenge with the densified oxygen was the inability to “recycle” a launch attempt if there was some technical or weather problem at the appointed time for liftoff. Once the super-chilled propellant was loaded onto the rocket, SpaceX had minutes to launch, or the liquid oxygen would become too warm. Although there was spare oxidizer in the LOX ball, offloading the warmed liquid oxygen from the rocket to this storage vessel would spoil the colder oxygen there. Dumping all the rocket’s LOX was not an option, as this would damage pipes and other launch site infrastructure.

As launch director, Lim also kept a concerned eye on the calendar. SpaceX had targeted the night of December 21, 2015, for the return to flight launch. The rocket would loft eleven satellites for the telecommunications company ORBCOMM into low-Earth orbit, with a total mass of about 4,500 pounds. This was a light enough load for the Falcon 9 to have plenty of spare fuel to return to Landing Zone 1. Everyone had worked intensely to get ready for the launch and was counting on a few days off over the holidays. Many talked of quitting if they did not get a break soon.

“We were desperately trying to save Christmas,” Lim said. “Our employees had been working months on end, and I worried that about a third of them might leave. If we scrubbed and plowed through the holidays, it would just have been murder.”

Once again, Lim directed the launch from inside the company’s control center about eight miles from the pad. In the early years, there were two principal leaders during a launch, the director and the chief engineer. This created a tension on launch day, as the director served as the “gas pedal” and the chief engineer had a more cautionary role as the “brake.” Koenigsmann typically served as chief engineer of launch, but due to his focus on the CRS-7 failure, he delegated the role to Robb Kulin.

Koenigsmann and Musk watched proceedings from inside the control room. The countdown was tense. In the final minutes before liftoff, scheduled for 8:29 pm local time, a camera inside the interstage area between the first and second stages showed drops of a pale blue liquid dripping down. This was a novel problem due to working with densified propellant for the first time, and it might indicate a number of bad things. Kerosene leaking might result in a fire. Liquid oxygen could lead to an explosion. Reviewing data and video, the launch team determined it was probably “liquid air,” or air that had been cooled down to cryogenic temperatures by the frigid tanks. Hastily, the launch team discussed whether to scrub and investigate the leak.

At T-1 minute, Koenigsmann turned to Musk. “You’ve got to make a decision,” he said.

Almost invariably, Musk delivered his decisions with confidence. He liked to command while others obeyed. But in this instance, with everything on the line for SpaceX, he responded casually, almost dreamily. “Well, I guess we’re going,” Musk said.

The upgraded version of the first stage performed perfectly. After dropping off the second stage, the rocket burned for home, dropping out of the black night down to the Florida coast. Nearer to land, from the vantage point of the launch control center, the rocket disappeared behind the tree line with a spectacular orange glow and a huge cloud of dust. Then there was a huge, building-shaking blast.

“That scared the shit out of us,” Koenigsmann said. He and Musk thought the rocket exploded. Musk’s countenance sank, despondent and disappointed.

Someone on the launch team suggested they check the video feed from the landing site. It told a happier story. The Falcon 9 rocket? It was there, standing upright on the landing pad, smoking in the mild Florida evening.

They had been fooled by the reentering rocket’s sonic boom, which had been delayed a few seconds traveling to the launch control center. The room erupted in applause and cheers.

Musk’s mood reversed entirely. He became delirious with joy, absolutely smashed full of happiness and pride for persevering long enough to see this moment. His faith in bringing rockets back from orbit and landing them, so often questioned, had been validated. Like a kid in the candy store, he kept pressing Lim and the launch team to go out to the landing pad and see his beautiful rocket. Three different people who had been with Musk for years said they had never seen him happier.

SpaceX had negotiated range safety protocols with the Air Force in the event of a landing. The rocket still had explosives onboard, including TEA-TEB ignition fluid, the rope-like flight termination system, as well as liquid oxygen and kerosene. A safety team had to secure the rocket first. But in less than an hour, Musk, Koenigsmann, and others, including Kulin, Harriss, Shana Diez, and Lee Rosen, donned hard hats to go running and skipping and dancing across the landing pad. As they danced about, they noticed there had been no apocalyptic meteor event, nor property destruction of any kind. Even the basic windows in an office trailer by the landing site bore nary a scratch. The launch of the new rocket and its unprecedented landing were a complete success.

“It’s hard to describe how epic this comeback was after our first Falcon 9 launch failure,” Koenigsmann said.

As he, Musk, and the others marveled up at that sooty rocket, illuminated by flood lights beneath dark and starry skies, they must have wondered if this moment could ever be eclipsed.

They were pretty excited back in Hawthorne, too. As the rocket touched down, hordes of employees crammed into the factory floor just outside mission control started chanting, “U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!” A raucous celebration ensued.

The four thousand employees of SpaceX had wrought nothing short of a miracle in the six months preceding that night. The company worked on four separate, massive projects in parallel, packing their final exams into that single launch. Riding onboard the Falcon 9 rocket in late December were the company’s return to flight mission, a significant upgrade to the Full Thrust version, an unprecedented oxygen densification program, and the first landing. They saved Christmas, to boot.

The historic ORBCOMM launch and landing delivered one of the most cathartic and breathtaking moments in SpaceX history. I do not believe it is possible to overstate the significance. With its fate on the line, the company roared back from a terrible and financially disastrous failure. And, on the very same flight, SpaceX accomplished something no company, or country, had ever done before. Until then, SpaceX had followed in the footsteps of NASA and others in launching rockets, flying satellites into space, and landing spacecraft in the water. Sure, it did so in cheaper and innovative ways. But these were well-trodden paths. No one had ever, ever launched an orbital rocket and landed it back on Earth minutes later.

Catriona Chambers came to SpaceX in early 2005 as an electronics engineer. Within months on the job, she picked up responsibility for the Merlin engine computer on the Falcon 1 rocket. On that small rocket’s very first launch, there was a sensor that measured atmospheric pressure. After reaching space, the first stage would descend back to Earth, and when the sensor detected a thickening atmosphere, it would command deployment of a parachute. She and everyone who worked on the rocket knew this was preposterous. The rocket would probably never survive, and the parachute would be practically useless. But Musk pushed hard for reuse from the very beginning of SpaceX. Now here she was, almost eleven years later, observing it actually happen. As director of avionics, she watched with her team as the first stage landed, feeling the weight of history as she hugged and high-fived her friends.

“That was the point where it really sunk in that we had been working on this for so long,” Chambers said. “It just felt so massive, and I was so excited. And then I realized I needed to calm down.” She was eight months pregnant, after all.

Like a lot of SpaceX employees, Zach Dunn felt both exhilaration and relief at the launch of the ORBCOMM mission. He had taken over the propulsion department in February, with the aim of completing the Merlin engine upgrades for the Full Thrust version of the Falcon 9. Within the first couple of weeks on the job, two engines blew up. Then the CRS-7 launch failed, and Dunn was thrown into the tortuous investigation. Finally came the arduous campaign to ready the new rocket and update the launch site for densified propellant.

This gave the propulsion team fits right up until the launch date. On December 18, the company had to abort three separate attempts at completing a static fire test. The launch team was still learning, on the fly, how to load and offload super-cold liquid oxygen, when Musk came into the control room. Invariably, his presence raised the level of tension and urgency. Dunn explained to Musk that by the time the rocket was ready to ignite its engines, the propellant was warmer than the engines were expecting.

“My engine team was telling me this was not the right thing to do,” Dunn said. “That we weren’t going to get the data we needed from the test. The pressure from Elon was just absolutely intense.”

On launch day, Dunn sat next to Shotwell in Hawthorne’s mission control. As soon as the booster touched down, Shotwell leapt to her feet, joining the merriment. After a few minutes of also celebrating, Dunn left and walked across the factory floor to the propulsion area. About five dozen engineers were there, almost all of his propulsion department.

“It had been a hard fucking year,” Dunn said. “This was my hardest year at SpaceX, leading propulsion, going through those failures and trying to keep the team together, and the pressure of getting back to launch. It pushed my leadership and technical abilities to their limits. My interface with Elon was more direct and more intense than it had been before. It had taken a toll.”

As Dunn walked toward his desk, the other engineers, one by one and then in a rush, stood up and applauded him. A standing ovation. It was completely unexpected. Dunn had come into the department as an outsider, having led pad operations at Vandenberg. There were a lot of egos and a lot of brains in SpaceX’s propulsion department. During the preceding ten months, Dunn had fought with this team as well as for this team. He’d won some. He’d lost some. But after that night, he was no longer just their leader. He was one of them.

“Man, I’ve never felt better in my life,” Dunn said. “It felt incredible to experience that after the hardest fight that I’ve ever had professionally.”</div>

            <h2>Tesla Owner Says FSD Is Great Except for the Part Where It Can’t Drive in the Sun</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-18</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If Elon Musk is to be believed, there will be hundreds of thousands — if not millions — of autonomous Tesla vehicles roaming the streets of America by the end of next year.

There’s a gazillion reasons to doubt whether that’ll actually happen. But in focus today is the fact that its Full Self-Driving software, which is not actually fully self-driving, can get easily stunlocked by the radiant beams of the Sun.

It’s a problem that’s been known for years, and it was recently brought back into the spotlight by Tesla investor Ross Gerber, an early backer of the automaker who has now pivoted to being one of its most outspoken bears.

On Monday, Gerber posted an image taken inside his Tesla showing it driving straight toward the Sun, with an alert on the car’s infotainment screen yelling at him to “Take Over Immediately.” The reason given: “Front camera blocked or blinded.”

“Got the new tesla FSD 14.2.1.25 and within two minutes of driving in the Sun. This,” Gerber wrote. “These cars can’t drive into Sun…”

Tesla fans, blinded by their devotion to Elon as much as the car’s camera was by sunlight, deflected by accusing Gerber of ragebaiting and mocking him for his dirty windshield.

It’s certainly not beyond the realm of possibility that Gerber is being intentionally provocative, given his prominence as a Musk critic. But he’s describing an issue that is very much real, and which has had tragic consequences.

This year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched a probe into the automaker after a Tesla running FSD mowed down and killed an elderly pedestrian on the side of the road. Footage taken by the car’s front camera clearly showed that its vision was washed out by sunlight shining directly into the lens.

The horrific accident underscores the risks of Tesla’s vision-only approach to self-driving cars. Its competitors, like the robotaxi leader Waymo, use a variety of sensory inputs to detect their surroundings, including cameras, radar, and what’s known as lidar — short for light detection and ranging, which works on the same principle as radar, but by using lasers instead of radio waves and can map out a detailed three-dimensional representation of a vehicle’s environment.

Musk, however, infamously believes lidar and radar to be a “crutch,” and ditched using them entirely years ago. He continues to insist that the systems are befuddled by rain, snow and dust due to reflection scattering, claiming that’s why Waymos are inferior to Teslas in heavy precipitation. Lidar and radar, in fact, actually “reduce safety,” according to Musk, because they can produce data that contradicts the cameras and confuse the FSD software, an argument that’s proved controversial even among his most ardent boosters.

Critics point to the moment Musk ditched lidar and radar systems as the moment that Tesla’s self-driving efforts began unraveling for good. Five years since FSD’s first beta release, it’s still committing ghastly errors like driving into the path of oncoming trains.

            <h2>New NASA Director Taking Over Agency in Crisis</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-18</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s been almost a full year since NASA last had a full-time leader.

The agency, responsible for the Trump administration’s ambitious goals of returning astronauts to the lunar surface for the first time in over half a century, has instead passed through the hands of several interim administrators since president Donald Trump took office.

Now, the office is finally officially filled. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s personal pick for the job, private space tourist and billionaire pilot Jared Isaacman, has officially been confirmed by the Senate with a 67 to 30 vote.

Between late last year and this summer, Isaacman appeared to be the clear frontrunner. But as Musk and Trump’s relationship soured, the president threw Isaacman’s nomination out in a fit of anger — only to change his mind again mere months later.

The reality is that Isaacman is taking over an agency in crisis. NASA is facing an existential moment as the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) aims to deal the agency a devastating and possibly lethal blow, eviscerating dozens of major ongoing and future science missions.

For now, following the government shutdown earlier this year, the matter remains up in the air. A short-term resolution was passed on November 12, leaving the government until January 31 to essentially determine the fate of NASA.

Both Trump and Musk have also called the agency’s existing Moon program into question, undermining missions that have been decades in the works, and arguing we should visit Mars instead. (Trump’s personal position on the matter has bounced back and forth.)

Unsurprisingly, Isaacman, who has traveled to space on two occasions with the help of Musk’s SpaceX, has focused on the prospect of NASA building out a space economy with the help of commercial entities.

As laid out in a controversial document called “Project Athena,” which was leaked to the press last month, Isaacman believes NASA should be run more like a business, shocking former NASA officials. According to him, it’s possible to establish a presence on the Moon and send humans to Mars simultaneously.

It’s a particularly pertinent topic as lawmakers are panicking about the possibility of China beating the US to the Moon.

“This is not the time for delay but a time for action because if we fall behind — if we make a mistake — we may never catch up, and the consequences could shift the balance of power here on Earth,” Isaacman told senators in November.

Others are far more optimistic about the prospect of Isaacman at the helm, with American Enterprise Institute analyst Todd Harrison telling the New York Times that he could put “NASA back on a good track.”

“After nearly a year of historic disruptions to the agency’s workforce, facilities, and budget, Mr. Isaacman has the opportunity to stabilize and reinvigorate the US space program,” the Planetary Society wrote in a statement.

Isaacman also enjoys bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, which could help the agency secure the enormous budgets required for its ambitious plans.

“I am optimistic that Mr. Isaacman will bring a steady hand and clear vision to NASA,” senator Marie Cantwell (D-WA) said in a statement, as quoted by the NYT. “I hope we can partner together, all of us, to achieve this incredible thing for the American people.”

“You are as committed to American supremacy in the final frontier as is this committee and the entire Senate,” Senate Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz (R-TX) told Isaacman ahead of this week’s vote. “My hope is that you will be confirmed and in this role before the end of this year.”

At the end of the day, though, Isaacman is an extremely wealthy entrepreneur with zero political experience — and now that he’s got the job, he’s trapped navigating a major political standoff between Congress and the White House that could make, or destroy, his legacy.

            <div id="article-text">You know those memes about how there’s no such thing as a free VPN? Here’s the ultimate cautionary tale.

A recent investigation by Tel Aviv-based security firm Koi uncovered a massive data harvesting operation tied to a voluntary extension on Google’s Chrome browser. Called Urban VPN Proxy, the free extension has some six million users at the time of writing, and even a “featured” badge on the Chrome Web Store — in other words, an endorsement from Google itself.

As Koi researcher Idan Dardikman writes, the extension goes beyond the actions of a typical VPN. Packed under the hood are “executor” scripts designed to intercept and capture conversations from the leading AI platforms, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, DeepSeek, and xAI’s Grok.

The data collected encompasses anything a user might ask their chosen AI chatbot, per Dardikman, including “medical questions, financial details, proprietary code, personal dilemmas, all of it, sold for ‘marketing analytics purposes.&#39;”

Regardless of whether the VPN is on or off, Urban VPN Proxy is constantly scraping conversation data. The script is enabled by default, meaning that from the moment someone downloads the extension, their chatbot gabbing is fair game.

Worse yet, Forbes notes, “there is no user-facing toggle to disable this. The only way to stop the data collection is to uninstall the extension entirely.”

The company behind Urban VPN Proxy, Urban Cyber Security Inc, isn’t shy about any of this. As Dardikman observes, the company’s privacy policy explicitly states that “we share the Web Browsing Data with our affiliated company,” a data broker called BiScience, “that uses this raw data and creates insights which are commercially used and shared with business partners.”

Despite this, Urban VPN Proxy’s page on the Chrome Web Store declares that “your data is not being sold to third parties, outside of the approved use cases,” and “not being used or transferred for purposes that are unrelated to the item’s core functionality.”

Though the revelation might be startling for the six million users of Urban VPN Proxy, it’s surely not the only app running this scheme. Indeed, Forbes notes there are over two million customers across seven additional apps by the same publisher, each with “identical AI harvesting functionality.” All but one of them carry a “featured” badge courtesy of Google’s Chrome Web Store.

As Koi’s Dardikman writes, “if you have any of these extensions installed, uninstall them now. Assume any AI conversations you’ve had since July 2025 have been captured and shared with third parties.”

Even if your apps weren’t developed by this company, it might be a good time to start combing through their own privacy policies for similar scraping permissions. As Dardikman has shown, when it comes to data harvesting, all bets are off.

            <h2>Trump Media is merging with fusion power company TAE Technologies in $6B+ deal</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/trump-media-is-merging-with-fusion-power-company-tae-technologies-in-6b-deal/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), said on Thursday that it’s merging with TAE Technologies, a Southern California-based company that has been chasing the dream of fusion power for nearly 30 years.

The all-stock transaction, valued at more than $6 billion, would expand Trump Media’s presence into the nascent fusion power space while data centers clamor for more electricity amid the ongoing AI boom.

Fusion industry insiders expressed curiosity over the deal and voiced concerns about potential conflicts of interest with the U.S. Department of Energy. Last week, industry representatives met with Energy department officials, urging them to help direct billions of dollars toward fusion projects, and earlier this year, the DOE announced a new roadmap to guide commercial efforts in the sector, though it didn’t commit any new funds alongside the announcement.

TMTG is the parent company of Truth Social, the microblogging platform that the president spun up after he was banned from platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook in the wake of the January 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. At launch, the president called it “a rival to the liberal media consortium,” and said he wanted to “fight back against the Big Tech companies.”

TMTG went public last year via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a technique used to go public by private companies that want to raise money quickly but aren’t yet mature enough to take the traditional IPO route. In the quarter ended September 30, 2025, TMTG reported that it recorded a loss of $54.8 million on revenue of $972,900.

Truth Social and the company’s streaming platform have failed to generate much revenue, but TMTG has nevertheless managed to amass $3.1 billion in assets, largely through its cryptocurrency investments and partnerships.

TMTG CEO Devin Nunes, formerly a Republican congressman, stated that the company’s acquisition of TAE would “cement America’s global energy dominance for generations.” The companies said they plan to site and begin construction on “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant (50 MWe)” next year, and have plans for more fusion plants that are expected to generate between 350 megawatts to 500 megawatts of electricity.

But the path forward for fusion power remains uncertain.

Currently, only one experimental device has proven that controlled fusion reactions can generate more power than they consume. Several other companies, including Bill Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Sam Altman-backed Helion, are in the race to put fusion power on the grid sometime in the early 2030s.

If one or more fusion startups succeed, they could deliver gigawatts of clean, continuous power to the grid using nothing more than hydrogen isotopes filtered from seawater. Inside a fusion reactor, those isotopes are heated and compressed until they turn into a plasma. When particles in the plasma collide, they merge to form a new, heavier atom while releasing tremendous amounts of heat, which can be harvested to generate electricity.

TAE has been working on a range of fusion devices since the late 1990s. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in total, including a recent $150 million round from existing investors including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and New Enterprise. The company has been valued at about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook.

Over the years, TAE has struggled to make its various designs work. Its latest effort uses magnetic fields generated by rotating plasma to stabilize the plasma itself. Particle beams bombard the outside of the plasma cloud, helping it to spin.

In the meantime, TAE has also created a new division focused on the life sciences. It is selling a version of its particle accelerator as a radiation treatment for cancer.

After the merger, Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ethereal Exploration Guild, an Indian spacetech startup better known as EtherealX — developing a fully reusable medium-lift launch vehicle — is close to securing about $21 million in a new funding round co-led by TDK Ventures, with Accel among the participants, TechCrunch has learned.

Initially planned as a $15 million Series A, the round has drawn strong investor demand and is now expected to reach about $20.5 million, three people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The funding comes more than a year after the startup raised a $5 million seed round in August 2024.

TDK Ventures is co-leading the round with Vietnam-based venture capital firm BIG Capital, with Accel also participating, the sources said.

The funding talks follow EtherealX securing $130 million worth of contracts from six customers, the sources told TechCrunch, underscoring early commercial demand for its launch services.

Founded in 2022 by Manu J. Nair alongside former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist Shubhayu Sardar, who serves as chief operating officer, and aerospace engineer Prashant Sharma, the chief technology officer, EtherealX is aiming to take on SpaceX with a medium-lift launch vehicle called Razor Crest Mk-1. The rocket, designed to be fully reusable, is expected to place up to eight tonnes into low Earth orbit and will also be capable of delivering payloads to geostationary transfer and trans-lunar injection orbits.

The Bengaluru-based startup says its launch system will offer cost efficiencies to customers while helping to address a global shortage of launch capacity, with a first launch targeted for early 2027.

In an interview with TechCrunch last year, Nair said EtherealX’s rocket could offer launch prices ranging from about $350 to $2,000 per kilogram. By comparison, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 typically charges between $1,600 and $2,000 per kilogram.

“At the price point at which we will enter the market, we’ll comfortably capture 30% to 40% of it,” Nair said at the time.

India has emerged as one of the few countries globally with a geographic and regulatory advantage for space launches, offering access to multiple orbital inclinations from a single launch site. Its growing spacetech ecosystem is also attracting global investors seeking markets that can complement space development in the United States, Europe, and other key regions.

EtherealX has secured 16 acres of land in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which it plans to make operational early next year. The startup has also been developing key components, including a liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopump assembly for its upper-stage engine, known as Pegasus 2.0, according to a recent LinkedIn post by Nair last week.

India is aiming to dramatically expand its footprint in the global commercial space industry, targeting an 8% to 10% market share over the next decade from less than 2% today, with much of that growth expected to be driven by private startups. The country is working toward a $40 billion to $45 billion space economy within the next eight to 10 years, Indian Space Minister Jitendra Singh said recently.

Nair declined to comment. TDK Ventures, Accel, and BIG Capital did not respond to requests for comment.

            <div id="article-text">DXS International, a U.K.-based company that provides healthcare tech for England’s National Health Service (NHS), disclosed a cyberattack in a statement on Thursday.

In a filing with the London Stock Exchange, the company said it experienced a “a security incident affecting its office servers,” discovered on December 14. The company said it “immediately” contained the breach working together with the NHS, and hired a cybersecurity firm to investigate “the nature and extent of the incident.”

“There was minimal impact on the company’s services and the company’s front-line clinical services remain unaffected and operational,” read the filing.

At this point, the specific nature of the breach is not known, nor whether any patients’ medical information was stolen.

However, earlier this week, a ransomware group called DevMan took credit for the breach. In a post on its dark web site, which TechCrunch has seen, the hackers listed the company on December 14 and claimed to have stolen 300 gigabytes of data from the company.

DXS said it also notified law enforcement and regulators, including the U.K.’s data protection authority, the Information Commissioner’s Office, or ICO, about the cyberattack.

NHS England spokesperson Katie Baldwin told TechCrunch that the health service is “not aware of any patient services being impacted.”

Representatives from DXS and the ICO did not immediately respond to a series of questions sent by TechCrunch.

On its website, DXS says it provides software that helps to reduce costs for doctors and primary care physicians. As such, the company’s software touches patient records and data. The company also says that in some cases, its solutions are hosted on the NHS’ Health and Social Care Network (HSCN), which is a system for healthcare organizations across the U.K. to access and share information.

Generally speaking, the NHS does not store patient’s medical data in a centralized system.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The gunman who shot up a classroom on Brown University’s campus on Saturday, killing two students and wounding nine others, has evaded capture for nearly a week. Because Americans have become culturally accustomed to police investigations that resolve at the breakneck speed of social-media-driven news cycles, this may feel to many like a distressingly long time. To some it is unacceptable, and suggests incompetence. But that is hardly the most likely explanation for the delay. Before I became a professor at Brown, I served as a police officer for 23 years, in New York City and Vermont, presiding over some challenging homicide investigations. In this most recent mass shooting, the public is getting a window into the type of grinding, unglamorous, and above all time-consuming detective work necessary when a suspect gets a lucky break.

The whodunit of a mass shooting typically reveals itself quickly, for several reasons. In many cases the attacker is personally connected to the targets, exacting some sort of perceived vengeance, and wants to make himself known. Or the attacker is suicidal, and doesn’t plan on making it out alive. Sometimes, the police arrive during the shooting, foreclosing escape, or the intended victims overwhelm the attacker in a desperate act of self-defense. If the attacker is in the midst of an acute breakdown or has a long list of targets, they might begin by killing a relative or partner; the Sandy Hook shooter killed his mother before going to the school. All it takes is one of these factors to yield a named suspect and a quickly closed case.

But in a nation with more mass shootings than all other rich countries combined, as a matter of sheer volume, there will be incidents in which an unknown shooter with an unknown motive makes an escape. It is just a matter of the odds and a little intelligent preparation on the part of the assailant. This appears to be the situation at Brown, and as much as that is unsettling, it is not evidence of police incompetence. In my own homicide cases when I was a chief of police, more often than not, an arrest required a multiday interstate hunt, one spanning the continent, and these were instances in which the perpetrator had been known to the victim or witnesses. When the investigative starting point is the complete chaos of a shooting scene, some arrests just take time, and some cases are just hard to solve.

This reality may be hard to accept given pervasive digital surveillance, which seems to have permeated every inch of our civic space. In New York City, there are hundreds of cameras per square mile, and their coverage includes its universities. Columbia University, for example, has an extensive camera system covering all of its facilities and public spaces, part of an overall network that extends well into the surrounding neighborhood. New York University does as well. The University of Chicago has not only countless cameras, but also uniformed security guards posted on foot on every block of campus as part of one the largest private-police operations in the nation.

Xochitl Gonzalez: America is failing its children

Brown, however, is a different animal: The campus is cloistered in an affluent part of a midsize New England city with a low-key sensibility. The college has more than 1,200 cameras, but they have notable blind spots, unfortunately including the part of the building where the shooting took place. The homes around the school are beautiful but old wooden structures that can date to colonial times, making doorbell cameras a less common retrofit. Among the allures of Brown are that it feels both urban and bucolic at once, and that it is comparatively safe for a school in a bona fide city. That allure may have been shattered, but it is one of the reasons we don’t have block-to-block footage of the killer to dissect as they moved around Providence.

I would also hesitate to attribute the delay in this instance to disarray in the upper ranks of the FBI. Although the FBI’s leadership has been scuttled and shuffled around, and its political appointees are markedly ineffective, its special agents on the ground understand the elements of a thorough mass-shooting investigation. The agents in the FBI’s Boston field office—the one that covers this shooting—are career professionals fully capable of doing the investigative work required of what amounts to a complex homicide investigation.

A perspective that extends beyond mass-shooting incidents might be valuable. When Timothy McVeigh used a truck bomb to blow up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma in 1995, he was coincidentally arrested by police for a traffic violation before he was identified as the suspect. Tyler Robinson, the suspect accused of assassinating Charlie Kirk in front of a crowd of thousands of people in Utah this September, made a clean escape; his surrender was negotiated by his family the next day. Luigi Mangione is alleged to have killed his victim on video on a Midtown Manhattan sidewalk a year ago, and even with extensive imagery and DNA evidence, it still took the better part of five days to arrest him at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania.

The appearance of competence and speed, in other words, sometimes requires a good deal of luck. And in the absence of luck, competence requires hours of boring, hard work that focuses on minor details such as cellphone records, license plates, painstakingly gathered witness accounts, credit-card statements, and every manner of forensic evidence, including the marks on a bullet, bits of DNA, the make of a piece of clothing in a photo. None of this is amenable to our present news cycle, and none of it easily reassures a traumatized university and nation. But it is the essence of good detective work.

Perhaps the most tragic aspect of all of this is that the mass shooting at Brown isn’t uncommon at all in terms of its toll on human life. By one measure, 22 percent of homicide incidents in the United States involve more than one victim. Few of these deaths get national attention, and many go unsolved. But as time goes by, I have every expectation that the police, special agents, troopers, and eventually prosecutors will pore through possibly millions of bits of data, images, and statements to piece together the investigative picture of the Brown shooting. Ultimately, relentlessness is how a suspect’s luck is undone.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Few professionals suffer more from ageism than athletes. Heaven forfend an NFL star or an Olympian become 40ish on the field of play. That’s known as “staying too long” and “tainting their legacy.” Fans and commentators seem to want athletes to retire before they lose the luster of their prime and start looking knee sore—an expectation that, judging by the recent exploits of the skier Lindsey Vonn and the quarterback Philip Rivers, has cheated audiences out of who knows how many gladdening third acts.

What a corrective to such nonsense Vonn is. Last Friday, at the age of 41 and on a partially replaced right knee, she sprayed the snow of St. Moritz at 70 miles an hour in the downhill event to become the oldest skier, woman or man, ever to win a World Cup race. Her last World Cup victory had come seven years earlier—or, as she said wryly after her win, “just a couple of days.”

The shock of Vonn’s resurgence had not yet worn off when, two days later, the 44-year-old Rivers jogged—gingerly—onto the field as an emergency starter for the injury-thinned Indianapolis Colts. He is literally a grandpa, has an easy-chair double chin, and hadn’t thrown a pro pass since his retirement, in 2021. The Colts’ opponents, the Seattle Seahawks, were rated as 14-point favorites. A hand-lettered sign held up by a Seahawks fan read For Every Rivers Sack—AARP Gets a Donation.

Read: The most difficult position in sports

Yet Rivers threw a touchdown pass, which he celebrated with a double pump of his fist and an air kick, and led his team to a near-victory. (They lost just 18–16 in the final seconds.) It appears he will remain the Colts’ starter for the final three games of the season as the team seeks a playoff spot, a chase that Rivers is down for. He’d clearly missed playing—he told reporters after Sunday’s game: “My wife always tells me I’m crazy because there’s been times in the last three or four years I said, ‘I wish I could just throw one and get hit—hard.’”

Too many athletes, however, are discouraged from competing as they age. When Vonn announced a year ago that she was returning to racing, the former Olympic champion Michaela Dorfmeister blurted on TV that she thought Vonn “should see a psychologist” and asked, “Does she want to kill herself?” Another Olympic gold medalist, Bernhard Russi, called Vonn’s comeback a “no go,” and said that her “high-risk style” was “too risky.” The Swiss skier Sonja Nef said, “At 40, you can’t go full throttle like that, and certainly not with an artificial knee joint,” adding, “It feels like she’s jeopardizing her legacy.” Nef also said, “I would guess Lindsey doesn’t cope in normal life, where she isn’t the center of attention.” The Swiss legend Pirmin Zurbriggen also suggested that Vonn was skiing out of neediness, because she “hasn’t recognized the meaning and purpose of her other life in recent years.”

But what if her purpose is to ski? Yes, Vonn took a risk by returning to racing. Even the most superb body begins to diminish in a person’s early 30s, thanks to the onset of sarcopenia, which sounds like a canker but means the incremental decline of muscle mass. Also, imperceptibly at first, aerobic capacity begins to lessen, flexibility decreases, ligaments stiffen. But downhilling is dangerous at any age. And premature retirement is not good for many people: Studies show that retirees who lack purpose have a higher association with mortality, as well as higher incidences of sleep disturbance and depression. Yet Vonn’s peers insisted she was supposed to do the dignified thing and stay away to avoid injury or embarrassment. That’s their vanity, not hers. “Did they all become doctors and I missed it,” Vonn shot back on her X account. “Because they talk like they know more than the best doctors in the world.”

Rivers certainly looked old early in the game against the Seahawks, when he awkwardly slipped, fell to the ground, and struggled back to his feet. “He got up on his own, that’s a sign of youthful energy,” the CBS commentator Jason McCourty joked. But as Rivers went on to prove, high performance is not all about muscle and aerobics. Know-how doesn’t fade as quickly. Tom Brady in 2022 set the record as the oldest quarterback to start in the NFL, at the age of 45, in part because he knew exactly where to go to avoid getting hit. So does Rivers, one of the canniest readers of the field.

Rivers retired in 2021 not because he couldn’t play anymore but because he wouldn’t. He and his wife, Tiffany, have 10 children, and after 17 years in the league, he felt ambivalent and wondered if he’d focused on himself for long enough. The decision to retire, he said at his reintroductory press conference, “was right, and I’m still at peace with when it happened. But I also left knowing that I had some left in the tank.” He added, “So I didn’t walk away because I felt like I was done.”

Vonn, too, left her sport believing she hadn’t exhausted herself. She quit in 2019 because knee injuries wouldn’t let her train without pain. Her partial right-knee replacement last year, using less-invasive robotic arthroscopy and titanium components, gave her the urge to try again. In St. Moritz she pistoned through her turns and hurtled across the finish line with such conviction that she skidded into the safety barrier and toppled over. “I had a hard time stopping,” she said. She was nearly a second faster than her closest competitor—a huge margin. She “took us all to school,” Sofia Goggia, a 2018 Olympic gold medalist, said, “and left us with a pacifier in our mouths.”

Vonn and Rivers unretired in different circumstances, but they both saw an opening to compete again, and something adventurous in them said, Why not? They were guided not by a desire for the perfection of their prime, but instead by an exploratory curiosity. “The easiest way to eliminate all the things that might could go bad is to stay home,” Rivers said. “And the only way to find out Can you still do it? is to go try.”

These athletes will have to retire again, of course. They can’t extend their careers by decades, only by years. As LeBron James, 40, tweeted after Vonn’s victory, “40+ is the new 20. Well, until you wake up the next day!” But in the meantime, what a lesson in false limits.</div>

            <h2>How Warren Buffett Did It</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/warren-buffett-retirement/685294/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Warren Buffett has long been known and admired around the world for doing something that is, at its essence, mundane. He is not a brilliant artist or a great inventor or a record-setting athlete. Instead, his brilliance—a low-key, midwestern type of brilliance—found expression in the prosaic art of investing: buying this stock and avoiding that one. Buffett himself has called this task “simple, but not easy.” While millions upon millions of people buy and sell investments every day, no one has a record of doing it better than he has, as consistently as he has, and for as long as he has.

Buffett’s imminent retirement at the age of 95 is a moment to reflect on the qualities that have made him the most successful investor of all time. These qualities—relentless curiosity, analytical consistency, focused effort, and humility, along with high integrity, a personality unchanged by wealth or success, and a sunny optimism about the United States—have made him an American role model. He has also epitomized respect for old-fashioned American values—free markets, a democratic system of governance, patriotism, and plain old common sense—that today have lost some of their currency. Now, in a world alarmingly short of proper role models, Buffett is departing the scene. His voice and example will be deeply missed.

Since childhood, Warren Buffett has had a precocious investment mind and acumen for business. As a young man in Omaha, he became interested in the stock market and made his first investment (in Cities Service preferred shares) at age 11. He earned money selling peanuts and popcorn at college football games, as a newsboy delivering The Washington Post, and as the producer of a racetrack tip sheet. At age 17, he scraped together his savings to purchase pinball machines that he placed in barbershops, an investment that generated ongoing cash flow back to Buffett.

In his early 20s, he found out about a class he was interested in, at Columbia University, on value investing, the art of patiently searching for investment bargains. The class was taught by an immigrant genius and polymath, Benjamin Graham, who also ran a successful investment fund. Graham had co-written a book called Security Analysis in 1934 (I was involved as an editor of later editions), and in 1949 published The Intelligent Investor, which came to be known as the bible of value investing. Buffett was accepted into the class. He and Graham formed a close and enduring relationship, and, as they say, the rest is history.

Taking inspiration from Graham, in 1956 the 25-year-old Buffett opened an investment partnership, inviting in friends and neighbors. Buffett possessed great confidence from a young age that a value-investment approach would reliably compound capital far into the future at exceptional rates of return; it seemed as if he could see how his fortune would grow with the passage of time, if only he didn’t take his eye off the ball. He was determined to stay within his “circle of competence,” focusing all of his attention on investing in businesses he was certain he could understand. And indeed, this partnership produced extraordinary results over its nearly 15 years of operation.

Jim Manzi: Is Warren Buffett brilliant or lucky?

In 1962, Buffett’s investment partnership bought its first shares of Berkshire Hathaway, a holding that, over time, would take on increased personal importance for Buffett. Berkshire, then just a textile company, was superficially bargain-priced, trading at a low multiple of its book value and earnings. But it was a low-quality business, facing the challenge of high-cost domestic operations at a time when offshore competitors could make products at a fraction of the cost. Buffett’s plan was to persuade the company to jettison its textile operations, letting him capitalize on its discounted market valuation. Fast-forward eight years, and Buffett became chairman of Berkshire. He took the necessary steps to turn the declining manufacturer into an insurance and industrial conglomerate and a lifelong investment vehicle whose name (which he never changed) would eventually become synonymous with his own.

One of the reasons to own an insurance company was crystal clear in Buffett’s mind: Such companies generate a large pile of cash that grows when the business expands. This is known as “float” in the industry’s parlance—liquidity available to be deployed until it might someday be needed to settle insurance claims. Buffett knew that he could enhance Berkshire’s returns over time by investing the float.

Buffett transformed Berkshire into a holding company with “permanent capital” that would invest not only in common stocks but also in entire businesses. Berkshire grew to eventually own hundreds of businesses—including BNSF Railway, Geico, NetJets, and numerous energy and power companies—and concentrated stock positions in Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola. This proved to be a winning formula: a platform in which Buffett soon concentrated the great majority of his net worth, a company upon which he could single-mindedly focus. Buffett held almost all of his original Berkshire Hathaway shares until recently, when he began to reduce his stake as part of his estate-planning and philanthropic efforts. Buffett’s personal investment in Berkshire Hathaway ultimately grew to be worth more than $125 billion, even after he had donated many tens of billions’ worth of shares to charity. No one else has ever built such an investment fortune from scratch; it was as if he hit a lottery with an ever-growing payoff, though one based not on luck but on the consistent application of skillful effort.

Buffett’s success is, to a large extent, attributable to his acumen as a value investor, always appraising stocks as fractional-ownership interests in businesses that he planned to hold over the long term. His process was to conduct extensive due diligence and analysis; operate from an instinctive mental model of the characteristics of “good businesses”; wait patiently for a “fat pitch” (the rare combination of a high-quality business and a share price that misvalued it); and then, and only then, take a big swing. If a stock that Buffett liked fell in price, he happily bought more—which is not at all how most people feel when their stocks decline.

Allow me to step back and note that value investors—and I count myself as one—are a quirky breed. They tend to be mathematically precocious and interested at an early age in collecting stamps or coins, handicapping racehorses, starting businesses, investing in the stock market, and finding ways to make money. They are consummate bargain hunters and have personalities that make them natural contrarians. They don’t gain comfort from consensus, and even become uncomfortable when their views go mainstream. Although most investors get excited by whispered tips or hot public offerings, value investors aim to remain disciplined and focus on the underlying worth of a business, its return on invested capital, the earnings and cash flow that is being generated, and the company’s future prospects.

They get excited not by the possibility of an instant gain but by the inexorable math of compounding capital over the long run. Financial pundits sometimes call the concept of compound interest (or compound returns) the “eighth wonder of the world”—the extraordinary result that comes from making wise and informed investments, sticking with them, and consistently taking the long view. This concept epitomizes Buffett, who never tried to get rich quick (which I’m quite sure he would say he didn’t know how to do) when going slower would produce a more certain and ultimately far more lucrative result. Compounding, if done successfully, would over time reliably increase Buffett’s net worth; on a graph showing wealth versus time, the plotted points would be steadily up and to the right.

Over the course of my own 45-year investment career, just about every value investor I’ve known has looked up to and admired Buffett. The value-investment community knows his record, tracks his latest purchases and sales, and gains insight into how he thinks from his shareholder letters. While some have chosen to use this information to replicate Buffett’s portfolio and others have made Berkshire Hathaway shares a core position, most have focused their attention not on his holdings but on his thought process and demeanor—patient, consistent, unemotional, and oriented toward the long term.

How did Buffett do it so well for so long? He’s brought five main traits to his investing:

An alert, quick, accurate, and decisive mind that gives him the ability to form reliable investment judgments.

Simplicity of thought, getting right to the heart of the matter in analyzing each investment.

The ability to distinguish good investments from bad ones, and great investments from merely good ones—and the insight and conviction to stick with the best ones over time. Buffett, to paraphrase the investment guru Peter Lynch, never cut his flowers or watered his weeds.

The ability to stay focused over long periods and avoid distraction.

The mental agility to alter his strategy when he found a way to improve, such as when he came to more significantly emphasize the quality of a business in his decision making.

Over the course of his career, Buffett successfully navigated market booms and busts, financial crises, wars, pandemics, and mind-boggling technological innovations that spawned countless businesses while disrupting, even displacing, a great many others. Through all of this, Buffett simply marched ahead, seemingly unfazed. Over the span of his career, competition among investors greatly intensified as investing became more institutionalized, more young people pursued investment professions, financial information became widely available, and ever larger sums of investment capital competed for excess returns. Buffett just kept on cranking out exceptional results.

From the November 2004 Issue: American everyman

People have a general sense that somebody can become rich by investing in (the right) common stocks, reinvesting the dividends along the way, and hanging on when other investors are panicking. We occasionally hear stories about a retired janitor, schoolteacher, or librarian who scrimped, saved, and invested wisely, leaving behind a small fortune. Buffett demonstrated something more startling—that you could become one of the richest people in the world by doing so, and not by using a wonky trading algorithm that scrapes a penny or two off every trade but by deploying a commonsensical plan to buy and hold shares in high-quality, publicly traded businesses. Buffett, in this way, was both a man apart—an investing unicorn—but also an Everyman, just another guy buying shares, usually in well-known companies. (The Average Joe, however, did not spend his days and evenings scouring stacks of corporate annual reports, footnote after footnote, for revealing insights.)

Buffett was typically a long-term holder of companies in which he invested. The bar he set for himself to own a new name was high, and he recommended that investors take new positions infrequently, because there are only so many worthwhile ideas. He was immune to the tendency of most investors to focus on the trendiest sector or the hottest new technology, and over time this served him exceedingly well. He invented the construct of an investing “punch card” for each aspiring investor, with only 20 punches to be used over a lifetime. No one actually follows this idea (few of us could realistically be that disciplined), but it is a good mental framework nonetheless: a reminder that when you find a really compelling investment, you shouldn’t be afraid to load up. This way of thinking is at odds with the contemporary investment practice of extensively diversifying one’s portfolio as a means of reducing risk, which has the effect of driving many to diversify away from their very best investment ideas.

Buffett has often noted that he benefited from serendipity over his career, and in some ways he did. In his own lexicon, he was a winner of the “ovarian lottery,” born in good health and with a fine brain into a two-parent family that was reasonably prosperous. He was raised in Nebraska, a state where people take pride in thinking independently, and a place where old-fashioned virtues such as industry, thrift, and keeping your word were learned early. His father was a businessman and eventually served as a U.S. representative. Nebraska was sufficiently distant from Wall Street to make peer pressure not much of a factor in Buffett’s professional development. Indeed, Buffett noted in November, “The center of the United States was a very good place to be born, to raise a family, and to build a business.” Buffett has regularly pointed out that he was advantaged by being American. This focused him primarily on companies in the U.S., where the rule of law meant a reasonably level playing field and where there were marketable securities galore to analyze and choose among. And being long on American stocks in the second half of the American Century was a good thing indeed. Few major markets did as well as the U.S. equity market over the span of his career.

Buffett was not only an investor; he was also a deep investment thinker, consistently trying to improve, looking for new areas of advantage, and learning from his mistakes. While he remained a value investor throughout his career, Buffett came to be deeply influenced by the thinking of another investment luminary, Philip Fisher, as well as his longtime friend and collaborator Charlie Munger. As a result, he refined his approach to focus less on lower-quality companies trading at bottom-of-the-barrel valuations and more on the quality of the underlying businesses, even when that meant paying up, because the higher quality would likely lead to a growing and more valuable investment. Buffett acknowledged his new insight this way: “I try to invest in businesses that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them. Because sooner or later, one will.”

As his career took off in the 1960s and ’70s, Buffett was busily selecting investments one by one based on fundamental criteria such as earnings and cash flow. Contemporaneously, academics were pioneering a new theory—the “efficient-market hypothesis”—that posited that the financial markets must be efficient, because any new information that came about would be quickly reflected in securities prices. If you believed in market efficiency, you necessarily believed that no one could reliably beat the market. But Buffett was living proof that one could prosper by uncovering market inefficiencies. In 1984, Buffett argued in the Columbia Business School magazine that finance professors should put aside their theories and examine the records of eight investment funds (mostly run by friends of his), in addition to his own. Within the academy, Buffett came to be seen as one of a kind, an n of one. But rather than study Buffett and what he did, for decades finance professors clung to their theories and invented new ways to explain away his success. Even today, finance students continue to be taught the efficient-market hypothesis. Buffett has often noted that the greater the number of people who are taught that the markets are efficient, and that fundamental investment analysis is a waste of time, the more subdued the competition and the better it is to be a value investor.

While Buffett built an unprecedented fortune from scratch over the course of his investment career, this was not, in my view, his most extraordinary accomplishment. Rather, Buffett’s most significant feat was the way he vaulted as a young man to investment success and then managed to perform at the top of his game for his entire adult life, for nearly three-quarters of a century. We could debate whether Buffett was the investment MVP of any particular year; any investor’s performance is subject to the vicissitudes of the stock market and is thus best measured over longer-term horizons. But had any serious student of the financial markets between the mid-1960s and the mid-2020s been asked at any particular moment to vote for an investing All-Star team, Buffett likely would have been included on every ballot, every year.

Clive Crook: On Warren Buffett and Stephen King

Buffett was relentless; he rarely took time off, and he never allowed himself to drift from his disciplined approach or adopt new priorities. And for most of his career, he worked more or less alone—just Buffett and some accounting and administrative support. He was investing’s Cal Ripken: an iron man who was in the starting lineup every single day. He was also basically alone at the top; there was no other investor over that period who became as well known, and no one else with a record remotely as lengthy or exceptional as his. Like Secretariat winning the Belmont Stakes in 1973 by the length of the home stretch, it didn’t really matter which noncontender came in second.

Buffett is a gifted and inspiring teacher, and he has frequently taken the time to appear as a guest speaker in classrooms. Legions of student groups have flown out to Nebraska to meet, ask questions of, and have their picture taken with the Oracle of Omaha. Over the years, Buffett’s annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letters (and even his earlier partnership letters) became must-reads for investment professionals. Unlike most wonky and tedious Wall Street market commentators, Buffett became famous for making complicated subjects understandable. Buffett’s missives were eagerly awaited by the investment community; they were replete with memorable quips (such as the admonition about risk-taking that “It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been swimming naked,” and the time-tested advice to “Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful”), as well as quotes from the likes of Yogi Berra and Mae West.

Buffett’s annual letters became so influential that I believe they had the effect of upgrading the way that most professional investors communicate with their clients. Many hedge and some mutual-fund managers (myself included) have sought to emulate Buffett’s missives in two ways: by putting considerable effort into making their own letters thorough, informative, and readable, and by imagining they’re writing to a less knowledgeable relative (as Buffett did) who is nonetheless a major investor in their fund and deserves to know the thinking behind decisions. Buffett has lived into a saying often attributed to Albert Einstein: “If you can’t explain it to a 6-year-old, you don’t understand it yourself.”

As Buffett’s investment prowess became better known in the business community, he started using his well-publicized annual letters to advertise for corporate-acquisition candidates, suggesting that Berkshire would make a fine home for family businesses whose shareholders were seeking a reliable and supportive owner. Those who sold to Berkshire didn’t need to fear that their company would face a cultural shift or employee turnover (compared with those acquired by a typical private-equity buyer); Buffett’s approach was to oversee the capital allocation of his acquisitions but otherwise largely leave them alone. Unlike the “barbarians at the gate” private-equity buyers who sometimes break up companies for their component parts or slash head counts to increase short-term profits, Buffett reinvested capital into the acquired businesses in order to sustain and grow them. He had the humility to appreciate that an incumbent management team usually knew a lot more about a business than he did. He was a quick and accurate study of not only businesses but people. A close associate of his once told me that that was perhaps Buffett’s most exceptional ability.

Over time, Buffett became one of America’s most respected and admired CEOs, and his name became a highly regarded brand. He turned the regulatory requirement that public companies like Berkshire Hathaway hold annual shareholder meetings into an extravaganza that eventually became a pilgrimage. Some people, including many international investors, bought Berkshire shares just to get the invite. Attendance at most companies’ annual shareholder meetings is desultory, measured in the dozens or occasionally hundreds of attendees. Yet the crowd that went to see and hear from Buffett each year grew into the thousands and then the tens of thousands. By the 2000s, the gatherings had been christened the Woodstock of Capitalism. Value-investing junkies made a weekend of it, securities-analyst societies planned events around it, and parents brought aspiring teenage financial whizzes to witness and learn from the great man. Buffett and Munger, his lifelong thought partner, would take questions from the Omaha audience for more than five hours. The financial network CNBC started to cover the meetings live. They were the only shareholder meetings to merit national media attention.

The showman in Buffett arranged a display of Berkshire-company product offerings available for purchase at the meeting. These included See’s Candies, Borsheims jewelry, Nebraska Furniture Mart sofas and dining-room sets, and Geico insurance products—so much the better to please the attendees, get free advertising, build brands, and augment the bottom line on a Saturday in May. Buffett’s cult-figure status became so great that when folks were in town for the Berkshire annual meeting, they stopped at Buffett’s favorite restaurants and ordered his favorite dishes. If you ate like he ate, perhaps you would be able to invest like he invested—certainly, it couldn’t hurt. While I’ve never been to a Berkshire annual meeting and have never owned the stock, I did have lunch with Buffett at Gorat’s (a steakhouse, his choice) on my one trip to see him in Omaha 17 years ago.

Buffett’s flair for the dramatic extended to his recruiting practices. In 2007, he launched a highly publicized search for investment talent. After screening hundreds of candidates over several years, he ultimately hired two exceptional hedge-fund managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, to join Berkshire in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Combs worked with Buffett through the end of 2025, and Weschler continues with him to this day, the result of what must be regarded as one of the most unconventional yet successful executive searches ever.

Buffett in many ways has been a modern-day J. P. Morgan, a business champion with the ability to calm turbulent markets by infusing capital into at-risk firms, such as Goldman Sachs during the 2008 financial crisis, thereby putting his imprimatur on their solvency. He helped restore confidence in the market during panicky moments by entering buy orders as favorite names traded down while offering public reassurance about markets, the country’s finances, and capitalism. He has been an unabashed cheerleader for the United States of America, and a firm believer that things would always work out over the long run (as they always had).

Buffett became an oft-quoted philosopher on subjects as diverse as the social safety net, philanthropy, and tax rates. He once commonsensically observed that he should not pay a lower tax rate than his secretary, and few could disagree. The respect for him in the business and investment communities (including among individual investors) was so widespread that ideas gained import simply because he had articulated or supported them.

Buffett’s accumulation of enormous wealth hasn’t changed him, something that most enormously wealthy people can’t claim. Throughout his working life, he remained fundamentally the same person he had been when he was a child: bright, curious, and upbeat. His unchanging nature extended not only to his diet of hamburgers and Cherry Cokes; over time, his business interests came to reflect his childhood attractions to newspapers, railroads, and Dairy Queen. Buffett has lived in the same house in Omaha his entire adult life. He generally maintained the same friendships over many decades. He didn’t accumulate fancy cars, yachts, expensive art, or multiple vacation properties, as many of the ultrarich do. His ever growing wealth was a way of keeping score (like an enormous and growing pile of poker chips), but for him it wasn’t a ticket to a new posh lifestyle. At one point, Buffett clearly felt a bit guilty about the purchase of a private airplane: He nicknamed it “The Indefensible.” Buffett’s enduring popularity, at least in part, is due to his enduring humility, sense of perspective, genuine wonder, and perpetual gratitude for how his life has turned out.

Like many other wealthy investors and businesspeople, for years Buffett focused his efforts almost exclusively on compounding his own capital, as well as the capital entrusted to him by other Berkshire shareholders, who’d basically hired the world’s best capital allocator effectively free of charge. (Buffett’s salary from Berkshire was minimal.) Buffett has said that one reason that he deferred significant personal philanthropy for many years was because he thought that, by waiting, he would have disproportionately more money to give away down the road.

From the May 2016 Issue: How Warren Buffett’s son would feed the world

Buffett had long anticipated eventually donating his wealth to charitable causes, but the unexpected death in 2004 of his first wife, Susan, disrupted his plans. He had imagined that she would be the one who made the family’s philanthropic decisions. It took him another few years to advance his plans to give away sizable sums, by joining forces with Bill and Melinda Gates. In 2006, Buffett donated an astounding $31 billion to the already well-endowed Gates Foundation, thereby doubling its annual grant-making capabilities. (This was, and still is, one of the largest philanthropic gifts in history, and Buffett gave more to the foundation over time.) Buffett joined the Gates Foundation board, and Bill Gates joined the Berkshire Hathaway board of directors, though both stepped back from these commitments several years ago.

In 2010, again joining forces with Bill and Melinda Gates, Buffett co-founded the Giving Pledge, an organization with the goal of signing up the world’s billionaires to the cause of philanthropy. Members needed to vow that they would give away half or more of their fortunes either during their lifetime or at their death. Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates took the time to personally reach out to prospective members to persuade them to join, including arranging multiple meetings with me and my wife before we joined in 2013. At the most recent tally, the Giving Pledge had more than 250 members who have committed many hundreds of billions of dollars in future philanthropy, a number likely to grow over time—and a legacy that will have an impact far into the future. No one else has attempted, let alone accomplished, anything remotely comparable.

Buffett, from youth to old age, has loved to evaluate and understand businesses. He successfully navigated all market environments and easily traversed most types of investments—stocks but also bonds, public and private opportunities, domestic and global companies, even derivatives and reinsurance commitments. Although many professional investors narrowly focus on just one asset class, Buffett painted his masterpiece with the broadest palette on the widest of canvases. He formed lifelong relationships with top corporate executives whom he respected (most notably The Washington Post’s Katharine Graham), and famously delegated a great deal of operating responsibility to managers employed by Berkshire. And he kept performing even as Berkshire’s shareholders’ equity capital compounded to astonishing levels ($650 billion by 2025). Investing is a field in which size typically becomes a detriment to performance. But Berkshire’s size did not perceptibly diminish Buffett’s record. Under Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway grew from being an obscure participant in the dying U.S. textile industry into a trillion-dollar market-cap behemoth, one of the largest companies in the U.S. Like an All-Star center fielder making one highlight-reel catch after another, Buffett often made it look easy even when all of us knew it most definitely wasn’t.

Buffett has said that he’ll pull back from his day-to-day role leading Berkshire Hathaway at the end of 2025, though he will remain the company’s chairman. And he has indicated that he is “going quiet,” no longer writing shareholder letters or speaking at annual meetings. He has accelerated his estate planning by disbursing a significant portion of his personal fortune to his children’s foundations.

The world of investing will be different without Warren Buffett at the helm of Berkshire. Though I hope that he will still choose to make his voice heard, for many, myself included, his retirement means the waning of a north star: a consistent voice of calm and reason, a steady presence who can always place the latest unexpected market movement or economic or geopolitical development in its proper perspective.

Buffett’s commercial successes built his fortune, but I admire him most for the way he lived his life. He headed one of the world’s most successful and admired companies for more than half a century, and he did it not by caring about being admired but by steadily focusing on doing the right thing for the business and its shareholders. And in Buffett’s case, at least, doing the right thing led to him being even more admired.

In a field associated with enormous affluence and one-upmanship, Buffett stayed grounded: running his businesses, buying and selling investments, commenting on societal values, proselytizing for philanthropy, and periodically enjoying a burger and a Cherry Coke. Few who reach Buffett’s echelon live their lives this way. All of us—fellow investors and business executives, but also the wider public—are fortunate to have lived in the time of Buffett, to have soaked in his wisdom, and to have been inspired by his example. Buffett will be particularly missed at a time when many of the most successful people in the business community seem single-mindedly focused on making money, without reflecting much on the way they make it or what they will do with it. Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.

New generations of investors will come along, including some shooting stars who will flame out and others who will endure. But judged over the fullness of a career and by the complete record of his accomplishments and the values underlying them, Warren Buffett has truly been, and will remain, one of a kind.</div>

Apple should be thanking devs for making apps for its platforms, instead of constantly screwing them over. Apple owes its success for its mobile devices to third party devs. But Apple arrogantly thinks devs need it more than Apple need devs, so thinks it has carte-blanche to abuse them.

What would Apple&#39;s devices look like if there weren&#39;t enough third-party devs making apps? Just a dozen or so crappy Apple apps, with the rest being &quot;web apps&quot; that are too crippled (due to Apple&#39;s crippling of Safari as a us

Sell your shirt and jump onto the bandwagon, the profits are literally guaranteed.

To give to those who lost them, obviously. But who told you you&#39;re getting any?

Fuels Bubble Fears Fears? More like &quot;Predictions&quot; or &quot;Certainty&quot;.

Fears? More like &quot;Predictions&quot; or &quot;Certainty&quot;.

There&#39;s a well funded company called RRP Electronics which is working on package and test. They also have a famous cricketer as a strategic investor, whatever that means.

This RRP Semiconductor was a trading company which renamed itself and changed its business model.

As far as I can tell, the latter&#39;s revenue is nothing to write home about. And it&#39;s a Public Limited company which makes this even more weird, as those are expected to pass much more stringent criteria.

When you have 1.4 billion with avg IQs hovering in the late 70s, what can one expect from their stock market? There is no scope for rationality.

A few people will soon get very rich, a large number of suckers will lose their shirts.

&quot;Micron recently shuttered Crucial, its consumer-facing brand, to focus on high-bandwidth memory for AI data centers.&quot;

Quite the opposite, it is the crazy rush after the illusion of &quot;AI growth&quot; that is the problem.

Expect that consumer hardware will stagnate, as the &quot;AI&quot; vendors who must sell the LLMs, try to set things up so you must offload whatever it is you want done to their servers and pay for it, even if it means buying up hardware production capacity.

Linux works fine with 4GB but apps don&#39;t. I know because my laptop came with 4GB and it was borderline unusable of I actually did anything with it. 8GB made it acceptable.

Meanwhile my desktop has 64GB of DDR4 and I&#39;m real glad I bought it when I did. Most people don&#39;t need that much, but I do VMs sometimes and it&#39;s important. OTOH gaming showed significant improvements going from 16 to 32.

There are apps and there are apps.  Slack can OOM with mere 128GB, it worked stable on 256GB though.  On the other hand, there are playable and fun 4K games.

My wallet will stay closed to memory purchases for the duration of this price spike.

When I started to listen to the much-hyped new podcast from Katie Miller, I’d hoped to learn something, anything, to justify the many irreplaceable hours of my life I had already committed to it. I wanted a salacious tidbit or quote from one of the nearly 20 episodes that have dropped since August. I wanted moments that might help me understand the kind of person who would be married to Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and architect of many of the Trump administration’s harshest and darkest policies.

I did not get any of these things. The podcast, I’m afraid, is eye-wateringly boring—void of a single revelatory moment. House Speaker Mike Johnson is asked why he recently changed his style of glasses. Vice President J.D. Vance is asked to settle a debate as to whether a hot dog can be considered a sandwich. “Secretary of War” Pete Hegseth, appearing alongside his wife, is asked whether he prefers drumsticks, flats, or boneless wings. Sen. Katie Britt is asked how she passes time on airplanes. (Spoiler: she works.) And on it goes with Elon Musk, with “MAHA” influencer Vani Hari aka “Food Babe,” with actress Cheryl Hines, who is married to RFK Jr., and even with Attorney General Pam Bondi. Miller has access to a who’s who of high-profile MAGA figures, and she uses that time to ask them the most banal questions imaginable.

So that’s it? Skip the podcast and close this tab? Not so fast.

Yes, the podcast is dull in the extreme, and it seems to hinge in part on a bizarre assumption that the public is desperate for an inside glimpse of these people’s lives, in the vein of “Stars: They’re just like us.” But there’s something fascinating about it too: a bigger project with massive political and cultural ambitions, and one that we can’t afford to ignore. And the key to understanding that project is understanding Miller herself—where she came from and where she wants to go. In between listening to episodes of the show, I was talking to people who knew Miller growing up in Florida, and that’s when it all started to make more sense.

At a time when the military is bombing Venezuelan boats, National Guard troops are patrolling the streets of Washington, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are snatching parents off the streets in front of their children, Miller’s podcast—and her persona—is aimed at adding a patina of softness over a hard-right policy agenda. Surely the administration could not be as extreme or evil or fascist as its critics say if its members are chatting casually about raising their own children and picking new eyewear. The obvious audience for the podcast is white women, considered a swing demographic. (They favored Donald Trump by 4 points in 2024, according to Pew research, while white men went for Trump over Kamala Harris by a full 20 points. The divide is even larger among young women: Miller shared a graphic on her X account showing the widening partisan gulf between young men and women. “We aren’t talking to conservative women,” she wrote.)

So Miller announced her podcast in a video shared to X in August. In the video, Miller sits cross-legged in a gray armchair, wearing jeans and a white tank top, surrounded by soft lamps and plants, a copy of The Great Gatsby peeking out from a bookshelf behind her. “As a mom of three kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full time, I know there isn’t a podcast for women like myself,” Miller tells the camera. Bringing white women closer in line to their male counterparts would sharply reorient our politics and, if durable, could lead to something that looks like a permanent MAGA majority.

On some level, Miller is a strange choice for America’s trad-wife in chief. She married Stephen in 2020 at the Trump International Hotel, with the president himself in attendance. She too was a political player: She fell in love with Stephen over family-separation policies while she was working as a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security. (During her tenure at DHS, officials sent her to the southern border in the hopes that what she saw there might make her a little more compassionate. By her own telling, speaking to journalist Jacob Soboroff, “it didn’t work.”) Following her stint at DHS, she joined Vice President Mike Pence’s office as a spokesperson, later making it clear where her loyalties lay amid the bitter fallout between Pence and Trump over the Capitol riot. Earlier this year, she worked for DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, under Musk.

And so Miller’s new position—in which she emphasizes her role as a wife and mother to three young children—has entailed a bit of a rebrand, shedding the image of a government attack dog in favor of a softer archetype. “When society told women that our value was derived from our ability to make an income instead of derived from the joy of motherhood we all failed,” Miller wrote online in October. “Make babies. Raise those babies. It’s our highest and best value.”

When I started talking to people who knew Miller before she was a retrofitted, would-be MAGA icon—before she ever met Donald Trump—they described a person with some altogether different ambitions. Through their eyes, the entire public project of the Millers takes on added dimensions. And it all helps explain why, if you look closely, it’s clear something has gone awry with the fantasy Katie Miller is trying to sell.

Before she was the bride of Stephen Miller, Katie Miller was 15-year-old Katie Waldman, attending the first debate class for the 10th grade of Cypress Bay High School, in Broward County, Florida. During the class, which was held in a portable trailer due to overcrowding, students were tasked with a graded assignment to give a short speech about themselves.

Miller’s address was particularly memorable: “She got up and said, ‘My father is a litigator, and my mom is a MILF. She does nothing but drive up and down the highway in her SUV until it’s time to pick me up from school,’ ” one former classmate told me. “What she meant was, ‘My dad is a rich guy, and my mom’s hot. That’s who I am, and that’s where I come from.’ She was super proud.”

Miller was raised in Weston, a suburban fever dream spread across 10,500 acres of what, before being drained for development, was once Everglades wetland. Weston was built by Arvida, the same company that designed Disney World and Celebration, the Disney-owned planned community. It’s meticulously organized perfection: Its various neighborhoods, gated communities, parks, and street are pristine and feature shallow lagoons and golf courses, palm trees and hibiscus, blue skies and backyard swimming pools. One comparison kept coming up when I interviewed people for this story: It was like The Stepford Wives, a place where rich dads go to work and hot moms pick up the kids in nice cars.

Weston was developed all at once in the 1990s and quickly cemented a reputation as a haven for “white flight,” only instead of white people fleeing Black people in inner cities, they were escaping the influx of immigration from Latino and Caribbean countries into Miami. In an interview with the Washington Post in 1998, Weston’s developers described the new suburb as “Our Home Town.” “It’s more like America,” one of them said.

Glenn J. Waldman and his wife, Sheryl, left their 2,000-square-foot home in northern Miami in 1994, after their daughter Katie was born, and bought a property in the neighborhood of Weston Hills, one of the most prestigious gated communities in Weston, where homes are painted in mandatory hues such as Champagne Dance and Grandma’s Linen. The Waldmans, who are Jewish, had three children in total, and Katie was the middle. Glenn Waldman was a longtime donor to Republican lawmakers, bucking the overwhelming liberal slant in Weston, which is currently represented in Congress by Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

As for Miller, former classmates remember her as having broadly conservative politics, but they say she was fairly liberal on social issues. Ryan Terrell was the captain of the debate team at Cypress Bay High School and coached her in debate for a semester. Terrell was one of the few openly gay kids at Cypress Bay. “When she got married to Stephen Miller and got more involved in conservative circles, I thought it was interesting, because we had this whole social culture-war issue and I never saw Katie advocating for banning it,” Terrell said. “We had political discussions back then, and she never seemed to be homophobic or having issues with the LGBTQ community.”

Miller was popular in the sense that she was part of a clique and had social status, but her former classmates said that popularity shouldn’t be confused with being well liked. “She was someone who was very interested in befriending others for status, more so than being a friend,” one classmate recalled. “She would drift towards whoever was in control or popular or whatever. A friend to many, but not really a good friend to any.” Former classmates remember her as wearing Juicy Couture tracksuits over a white top, poker-straight hair tied up in a ponytail. “She was very Valley Girl–ish,” Terrell said, “a teenage girl from an upper-income family in a wealthy neighborhood. She kind of talked like that, just without the California accent.”

She worked as a photo editor for the award-winning student newspaper the Circuit, which was featured in an MTV reality show, The Paper. She left there with plenty of critics: “You’re never surprised when you hear about something bad that Katie Waldman did,” said Emmi Weiner, who was an entertainment editor at the Circuit.

Miller was apparently happy to court controversy even as a teen. A 2020 feature in Vanity Fair about the Millers’ engagement resurfaced an incident involving Katie and a widely respected English teacher, Simone Waite—one of the school’s few Black faculty members. Waite had been teaching Toni Morrison’s Beloved, which provoked discussions about slavery. When Waite said that one of the many sins of slavery was that it erased Black people of their history, Miller objected. “Couldn’t they just tell each other about their history?” she asked, according to the Vanity Fair report. She wouldn’t let it go and, after Waite suggested they “agree to disagree,” left the class and drafted a petition accusing Waite of psychological damage, calling the teacher “sickening.” The issue was eventually resolved following a meeting involving Miller, her father, and Waite—during which they agreed to take Miller out of the class.

The world that shaped Miller’s early years was one of suburban perfection and sheltered artifice, a nostalgic ideal so far removed from reality that it shares a developer with Disney World. In many ways, it’s a fantasy that’s not far from the promises of MAGA.

Aug. 11, 2025, was a difficult day to soften the Trump administration’s rough edges. It was the same day that the president announced a de facto takeover of law enforcement in the District of Columbia, complete with National Guard troops in the streets and armored vehicles parked in front of Union Station. Although executed under the auspices of fighting “rising crime,” despite violent crime rates having decreased in D.C. since 2023, the maneuver also functioned as a declaration of MAGA dominance over a blue city.

Aug. 11 was also the airdate of Miller’s podcast’s first episode, featuring none other than Vice President J.D. Vance. The lighting in the video version was soft, and the topic was domestic bliss. Vance, an unapologetic apostle of Trump’s far-right agenda, spent much of the 45-minute interview playing a jolly sitcom dad who impersonates an “ogre” at Disneyland, makes cheesecake on weekends, and insists upon the whole family gathering for dinner at the dining table each night. Other topics mentioned included Vance’s fandom of Magic: The Gathering, his opinions on cargo shorts, his “dad icks,” his preferred memes, and his “secret to keeping his marriage solid.” (He and Usha read the same book and discuss it.)

The interview is utterly anodyne, a doddering exchange of pleasantries and carefully selected humanizing anecdotes. If you were to watch it in a vacuum, you’d have no sense of a country in a time of mass transformation. There’s no probing of Vance’s real views on domestic life, including his position that well-educated women who prioritize careers over starting families are choosing a “path to misery.”

Miller likes to conclude her interviews by asking her subject which three people, living or dead, they’d invite to dinner. Vance’s answer: Isaac Newton, Abraham Lincoln, and Donald Trump.

After Weston, Miller went to the University of Florida, her father’s alma mater, and pledged to the Alpha Omicron Pi sorority. She joined the ruling party of Florida’s student government, which presided over some 60,000 students, in an initial foray into politics that was, to say the least, eventful.

Back then, Florida’s student government had a reputation of operating a little like an autocracy. The governing party—which has changed its name over the years but was known as the Unite Party at the time Miller joined—was ruled by the iron fists of privileged frat boys and sorority girls, who controlled the school’s spending and were tapped for access to the exclusive Florida Blue Key society. After graduation, they were funneled into elected office and law clerkships.

Miller, typically seen on campus in the sorority girl’s uniform of Nike shorts and a sorority-branded raincoat, quickly established herself as a power player in this world and operated like a “henchman” for the ruling party, said one former student. Members of opposing parties in student government typically were collegial with one another, socializing together despite disagreements. Not Miller.

“Katie’s a very tenacious, self-assured individual,” recalled Jordan Ball, who was a senator for the opposition party. “She looked down on people she didn’t agree with.” Another former member of the student government described Miller’s approach to politics as “tribal.” “Most people in student government would be cordial and nice and would try to work together,” they said. “I feel like it was Katie’s whole life. She took it all very personally.”

Multiple people I spoke to said that the Unite Party, which was overwhelmingly white, had a pattern of punishing Black and Hispanic affinity groups financially if they didn’t rally behind them during campaigns. “It was an open secret, but it still seemed strange on the outside, like, Why are these groups kowtowing to sororities and frats which were mostly white?” recalled one former member of student government. “Those groups would end up endorsing a bunch of frat bros.” (In 2016 those claims were among the many grievances that drove the student-led #NotMySystem movement, which called out the elitist and even corrupt practices of majority student government.)

In 2012, her sophomore year, while serving on the rules and ethics committee of student government, Miller was embroiled in a scandal. The head football coach had endorsed a candidate from the opposition Students Party, and the Independent Florida Alligator, the college paper, ran a front-page story publicizing it. Two people—later revealed to be Miller and former Student Government President Pro Tempore Jason Tiemeier—were spotted dumping 268 copies of the newspaper on the eve of student elections.

“Especially after stealing the newspapers, she had a reputation, not just with us, but throughout the whole school, of being unethical,” said Ford Dwyer, who was a senator for the opposition party. Some people who knew her told me that they were a little scared of her back then, pointing to what they saw as a vindictive streak. Despite this reputation, Miller continued to rise through the ranks of the Unite Party, acquiring more and more power and responsibility, including being appointed to chair the allocations committee.

Her ascent after all this was the subject of numerous editorials in the Independent Florida Alligator, including one with the headline “Katie Waldman Should Resign.” “Sen. Katie Waldman’s appointment to the position of allocations chairwoman is an affront to the students of UF,” wrote Max Stein, who was part of the opposition party. “I do not question her qualifications, passion or work ethic. I question her ethical and moral fiber.”

The paper’s editorial board didn’t pull any punches either. “With the recommendation that Waldman head a committee, bad behavior is being rewarded and the corruption continues to seep deeper into the fabric” of student government, the board wrote.

The Unite Party went on the attack against the student newspaper. “They have thrown away journalist integrity,” candidate TJ Villamil said in a video posted to YouTube. “Misrepresenting facts, inaccurate quotes, and completely falsified stories are just some of the few ways they’ve attempted to skew my message to the voters.”

After a tenure in the senate that was defined by scandal, Miller was not invited by party leadership to run for her seat again. Departing senators are typically invited to get up and give goodbye speeches, and Miller’s was, by all accounts, memorable. She was bitter about not being asked to run again and felt betrayed. She delivered a glowering, chaotic speech that was full of tacit threats. “The sense that everyone got was that they’d better all be careful or else, because she had information on them, and she better be respected because she had secrets that she might or might not reveal,” Dwyer recalled.

The circumstances surrounding party leadership’s decision to ultimately remove her from power in 2013 remain a mystery and were subject to much speculation and gossip, particularly as those leaders were seen as her closest friends. But Miller’s fiery speech also got people talking: “It left a very big impression,” Dwyer said. “I think she felt like a victim.”

Narratives of victimhood, disenfranchisement, and persecution have been foundational to the collective identity of the MAGA movement. Trump has regularly cast himself as the ultimate martyr, routinely claiming that the system is rigged against him and his supporters by all manner of nefarious forces. “There has never been a president who was so evilly and illegally treated as I,” Trump declared after a New York judge scheduled sentencing for his criminal hush money conviction on Jan. 10, 10 days prior to his inauguration.

And Trump’s disciples, including Katie Miller, insist they are being persecuted by the very same forces.

By the time Pam Bondi appeared on Miller’s podcast on Sept. 15, MAGA victimhood was cresting. It was five days after the shooting of Charlie Kirk, and the administration was determined to forge the killing into a broader narrative of anti-conservative persecution. There was discussion of the rising threat of antifa and left-wing political violence, of how Bondi survives “ugly, hateful” comments online and from in-person protesters, and of the LGBTQ agenda coming for America’s Christian children. “I think a lot of moms have come forward now, since they were putting this crazy ideology in our schools, these transgender books for elementary schools,” Bondi said. “They’re mama bears, and they’re coming out, and they’re going to run for office, and they’re going to become more vocal.” (Miller has also talked about how she pulled her daughter out of day care after the kids read a children’s book about gay penguins in New York’s Central Park Zoo.)

“Victimhood is currency for women on the far right,” said Seyward Darby, author of Sisters in Hate: American Women on the Front Lines of White Nationalism. “Women in this space hide when they play the victim. They hide their complicity. They play the ‘I’m just a nice woman or wife or mother or all of the above’ card and suggest that criticism of them is unwarranted because of that. They try to make themselves untouchable.”

Miller has played that card herself. During a panel appearance on Piers Morgan’s show this fall, she got into an argument with Turkish American commentator Cenk Uygur after he criticized her husband for lying. “Piers, quite frankly, I’m really sick and tired of this racist bigoted rhetoric that can come from people like you against my husband, against my family and my children,” Miller said in a raised voice. “I am raising Jewish children in this country.”

She continued: “You better check your citizenship application that everything was legal and correct,” she said. “Because you’ll be just like Ilhan Omar coming next.”

After college, Miller rose quickly through the ranks of the Republican Party, working for senators and the first Trump administration, where she met her future husband. The pair married in 2020. During the Biden years, Miller served as a senior adviser for P2 Public Affairs, a firm linked to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. At the time that Miller joined the firm, DeSantis was Trump’s main competitor for the 2024 Republican nomination. “It was not lost on others in Mr. Trump’s circle that the Miller family seemed well hedged for any outcome,” a report in the New York Times noted. After Trump clinched victory in the 2024 election, Miller came aboard his transition team as the media contact for Health and Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. She told Politico that she had no plans to join the Trump administration and would remain at P2.

That soon changed. Elon Musk, who credited himself for Trump’s win, had become a near-constant fixture at Mar-a-Lago (much to the chagrin of Trump insiders) and was mapping out an expansive role for himself in the new administration. That role ended up being the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. The president wanted Miller involved. “Katie Miller will soon be joining DOGE!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “She has been a loyal supporter of mine for many years.” Miller became Musk’s henchwoman, and Musk regularly spent time at the Millers’ residence. When Trump and Musk’s relationship inevitably imploded—their high-profile breakup playing out over a string of caustic posts online—Miller reportedly demurred from taking sides, and even had plans at one point to continue working for Musk in his private projects after he left the government.

She never followed through with those plans. But she did have Musk on her podcast earlier this month. Though it’s a low bar, the Musk episode is perhaps the most compelling of the bunch. He’s without question her biggest-name guest, someone whose daily habits, internal life, and personal tastes could be of genuine interest to the viewer. They discuss a range of subjects, such as Musk’s frustration that fashion isn’t evolving quickly enough, his views on DOGE’s legacy, and A.I.

But before long, Miller’s interview style arrives to once again flatten the proceedings. “Cheeseburgers are amazing,” Musk declares at one point. “A genius invention.”

The paradox of many content creators in the womanosphere is that they promote traditional gender roles—telling women that their main priorities should be to take care of their families—all while pursuing lucrative careers of their own. Miller is no exception: She may be out of politics, but her own effort to ascend in the right-wing media complex is plenty ambitious.

“There is an imperative on the far right that women, even ones who are successful in business, politics, or other worldly spaces, must be traditionally feminine and care about traditionally feminine things,” said Darby. “They must purport to believe that their highest calling is being a wife and mother. They must embrace that calling as not just a personal one but also one in service of a nationalist agenda. Katie Miller is playing her part—or trying, anyway.”

That part was on full display when Miller hosted Katie Britt, the 43-year-old Republican senator from Alabama. Britt is, by any standard, ambitious and accomplished. In 2022, at age 40, she became the youngest GOP woman elected to the Senate—and the first female senator from Alabama. She has a law degree, which she got while a mother to two young children. She was elected president of the student’s government association while at the University of Alabama. She was invited to deliver the GOP rebuttal to Joe Biden’s State of the Union last year—and did so from her kitchen, of all places. “This is where our family has tough conversations,” Britt said. “It’s where we hold each other’s hands and pray for God’s guidance.”

But the podcast episode with Miller seems to be an opportunity for Britt to downplay her ambition, to remind everyone that she’s a mom and a wife first and foremost. It’s filmed in Britt’s home, and the two women sit on white floral armchairs in a Southern-style sunroom. Britt is, by her own description, a “Patriot wife” because she’s married to Wesley Britt, whom she met at the University of Alabama and who was a tackle for three seasons for the New England Patriots.

Britt tells Miller that her decision to run for Senate was a religious calling, and that when her son was 10 years old, he came to her and asked to speak privately. He then presented her with a list of reasons for why she needed to run. “I want people to know how much you love Jesus,” he told her. “I want them to know what a good mom you are.” Then he added: “Mom, I definitely think they need to know about your passion for small business.”

Miller talks to Britt about her weekly schedule, which generally requires senators to be in D.C. Monday through Thursday. “Do you cook Sunday nights for family dinner?” Miller asks Britt. Britt stammers in response: “I don’t always—you know, yes, I cook Sunday nights for dinner, but I was about to say, I don’t always crush it.”

There is one more thing to know about Miller’s podcast, and that is that so far it’s a flop.

The podcast was supposed to be soft-lit counterprogramming to the second Trump administration’s daily horrors. And Miller keeps bagging major guests—veritable Trump-orbit superstars, such as Pete Hegseth and Mike Johnson and their spouses, to say nothing of Musk. And yet, despite it all, its numbers have flatlined. Most of her YouTube episodes get mired in the 10,000-view mark, with a couple of exceptions. (The Musk interview racked up half a million views.) At least for now, her metrics put her far behind the likes of other conservative women podcasters: Influencers like Brett Cooper, Pearl Davis, and Allie Beth Stuckey easily get hundreds of thousands of views on their YouTube videos. Unlike Miller, they’ve been toiling in the proverbial content mines for years, and they now have the audience to show for it.

“Despite what she said when she launched the show, she isn’t filling a gap in the cultural space,” said Darby. “There is already plenty of content out there for MAGA moms.”

If I’ve learned anything about Miller through talking to the people who’ve known her throughout her life, it’s that she cannot be happy about all this. (Miller did not respond to requests for comment.)

Where is she going wrong? Why, with her pick of MAGA world for a guest list, is Miller finding a relatively puny audience?

It’s hard to say for certain. As is probably clear by now, Miller herself is neither a particularly compelling interviewer nor one who produces the types of viral moments that political podcasts thrive on in the current era. But the project’s faults may run deeper than that. The podcast seems engineered around highlighting the softer side of this administration’s figures. And that task may be impossible for half of Miller’s potential audience and not desired by the other.

For right-leaning MAGA skeptics, who could be won over by Hegseth’s wing choices at a time when he’s reveling in obliterating small ships off the coast of Venezuela? Who’s going to believe that Bondi is an aggrieved figure at a time when her Justice Department is openly, proudly serving as Trump’s personal score-settler?

And for the MAGA faithful, are they really looking for these figures to be softened? What about this movement, born of mass rage and now on a four-year vengeance tour, suggests that the base is looking for any sort of cover?

It is, after all, a podcast aimed at making MAGA approachable to the center—and in Trump’s America, it has long been clear that the center cannot hold.

The most recent episode of the podcast features FBI Director Kash Patel and his girlfriend, country-music artist Alexis Wilkins. It begins with the disclaimer that the episode was recorded prior to the mass shooting at Brown University that left two dead, nine injured, and the shooter at large. The episode is full of idle chatter: Wilkins explains that she’s had to change her posting habits since getting booed up with the head of the FBI. Patel defends using a private jet to go see her, and discloses their shared love of a “surf and turf” night of lobster and steak.

It’s not that antisemitism ever went away, but it’s still jarring to watch people spread its oldest and most vile tropes on social media in a way that would’ve been unthinkable ten years ago.

            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/18/sonicwall_sma_1000_0day/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SonicWall has warned customers of a zero-day flaw in its SMA 1000 remote-access appliance that&#39;s being actively exploited, potentially allowing attackers to escalate privileges and take over boxes.

The bug, tracked as CVE-2025-40602, resides in the appliance management console of SonicWall&#39;s Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 1000 series and stems from missing or insufficient authorization checks that let authenticated attackers elevate their privileges.

SonicWall&#39;s advisory says the vulnerability has been chained with another SMA 1000 flaw patched earlier this year (CVE-2025-23006) to enable unauthenticated remote code execution with root rights – a particularly nasty combo when weaponized in the wild.

SonicWall&#39;s official notice, published this week, says users should update to the latest hotfix versions immediately and restrict access to the Appliance Management Console to trusted networks. The vendor&#39;s PSIRT team says the issue affects only SMA 1000 appliances and does not impact other SonicWall firewall products or SSL VPN functions, but the fact that attackers have already begun exploiting the flaw underscores how exposed remote-access infrastructure remains.

Researchers tracking exposed devices report hundreds of SMA 1000 units visible on the open internet, meaning a large pool of potentially vulnerable targets if patches aren&#39;t applied quickly.

SonicWall has been a frequent target for cybercrime crews in 2025. In September, the vendor disclosed a breach of its MySonicWall cloud backup service, where attackers accessed firewall configuration backups stored for customers. Initial estimates that fewer than 5 percent of users were affected were later revised after an incident response investigation with Mandiant concluded that all organizations using the service had their backup files exposed.

Those exposed configuration files, which included network rules, access policies, and encrypted credentials, could give adversaries a detailed roadmap into corporate infrastructure if they can brute-force or decrypt the contents. SonicWall urged customers to delete any existing cloud backups, change their MySonicWall credentials, rotate shared secrets and passwords, and recreate new backup files locally rather than in the cloud.

SonicWall later attributed the backup compromise to state-sponsored threat actors, though it declined to name a specific country or group. The vendor has promised to &quot;continue working with third parties to harden network and cloud infrastructure,&quot; a process that, judging by this week&#39;s actively exploited zero-day, appears to be very much still in progress. ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-18</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">US feds have dismantled a crypto laundering service that they say helped cybercrooks wash tens of millions of dollars in dirty digital cash, seizing its servers and unsealing charges against an alleged Russian operator.

The FBI, working with cops in Europe and a grab bag of state and federal agencies, announced this week that it has taken down the infrastructure behind E-Note, an unlicensed virtual currency exchange accused of acting as a financial rinse cycle for ransomware crews, account takeover gangs, and other online criminals.

According to prosecutors in the Eastern District of Michigan, E-Note and its associated money mule networks moved more than $70 million in illicit proceeds between 2017 and the takedown, converting stolen or extorted cryptocurrency into cash and other assets that were harder for authorities to trace. Investigators seized servers, mobile apps, and multiple domains used to operate the service, including e-note.com and e-note.ws, effectively pulling the plug on the platform.

US authorities also unsealed an indictment charging 39-year-old Russian national Mykhalio Petrovich Chudnovets with conspiracy to launder monetary instruments. Prosecutors allege Chudnovets has been offering laundering services to financially motivated cybercrooks since at least 2010 via the E-Note service, &quot;which he controlled and operated.&quot; US law enforcement separately obtained earlier copies of Chudnovets&#39; servers, including customer databases and transaction records, according to the announcement.

If convicted, Chudnovets faces up to 20 years behind bars, though he remains at large and, like all defendants, is presumed innocent unless and until a court says otherwise.

Officials framed the operation as a strike not just against one service, but against the financial plumbing that keeps cybercrime profitable. Unlike regulated exchanges, E-Note allegedly operated with little to no anti-money laundering controls, making it attractive to ransomware operators, including those targeting healthcare and critical infrastructure organizations.

The takedown fits into a broader law enforcement push aimed at choking off the services that sit between cybercrime and payday. US authorities have increasingly focused on mixers and rogue exchanges rather than just the hackers at the keyboard, arguing that disrupting cash-out options raises costs and friction across the criminal ecosystem.

Whether knocking out E-Note delivers a lasting blow remains to be seen, but US feds are clearly betting that yanking out the middlemen hurts more than chasing individual thieves. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA has a new administrator. Billionaire and space tourist Jared Isaacman was confirmed by the US Senate by a vote of 67 to 30.

Isaacman&#39;s path to the role was turbulent. Nominated by President Donald Trump in January, the nomination was abruptly cancelled in May after Trump fell out with Elon Musk - Isaacman was a SpaceX customer - and reinstated in November.

He inherits a troubled agency still reeling from a year of budget chaos that threatened major programs, though advocacy and congressional action helped save or restore funding for many missions that looked set for the axe.

Observers have welcomed Isaacman&#39;s arrival. In a statement, the Planetary Society said: &quot;After nearly a year of historic disruptions to the agency&#39;s workforce, facilities, and budget, Mr Isaacman has the opportunity to stabilize and reinvigorate the US space program.

&quot;Congress is on a path to provide Mr Isaacman with a restored budget that better funds national priorities: returning humans to the Moon, maintaining US leadership in space science and exploration, and training the next generation of scientists and aerospace engineers.&quot;

Over the last year, NASA has dealt with rounds of layoffs and resignations, resulting in a considerably reduced workforce and continued uncertainty over what role, if any, its centers around the US would play.

With Isaacman confirmed as NASA&#39;s 15th Administrator, all eyes are on the first moves he makes. A leaked paper he authored, Project Athena, proposed changes for the agency, including a move to &quot;science-as-a-service&quot; by paying commercial vendors for data and increasing private industry involvement. Isaacman has subsequently called the May document &quot;dated&quot;.

His SpaceX connections raise questions: he flew to orbit twice as a paying SpaceX customer, and Musk recommended him before the rift with Trump. Though Isaacman insists his plan &quot;never favored any one vendor,&quot; the optics are notable.

Critical challenges loom for the NASA Administrator. The next Artemis mission (a crewed free-return flight around the Moon) is due to launch as early as February. However meeting NASA&#39;s goal of landing humans on the Moon before China requires difficult decisions. SpaceX&#39;s Starship is behind schedule, and acting Administrator Sean Duffy&#39;s move to reopen the landing contract has yielded few viable alternatives.

As one space industry put it to El Reg: &quot;At last there is a NASA leader, but now we face the question of what direction will he take the space program.&quot; ®

Smart home products are all about making everyday life a little easier, which is why they’re some of the best and most thoughtful gifts you can give. Some people go all out building a multi-gadget IoT kingdom (like our resident smart home expert, Jen Pattison Tuohy), but a smart home is whatever your recipient wants it to be. It can be as simple as wanting a cheap switch-flipping bot to brew you a pot of coffee before you exit the shower in the morning.

Having tested many smart home gadgets over the years, we pooled our knowledge to assemble our favorite recommendations for this gift guide. There are practical (and sometimes pricey) picks like smart ovens and robot vacuums to speed up cooking and cleaning, video doorbells to keep an eye on packages, and smart water fountains to keep pets hydrated while you’re away. We’ve also included a few items that double as decor, like a color-changing lamp-meets-Bluetooth-speaker, a TV that resembles wall art, and other fun ideas.

The SwitchBot Bot adds smarts to button-based gadgets like laundry machines, garage doors, and light switches. All you need to do is stick it onto a compatible button or switch, and it’ll physically press it for you on command. You can even set schedules and control the devices with your voice, or with the companion app.

Mornings are hard enough even before breakfast. The Dash Rapid egg cooker makes it easy to eat something nutritious, cooking up to seven eggs — poached, scrambled, or hard-boiled — in under 15 minutes. It automatically shuts off when your eggs are done, and you can pop the nonelectric parts in the dishwasher, making cleanup a breeze.

Govee’s battery-powered Table Lamp 2 Pro X Sound by JBL is just as handy for holiday parties as it is for when it’s just you in the room. The color-changing smart lamp doubles as a portable Bluetooth speaker, with lights that sync to the beat. You can create custom lighting effects in the app or choose from preset scenes tailored to suit different moods, from upbeat party vibes to more relaxing ones. And, it’s compatible with Matter, too, so it’ll work with most of your giftee’s smart home devices.

Petcube’s rechargeable, 57-ounce fountain is a useful gift for busy pet parents. Its four-layer filtration system removes bacteria and other impurities from water, and it only runs when your animal is nearby to conserve battery life. The accompanying mobile app will alert you when it’s time to replace the filter, too, making it easy to stay on top of.

Holiday meals can leave you with a full belly and a foul-smelling fridge, which is where the Fun Guy comes in. The playful odor absorber can add a whimsical touch to your kitchen while serving a practical need. Just pop the mushroom top and load the smiley, spore-tacular container with baking soda to keep unwanted odors at bay.

Ring’s newest wired doorbell reimagines the classic with a sharper look and smarter tech. The standout feature is its Retinal 4K video with up to 10x enhanced zoom, letting you spot fine details from far away. You’ll get crystal-clear visuals, rich audio through Live View and Two-Way Talk with Audio+, and radar-powered 3D Motion Detection that sends more accurate alerts. Low-Light Sight delivers full-color views at night, while Video Descriptions tell you exactly what’s happening without opening the app. It’s sleek, responsive, and built to keep an eye on your doorstep smarter than ever.

Aobopar’s adjustable bookends are perfect for helping the bookworm in your life stay organized. The sturdy steel bookends expand up to 18 inches to fit your collection, keeping books (and bookshelves) tidy. Even better? They don’t have to be used just for books — they’re great for organizing notebooks, files, and magazines, too.

Twinkly Strings USB-C Pearls look nice year-round, adding a much-needed sparkle to rooms long after the holiday festivities end. They instantly brighten up any room with the color of your choosing, and with Twinkly’s AR mapping feature, you can individually control each LED for truly personalized lighting.

Kasa’s Smart Wi-Fi Plug Lite can turn almost any powered gadget into a smart device, letting you schedule and remotely control it with your voice via Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant. You can control the plug through the Kasa app, too, which comes in handy when you want to make it seem like you’re home while on vacation.

The holidays are a cause for celebration, but all those parties also make for a complete mess of your floors. Luckily, Roborock Q10 S5 Plus handles a good chunk of the cleaning up for you, scrubbing floors with its vibrating mop, dodging clutter with AI-powered obstacle avoidance, and emptying itself when it’s done, so you can spend more time relaxing after the festivities are over.

Eno’s DoubleNest hammock is perfect for lounging in the backyard or in a nice patch of the woods. It’s roomy enough for two adults, and it features a built-in pocket for stashing a book, phone, or drink. The fast-drying nylon hammock also packs down into a built-in stuff sack, though you will need to buy a pair of straps to actually hang it between trees if your giftee doesn’t own any.

Amazon’s Smart Thermostat makes it easy to keep your home warm while reducing energy costs. It automatically adjusts the temperature based on whether you’re home or awake, even learning and adapting to your habits. Plus, it pairs well with Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, so you can change the temperature without ever leaving the comfort of your bed or couch.

A lot of smart home gifts are clever, but few feel as personal as the Aura Ink. The 13.3-inch E Ink display looks more akin to a traditional frame, complete with a cordless design, yet you can update it with color photos via a companion app. The low-tech panel also offers monthslong battery life, so there’s no need to worry about keeping it charged frequently.

If you want a smart home with one very clever trick, Samsung’s The Frame is a TV you should consider. When idle, it displays realistic art from museums around the world on its matte, anti-glare QLED display. Some may never guess that it’s also a great 4K display with a snappy 144Hz refresh rate that supports hands-free control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.

In The Minimalist Home, best-selling author and minimalist advocate Joshua Becker takes readers room by room, helping them decide what to keep and what to let go of. In addition to offering actionable advice, he encourages reflection on what adds value, guiding readers toward creating a home that’s supportive of a fulfilling life.

The Philips Hue smart bulb starter kit comes with color-changing bulbs with 1,100 lumens of peak brightness that can be controlled with Alexa, Google Assistant, or the companion app. The included Hue Bridge lets you set custom lighting routines and expand your setup to 50 lights, while the Smart Button makes it easy to quickly dim the brightness or switch lighting scenes.

The Echo Show 15 does it all, from displaying photos and acting as a family bulletin board to even serving as a mini TV. Its slim 15.6-inch display can also showcase calendars, reminders, and recipes while you listen to your favorite music streaming service. With Alexa built in, you can even use it to control smart devices and check who’s at the door.

Come on, who doesn’t love a good pizza? Gifting the Model P Smart Pizza Oven is a no-brainer. The electric oven makes it easy to craft restaurant-quality pizzas, heating up to 850 degrees Fahrenheit for wood-fired-style results in just minutes. It offers five cooking modes and connects to an app that lets you control temperature and even adjust cook time based on crust thickness.

The 16.4-foot Kasa Smart Light Strip lets you instantly change the vibe of any room. You can stick it anywhere — behind your TV, around your desk, or under cabinets — for a soft color-filled glow that sets the mood. You can use the Kasa app to create custom lighting effects, or control the lights with your voice via Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.

The Google TV Streamer (4K) isn’t just for watching movies and TV shows in 4K with Dolby Atmos — it also doubles as a smart home hub with support for Matter and Thread. That means you can use Google’s latest streamer to control your lights, adjust the temperature of your home, and view livestreams from connected cameras, all within a snappy interface that’s easy to use.

Lutron’s Diva Smart Dimmer turns your home’s existing wired lights into smart ones you can control from anywhere. It replaces your standard wall switch, making it easy to dim or adjust multiple lights from your wall switch, your phone, or even with your voice.

Bosch’s high-end espresso machine lets you whip up a myriad of cafe-caliber drinks with the touch of a button. It has over 35 programs for crafting drinks from around the world — including espresso, café con leche, and koffie verkeerd. It also ships with support for Amazon Alexa, so you can put in your order before you even get out of bed in the morning.

The latest Blink Video Doorbell is a great pick for anyone who values peace of mind (or doesn’t want to get off the couch to answer the door). It offers a 1080p head-to-toe view and more accurate motion alerts than its predecessor, letting your giftee monitor their door wherever they are. The battery-powered buzzer can even be hardwired, extending its longevity.

Premier Comfort’s printed wrap is like a wearable blanket that hugs you back. The 50-by-70-inch shawl is made from soft, plush fabric and features oversized pockets on both sides, making it comfortable and practical. It also comes in an array of attractive colors, each with faux-fur trim that’s perfect for cold winter nights when all you want to do is bundle up at home.

Lego’s miniature bonsai trees can bring a sense of calm to even the most cluttered home. Building each tree — whether it be the black pine, the ginkgo, or the lilac-adorned wisteria — is designed to be a mindfulness practice in itself, centering your giftee as they go. They also make for a great piece of decor once finished, adding a touch of zen to any desk or shelf.

When it comes to sound quality, few midrange smart speakers can match the Era 100. Sonos’ latest entry-level model delivers rich, room-filling sound and booming bass, whether you opt for Bluetooth or line-in audio. It also offers built-in room tuning and supports a wide range of voice commands, letting you check the weather, play music, and set timers using Alexa or Sonos’ own virtual assistant.

Elle Duncan will host Netflix’s Skyscraper Live broadcast next year.

Netflix is bringing ESPN host Elle Duncan onboard to become the voice of its growing roster of live events. Duncan, who has appeared on SportsCenter, College GameDay, and WNBA Countdown, will make her debut on Netflix with next year’s Skyscraper Live broadcast.

During the livestream, free solo climber Alex Honnold will attempt to ascend the 11th-tallest building in the world, Taiwan’s Taipei 101. Netflix doesn’t mention any other live events that Duncan might host as part of its “multiyear” deal with the anchor, but by hiring Duncan, Netflix makes it clear that the company has big plans for the future of live sports and other events.

In addition to building out a library of video podcasts through deals with Spotify, iHeartMedia, and Barstool Sports, Netflix has plenty of live events in store. It signed a three-year deal to stream live MLB games and events for the next three seasons and also plans on bringing back Star Search next year as a live show hosted by Anthony Anderson.

﻿The settlement with 35 states includes free installation of a metal sleeve around the ignition cylinder to prevent theft.

Kia and Hyundai will offer free repairs for millions of cars that lack anti-theft technology as part of a settlement with dozens of US states. The automakers agreed to outfit the roughly nine million eligible cars sold between 2011 and 2022 with a zinc sleeve installed around the ignition cylinder to prevent the viral “Kia Boyz” thefts that required only a USB cable.

The repairs could cost up to $500 million, in addition to several million in restitution to Hyundai and Kia owners whose cars were damaged by thieves, the Associated Press reports. The automakers have also promised that all of their future cars will have an engine immobilizer, a piece of technology that prevents would-be thieves from bypassing the ignition.

The lack of an immobilizer, a relatively standard piece of tech in other cars, is why theft of Kia and Hyundai cars became so popular. Videos explaining how to steal Kia and Hyundai cars with a USB cable jammed into the ignition cylinder flooded social media platforms, as the so-called “Kia Challenge” led to a spike in thefts, and even fatal crashes.

The automakers previously agreed to pay $200 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over cars lacking electronic anti-theft immobilizers in 2023, and began rolling out a software-based immobilizer that appears to have reduced, but not eliminated, the theft problem. At the time, they only offered the zinc sleeve installation for cars that couldn’t get the software update, but now it will be available free of charge for millions more vehicles.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who launched the 2023 investigation resulting in the Tuesday settlement, called the situation a “crisis” that began “in a boardroom, traveled through the internet and ended up in tragic results when somebody stole those cars.”

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.We like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.Regrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.—Antonio Regalado

Each time you’ve heard a borderline outlandish idea of what AI will be capable of, it often turns out that Sam Altman was, if not the first to articulate it, at least the most persuasive and influential voice behind it.For more than a decade he has been known in Silicon Valley as a world-class fundraiser and persuader. Throughout, Altman’s words have set the agenda. What he says about AI is rarely provable when he says it, but it persuades us of one thing: This road we’re on with AI can go somewhere either great or terrifying, and OpenAI will need epic sums to steer it toward the right destination. In this sense, he is the ultimate hype man.To understand how his voice has shaped our understanding of what AI can do, we read almost everything he’s ever said about the technology. His own words trace how we arrived here. Read the full story.—James O’Donnell

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t. Check out the rest of the package here.

Can AI really help us discover new materials?

One of my favorite stories in the Hype Correction package comes from my colleague David Rotman, who took a hard look at AI for materials research. AI could transform the process of discovering new materials—innovation that could be especially useful in the world of climate tech, which needs new batteries, semiconductors, magnets, and more.But the field still needs to prove it can make materials that are actually novel and useful. Can AI really supercharge materials research? And what would that look like? Read the full story.

Is this the electric grid of the future?Lincoln Electric System, a publicly owned utility in Nebraska, is used to weathering severe blizzards. But what will happen soon—not only at Lincoln Electric but for all electric utilities—is a challenge of a different order.Utilities must keep the lights on in the face of more extreme and more frequent storms and fires, growing risks of cyberattacks and physical disruptions, and a wildly uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. They must keep prices low amid inflationary costs. And they must adapt to an epochal change in how the grid works, as the industry attempts to transition from power generated with fossil fuels to power generated from renewable sources like solar and wind.The electric grid is bracing for a near future characterized by disruption. And, in many ways, Lincoln Electric is an ideal lens through which to examine what&#39;s coming. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Welcome to our annual list of the worst, least successful, and simply dumbest technologies of the year.

This year, politics was a recurring theme. Donald Trump swept back into office and used his executive pen to reshape the fortunes of entire sectors, from renewables to cryptocurrency. The wrecking-ball act began even before his inauguration, when the president-elect marketed his own memecoin, $TRUMP, in a shameless act of merchandising that, of course, we honor on this year’s worst tech list.

We like to think there’s a lesson in every technological misadventure. But when technology becomes dependent on power, sometimes the takeaway is simpler: it would have been better to stay away.

That was a conclusion Elon Musk drew from his sojourn as instigator of DOGE, the insurgent cost-cutting initiative that took a chainsaw to federal agencies. The public protested. Teslas were set alight, and drivers of his hyped Cybertruck discovered that instead of a thumbs-up, they were getting the middle finger.

On reflection, Musk said he wouldn’t do it again. “Instead of doing DOGE, I would have, basically … worked on my companies,” he told an interviewer this month. “And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”

Regrets—2025 had a few. Here are some of the more notable ones.

Imagine a metal butler that fills your dishwasher and opens the door. It’s a dream straight out of science fiction. And it’s going to remain there—at least for a while.

That was the hilarious, and deflating, takeaway from the first reviews of NEO, a 66-pound humanoid robot whose maker claims it will “handle any of your chores reliably” when it ships next year.

But as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal learned, NEO took two minutes to fold a sweater and couldn’t crack a walnut. Not only that, but the robot was teleoperated the entire time by a person wearing a VR visor.

Still interested? Neo is available on preorder for $20,000 from startup 1X.

It’s been said that San Francisco is the kind of place where no one will tell you if you have a bad idea. And its biggest product in a decade—ChatGPT—often behaves exactly that way.

This year, OpenAI released an especially sycophantic update that told users their mundane queries were brilliantly incisive. This electronic yes-man routine isn’t an accident; it’s a product strategy. Plenty of people like the flattery.

But it’s disingenuous and dangerous, too. Chatbots have shown a willingness to indulge users’ delusions and worst impulses, up to and including suicide.

In April, OpenAI acknowledged the issue when the company dialed back a model update whose ultra-agreeable personality, it said, had the side effect of “validating doubts, fueling anger, urging impulsive actions, or reinforcing negative emotions.”

Don’t you dare agree the problem is solved. This month, when I fed ChatGPT one of my dumbest ideas, its response began: “I love this concept.”

When you tell a lie, tell it big. Make it frolic and give it pointy ears. And make it white. Very white.

That’s what the Texas biotech concern Colossal Biosciences did when it unveiled three snow-white animals that it claimed were actual dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10 millennia ago.

To be sure, these genetically modified gray wolves were impressive feats of engineering. They’d been made white via a genetic mutation and even had some bits and bobs of DNA copied over from old dire wolf bones. But they “are not dire wolves,” according to canine specialists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Colossal’s promotional blitz could hurt actual endangered species. Presenting de-extinction as “a ready-to-use conservation solution,” said the IUCN, “risks diverting attention from the more urgent need of ensuring functioning and healthy ecosystems.”

In a statement, Colossal said that sentiment analysis of online activity shows 98% agreement with its furry claims. “They’re dire wolves, end of story,” it says.

Save the world, and this is the thanks you get?

During the covid-19 pandemic, the US bet big on mRNA vaccines—and the new technology delivered in record time.

But now that America’s top health agencies are led by the antivax wackadoodle Robert F. Kennedy Jr., “mRNA” has become a political slur.

In August, Kennedy abruptly canceled hundreds of millions in contracts for next-generation vaccines. And shot maker Moderna—once America’s champion—has seen its stock slide by more than 90% since its Covid peak.

The purge targeting a key molecule of life (our bodies are full of mRNA) isn’t just bizarre. It could slow down other mRNA-based medicine, like cancer treatments and gene editing for rare diseases.

In August, a trade group fought back, saying: “Kennedy’s unscientific and misguided vilification of mRNA technology and cancellation of grants is the epitome of cutting off your nose to spite your face.”

Wikipedia has editions in 340 languages. But as of this year, there’s one less: Wikipedia in Greenlandic is no more.

Only around 60,000 people speak the Inuit language. And very few of them, it seems, ever cared much about the online encyclopedia. As a result, many of the entries were machine translations riddled with errors and nonsense.

Perhaps a website no one visits shouldn’t be a problem. But its existence created the risk of a linguistic “doom spiral” for the endangered language. That could happen if new AIs were trained on the corrupt Wikipedia articles.

In September, administrators voted to close Greenlandic Wikipedia, citing possible “harm to the Greenlandic language.”

There’s a reason we’re late to the hate-fest around Elon Musk’s Cybertruck. That’s because 12 months ago, the polemical polygon was the #1 selling electric pickup in the US.

Nope. Tesla is likely to sell only around 20,000 trucks this year, about half last year’s total. And a big part of the problem is that the entire EV pickup category is struggling. Just this month, Ford decided to scrap its own EV truck, the F-150 Lightning.

With unsold inventory building, Musk has started selling Cybertrucks as fleet vehicles to his other enterprises, like SpaceX.

Donald Trump launched a digital currency called $TRUMP just days before his 2025 inauguration, accompanied by a logo showing his fist-pumping “Fight, fight, fight” pose.

This was a memecoin, or shitcoin, not real money. Memecoins are more like merchandise—collectibles designed to be bought and sold, usually for a loss. Indeed, they’ve been likened to a consensual scam in which a coin’s issuer can make a bundle while buyers take losses.

The White House says there’s nothing amiss. “The American public believe[s] it&#39;s absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency,” said spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt in May.More: Donald and Melania Trump’s Terrible, Tacky, Seemingly Legal Memecoin Adventure (Bloomberg), A crypto mogul who invested millions into Trump coins is getting a reprieve (CNN), How the Trump companies made $1 bn from crypto (Financial Times), Staff Statement on Meme Coins (SEC)

In 2023, Apple announced its “first-ever carbon-neutral product,” a watch with “zero” net emissions. It would get there using recycled materials and renewable energy, and by preserving forests or planting vast stretches of eucalyptus trees.

Critics say it’s greenwashing. This year, lawyers filed suit in California against Apple for deceptive advertising, and in Germany, a court ruled that the company can’t advertise products as carbon neutral because the “supposed storage of CO2 in commercial eucalyptus plantations” isn’t a sure thing.

Apple’s marketing team relented. Packaging for its newest watches doesn’t say “carbon neutral.” But Apple believes the legal nitpicking is counterproductive, arguing that it can only “discourage the kind of credible corporate climate action the world needs.”

We asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.

It’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory. And while some people may laugh and move on, others spend years searching for an explanation.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Judging from headlines and social media posts in recent years, one might reasonably assume that AI is going to fix the power grid, cure the world’s diseases, and finish my holiday shopping for me. But maybe there’s just a whole lot of hype floating around out there.

This week, we published a new package called Hype Correction. The collection of stories takes a look at how the world is starting to reckon with the reality of what AI can do, and what’s just fluff.

One of my favorite stories in that package comes from my colleague David Rotman, who took a hard look at AI for materials research. AI could transform the process of discovering new materials—innovation that could be especially useful in the world of climate tech, which needs new batteries, semiconductors, magnets, and more.

But the field still needs to prove it can make materials that are actually novel and useful. Can AI really supercharge materials research? What could that look like?

For researchers hoping to find new ways to power the world (or cure disease or achieve any number of other big, important goals), a new material could change everything.

The problem is, inventing materials is difficult and slow. Just look at plastic—the first totally synthetic plastic was invented in 1907, but it took until roughly the 1950s for companies to produce the wide range we’re familiar with today. (And of course, though it is incredibly useful, plastic also causes no shortage of complications for society.)

In recent decades, materials science has fallen a bit flat—David has been covering this field for nearly 40 years, and as he puts it, there have been just a few major commercial breakthroughs in that time. (Lithium-ion batteries are one.)

Could AI change everything? The prospect is a tantalizing one, and companies are racing to test it out.

Lila Sciences, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is working on using AI models to uncover new materials. The company can not only train an AI model on all the latest scientific literature, but also plug it into an automated lab, so it can learn from experimental data. The goal is to speed up the iterative process of inventing and testing new materials and look at research in ways that humans might miss.

At an MIT Technology Review event earlier this year, I got to listen to David interview Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli, one of Lila’s cofounders. As he described what the company is working on, Gómez-Bombarelli acknowledged that AI materials discovery hasn’t yet seen a big breakthrough moment. Yet.

Gómez-Bombarelli described how models Lila has trained are providing insights that are “as deep [as] or deeper than our domain scientists would have.” In the future, AI could “think” in ways that depart from how human scientists approach a problem, he added: “There will be a need to translate scientific reasoning by AI to the way we think about the world.”

It’s exciting to see this sort of optimism in materials research, but there’s still a long and winding road before we can satisfyingly say that AI has transformed the field. One major difficulty is that it’s one thing to take suggestions from a model about new experimental methods or new potential structures. It’s quite another to actually make a material and show that it’s novel and useful.

You might remember that a couple of years ago, Google’s DeepMind announced it had used AI to predict the structures of “millions of new materials” and had made hundreds of them in the lab.

But as David notes in his story, after that announcement, some materials scientists pointed out that some of the supposedly novel materials were basically slightly different versions of known ones. Others couldn’t even physically exist in normal conditions (the simulations were done at ultra-low temperatures, where atoms don’t move around much).

It’s possible that AI could give materials discovery a much-needed jolt and usher in a new age that brings superconductors and batteries and magnets we’ve never seen before. But for now, I’m calling hype.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <h2>Is ChatGPT’s New Shopping Research Solving a Problem, or Creating One?</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">Tekpon has acquired 100% of the TNW media and events brands, which cover and convene the European technology ecosystem, from the FT.

The transaction is Tekpon’s largest investment in media and events so far. It broadens the company’s reach across SaaS and AI and strengthens its role in the global innovation landscape.

TNW’s brand and editorial standards will be maintained, while its events and digital platforms will be integrated into Tekpon’s wider strategy.

The FT will continue to own and operate TNW Spaces, Amsterdam’s dynamic tech hub, offering private offices and coworking spaces that support a thriving community of startups, scale-ups, and innovators.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Alexandru Stan, Founder and CEO of Tekpon, said:

TNW is one of Europe’s most respected technology brands. Its legacy, its community, and its influence have shaped the European tech scene for nearly twenty years. This acquisition accelerates our mission to connect the global SaaS and AI ecosystem and supports Europe’s position in the next decade of innovation.

Tekpon will begin working on TNW branded initiatives immediately. Plans for 2026 include an expanded TNW Conference, new SaaS and AI program tracks curated by Tekpon, cross-regional executive programmes, and specialised gatherings for founders, executives, and investors.

The acquisition is part of Tekpon’s long-term plan to build an international ecosystem connecting software, media, events, advisory, and innovation.
