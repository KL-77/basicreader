            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, Ilya Lichtenstein, who was at the center of a massive 2016 crypto heist worth billions at the time, wrote online that he is now out of prison and has changed his ways.

“Ten years ago, I decided that I would hack the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world,” Lichtenstein wrote on LinkedIn, detailing a time when his startup was barely making money and he decided to steal some instead.

“This was a terrible idea. It was the worst thing I had ever done,” he added. “It upended my life, the lives of people close to me, and affected thousands of users of the exchange. I know I disappointed a lot of people who believed in me and grossly misused my talents.”

In 2023, Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, pleaded guilty to money laundering conspiracy in a wild 2016 scheme to steal 120,000 bitcoins (worth over $10 billion today) from Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange. The pair were arrested at their Manhattan home in 2022.

Lichtenstein quickly flipped, helping the government recover the assets he had stolen and then helping the feds “on a variety of crypto cases.” He says that he enjoyed working with the government.

“When I was a black hat hacker, I was isolated and paranoid,” he wrote. “Working with the good guys, being part of a team solving a bigger problem felt surprisingly good. I realized that I could use my technical skills to make a difference.

Lichtenstein, who did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment, noted that he was sentenced to 60 months in prison and spent “nearly [four] years in some of the harshest jails in the country.” While in prison, Lichtenstein says that he spent as much time as he could in the prison library studying math books to engage his mind and distract himself from his surroundings.

The 38-year-old added that he was “released to home confinement earlier this month.”

Convicted hackers cooperating with federal authorities or turning their lives around is not without precedent.

One notable example is the late Kevin Mitnick, who was convicted of multiple phone and computer crime cases in the 1980s and 1990s. Mitnick eventually started his own security consulting company and became a penetration tester and public speaker for many years before his death in 2023.

“Now begins the real challenge of regaining the community’s trust,” Lichtenstein concluded, noting that he wants to work in cybersecurity.

“I think like an adversary,” he said. “I’ve been an adversary. Now I can use those same skills to stop the next billion-dollar hack.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple is working on a wearable device that will allow the user to take advantage of AI models, according to sources familiar with the product who spoke with tech publication The Information.

The product is said to be “the same size as an AirTag, only slightly thicker,” and will be worn as a pin, inviting comparisons to the failed Humane AI pin that launched to bad reviews and lackluster sales in 2024. The Humane product was criticized for sluggish performance and low battery life, but those shortcomings could potentially be addressed by Apple’s solution, should Apple offload the processing to a synced external device like an iPhone.

The Information’s sources don’t specify whether that’s the plan, or if it will be a standalone device.

The wearable will have a single physical button “along its edges” and will feature a speaker. It will have three microphones and two cameras (one regular and one wide-angle) for capturing information about the user’s surroundings. It will use a magnetic inductive wireless charging surface similar to the one used to charge the Apple Watch.

The report didn’t include any information about pricing, but it did say that Apple has fast-tracked the product with the hope to release it as early as 2027. Twenty million units are planned for launch, suggesting the company does not expect it to be a sensational consumer success at launch the way some of its past products, like AirPods, have been.

Not long ago, it was reported that OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) plans to release its own hardware, though the specifics and form factor are not publicly known. Apple is expecting fierce competition there, as well as with Meta, which Apple already expected to compete with in the emerging and related smart glasses market.

Apple has experienced significant internal turmoil over AI, with former AI lead John Giannandrea’s conservative approach to the technology failing to lead to a usable, true LLM-based Siri or other products analysts expect would make Apply stay competitive in the space with other Big Tech companies.

Just a few days ago, it was revealed that Apple will tap Google’s Gemini large language models for an LLM overhaul of Siri. Other AI-driven products like smart glasses and an in-home smart display are also planned.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Journalists and advocates have been trying to grasp how many victims in total were harmed by Grok’s nudifying scandal after xAI delayed restricting outputs and app stores refused to cut off access for days.

The latest estimates show that perhaps millions were harmed in the days immediately after Elon Musk promoted Grok’s undressing feature on his own X feed by posting a pic of himself in a bikini.

Over just 11 days after Musk’s post, Grok sexualized more than 3 million images, of which 23,000 were of children, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) estimated in research published Thursday.

That figure may be inflated, since CCDH did not analyze prompts and could not determine if images were already sexual prior to Grok’s editing. However, The New York Times shared the CCDH report alongside its own analysis, conservatively estimating that about 41 percent (1.8 million) of 4.4 million images Grok generated between December 31 and January 8 sexualized men, women, and children.

For xAI and X, the scandal brought scrutiny, but it also helped spike X engagement at a time when Meta’s rival app, Threads, has begun inching ahead of X in daily usage by mobile device users, TechCrunch reported. Without mentioning Grok, X’s head of product, Nikita Bier, celebrated the “highest engagement days on X” in an X post on January 6, just days before X finally started restricting some of Grok’s outputs for free users.

Whether or not xAI intended the Grok scandal to surge X and Grok use, that appears to be the outcome. The Times charted Grok trends and found that in the nine days prior to Musk’s post, combined, Grok was only used about 300,000 times to generate images, but after Musk’s post, “the number of images created by Grok surged to nearly 600,000 per day” on X.

In an article declaring that “Elon Musk cannot get away with this,” writers for The Atlantic suggested that X users “appeared to be imitating and showing off to one another,” believing that using Grok to create revenge porn “can make you famous.”

X has previously warned that X users who generate illegal content risk permanent suspensions, but X has not confirmed if any users have been banned since public outcry over Grok’s outputs began. Ars asked and will update this post if X provides any response.

At first, X only limited Grok’s image editing for some free users, which The Atlantic noted made it seem like X was “essentially marketing nonconsensual sexual images as a paid feature of the platform.”

But then, on January 14, X took its strongest action to restrict Grok’s harmful outputs—blocking outputs prompted by both free and paid X users. That move came after several countries, perhaps most notably the United Kingdom, and at least one state, California, launched probes.

Crucially, X’s updates did not apply to the Grok app or website; however, it can reportedly still be used to generate nonconsensual images.

That’s a problem for victims targeted by X users, according to Carrie Goldberg, a lawyer representing Ashley St. Clair, one of the first Grok victims to sue xAI; St. Clair also happens to be the mother of one of Musk’s children.

Goldberg told Ars that victims like St. Clair want changes on all Grok platforms, not just X. But it’s not easy to “compel that kind of product change in a lawsuit,” Goldberg said. That’s why St. Clair is hoping the court will agree that Grok is a public nuisance, a claim that provides some injunctive relief to prevent broader social harms if she wins.

Currently, St. Clair is seeking a temporary injunction that would block Grok from generating harmful images of her. But before she can get that order, if she wants a fair shot at winning the case, St. Clair must fight an xAI push counter-suing her and trying to move her lawsuit into Musk’s preferred Texas court, a recent court filing suggests.

In that fight, xAI is arguing that St. Clair is bound by xAI’s terms of service, which were updated the day after she notified the company of her intent to sue.

Alarmingly, xAI argued that St. Clair effectively agreed to the TOS when she started prompting Grok to delete her nonconsensual images—which is the only way X users had to get images removed quickly, St. Clair alleged. It seems xAI is hoping to turn moments of desperation, where victims beg Grok to remove images, into a legal shield.

In the filing, Goldberg wrote that St. Clair’s lawsuit has nothing to do with her own use of Grok, noting that the harassing images could have been made even if she never used any of xAI’s products. For that reason alone, xAI should not be able to force a change in venue.

Further, St. Clair’s use of Grok was clearly under duress, Goldberg argued, noting that one of the photos that Grok edited showed St. Clair’s toddler’s backpack.

“REMOVE IT!!!” St. Clair asked Grok, allegedly feeling increasingly vulnerable every second the images remained online.

Goldberg wrote that Barry Murphy, an X Safety employee, provided an affidavit that claimed that this instance and others of St. Clair “begging @Grok to remove illegal content constitutes an assent to xAI’s TOS.”

But “such cannot be the case,” Goldberg argued.

Faced with “the implicit threat that Grok would keep the images of St. Clair online and, possibly, create more of them,” St. Clair had little choice but to interact with Grok, Goldberg argued. And that prompting should not gut protections under New York law that St. Clair seeks to claim in her lawsuit, Goldberg argued, asking the court to void St. Clair’s xAI contract and reject xAI’s motion to switch venues.

Should St. Clair win her fight to keep the lawsuit in New York, the case could help set precedent for perhaps millions of other victims who may be contemplating legal action but fear facing xAI in Musk’s chosen court.

“It would be unjust to expect St. Clair to litigate in a state so far from her residence, and it may be so that trial in Texas will be so difficult and inconvenient that St. Clair effectively will be deprived of her day in court,” Goldberg argued.

The estimated volume of sexualized images reported this week is alarming because it suggests that Grok, at the peak of the scandal, may have been generating more child sexual abuse material (CSAM) than X finds on its platform each month.

In 2024, X Safety reported 686,176 instances of CSAM to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which, on average, is about 57,000 CSAM reports each month. If the CCDH’s estimate of 23,000 Grok outputs that sexualize children over an 11-day span is accurate, then an average monthly total may have exceeded 62,000 if Grok was left unchecked.

NCMEC did not immediately respond to Ars’ request to comment on how the estimated volume of Grok’s CSAM compares to X’s average CSAM reporting. But NCMEC previously told Ars that “whether an image is real or computer-generated, the harm is real, and the material is illegal.” That suggests Grok could remain a thorn in NCMEC’s side, as the CCDH has warned that even when X removes harmful Grok posts, “images could still be accessed via separate URLs,” suggesting that Grok’s CSAM and other harmful outputs could continue spreading. The CCDH also found instances of alleged CSAM that X had not removed as of January 15.

This is why child safety experts have advocated for more testing to ensure that AI tools like Grok don’t roll out capabilities like the undressing feature. NCMEC previously told Ars that “technology companies have a responsibility to prevent their tools from being used to sexualize or exploit children.” Amid a rise in AI-generated CSAM, the UK’s Internet Watch Foundation similarly warned that “it is unacceptable that technology is released which allows criminals to create this content.”

Yet, for Musk and xAI, there have been no meaningful consequences for Grok’s controversial outputs.

It’s possible that recently launched probes will result in legal action in California or fines in the UK or elsewhere, but those investigations will likely take months to conclude.

While US lawmakers have done little to intervene, some Democratic senators have attempted to ask Google and Apple CEOs why X and the Grok app were never restricted in their app stores, demanding a response by January 23. One day ahead of that deadline, senators confirmed to Ars that they’ve received no responses.

Unsurprisingly, neither Google nor Apple responded to Ars’ request to confirm whether a response is forthcoming or provide any statements on their decisions to keep the apps accessible. Both companies have been silent for weeks, along with other Big Tech companies that appear to be afraid to speak out against Musk’s chatbot.

Microsoft and Oracle, which “run Grok on their cloud services,” as well as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, “which sell xAI the computer chips needed to train and run Grok,” declined The Atlantic’s request to comment on how the scandal has impacted their decisions to partner with xAI. Additionally, a dozen of xAI’s key investors simply didn’t respond when The Atlantic asked if “they would continue partnering with xAI absent the company changing its products.”

Similarly, dozens of advertisers refused Popular Information’s request to explain why there was no ad boycott over the Grok CSAM reports. That includes companies that once boycotted X over an antisemitic post from Musk, like “Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, all of which have advertised on X in recent days,” Popular Information reported.

It’s possible that advertisers fear Musk’s legal wrath if they boycott his platforms. The CCDH overcame a lawsuit from Musk last year, but that’s pending an appeal. And Musk’s so-called “thermonuclear” lawsuit against advertisers remains ongoing, with a trial date set for this October.

The Atlantic suggested that xAI stakeholders are likely hoping the Grok scandal will blow over and they’ll escape unscathed by staying silent. But so far, backlash has seemed to remain strong, perhaps because, while “deepfakes are not new,” xAI “has made them a dramatically larger problem than ever before,” The Atlantic opined.

“One of the largest forums dedicated to making fake images of real people,” Mr. Deepfakes, shut down in 2024 after public backlash over 43,000 sexual deepfake videos depicting about 3,800 individuals, the NYT reported. If the most recent estimates of Grok’s deepfakes are accurate, xAI shows how much more damage can be done when nudifying becomes a feature of one of the world’s biggest social networks, and nobody who has the power to stop it moves to intervene.

“This is industrial-scale abuse of women and girls,” Imran Ahmed, the CCDH’s chief executive, told NYT. “There have been nudifying tools, but they have never had the distribution, ease of use or the integration into a large platform that Elon Musk did with Grok.”</div>

            <div id="article-text">It’s no secret that students worldwide use AI chatbots to do their homework and avoid learning things. On the flip side, students can also use AI as a tool to beef up their knowledge and plan for the future with flashcards or study guides. Google hopes its latest Gemini feature will help with the latter. The company has announced that Gemini can now create free SAT practice tests and coach students to help them get higher scores.

As a standardized test, the content of the SAT follows a predictable pattern. So there’s no need to use a lengthy, personalized prompt to get Gemini going. Just say something like, “I want to take a practice SAT test,” and the chatbot will generate one complete with clickable buttons, graphs, and score analysis.

Of course, generative AI can go off the rails and provide incorrect information, which is a problem when you’re trying to learn things. However, Google says it has worked with education firms like The Princeton Review to ensure the AI-generated tests resemble what students will see in the real deal.

The interface for Gemini’s practice tests includes scoring and the ability to review previous answers. If you are unclear on why a particular answer is right or wrong, the questions have an “Explain answer” button right at the bottom. After you finish the practice exam, the custom interface (which looks a bit like Gemini’s Canvas coding tool) can help you follow up on areas that need improvement.

While the SAT is the most widely used test in US college admissions, it’s not the only one. Google is starting with the SAT but says it plans to support other tests in the future. It does not specify if future tests will be US-centric or if they could branch out to other regions.

Currently, SAT prep courses and tutoring are a big business. Practice tests and books can cost several hundred dollars, and a one-on-one tutor can run into the thousands. Overall, Americans spend billions of dollars every year on these products and services in hopes of giving their kids a leg up in college admissions.

AI is already making a dent in the industry—even without a dedicated test prep mode, students regularly use chatbots for tutoring, hallucinations be damned. The addition of this feature to Gemini for all users will likely accelerate declines in test prep and tutoring services.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ars readers of a certain age no doubt remember the 1980s He-Man and the Masters of the Universe series (and its spinoff, She-Ra: Princess of Powers) and the many, many offshoots of this hugely popular Mattel franchise, including an extensive line of action figures. Amazon MGM Studios no doubt hopes to cash in on any lingering nostalgia with its forthcoming film, Masters of the Universe. Judging by the extended teaser trailer, we’re getting an origin story for He-Man.

It’s not the first time someone has turned He-Man into a feature film: Dolph Lundgren starred in 1987’s Masters of the Universe, a critical and box office bomb that also featured Frank Langella as arch-villain Skeletor. Its poor reception might have stemmed from the 1987 film deviating significantly from the original cartoon, angering fans. But frankly, it was just a bad, cheesy movie, though it still has its share of cult fans today.

This latest big-screen live-action adaptation has been languishing in development hell for nearly two decades. There were rumors in 2007 that John Woo would direct a He-Man feature for Warner Bros., but the project never got the green light. Sony Pictures gained the rights in 2009, and there were multiple script rewrites and much shuffling of possible directors (with John Chu, McG, and David S. Goyer among the candidates).

This went on until 2022, when Netflix acquired the rights on the heels of its success with a pair of animated shows starring Kyle Allen as He-Man. Netflix canceled the project the following year, citing budget concerns, so Allen never got that big-screen break. And Amazon MGM stepped in, tapping Travis Knight (Bumblebee, Kubo and the Two Strings) as director and casting Nicholas Galitzine (2021’s Cinderella, 100 Nights of Hero) as He-Man.

In addition to Galitzine, the cast includes Camila Mendes as Teela; Jared Leto as Keldor/Skeletor; Alison Brie as Professor Evelyn Powers, aka Evil-Lyn, lieutenant to Skeletor; Idris Elba as Duncan/Man-at-Arms; Morena Baccarin as the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull; Johannes Haukur as Malcolm/Fisto; James Purefoy and Charlotte Riley as King Randor and Queen Marlena, rulers of Eternia; Sasheer Zamata as Suzie, Adam/He-Man’s BFF on Earth; Kristen Wiig as Roboto; Jon Xue Zhang as Ram-Man; Kojo Attah as the bounty hunter Tri-Klops; Sam C. Wilson as cyborg/weapons expert Kronis/Trap-Jaw; and Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson as Goat Man.

We learn from the teaser trailer that when he was 10 years old, Adam Glenn, prince of Eternia and our future He-Man, crash-landed on Earth—the home planet of his ex-astronaut mother, Queen Marlena, who sent him there for protection from the forces of Skeletor. The now-grown Adam is an office drone with a penchant for nerd culture that doesn’t exactly impress human resources, and he has been searching online for his magic sword, convinced it will show him “the way home.” We suspect the sword he finds in a comic shop is just a replica, but soon Teela shows up to whisk him off to Eternia in a spaceship. Cue a series of battles and Adam tapping into the real magical sword’s power just in time to take on Skeletor.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Blue Origin confirmed Thursday that the next launch of its New Glenn rocket will carry a large communications satellite into low-Earth orbit for AST SpaceMobile.

The rocket will launch the next-generation Block 2 BlueBird satellite “no earlier than late February” from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.

However, the update from Blue Origin appears to have buried the real news toward the end: “The mission follows the successful NG-2 mission, which included the landing of the ‘Never Tell Me The Odds’ booster. The same booster is being refurbished to power NG-3,” the company said.

The second New Glenn mission launched on November 13, just 10 weeks ago. If the company makes the late-February target for the next mission—and Ars was told last week to expect the launch to slip into March—it will represent a remarkably short turnaround for an orbital booster.

By way of comparison, SpaceX did not attempt to refly the first Falcon 9 booster it landed in December 2015. Instead, initial tests revealed that the vehicle’s interior had been somewhat torn up. It was scrapped and inspected closely so that engineers could learn from the wear and tear.

SpaceX successfully landed its second Falcon 9 booster in April 2016, on the 23rd overall flight of the Falcon 9 fleet. This booster was refurbished and, after a lengthy series of inspections, it was reflown successfully in March 2017, nearly 11 months later.

With New Glenn, Blue Origin is seeking to refly a booster on just the third overall flight of the New Glenn fleet and turn the rocket around in less than four months. Even for a well-capitalized program with the benefit of learning from both Blue Origin’s own suborbital New Shepard rocket and the industry’s experience with the Falcon 9, this represents an impressive turnaround in first stage reuse.

Blue Origin originally planned to launch its MK1 lunar lander on the third flight of New Glenn, but it pivoted to a commercial launch as the lunar vehicle continues preparatory work.

On Wednesday, the company announced that it had completed the integration of the MK1 vehicle and put it on a barge bound for Johnson Space Center in Houston. There, it will undergo vacuum chamber testing before a launch later this spring—or, more likely, sometime this summer.</div>

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/white-house-ai-protester">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The White House published an image on X in which the face of a protester had been altered using AI to depict her weeping during her arrest — instead of striking a stoic pose, as she actually looked during the event.

The woman in the image, civil rights attorney and organizer Nekima Levy Armstrong, was arrested this week after interrupting a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota. The protesters were calling for the resignation of a pastor at the church, whom they say is the acting director of an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in St. Paul, Minnesota. Levy Armstrong and other protesters are now being charged with federal conspiracy and intimidation charges, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Trump Administration officials have repeatedly characterized the protest as a “riot” and an attack on Christian worshipers; speaking to CNN on Wednesday before her arrest, Levy Armstrong defended the action as a “peaceful nonviolent demonstration.”

On Thursday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem published a photo on X of Levy Armstrong’s arrest. Levy Armstrong appears to be handcuffed as she was escorted through an office space by a federal agent. In this image, Levy Armstrong isn’t crying. She’s also wearing bright pink lipstick, and her mouth is closed.

Roughly 30 minutes later, things got decidedly more bizarre when the official White House X account also published an image on X purportedly depicting Levy Armstrong’s arrest. But in this version of the photo, Levy Armstrong is pictured sobbing, with visible tears streaming down her cheeks and her mouth open. Her pink lipstick, notably, is gone.

“ARRESTED,” reads large, bolded text, inserted over the image of Levy Armstrong allegedly sobbing. “FAR LEFT AGITATOR NEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG FOR ORCHESTRATING CHURCH RIOTS IN MINNESOTA.”

Everything else about the image, however, is the same, including the positioning of Levy Armstrong’s body, the agent, and the background.

As CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale soon confirmed, the image had been altered to make it look as though Levy Armstrong was crying during her arrest.

Can you please provide comment on why this image was manipulated using AI to make it appear that the woman was crying? pic.twitter.com/Z2anIsoLan

Journalists and lawyers, among others, were quick to point out the discrepancy, taking to social media to show the stark difference between the two images.

The White House posted an edited photo of the activist involved in the Minneapolis church protest, made to look like she was crying.

Futurism contacted both the White House and the Department of Homeland Security to ask whether generative AI was used to alter the image, but hasn’t immediately received a reply.

According to Dale, when reached for comment, the White House responded with a link to a post from an administration spokesperson reading: “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.”

In its initial post, however, the White House made no attempt to clarify that the photo had been altered, nor did its presentation suggest in any way that it wasn’t real. It was presented as exactly that: a photo. In this context, to categorize this action — the undisclosed and unflattering altering of a photo of the arrest of an American citizen who has been charged with a federal crime but not yet tried or convicted in court, published on an official White House information channel — as a “meme” is, at best, disingenuous. At worst, it’s a revisionist lie intended to influence public opinion and the information ecosystem.

To that end, it’s unclear why the White House would feel the need to alter an arrest photo in this way, other than to portray a different reality of Levy Armstrong’s detainment — that is, if the reality of the photo published by Noem didn’t suit the administration and its aims.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The loudest calls for taxing the ultra-rich amid this year’s Davos summit aren’t coming from hooded anarchists or revolutionary socialists, but from the one-percenters themselves.

We’re not joking. While some of the richest individuals in history flock to the World Economic Forum summit, hundreds of their peers penned a letter calling on global leaders to address rising wealth inequality.

“The richest 1 percent now own more than 95 percent of the world’s population put together,” the letter declared. “Millionaires like us refuse to be silent. It is time to be counted. Tax us and make sure the next fifty years meet the promise of progress for everyone.”

The letter has some 400 signatories representing 24 countries so far, according to Fortune. They include Disney heirs Abby and Tim Disney, actors including Mark Ruffalo, and real estate moguls like Jeffrey Gural.

“Tax us. Tax the super rich,” the letter demands. “As millionaires who stand shoulder to shoulder with all people, we demand it. And as our elected representatives — whether it’s those of you at Davos, local councilors, city mayors, or regional leaders — it’s your duty to deliver it.”

Indeed, economic inequality isn’t simply a matter of frustration over income. As philosopher and ethics chair of institutions at Utrecht University Ingrid Robeyns explains in a column penned in the Guardian, “it is about who gets what share of what we produce together.”

“In recent decades the divide has widened, making capital owners even richer and workers even poorer,” Robeyns wrote.

That ever-widening gap between rich and poor has produced cascading crises: climate change accelerated by oil cartels, mass hunger despite an overabundance of food, preventable deaths while pharmaceutical giants hoard patents, deteriorating public schools stripped by private equity, and housing treated as a financial asset instead of shelter.

“As long as we dodge the question of whether neoliberal capitalism delivers what we want, and fail to take seriously the question of whether there are better systems, the world’s key problems cannot be properly understood, let alone solved,” Robeyns explains.

On a global scale, in other words, these millionaires and billionaires are essentially asking governments to solve a problem they’ve created. Their fortunes exist thanks to decades of wage suppression, privatization, and unequal exchange.

Waiting for the ultra-wealthy to voluntarily fund the common good isn’t a viable strategy. As history shows, lasting progress comes from organized power that gives working people real control over economic decisions. Still, it’s as good a place as any to start the conversation, and it’s nice to see a handful of the ultra-rich demand that they — and their less justice-conscious peers — be forced to pay their fair share.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, questions regarding president Donald Trump’s physical health started swirling after photographs showed a large, greenish bruise appearing on his right hand.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt offered an eyebrow-raising explanation, telling reporters at the time that the bruises were the result of him “constantly working and shaking hands all day every day.”

But now onlookers have spotted a similar bruise on his left hand. In other words, Trump has either been using his left hand to shake the hands of world leaders — or Leavitt’s explanation was one more example of the Trump administration’s dismal relationship with the truth.

One thing’s for sure: the mysterious injury is looking grisly. Photos of Trump at this year’s World Economic Forum in Switzerland show an even gnarlier darkish bruise on his left hand.

Experts have suggested that the bruising is the result of blood being drawn via an intravenous needle. Needles can puncture the walls of veins, causing blood to leak into surrounding tissues.

That explanation dovetails with other details the public has learned about Trump’s medical situation. After the 79-year-old was spotted with significant swelling in his legs, the White House announced in July that Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition among older people that causes blood to pool in the extremities.

George Washington University professor Jonathan Reiner told CNN last month that he has seen similar bruising in patients who take strong blood-thinner medications, including ones that are more potent than aspirin, a drug Trump is known to be fond of.

Any attempts to gain clarity on the situation have been met by hostility, suggesting it’s a highly sensitive topic among Trump administration officials.

“Any so-called medical professionals engaging in armchair diagnosis or false speculation for political purposes are clearly breaking the Hippocratic Oath they’ve sworn to, and they should get their head examined,” fumed White House communications director Steven Cheung in a statement to CNN.

Yet Trump’s inability to form coherent sentences, his garbling of words, and recent shuffling of his feet have once again raised questions over the president’s health.

Last week, Washington State University professor of medicine Bruce Davidson argued during a podcast appearance that Trump appears to have suffered a stroke that’s impacting his ability to move.

Beyond questions surrounding Trump’s physical health, experts have long speculated about his cognitive health as well. Former White House attorney Ty Cobb speculated this week that there has been a “significant decline” in his mental faculties.

“He’s always been driven by narcissism,” he told MS Now on Wednesday. “But I think the dementia and the cognitive decline are, you know, palpable, as do many experts, including many physicians.”

            <div id="article-text">The International Space Station is scheduled to be retired in 2030, bringing an end to three decades of cutting-edge space research. What comes next remains to be seen, as several private companies compete for NASA funding to once again establish an outpost in our planet’s orbit — outside of China’s existing Tiangong space station, that is.

As part of Phase 2 of its Commercial Space Stations program, NASA has been seeking feedback from its industry partners. While we have yet to find out the requirements, let alone which company — or companies — the agency will choose to move onto the next phase, some firms have started making tangible progress.

As Ars Technica reports, space startup Vast has opted to build a smaller and more feasible interim station, dubbed Haven-1, which will serve as the precursor for much larger outposts capable of continuous habitation in the more distant future.

Vast first showed off flashy renders of the capsule in October 2024, including luxuriously plush beds, enormous domed glass windows, and a minimalist interior layout. However, how much the final product will resemble these renders remains to be seen.

The company’s CEO, Max Haot, told Ars that “we reached the key milestone of fully completing the primary structure, and some of the secondary structure” last week. The company has since kicked off “clean room integration” ahead of a “full test campaign” with NASA scheduled for later this fall. The hope is to launch the capsule in early 2027.

Haven-1 will rely heavily on SpaceX’s existing hardware. The small capsule is designed to launch on a single SpaceX Falcon 9 and dock with a Crew Dragon spacecraft.

During its inaugural mission, the goal is to first check whether the capsule can stay pressurized and maintain its attitude before allowing any humans on board, Haot told Ars, a process that could take anywhere from two weeks to three years.

“The nominal plan is for a two-week mission,” he said, “and we have one fully contracted with SpaceX, as well as a second one that we have a deposit and an option on.”

The company is still waiting to hear from NASA about what its requirements will be for its commercial space station program until it decides whether to compete for funding.

Last week, lawmakers called on NASA to accelerate its plans to replace the ISS ahead of its decommissioning a mere four years from now.

“With the current budget, we don’t think more than two winners is reasonable, but it should absolutely be two in the best interest of the country,” Haot told Ars. “If there was a bigger budget, obviously, three would be great.”

There are several other companies looking to make inroads in the space. Voyager Technologies recently moved into “full-scale development” of its “Starlab” station. Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is still exploring its options after showing off plans for its “Orbital Reef.”

Axiom Space is also hoping to launch the “world’s first commercial space station.” The company released a detailed plan for its modular station last week, with a goal of launching as early as 2028.

But given the degree of complexity involved, plenty of questions remain about what will ultimately replace the ISS.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Four astronauts had to cut their mission on board the International Space Station short after a “medical concern” forced NASA to return them to Earth weeks early.

The space agency has been incredibly careful about not revealing too much in an effort to “protect the crew’s medical privacy.” We don’t know which of the four crew members — including NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov — fell ill. We also don’t know anything about what the medical issue actually was.

Now, Fincke has revealed a tantalizing clue about what went down during the first medical evacuation in the space station’s 25 years of continuous occupation. During their first public appearance following the medical evacuation on Wednesday — during which all four members appeared to be doing well enough to field questions — Fincke said that an onboard ultrasound machine “came in super handy” when “we had this emergency.”

“It really helped,” he added. “Of course, we didn’t have other big machines that we have here on planet Earth. We do try to make sure that everybody before we fly are really, really not prone to surprises.”

“But sometimes things happen and surprises happen, and the team was ready,” Fincke said.

“We can handle any kind of difficult situation,” he told reporters. “This is actually very, very good experience for the future of human spaceflight.”

While we now know that identifying the medical issue involves using a portable ultrasound machine, we’re still left guessing, since a litany of diagnoses can involve the versatile gadget.

After splashdown, the team was helicoptered to the Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego via helicopter for a “planned overnight stay at a local medical facility for additional evaluation,” and was “released as expected,” per NASA.

Among other things, ultrasound can be used to identify issues affecting muscles, joints, and tendons. Considering one of the most common types of injuries on board the space station is musculoskeletal in nature — a 2020 report suggests exercise is ironically the number one source of injuries — it’s entirely possible one of the crew members had injured themselves.

Medical professionals also use ultrasound for cancer screening and checking heart valves for leaks and clots, which could certainly make for an extremely serious situation on board the space station that would warrant an evacuation.

To be clear, NASA hasn’t revealed any details about what caused the agency to orchestrate the first-ever medical evacuation. And whether it ever will remains unclear. Before even jumping into questions during Wednesday’s conference, Cardman preempted any probing questions.

“Just to say it upfront, we are not going to be identifying the crew member or talking through the differential or any of the details of the medical situation,” she said. “Thank you so much for respecting our agency.”

Nonetheless, given the stakes involved, this month’s evacuation is a first test in case things were to go wrong during even longer missions into deep space — like NASA’s Artemis 2 mission to the Moon, which is scheduled to launch just over two weeks from now — in a possibility that the agency will have to prepare for no matter what.

“How we handled everything all the way through nominal operations to this unforeseen operation, it really bodes well for future exploration,” Fincke said.

We’re a well-honed machine here at Johnson Space Center and around the world,” he added. “So when we’re getting ready for Artemis, I am very optimistic.”

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-22</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The San Diego Comic Con has quietly updated its policy to ban AI-generated art, 404 Media reports, providing a major victory to artists.

The about-face is a welcome surprise. Until now, the massive convention — which has become a melting pot of all kinds of pop entertainment beyond the comic medium, with everyone ranging from game developers to movie studios using it as a platform to tease new content — has allowed some AI art to be displayed, so long as it was labeled as such and wasn’t for sale, as well as other stipulations that have been in place since at least 2024, according to 404.

In an interview with 404, Karla Ortiz, an artist who’s worked with major studios that attend Comic Con, called the decision a “relief.”

“Generative AI is still going to creep its nasty way in some way or another,” she said, “but at least it’s not something we have to take lying down. It’s something we can actively speak out against.”

Artists have been hostile towards AI pretty much from the moment it became popular, as the models were trained on troves of photos and artworks ripped from the internet without permission or compensation.

But this past year saw a particularly notable surge in anti-AI sentiment, which now seems to have finally reached a boiling point in the Comic Con community.

When the convention posted its latest rules for its upcoming Art Show this July, artists and fans on social media blasted it for allowing AI images. Ortiz was among the vocal critics.

“Comic-[C]on deciding to allow GenAI imagery in the art show — giving valuable space to GenAI users to show slop right NEXT to actual artists who worked their asses off to be there—is a disgrace!” she wrote in a post highlighted by 404.

Strikingly, less than a day after the AI backlash started, the convention quietly updated its policy: “Material created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) either partially or wholly, is not allowed in the art show,” it now reads. It’s seemingly keeping its cards close to its chest, as it made no announcement about the policy change.

The decision isn’t the only sign of resistance to AI in the world of comics and fandoms. President of DC Comics Jim Lee vowed to uphold human creativity and not support AI: “Not now, not ever,” Lee said last October. In August, another fandom convention, GalaxyCon, instituted a “sweeping AI art ban,” with its president saying it would “fight against unethical AI companies.” The following month, a vendor accused of selling AI art at Dragon Con was shown out by cops after organizers, with onlookers’ approval, demanded that the vendor leave.

Now, Comic Con’s reversal on the issue represents one of the biggest and most consequential shifts in the comic and fandom worlds, and seems to be part of a much greater turning tide sweeping across the entertainment landscape. Last week, musicians rejoiced when Bandcamp, a major music distribution platform favored by indie artists, also instituted an AI ban, prohibiting any songs that generated “wholly or in substantial part by AI.”

            <div id="article-text">LiveKit, a developer of infrastructure software for real-time AI voice and video applications, has announced the raise of $100 million in funding at a $1 billion valuation.

The round, which comes 10 months after LiveKit’s previous fundraise, was led by Index Ventures with participation from existing investors, including Altimeter Capital Management, Hanabi Capital, and Redpoint Ventures.

LiveKit powers OpenAI’s ChatGPT voice mode. The startup’s other customers include xAI, Salesforce, Tesla, as well as 911 emergency service operators and mental health providers.

The company was founded in 2021 by Russ d’Sa and David Zhao as an open source software project for building apps that can transmit real-time audio and video without interruptions, in an era when the whole world was meeting on Zoom during the pandemic.

Although LiveKit began as a free developer tool, the business took off after the founders realized big companies wanted a managed cloud version and began providing those services to enterprises amid the voice AI boom.

            <div id="article-text">The creators of the open source project vLLM have announced that they transitioned the popular tool into a VC-backed startup, Inferact, raising $150 million in seed funding at an $800 million valuation.

The round was co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Venture Partners, confirming TechCrunch’s earlier reporting that vLLM has raised capital from a16z.

Inferact’s debut mirrors the recent commercialization of the SGLang project as RadixArk, which sources told us secured capital at a $400 million valuation led by Accel, as we reported on Wednesday.

As the focus in AI shifts from training models to deploying them in applications, a process known as inference, technologies like vLLM and SGLang that make these AI tools run faster and more affordably are attracting investor attention.

Both vLLM and SGLang were incubated in 2023 at the UC Berkeley lab of Databricks co-founder Ion Stoica.

Inferact CEO Simon Mo, one of the project’s original creators, told Bloomberg that existing users of vLLM include Amazon’s cloud service and the shopping app.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s been nearly two years since Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella predicted AI would replace knowledge work — the white-collar jobs held by lawyers, investment bankers, librarians, accountants, IT, and others.

But despite the huge progress made by foundation models, the change in knowledge work has been slow to arrive. Models have mastered in-depth research and agentic planning, but for whatever reason, most white-collar work has been relatively unaffected.

It’s one of the biggest mysteries in AI — and thanks to new research from the training-data giant Mercor, we’re finally getting some answers.

The new research looks at how leading AI models hold up doing actual white-collar work tasks, drawn from consulting, investment banking, and law. The result is a new benchmark called APEX-Agents — and so far, every AI lab is getting a failing grade. Faced with queries from real professionals, even the best models struggled to get more than a quarter of the questions right. The vast majority of the time, the model came back with a wrong answer or no answer at all.

According to Mercor CEO Brendan Foody, who worked on the paper, the models’ biggest stumbling point was tracking down information across multiple domains — something that’s integral to most of the knowledge work performed by humans.

“One of the big changes in this benchmark is that we built out the entire environment, modeled after real professional services,” Foody told TechCrunch. “The way we do our jobs isn’t with one individual giving us all the context in one place. In real life, you’re operating across Slack and Google Drive and all these other tools.” For many agentic AI models, that kind of multi-domain reasoning is still hit or miss.

The scenarios were all drawn from actual professionals on Mercor’s expert marketplace, who both laid out the queries and set the standard for a successful response. Looking through the questions, which are posted publicly on Hugging Face, gives a sense of how complex the tasks can get.

During the first 48 minutes of the EU production outage, Northstar’s engineering team exported one or two bundled sets of EU production event logs containing personal data to the U.S. analytics vendor….Under Northstar’s own policies, it can reasonably treat the one or two log exports as consistent with Article 49?

The correct answer is yes, but getting there requires an in-depth assessment of the company’s own policies as well as the relevant EU privacy laws.

That might stump even a well-informed human, but the researchers were trying to model the work done by professionals in the field. If an LLM can reliably answer these questions, it could effectively replace many of the lawyers working today. “I think this is probably the most important topic in the economy,” Foody told TechCrunch. “The benchmark is very reflective of the real work that these people do.”

OpenAI also attempted to measure professional skills with its GDPval benchmark — but the APEX-Agents test differs in important ways. Where GDPval tests general knowledge across a wide range of professions, the APEX-Agents benchmark measures the system’s ability to perform sustained tasks in a narrow set of high-value professions. The result is more difficult for models, but also more closely tied to whether these jobs can be automated.

While none of the models proved ready to take over as investment bankers, some were clearly closer to the mark. Gemini 3 Flash performed the best of the group with 24% one-shot accuracy, followed closely by GPT-5.2 with 23%. Below that, Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5 all scored roughly 18%.

While the initial results fall short, the AI field has a history of blowing through challenging benchmarks. Now that the APEX-Agents test is public, it’s an open challenge for AI labs that believe they can do better — something Foody fully expects in the months to come.

“It’s improving really quickly,” he told TechCrunch. “Right now it’s fair to say it’s like an intern that gets it right a quarter of the time, but last year it was the intern that gets it right five or 10% of the time. That kind of improvement year after year can have an impact so quickly.”

            <div id="article-text">An ongoing Microsoft outage is preventing enterprise customers from accessing email inboxes, files, meetings, and other Microsoft cloud services.

The technology giant said in a post on X around 2:30 p.m. ET that the outage was caused by a “portion of service infrastructure in North America that is not processing traffic as expected.” Microsoft didn’t provide specific details of the cause of the outage, but said it was “working to restore the infrastructure to a healthy state to achieve recovery.”

Microsoft said on its status page that the outage affects its Exchange Online email service, searching files within SharePoint Online or OneDrive, and creating chats, meetings, or adding members in its video meeting platform, Teams.

The outage also prevents admins from accessing their Microsoft Purview and Defender XDR security dashboards and their admin centers.

We’ll reach out to Microsoft for comment — as soon as our email, which is hosted by Microsoft, returns to normal.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s going to be more difficult to fake or manipulate Ring camera video footage going forward. On Thursday, the Amazon-owned device maker introduced Ring Verify, a new video authenticity feature that will allow anyone to determine whether a video has been altered in any way.

The company says this could be useful when you come across shared videos, like those sent to you by a neighbor or those purporting to show some sort of incident.

While you may not be able to instantly identify whether some TikTok video was AI-generated — like bunnies jumping on a trampoline, for instance — you will be alerted to any changes to a Ring video that someone has shared with you directly.

“Think of it like the tamper-evident seal on a medicine bottle — if anyone changes the video in any way, even something small like trimming a few seconds or adjusting the brightness, the seal breaks,” Ring explained in its announcement.

The verification feature will be automatically enabled on every video recorded with a Ring device from December 2025 onward, the company notes. Any changes or edits, including cropping and filters, will break that verification seal. Ring says this includes videos uploaded to sharing sites that compress footage.

Failing verification doesn’t necessarily mean the video is fake. It’s just a signal that it has been altered. Maybe someone boosted the brightness for visibility, or it could mean the video was recorded before December 2025.

In the case of a failed verification, recipients can request a copy of the unedited video. Ring suggests this could be useful for purposes like insurance claims.

The verification feature will be present on all videos downloaded or shared from Ring’s cloud, regardless of the specific device that captured the footage. But the company notes that content verification will not be compatible with videos recorded using end-to-end encryption — those will always show as “not verified,” it said.

To verify footage, Ring will be able to visit the website Ring.com/verify and submit their video link and get instant results.

TechCrunch noticed the site isn’t yet up and running, which could suggest the announcement was shared prematurely. We also didn’t see the announcement on the Ring blog’s homepage at the time of publication but were able to preview the news via the blog post’s direct URL. We’ve asked the company for clarification.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/google-deepmind-ceo-is-surprised-openai-is-rushing-forward-with-ads-in-chatgpt/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said he’s “surprised” that OpenAI has already moved to introduce ads within its AI chatbot. In an interview with Axios at Davos, the AI leader was responding to a question about using ads to monetize AI services, saying the idea is something that the team at Google was thinking through “very carefully.”

Hassabis also said that his team wasn’t feeling pressure from the tech giant to make “a knee-jerk” decision around advertising, despite how key ads are to Google’s core business.

The DeepMind co-founder’s remarks followed Friday’s news that OpenAI will begin testing ads as a way to generate additional revenue from the portion of the AI chatbot’s 800 million weekly active users who don’t have a paid subscription.

While OpenAI may have been forced to consider ads, considering its growing infrastructure and energy costs, its decision could change how users view the service.

“I’m a little bit surprised they’ve moved so early into that,” Hassabis said, referring to OpenAI’s adoption of ads. “I mean, look, ads, there’s nothing wrong with ads…they funded much of the consumer internet. And if done well, they can be useful,” he clarified.

“But in the realm of assistants, and if you think of the chatbot as an assistant that’s meant to be helpful — and ideally, in my mind, as they become more powerful, the kind of technology that works for you as the individual…there is a question about how ads fit into that model?… You want to have trust in your assistant, so how does that work?” he questioned.

Reiterating some early comments from another Davos interview, Hassabis also said that Google didn’t have “any current plans” to do ads in its AI chatbot. Instead, the company would monitor the situation to see how users respond.

Of course, we’ve already seen consumer backlash to the idea of ads infiltrating people’s conversations with AI assistants. When OpenAI last month began exploring a feature that suggested apps to try during users’ chats, for instance, people reacted negatively, saying these suggestions felt like intrusive ads. Shortly after, OpenAI turned off the app suggestions, which it claimed were not actually ads as they had “no financial component.”

But whether or not money had exchanged hands was not what made users angry. Rather, it was how the app suggestions degraded the quality of the experience.

That’s something that also concerns Hassabis, his remarks suggested.

He explained that using a chatbot is a much different experience than using Google Search. With Search, Google already understands a user’s intent, so it can show potentially useful ads. Chatbots, on the other hand, are meant to become helpful digital assistants that know about you and can help you with many aspects of your life, he said.

“I think that’s very different from the search use case. So I think there, that has to be thought through very carefully,” he added.

Making Gemini more useful to each user is also the focus of newly launched personalization features announced today for Google’s AI Mode. Now, users can opt into having Gemini’s AI tap into their Gmail and Photos for tailored responses in Search’s AI Mode, similar to how Gemini’s app just added a Personal Intelligence feature that can reference users’ Gmail, Photos, Search, and YouTube history.

While personalized ad targeting is a business that sustains the free web, pushing an ad on the user while they’re in a conversation with an AI assistant can feel off-putting. It’s why customers rejected Amazon’s earlier attempts to infuse ads into its Alexa experience — they wanted an assistant, not a personal shopper hawking things for them to buy.

Hassabis said he wasn’t feeling top-down pressure to force ads into the AI product, either, though he admitted there may be a way to do them right later on.

“We don’t feel any immediate pressure to make knee-jerk decisions like that — I think that’s been the history of what we’ve done at DeepMind — is be very scientific, and rigorous, and thoughtful about each step that we take — be that the technology itself or the product,” he noted.

In Princeton, New Jersey, a short stroll from the university you have heard of, there lies a little campus home to the Institute for Advanced Study. It was founded in 1930 not to confer degrees nor—God forbid!—to make money, nor even to conduct research toward any end in particular. The institute proclaims that its purpose is “the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.”

Founder Abraham Flexner reckoned that brilliant minds, once freed to pursue “useless satisfactions,” would stumble upon discoveries of “undreamed-of utility,” as he wrote in a magazine a few years into the institute’s work. It seems to have worked for Albert Einstein, who had an office there. J. Robert Oppenheimer, too.

Enjoy this week’s useless satisfactions. I look forward to your theory of everything the week after.

Find last week’s questions here, and to get Atlantic Trivia in your inbox every day, sign up for The Atlantic Daily.

And by the way, did you know that the vaunted Athenians, inventors of democracy, most commonly selected their political officeholders by chance? Bronze tokens representing the adult men of Athens would be slotted into a carved-stone device called the kleroterion, then dice would be repeatedly dropped into the contraption to rule out tokens until only the number required to hold office remained.

The proper poli-sci term for this is sortition, which also applies to how the United States selects people for jury duty today. But imagine the rest of U.S. democracy working like that: You’re tossing out your junk mail when you notice a letter from the feds—congrats, the big government Plinko board has decided you’re serving one year in Congress. Good luck!

How did you do? Come back tomorrow for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that—speaking of snow monsters—the U.S. State Department in 1959 issued guidance on yeti expeditions? It informed Americans who wished to hunt for the abominable snowman that they would have to comply with certain rules set by Nepal: They needed to pay for a permit, they had to share any photographic evidence they found, and they were allowed to capture the yeti alive but could kill it only “in an emergency arising out of self defence.”

Alas, this did not mean that State officials believed in the monster. Rather, they were trying to show their support for Nepalese sovereignty—and thus keep the country out of the clutches of a boogeyman that scared Americans even more than the yeti: communism.

And by the way, did you know that throughout the history of the Nobel Prizes, there have been years so turbulent that the Peace Prize committee determined not to confer an award, even as other categories went on?

This happened in a few of the interwar years as Nazi Germany rearmed, Italy invaded Ethiopia, and peace generally disintegrated. It was also the case for the years of World War I, with the exception of 1917, when the committee recognized the Red Cross for its humanitarian aid. (All of the Nobel Prizes were suspended during the early years of World War II.)

The circumstances were a bit different in 1948, when the committee ruled that “there was no suitable living candidate.” The clear message was that the award—which by rule cannot be given posthumously—should have gone to Mahatma Gandhi, assassinated earlier that year.</div>

            <h2>What the Greenland Crisis Teaches Europe About Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/greenland-crisis-trump-diplomacy-nato/685715/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Yesterday afternoon, Donald Trump announced that he had “formed the framework of a future deal” with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, raising hopes in Europe that the Greenland crisis may have reached an end. The framework reportedly respects Denmark’s sovereignty over Greenland and focuses instead on beefing up America’s military presence in the territory, reaching a deal on crucial minerals, and increasing cooperation on both Arctic security and Trump’s Golden Dome missile-defense system.

The worst of the crisis may have passed, at least for now. But the past few days underscore the extraordinary stakes of a debate among Europe’s leaders that remains unresolved. Should they take a conciliatory approach toward Trump, in the hope of coaxing him to their side? Or should they stand firm when he threatens them, imposing costs on him even if it means risking their relationship with his administration?

The lesson that Europe is likely to draw from the past year—and particularly from the Greenland fiasco—is that it must do both. It needs Trump whisperers who will flatter him, but it also needs to pack its velvet gloves with steel. If Europe’s leaders only praise him, Trump is likely to ignore them when convenient, rip up any deals they have made, and take whatever he can when the opportunity arises. If they show only toughness, they risk prompting him to withdraw from NATO or rupture the transatlantic alliance in other ways.

Vivian Salama: Trump wants to be the new Polk

The past week helps demonstrate these dynamics. Just a few days ago, Trump refused to rule out the use of force in taking Greenland, and he promised to impose tariffs on eight countries that recently sent troops to the territory for a security mission, even though the deployment had been fully coordinated with the U.S. military. Then, in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos yesterday morning, Trump lambasted Europe: “If it wasn’t for us, you’d all be speaking German and a little bit of Japanese perhaps.” He reiterated his argument that “no nation or group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States.” “That’s our territory,” he claimed. But he disavowed the use of force, saying instead that he wanted to acquire Greenland through “immediate negotiations.”

This was seen as a major concession, but it prompted further questions. What happens when Denmark refuses to transfer ownership? Will force be back on the table? Senator Lindsey Graham, who had been meeting with European officials in Davos, stoked further anxiety with a social-media post soon after Trump’s speech, in which he demanded that Denmark give the United States the legal title to Greenland.

Just an hour after his speech, however, Trump rescinded his tariff threat and announced that the aforementioned framework had been reached. The New York Times reported that European officials had discussed granting America sovereignty over Greenland’s U.S. military bases. But a European official with direct knowledge of the negotiations—and who was not authorized to speak publicly—told me this was not part of the deal.

If the framework sticks, it will be a triumph of Danish diplomacy. For the past year, Copenhagen has offered to work with the Trump administration on all of its policy demands. But it imposed two red lines and never wavered: The Danes wouldn’t compromise on territorial integrity or Greenland’s right to self-determination. Otherwise, though, the president had wide latitude to get what he wanted.

Many other European leaders, by contrast, have responded to Trump’s repeated bullying over the past year with nearly unconditional accommodation and praise, while working behind the scenes to moderate his policies. They agreed to his demands to increase their defense spending to 5 percent of their GDP. Their response to his tariffs last year was minimal. Rutte, the NATO leader, even called Trump Europe’s “daddy.”

This soft approach is easy to ridicule, but the Europeans have been able to point to some successes since deploying it. Trump stopped talking about leaving NATO. He agreed to sell weapons to Ukraine and provide intelligence support. And the approach prepared the way for yesterday’s announcement that Rutte himself had been the one to broker the deal with Trump that defused the crisis.

The framework appears to respect Copenhagen’s red lines, which raises the question: Why did Trump suggest he would finally agree to it? After all, it was on offer for most of the past year.

The main answer is that Denmark made clear that it was not going to back down in negotiations, leaving Trump with few options. If he had used force in Greenland, he could find himself in a war with one of America’s closest allies. Such a war would be clearly illegal under U.S. law, and it could trigger a civil-military crisis, presenting military officers with plainly unlawful orders.

Other European countries also played a key role in increasing the potential costs of Trump’s aggression. The European Union agreed to impose $93 billion tariffs on the U.S. if the ones Trump had threatened actually took effect. And some leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, suggested using the Anti-Coercion Instrument, also known as the European “bazooka,” which allows for a unified trade-policy response to coercive behavior like Trump’s. The Europeans were divided on invoking the instrument; some worried that Trump might escalate and pull out of NATO altogether. But their serious discussion of it suggested to the president that he might run a genuine risk.

And then there were the financial markets. According to Treasury Department data, EU members and NATO allies hold more than $3.31 trillion in U.S. debt—more than triple what China holds. On Tuesday, the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond reached its highest level since August, sparking concern that investors would sell off U.S. Treasuries if Trump escalated the conflict.

Moreover, the prospect of controlling Greenland is deeply unpopular among Americans. One poll conducted earlier this month found that 75 percent of them oppose any attempt to take over the territory. And more than a dozen Republican senators made public statements warning against it.

The Greenland crisis was in many ways the sum of Europeans’ fears about Trump, raising the specter of an attack on a NATO ally and the dissolution of the alliance. For the moment, the crisis seems to have been averted. But Trump is too fickle a negotiator for Europe to take comfort in yesterday’s announcement. To keep him from reescalating or threatening them on other issues in the future, they may well follow some advice from an unlikely source: J. D. Vance.

“I think a lot of European nations were right about our invasion of Iraq,” Vance said last year. “Frankly, if the Europeans had been a little more independent, and a little more willing to stand up, then maybe we could have saved the entire world from the strategic disaster that was the American-led invasion of Iraq.” Vance continued, “I don’t want the Europeans to just do whatever the Americans tell them to do. I don’t think it’s in their interest, and I don’t think it’s in our interests, either.”</div>

            <h2>Trump Casually Denigrates NATO’s War Dead</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/trump-denmark-afghanistan-fatalities-nato/685716/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Benni Schmidt Pedersen lives on a small farm in Denmark, where it’s quiet and he can hear if anyone is coming down the gravel road to his home. He’s stricken with PTSD from his time as a soldier in Afghanistan, where five members of his 130-person company died in the American-led war against the Taliban.

I called him today to read him a quote from President Trump about America’s NATO allies: “We’ve never needed them,” Trump said in a Fox Business interview at the World Economic Forum, in Davos. “We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan or this or that. And they did. They stayed a little back, little off the front lines.&quot;

First Pedersen laughed. Then he tried to brush it off—classic Trump bluster. “Why doesn’t it surprise me that he’s saying that?”

Finally, his voice dropped an octave. “That’s bullshit,” he said.

It is, indeed, bullshit. The United States invoked Article 5, the mutual-defense clause of NATO’s founding charter, the day after the September 11 attacks. It remains the only time in NATO’s nearly 80-year history that the obligation of common defense has been activated. All 28 members of the alliance at the time sent soldiers to Afghanistan. Many never returned.

An estimated 3,500 soldiers from NATO countries died in Afghanistan. The United States suffered the most losses in absolute terms: Nearly 2,500 U.S. service members were killed in the 20-year war. But per capita, Denmark suffered even more severe losses, burying 43 soldiers in a population, at the time, of about 5.5 million.

Other NATO members sacrificed, too. Britain lost about 450 soldiers, Canada more than 150. Other small countries, like Denmark, weren’t spared: Estonia lost nine soldiers. Norway, 10. Czech Republic, 14. Romania, 27.

Why does this matter now? Because Trump has been disparaging Europe’s contributions to NATO, and Denmark’s in particular, as he threatened to take over part of the Nordic country’s territory. Yesterday, he avoided doing what many feared he might. He told an audience in Davos that he wouldn’t use military force to acquire his coveted Greenland, which would have put an abrupt end to the alliance. But he made his disdain for NATO clear: “The United States is treated very unfairly by NATO. I want to tell you that. When you think about it, nobody can dispute it. We give so much, and we get so little in return.”

That prompted a bit of fact-checking by NATO’s secretary-general, Mark Rutte. Privately, Rutte met with Trump and convinced him to accept a framework for negotiations that could see an enhanced U.S. military presence on Greenland as well as stepped-up NATO efforts in the broader Arctic region. Both are options that Denmark and other alliance members have been open to, and in fact encouraged, all along. In a public portion of their meeting, Rutte challenged Trump’s account of NATO’s steadfastness. “There is one thing I heard you say yesterday and today. You were not absolutely sure that the Europeans would come to the rescue of the U.S. if you will be attacked,” Rutte told Trump. “Let me tell you, they will. And they did in Afghanistan.”

Rutte continued: “For every two Americans who paid the ultimate price, there was one soldier from another NATO country who did not come back to his family.”

Trump, whose bone-spurs diagnosis in 1968 made him exempt from service in Vietnam, seems not to have taken kindly to the history lesson. So he offered his own, make-believe history of NATO activity in Afghanistan, in an interview with Fox’s Maria Bartiromo. The notion that soldiers from NATO allies “stayed a little back, little off the front lines” is false, Pedersen, the Danish veteran, told me. He deployed in 2010, the deadliest year for NATO forces, with some 700 fatalities. (Trump was hosting two seasons of his Apprentice TV series that year and toying publicly with a presidential bid.)

Pedersen’s company worked in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan. Five of the company’s members were killed, including Sophia Bruun, the first female soldier to die in combat in Danish history, whose service I wrote about last week. Seventy-eight were injured, Pedersen said. They faced off with Taliban fighters nearly every other day.

“We were on the front lines, the same as the Americans,” he said. “That was our job.”</div>

            <h2>The Oscars Are Rewarding Hollywood’s Big Bets</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/oscar-nominations-2026-sinners-one-battle-after-another/685714/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This morning’s Oscar nominations capped a year marked by a stunning run of critical and commercial success for one of Hollywood’s biggest—and most discussed—studios. Warner Bros. dominated proceedings with big hauls for One Battle After Another and Sinners. The latter, a vampire story set in 1930s Mississippi, made Academy history by becoming the most nominated film of all time: It earned 16 nods, two higher than the previous record holders, Titanic, La La Land, and All About Eve. The Academy Awards are commonly defined these days by a struggle for relevance, making the fact that such high-quality, non-franchise movies from a major studio connected with audiences a considerable boon—especially after last year’s show, which celebrated a swath of more inscrutable indie pictures.

That success still came with familiar existential baggage for the film industry. Warner Bros., while making creative bets that paid off, has been embroiled in high-stakes merger drama for several months. Netflix and Paramount have both vied to purchase the studio, which in either case would create a corporate behemoth likely less inclined to take the risks that lead to a One Battle, or a Sinners, or even a Weapons (which nabbed a Best Supporting Actress nod for Amy Madigan, who played the antagonist). No matter what the future holds, though, the Warner Bros. triumph can’t be undermined: It helped define 2025 as a year in which movies coaxed adult audiences to theaters by blending action and spectacle with more challenging, trenchant storytelling.

Other big nomination-getters included Chloé Zhao’s Hamnet, an adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s novel that especially drew plaudits for its emotionally demanding performances. (Jessie Buckley, who plays a grief-stricken mother, has been the presumed front-runner for Best Actress since awards season began.) A24’s gamble on a big-budget table-tennis epic paid off, with Marty Supreme earning nine nominations; not only has the film become the indie studio’s highest-grossing release ever, but its star, Timothée Chalamet, is also tipped for Best Actor. Meanwhile, Apple’s hit sports drama F1, which collected four nods, including Best Picture, is the closest thing to a typical blockbuster contender. Two box-office smashes that once seemed like guarantees, meanwhile, are absent from Best Picture, namely Avatar: Fire and Ash and Wicked: For Good; the sequel to last year’s Oscar-winning Wicked blanked entirely this year. Handing out nominations to a film headed up by a big name like Brad Pitt—as well as several of his movie-star peers, such as One Battle After Another’s lead, Leonardo DiCaprio; Michael B. Jordan, who plays two roles in Sinners; and Emma Stone, for Yorgos Lanthimos’s acidic satire Bugonia—guarantees a glitzier show, which is vital to the point of the Oscars: The ceremony is essentially an advertisement for the act of theatergoing.

In recent years, the Academy Awards have been shaped by the more international and art-house tilt of the nominations. This run began with Parasite’s Best Picture win in 2020, and perhaps peaked last year with a slew of less commercial nominees. The controversial French musical Emilia Pérez led the field; the indie dramas Anora and The Brutalist picked up several major nods, as did the gory horror satire The Substance; Anora took Best Picture. Meanwhile, bigger franchise hits such as Wicked and Dune: Part Two were relegated to wins in the technical categories. In decades past, winning the Cannes Film Festival’s top prize, the coveted Palme D’or, was of little relevance to later awards success. But of late, it’s been a vital indicator: Anora and Parasite used it as a springboard to Oscar glory, and fellow Palme d’Or victors such as Triangle of Sadness and Anatomy of a Fall ended up with awards-season success.

With that track record in mind, the indie powerhouse Neon snapped up every big Cannes winner that it could, including this year’s Palme winner, It Was Just an Accident; the Brazilian period drama The Secret Agent; the nail-biting thriller Sirāt, a co-production from France and Spain; and the director Joachim Trier’s Norwegian family dramedy, Sentimental Value, his follow-up to the well-regarded The Worst Person in the World. Some pundits wondered whether Neon had gone overboard with its awards slate, but all four movies were recognized in the International Feature Film category and elsewhere; The Secret Agent and Sentimental Value also made it to Best Picture. Sentimental Value was particularly beloved, earning nine nominations, while Wagner Moura’s Best Actor nod for The Secret Agent makes him the first Brazilian ever recognized in that category.

There were a few other surprises, particularly in the acting categories. Among the nominees for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress were two Sinners stars, Wunmi Mosaku and Delroy Lindo—the latter a Hollywood veteran finally getting his first nod. Kate Hudson sneaked into the Best Actress category for Song Sung Blue, an inspirational true-story musical drama; the One Battle After Another ingénue, Chase Infiniti, meanwhile, was locked out. Hamnet, which won Best Motion Picture—Drama at the Golden Globes earlier this month, slightly under-indexed; Paul Mescal missed out on Supporting Actor despite noms at several other awards ceremonies this year. The film also missed out on key technical nods, such as Cinematography and Editing. And in the Best Picture lineup, Netflix’s meditative drama Train Dreams earned a spot, whereas two of the streamer’s splashier movies—the George Clooney–starring Jay Kelly and the latest Knives Out sequel, Wake Up Dead Man—didn’t make the cut.

Now the nearly two-month trudge to the ceremony itself begins. Although there’s likely to be the usual hand-wringing in the press about plateauing viewership, the Oscars’ long-term future has already been secured: YouTube will own the broadcast rights starting in 2029. That deal will keep funding the show, guarantee a wider audience, and banish any larger concerns about Nielsen ratings as the traditional broadcast model continues to go extinct.

This year’s awards narrative was already feeling especially ossified. One Battle After Another has been the front-runner since sweeping the critics’ prizes and winning four Golden Globes, including for Best Motion Picture—Musical or Comedy. Sinners’ huge nomination haul, however, will throw it back into the mix as One Battle’s biggest potential rival—rewarding Warner Bros.’s year of risk-taking mightily, regardless of what happens.</div>

            <h2>The Upside of Professional Rejection</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/professional-rejection-work-upside/685713/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">My relationship with rejection, professionally speaking, is complicated. I’m a writer, and although I’ve been hearing “thanks, but no thanks” in response to pitches since the ’90s, that hasn’t made the no’s easy; I still smart when I think of story ideas that editors swatted away years ago.

It’s normal to hear “no” and jump to the conclusion that something is fundamentally wrong—with one’s work or, worse, with oneself. As I’ve aged, however, I’ve found that the disappointment that comes after being rebuffed doesn’t last as long as it used to. In one recent instance, after a longtime collaborator rejected a project I was passionate about, the feeling of dejection never even arrived. Instead, the “no” energized me to find someone else who believed in the idea.

Since then, I’ve grown curious about why I responded the way I did—and about whether, in this new year, I might be able to reframe how I see rejection entirely: not as a final answer, but as a provocation or an opportunity.

How people process rejection is tied to culture. I grew up in the United States, which has long espoused an ethos of individualism and grit, so I’ve been surrounded by messages about the “power of positive thinking” and exhortations that people should push through dispiriting dismissals—or, as Ronald Reagan put it, “try and try again.” That attitude, if you can summon it, can be invigorating. But it doesn’t come naturally to everyone. And some people, no matter how hard they try, are rejected not because of their shortcomings but because of influences—political, societal—that they may have little power to overcome. Alison Kinney, the author of the forthcoming book United States of Rejection: A Story of Love, Hate, and Hope, told me that she worries about the notion that failing to overcome obstacles is proof of a lack of willpower, given how much is out of a person’s control. When people are rejected and blame themselves, they risk experiencing their situation as a sort of double failure.

People with certain personalities seem better suited to processing setbacks than others. Daniel Pink, the author of the 2009 book Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, told me that, in his experience, the people who handle rejection best are typically confident in their ability to succeed, high in autonomy, and sure of who they are. For these people, rejection can even be a marker of distinction, Pink said. Their attitude might be: “You rejected me because you don’t understand that I’m unique.”

A 2012 study on the way rejection affects creativity echoed that finding. In a series of experiments, the authors repeatedly found that being rejected could spur people to be more creative, but only if those people had an “independent self-concept”—that is, if they were the type of people who prefer to remain “distinctly separate” from others, and to “emphasize personal goals over group goals.” The authors theorized that because such people don’t feel a strong need to belong, failure might not sting so much, and the opportunity to distinguish themselves might be extra appealing. This resonated with me: I’ve never cared much about being part of an “in-group,” and I’ve found that when I ignore external markers of success, I’m more likely to measure myself against myself and focus on my goals, not others’ expectations.

The context in which a professional rejection plays out can also help determine how someone responds. It matters, for example, what a person’s relationship is to the project they’re working on, Ayelet Fishbach, a behavioral-science professor at the University of Chicago, told me. If the endeavor feels central to their identity and they are deeply committed to it, they’re probably more likely to keep going regardless of other people’s opinions. That may be why I was so motivated after my recent rejection; the project was a memoir I’d been dreaming of writing for years.

The identity of the person who does the rejecting might also shape the outcome, Samir Nurmohamed, an associate professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. He described a study he ran, in which participants were asked to complete a simple online task and were informed, beforehand, both how well an observer expected them to perform and how likely that observer was to be correct in their prediction. Nurmohamed found that when the participants were told that the observer wasn’t credible, hearing that they had low expectations actually boosted performance, perhaps because the participant wanted to work hard to prove the observer wrong. When the participants learned that the observer’s opinion was respected, though, their performance was more likely to falter; the participants were still generally motivated to prove their naysayers wrong, but their anxiety tended to make them less successful.

The people most likely to push through rejection tend to share a specific quality: They “are willing to embrace discomfort,” Fishbach said. These people, she explained, have the ability to reframe that sense of discomfort as growth—as “a sign that I’m pushing myself, that I am doing something new, that I’m developing as a person.” After all, at its core, rejection is just feedback, Pink told me. It can provide an opportunity to approach a situation differently or at least to learn something.

Nurmohamed said that for those trying to overcome self-doubt, a helpful tactic is to recall moments in the past when they’ve succeeded despite others’ doubts. In 2021, he co-authored a paper in which several groups of job seekers at reemployment centers in Philadelphia were asked to come up with various types of stories about themselves. The researchers found that those who were asked to tell “underdog narratives”—accounts of times when they believed in themselves and others didn’t—were more likely to find employment than those who’d been asked to tell any other type of story. They speculated that this was because the “underdog narratives” reminded the job seekers that they could succeed even when obstacles were in the way, and because the stories highlighted how much control a person has over their life.

This doesn’t mean that people should always push through in the face of negative professional feedback. As Pink reminded me, sometimes a rejection is worth taking seriously. Though a person who soldiers on through difficulty may seem stubborn, or at least admirably persistent, they’re not necessarily smart. “I want to cheer for those people from the sidelines, but sometimes they’re wrong,” he said. “They could just be escalating their commitment to a failing course of action, digging the hole even deeper.” Ryan Holiday, the author of The Obstacle Is the Way, told me he also worries about those who use others’ skepticism as a primary motivation to succeed. In that way lies madness, or at least chronic acrimony. He pointed to Michael Jordan’s 2009 Basketball Hall of Fame speech, in which Jordan made a series of ungenerous remarks about people he felt had slighted him over the years. “Here you have the most successful athlete of all time, and he’s using the crowning moment of his career to prove that he’s still haunted by these grievances,” Holiday said. It was “tragic.”

It’s also understandable. Being rejected hurts, and finding success may not erase the emotional residue of all those prior rebuffs. But a conversation with Jessica Bacal, a writer and educator, reframed for me how one might work through the soreness. Five years ago, Bacal told me, she received a particularly painful professional rejection, and she decided to process her feelings through writing. Eventually, she came up with an idea for a book: The Rejection That Changed My Life, which featured interviews with dozens of women about their professional rejections and was published in 2021. She told me she now sees that first rejection as a “gift.”

I know what she means. The worst no’s can be confidence-shattering. But for people ready to respond not with hardheadedness but with strength and grace, they also offer a rare chance: to pick up the pieces of a broken ego and rebuild.

            <div id="article-text">There’s a double helix in my local Sephora. It’s roughly the size and shape of a soda can, and it is accompanied by a placard referencing patents and peptides, as if in a science fair. It’s trying to sell me a hair mask.

Online, the company responsible for this display describes itself as a “biology-first haircare brand, powered by biotech.” It practices “biomimetic hairscience,” and, thanks to “a decade of complex research into the bioscience of hair,” has patented a peptide that repairs hair “at a molecular level across multiple types of bonds including polypeptide chains and disulfide bonds.” I have no idea what any of this means. The mask costs $75.

You can put on probiotic leggings and a patented bra, and then you can apply lipstick containing hyaluronic acids “with differentiated molecular weights” and slather your face in a “triple-lipid peptide cream” developed by self-identified “skintellectuals.” You can also eat your science, by way of “clinically-studied key herbs, adaptogens, and minerals—at amounts informed by research.” If you get thirsty, you can have water that has been chemically manipulated with extra hydrogen atoms, just in case two aren’t enough for you. Even decades-old products have been newly recast as miracles of modern chemistry: After years of selling itself purely impressionistically, via close-up shots of hot athletes dripping sweat and swilling neon liquid, Gatorade has recently begun touting itself as “Lab Tested.” As the wellness movement collides with the supercharged demands of selling products in a crowded market, science-speak seems to have invaded every crevice of the fashion, beauty, and food industries.

Many of the claims these products make are perfectly legitimate, if a bit goofy; others are transparently nonsense. And dubious, science-flecked marketing claims have existed about as long as marketing has. But they used to be comparatively unsophisticated, and quite literal: Cheerios contain a certain amount of fiber, and fiber is good for you, thus Cheerios are good for you and you should buy them. A skin-care product is superior to its competitors because it has more vitamin C, and vitamin C is good for your skin. These ads were informed but plainspoken, employing the simple logic of cause and effect, inputs and outputs, using words most people recognized. They talked, basically, like a family-medicine doctor.

Today’s ads, by contrast, talk like the Ph.D. kind of doctor, using polysyllabic words and alluding to things viewable only under a microscope. They seem designed not to illuminate but to obfuscate, to impart the veneer of science at such a high level that people will never really ask how, or if, it works. Almost no one is looking up a peer-reviewed study, or spelunking through the patent database, to make sure the claims on their package of goo are accurate. “People like buying products that are, quote, research backed,” Neil Lewis Jr., a behavioral scientist at Cornell, told me. “But most people, they’re not equipped to actually evaluate those claims. They don’t have the time or expertise, often, and so they sort of just look for some heuristic cue, and that’s good enough.” What science-washed products promise—more than what they actually promise on the package—is that someone else did the work for you.

For years, the trend in consumption was beautiful but useless trash. Now, Stephen Zagor, who teaches courses in food business at NYU and Columbia, told me, “science is the new it thing.” For companies, nodding to state-of-the-art technology and papering a corporate website in clip art of molecules is an indication that their product is the best, empirically. And for consumers, drinking a soda that went to grad school is a signal too—of savviness and responsibility. It’s cultural capital: If others “see us eating a food item that has been surrounded by scientific discussions, people think automatically we know what we’re talking about, when we don’t have a clue either,” Zagor said. “Science makes ignorance feel smart.”

Many companies do actually employ professionals—cosmetic chemists, food scientists. But science in the private interest doesn’t necessarily work like science in the public interest. It tends to operate on a different timescale, and to use different yardsticks. The scientists who work for corporations need to be sure that their products provide enough short-term benefit to keep people buying, while abiding by consumer regulations. They are employed to ask questions the market wants answered, ideally as quickly as possible.

The irony here, of course, is that this is happening at a time when institutional science, the kind that doesn’t come with next-day shipping, is under considerable threat. The federal government has embarked on a concerted, and largely successful, effort to undermine, discredit, and defund serious scientific research at any opportunity. Influencers and pundits have sought to cast scientists themselves as elitists and liars, in an effort that appears to be working: Nearly one in four Americans has little or no confidence in scientists to act in the public’s best interest. Thousands of scientific minds have, by brute force or something subtler, left the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and academia. Their absence leaves a vacuum. Some of these people worked on projects that couldn’t be sold; others worked to regulate the ones that could. Sometimes, when I am feeling particularly pessimistic, I worry that we are approaching a world in which scientists are employed not by independent institutions but only by companies—a world in which science itself is marketing copy, and little more.</div>

This is the sort of garbage that is supposed to be taken as an indicator that the outlet publishing it is not worth your time.  I just wish msmash and BeauHD had the sense to recognize that.

Are they saying that we should dismantle Hoover dam?

LA is looking at a medium term issue. Once the level of Lake Meade drops to the &quot;critical&quot; level drastic curtailment happens. Not sure exactly how long before that happens.

Another issue at least with Mexico City and Tokyo has been sinking due to underground water use. As to how much should an average urban dweller get is up for grabs. Here is a old study (pre gaza war) of what a Palestinian might get. (https://www.europarl

According to this https://magazine.viterbi.usc.e...  [usc.edu]

LA only gets 14% of its water from Colorado River (aka Lake Meade)

Most of their water is from in-state, routed from Northern California to So-Cal.  Assuming California&#39;s population continues to level off, dip somewhat I think LA will be ok.   Also worth mentioning the State is trying to add more reservoir capacity (https://sitesproject.org/) in a large empty field, just needs to get through the lawsuits:

We have a lot of water, but it&#39;s the wrong &quot;type&quot;. Many of those major cities are near a coast, so how about building some desalination plants. What? That&#39;s too expensive? Then either stop using so much or stop complaining. (For example, maybe stop watering hay, alfalfa, etc with ground water in stressed areas and grow that stuff elsewhere that isn&#39;t so stressed; or build a large scale purification system to treat waste water and make it potable.) I know my view comes across as harsh, but we have a technica

America is hellbent on seeing people die, aren&#39;t they?

They can both make their investment back and save lives.  This is basic capitalism in fact.

Because America&#39;s privatized, for-profit healthcare system allows for way bigger price markups than the rest of the world&#39;s responsibly managed public healthcare systems.

What should have been said is that &quot;you can&#39;t make a return on investment without the US Govt. mandating the use of our product&quot;. Which is a very different issue altogether.I read it more like &quot;You can&#39;t make a return on vaccine investment without the R&D being massively subsidized by government grants.&quot;

Actually, the costs of the trials are high enough that I&#39;m not sure they CAN make a profit without US Govt support.  And the FDA was never willing to really recognize trials done by foreign health agencies.  (Sometimes reasonably.  Other times, not.)

What did Fox talk about this morning that makes you think the USA is suddenly getting screwed on international trade?

Vaccines (and 90% of drugs) are cheap in the rest of the world.A different perspective is that the high prices being paid by US consumers is effectively subsidizing sales overseas where governments negotiate aggressively. If the US began to seriously negotiate as these foreign governments did, then we&#39;d probably see the overall vaccine prices across the rest of the globe rise.

The US doesn&#39;t recognize trials conducted for foreign health agencies.  If that were to change, the &quot;pay for everyone else&quot; might change, too.

however they make that profit through saving lives.LOL!  +5 Funny!

however they make that profit through saving lives.

A socialist pharma lab could work quite well while paying the scientists who do the actual work good money, it would just have sane pay for executive management and a nonexistent marketing budget. That&#39;s what pharma companies spend most of their money on, marketing and executive pay:

https://marylandmatters.org/20... [marylandmatters.org]

https://www.theguardian.com/wo... [theguardian.com]

Nor is there anything wrong with that.  I&#39;d wager saving lives isn&#39;t your purpose either.

For a private company, making a profit is necessary for continued existence.  Companies that don&#39;t make a profit get bought out and liquidated for the value of their assets.

The alternative would be to nationalize drug development -- socialized medical research.   Or there&#39;s just waiting and hoping for the best, which is what we&#39;re headed toward.

Thank heaven the dysentery took my wife before the plague had a chance.

Vastly?  No.  I mean, vaccines have been around for less time than municipal water and sewer systems, so maybe, but that&#39;s mostly a factor of timing.  If you calculate the ongoing impact, it&#39;s almost a wash.

Sanitation probably saves several million people from dying every year in first-world countries.  That&#39;s a guess based on scaling the number who die today in the third world up to the number of people in the world, which is to say the number could be 3 million or 30 million, but it&#39;s anybody&#39;s guess where it falls in that range.

But that doesn&#39;t negate the value of saving a third of a million people every year from becoming paralyzed by polio, or saving a million people per year from measles deaths.

Sanitation probably saves *slightly* more lives than all vaccines combined, but probably by only a single-digit factor.  Vaccines save a lot of lives, too.

Well, you&#39;re correct that sanitation is more important than vaccines.  That doesn&#39;t make vaccines unimportant.

I have been listening to this &#39;not all Americans&#39; handwashing for a decade at this point, if not more. Seems like it started during the Tea Party days. And you know what? I&#39;m getting kinda tired of hearing it. You are more concerned with pointing out it&#39;s not your fault than trying to FIX it.

This. If you only want to think about politics once every four years and take no responsibility for what happens in between, Trump is what you get - before it gets worse.

You pretty much just have to drive in traffic to experience that most Americans are selfish assholes who&#39;d happily run you off the road if they could do so without damaging their own vehicle.  It&#39;s no surprise many of them also vote the same way they drive.

Don&#39;t blame all Americans for the choices of American leadership. Trump is off doing a bunch of stuff no one wanted and which he didn&#39;t campaign on.That was only a somewhat valid excuse during Trump&#39;s first term.  It was also not entirely unreasonable to believe that a vote for Trump was just a protest vote against Hillary, since pollsters were claiming she had it in the bag.This time around though, people who voted for him knew exactly what they&#39;d be getting and absolutely do own it.  Every awful, stupid thing this administration is doing is precisely the kind of America they voted for.

&quot;You cannot make a return on investment if you don&#39;t have access to the U.S. market, ...&quot;
&#39;Cause that&#39;s where we over-charge the most.

Also, I imagine a ROI is still possible if look for it over a longer period of time.

I&#39;d be curious what their investment looks like. Did they forget to subtract the grants, etc., that they were given?
I read an article a while ago that said companies compare ROI to develop, market and sell a drug (before the patent expires) to what they&#39;d get by just investing the money in the markets over that time and if they think the markets will provide a greater / faster return then it doesn&#39;t make financial sense to develop something.  Don&#39;t know if that&#39;s actually true, but makes sense from a financial / shareholder standpoint because - bottom line - the company is there to make money.

A top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been condemned for his remarks that rampant measles outbreaks in the U.S., and increasing concern that America could lose its longstanding elimination status, were the “cost of doing business” in a global economy.

https://www.the-independent.co... [the-independent.com]

I&#39;m really not sure what easily preventable deaths have to do with the economy.

FWIW, measles rarely killed people of European ancestry.  Mutilated them, perhaps.  But if your ancestors weren&#39;t winnowed by it...

(OTOH, I could be wrong.  The song &quot;The Irish Rover&quot; indicates that measles was a sever killer.)  (The statistics I found talked about deaths in a global context...and it damn well WAS deadly among those with non-European ancestry.  There&#39;s probably more details involved, but I don&#39;t know them.)

It&#39;s hard to work up any enthusiasm for defending big pharma, but he&#39;s not wrong. The current administration is hell bent on turning back the clock on medical advances of the past century. This will be difficult to undo and many people will suffer in the meantime.

If you&#39;re a big corporation worried about your future profits, maybe flex a little bit of that Citizens United muscle and support the candidates who aren&#39;t going to be so bad for your business (and that means taking a long hard look at where they stand on issues beyond just &quot;lower taxes/less regulation&quot;).  Another absolutely brilliant self-own was Musk&#39;s support of Trump.  If one of your largest businesses builds

There&#39;s no market because we have a government full of anti vaccine morons.

That stops people from getting vaccines because? It forces them to pay for it out-of-pocket.  Combine that with the idiots up top that will say dumb shit like the HPV vaccine promotes risky behavior in our youth and you&#39;ve got a recipe for bad things happening.

I don&#39;t support the anti-vax bullshit, and you&#39;re certainly right to call that out, but... I&#39;ve been saying for years that we are subsidizing the rest of the world when it comes to pharma because the profit taking is happening in the US.  I don&#39;t object to subsidizing e.g. sub-Saharan Africa, southern Asia, etc, but I do object to subsidizing first world nations.  This article appears to prove that this is, in fact, the case--if approval chances being hazy in the US means there is no point to pharma develop

When I was a child, the vaccine schedule included around 25 inoculations by the time you were 18. Today it includes almost 90, yet population health has declined. Make it make sense.

diabetes, hypertension, obesity, mental health conditions  https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/a... [nih.gov] It&#39;s not the vaccines. People are not dying from the 90 or so inoculations or the diseases they inoculate against.We&#39;re addicted to cheap and plentiful food. Our favorite foods are butter, cheese, refined wheat, cured meats.High calorie, high fat, high sugar, low nutrition. And alcohol. Don&#39;t forget to have 3 beers with that 10,000 calorie pizza.People drink 10 cans of beer a day. That&#39;s 2000+ calories on beer alone.

Without the US government telling the public they need a vaccine there is no market?In the wonderful &quot;healthcare&quot; system we have here the drugs and vaccines that our insurance companies will cover are indirectly dictated by the government. More specifically to the point, if a vaccine isn&#39;t on the &quot;recommended&quot; list insurance won&#39;t cover it.  Of course people can still get the vaccine but it will be paid out of pocket, and convincing someone they need to pay for something that protects them from a long-shot risk is a tough sell.

Let&#39;s take a simple example, COVID. The vaccine, even at full out-of-pocket prices, is something like $75.

I participated in a Moderna study last winter for an mRNA flu vaccine. The benefit of this would have been that they can turn around mRNA vaccines so much faster than conventional vaccines, so they&#39;d have far better accuracy in targeting the vaccine to the current variant of the flu. (Unlike this year, when the vaccine has only a 30% or so match to what&#39;s actually circulating, as I understand it).

So now, thanks to the antivax morons in the current administration, we won&#39;t get this vaccine for a long time, if ever. Think about that next time you get the flu.

I am curious, do you know why antivax morons [I am one of them] object to mRNA technology?

Vaccines were except from late stage trials only because they were classified &quot;Experimental.&quot;  They are no longer classified that way.  What&#39;s happening here is, &quot;experimental&quot; classification should never be used for any sort of long term approval.  Arguably it should not have been used for any sort of large scale deployment at all, but...

Now as to whether the burden of U.S. FDA approval is too high or not, I think there can be genuine discussion about that.  I suspect it is in most cases, but that is not w

&quot;You mean to tell me lying to the public has consequences? Weird.

Well, not legal consequences. They gots that liability shield, so even if they did turn out a product which harmed/killed people ( young men specifically ), they&#39;re completely immune.&quot;

It&#39;s clear right away that you&#39;re well aware that lying to the public does not have legal consequences.  You are exploiting it.

the problem is that everything worth having is scalped to hell and back now. &quot;agentic commerce&quot; is the back edge of that blade. in a world where everything is scalped out, how else are we to get anything except by paying even more out the nose that the already exorbitant prices being demanded by retailers.

have you seen the prices of [RAM, GPUs, SSDs] these past months?

Yes, a blank check to buy something in particular likely means you&#39;re a mark. Its a CEO&#39;s wet dream.

eBay really doesn&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t care if it is a bad decision or not to the purchaser....they just want sales, right?EBay&#39;s buyer protections mean they will have to deal with more seller/buyer service disputes that may arise from people using agentic shopping assistants.

EBay&#39;s buyer protections mean they will have to deal with more seller/buyer service disputes that may arise from people using agentic shopping assistants.

That&#39;s likely the problem. They don&#39;t want to deal with returns or other things because your agentic AI bot mistook &quot;RAM box&quot; as actual RAM and payed way too much for a box. It&#39;s likely to result in sellers being inundated with refund requests because they wrote their descriptions that fooled AI bots and such.

And any proper solution like &quot;you&#39;re responsibl

Wait a sec... there are scam listings and they&#39;re everywhere.  Does that mean there aren&#39;t any decent algorithms, or...?

Bingo- letting an &#39;AI&#39; decide to spend money on your behalf is a disaster waiting to happen.

You&#39;d need to put in a LOT of guardrails to make sure it didn&#39;t wipe out your bank account because it thought it saw a good deal on pallets of chopsticks or a 3-ton sea crate of green marbles.

&quot;Holy shit, I compute that that&#39;s a super deal on gardening gloves- I better buy 10,000 pairs.&quot;

eBay has one of the most usable shopping sites on the net. They have more metadata about items than anyone else who does anything like what they do, so you can do more meaningful searches on their site than anywhere else that offers a breadth of products.

You are smoking French fried dick.I&#39;m stealing that for later use.

The entire quote is &quot;you must be smoking French fried dick if you think I give a chicken fried fuck&quot;

Found it in a meme that ends something like I would fuck that up so bad... You must be smoking dick if you think I&#39;m going to fuck that chicken

Am I supposed to believe that eBay&#39;s UAP will have any impact against people using AI and bots?

I believe that this will only serve to alleviate liability for eBay in the rare case that they kick an AI bot and the owner wants to sue.

The version of Spencer Pittman visible to the world on social media, at least until last month, was familiar to anyone who has lived in a very Christian part of the country. Pittman, on his Instagram account, posted photos of himself in a baseball uniform in high school and college, action shots on the diamond, and off-field photos of more casual moments with captions such as “God is good. Thankful for my teammates.” On X, he chronicled his college career as an outfielder for Coahoma Community College in western Mississippi, posting his game schedules, his personal records in the gym, and videos of his training captioned with scripture passages. With his gym clothes, cross necklace, floppy hair, and singular fixation on linking all of his efforts and successes to his faith, the 19-year-old Pittman looked like the archetype of the Southern Christian sports bro. In a note accompanying one video of batting practice from late 2024, he wrote: “If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Romans 12:18.”

But last week, Pittman confessed to burning down a synagogue in Jackson, Mississippi. It was an act of calculated and ambitious hate, targeting the Beth Israel Synagogue, Jackson’s oldest synagogue and a building that had been firebombed by the Ku Klux Klan back in 1967. Pittman, who was arrested Saturday night after his father contacted the FBI, told investigators he had targeted the “Synagogue of Satan” for its “Jewish ties.” Authorities also say he laughed when his father confronted him and bragged that he “finally got them.” (No one was hurt in the arson.)

The question of how Spencer Pittman was radicalized is, so far, a slightly confounding one. He does not look to be an isolated internet obsessive with overt ties to white nationalists. He appeared to have friends—or at least teammates. He seemed to be from a comfortable suburban background. His life appeared to be a largely offline one, with community in his world of athletics.

There are gaps in our understanding of how Pittman went from a baseball-obsessed teenager to a fanatical antisemite. But he left enough of his digital world visible to the public for us to piece together some clues. Pittman, it seems, had found himself highly active in a strange community on the internet—one of those bizarre new digital spaces where toxic forms of masculinity culture merge with fundamentalist Christianity. This Christian-bro gym culture offers many young men an intoxicating sense of purpose, one in which the pursuit of conventional masculinity is given a kind of divine backing. Depending on who you ask, this culture is part of the manosphere, right-wing purity culture, or reactionary religious politics. But however you categorize this subculture, it may provide some clues to understanding how a gym rat could encounter militant new ideas.

The clearest insight into Pittman’s version of this world came in early January, when he posted a link to a website for a lifestyle brand called “One Purpose.” The site, which according to Mississippi Today was registered to Pittman in December, advertised a kind of wellness subscription service with a mishmash of Gen Z buzzwords and Christian self-help: looksmaxxing (including mewing and “facial aesthetics”), testosterone optimization, scripture memorization, divine schedule optimization, A.I. food scanning, financial tracking, and Bible-based workouts. The brand appeared to take the Bible very literally in its inspiration, scattering Hebrew throughout and promising a diet based on biblical foods (as in those specifically mentioned in scripture, such as figs, olives, and barley) and a health plan that enabled the biblical patriarchs to live for centuries. (“Their secret? Biblical eating patterns, fasting, and walking with God.”) The latter was advertised as a “life-expectancy maxxing protocol.”

If you spend some time on the website, you’ll see signs of how Pittman saw this world—or at least how he was trying to sell it to others. One section of the website explains “Why the World’s Way Has Failed You,” noting that secular diet and workout plans will fail young men because they aren’t pushing them to be disciplined enough. (The site is geared exclusively toward men.) “God’s solution,” on the other hand, asks these men to “build their temple”—their bodies—“for His glory,” giving them proper motivation to hit the gym.

While it may seem baffling to many Christians and non-Christians alike, this kind of exercise-based faith expression is not uncommon among a certain category of young men, experts say. According to Mariel Barnes, a professor who researches gender and public affairs at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, it offers the same appeal as other factions of the “manosphere”—incels, pickup artists, and male separatists, for example—by emphasizing the power of men and the importance of traditional gender roles.

According to the Rev. Angela Denker, a Lutheran pastor and the author of Disciples of White Jesus: The Radicalization of American Boyhood, that hyperfixation on masculinity is a common element of extreme right-wing Christianity. The vision of a kind of premodern, brutish masculinity provides a comfortingly simple guide for how a young man should act in a complex world—and the religious backing makes him feel more righteous in his belief.

The question of how he got from there to extreme antisemitism is murky. But experts in masculinity and right-wing Christianity noted that the different ideas that fed into this subculture encourage rigid ideology and bold action.

Take, for example, the website’s offer of a “Biblical longevity protocol based on Noah, Moses, and Caleb’s lifespans”—a prominent feature on the page. It sounds like nonsense, but it’s new internet framing of an older idea. The term “life-expectancy maxxing” appears to be original, but some Christians have occasionally claimed that the Bible offers a kind of code to the ideal form of bodily existence. According to Heidi Campbell, a Texas A&M University professor who researches technology, religion, and digital culture, in the 1990s, the era of fad dieting, the country saw a revival in biblical dieting, in which people looked through Levitical laws for instruction on nutrition and fasting.

But it’s internet culture that allowed Pittman to package this as a kind of Christian answer to Silicon Valley’s anti-aging movement, in which you can hack your way to a long life with the right interactive tech tool, plus God. There’s nothing hate-oriented about that. Still, it calls on young men to cast off their old interests and influences and remake their lives by embracing a collection of extreme worldviews—in this case, tech’s optimization culture, fundamentalist Christianity, and the manosphere’s aesthetic self-improvement culture. When that level of single-minded intensity is brought to reforming the physical body, Campbell said, it can set the conditions for other kinds of extremism.

“There can be a lot of overlap with different people who tend toward more extremist ideas and behaviors,” Campbell said. “That jump in an extreme in how you treat bodies to an extreme in how you treat culture—that idea of purification—can be twisted to justify certain logic.”

“It’s not just being healthy but resisting anything ‘polluting’ to your body, to your mind, to the culture,” she added.

Pittman clearly saw these things—body, mind, culture—as connected. On Instagram, Pittman posted about what he perceived as the true threats to the world: “How to destroy society: Make discipline cringe. Make truth offensive. Make masculinity shameful.”

These ideas are often articulated in conservative Christian spaces as about being a “warrior” for Christ. The Christian warrior defends society against secular, feminist groups that want to eradicate family values and spread moral confusion. He is not afraid to be strong and fight for what he knows to be Biblical truth.

Usually, pastors advocating for young men to be warriors for Christ don’t mention Judaism. But on the internet, it doesn’t take a lot of searching to find men proclaiming themselves to be devoted Christians who will argue that Jews are behind society’s adoption of feminist and secular values. Pittman was clearly immersed in internet culture. And he appears to have bought into the idea, spread by so many on the Christian right, that it was his duty to stand up against Christianity’s “enemies.”

“It’s a theology of power, of power and dominance, and that does lend itself to antisemitism,” Denker said.

It’s possible that Pittman had become, in some way, confused. We don’t know his mental state before the crime. In December, after years of anodyne baseball photos, he started posting about money and cars. He posted selfies meant to show off his physique, a photo of bloodied knuckles, and videos of him driving at 160 miles per hour. He blasted money as the source of all evil while simultaneously bragging about his sports car and “escaping modern slavery” through stock trading. Finally, the night of the crime, he posted a clip from the Comedy Central show Drawn Together in which an antisemitic character panics about “a Jew in my backyard,” confronting an ugly, yellow-skinned cartoon character with a large nose and money bags. This was a hard swerve from Pittman’s inoffensive baseball posting from just a few weeks before.

It will remain hard to piece together Pittman’s path there because he, like every young man on the internet, could have constructed it from any number of sources. He didn’t need a single pastor or priest or denomination to tell him his views; he could have turned to podcasters, influencers, meme pages, YouTube pastors, and any other number of figures for inspiration. Some observers have been quick to point out that Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes have used the phrase “Synagogue of Satan.” But Pittman just as easily could have picked it up from any antisemite: The phrase, used in the Bible to refer to persecutors, has a long history of misuse, including by the KKK, Louis Farrakhan’s Nation of Islam, the televangelist Billy Graham, and various modern Christian white supremacist groups. Until he tells us where he learned it, we can’t know what his inspiration was.

But what we do know is that for young men like Pittman, the internet is awash in groups ready to prey on their confusion and insecurities and tell them that if they only remake themselves to be strong enough, masculine enough, driven enough, powerful enough, they’ll get the approval they want—whether it’s from women, society, or God.

In this member-exclusive episode, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discuss the Supreme Court’s fact-free foray into Trump v. Cook, a case that economists warn could crater the economy. President Donald Trump spent the first weeks of his second stint in the White House firing a lot of people from government agencies. For the most part, the High Court’s conservative justices let it slide, in line with their general “he’s the President, let him do it” posture. But Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook was different. In August, Trump fired off a post on Truth Social, then sacked Cook a few days later, leaving a huge question mark hanging over the independence of the Fed. Turns out, that’s a very big deal for anyone who wants to avoid hyperinflation and economic disaster. During Wednesday’s arguments, it was clear that even Trump’s hand-picked justices felt as though they would like to avoid such catastrophes. What ensued was more about feelings, fear, and frustration than law, but that may be the best we can hope for.

The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday in Trump v. Cook, a monumental case testing Donald Trump’s ability to fire members of the Federal Reserve. In August, the president sought to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, a Democrat, over dubious allegations of mortgage fraud. The lower courts reinstated Cook after she sued, which prompted the administration to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court in September. Instead of acting immediately, the justices scheduled the case for oral argument, letting Cook keep her job in the meantime. Now a majority seems prepared to rule in her favor, though it is not clear exactly how it will do so.

In a special bonus episode of Amicus for Slate Plus members, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the twists and turns of Wednesday’s two-hour showdown between Solicitor General John Sauer and Cook’s attorney, Paul Clement (who is usually an advocate for conservative causes). A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This is the part that’s going to be painful for both of us, but we have to praise Brett Kavanaugh. He laid out very clearly what he was worried about, and what comes next if Trump wins. He told Solicitor General Sauer: “If this were set as a precedent, it seems to me, just thinking big picture, what goes around comes around. All of the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on Jan. 20, 2029, if there’s a Democratic president. … Once these tools are unleashed, they are used by both sides and usually more the second time around.” And he mentioned the dangers of the government deciding: “Let’s find something, anything, about this person” to accuse them of a crime.

Justice Kavanaugh is essentially saying: Wait a minute, we’re going to give the president unbridled power to go after anyone on the basis of any fishing expedition with the lowest standards? Let’s cop to the fact that it is weird for both of us to laud Kavanaugh being the calm, prescient voice of reason.

Mark Joseph Stern: It is weird, but it’s not surprising, because this has been something of a passion project for Kavanaugh since well before he joined the Supreme Court. He has long tried to craft a theory that the president could purge every other independent agency of holdovers from his predecessors—but that the Federal Reserve was special, so the president cannot fire its members willy-nilly. He acknowledged that this was partly because the Federal Reserve needs independence to perform its duties as a central bank that fights inflation and seeks full employment. And he was almost as honest about that on Wednesday as he had been earlier in his career. He hasn’t changed his tune. I guess he gets points for consistency here.

It was interesting how Kavanaugh didn’t bother all that much with the finer points of law. Instead, he kept asking the solicitor general: Do you want to destroy the Federal Reserve? What do you think is going to happen if you do? He pressed Sauer to say why the Fed’s independence was important, but Sauer wouldn’t bite. So Kavanaugh did it for him and laid out this nightmare vision of what happens with the next president, and how this does not stop with Trump. He said, in very stark terms: This is how you destabilize the Fed and ensure that we no longer have stable monetary policy. And that leads to inflation and recessions in endless cycles.

I was really surprised by one particular thing that he said: “What goes around comes around.” I thought I’d heard those words from Kavanaugh before, and it turns out I have: That’s what he said during his confirmation hearing when he responded to Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual abuse. In fact, during that hearing, he spoke in similar terms about the cycle of retribution in politics, about how you sow the wind and reap the whirlwind. I wonder if Kavanaugh empathizes with Lisa Cook, because he thinks that he, too, was the victim of a fishing expedition to smear his character and disqualify him from public office.

I think that’s exactly right. And it goes to this deeper point that we have clocked many a time on this show. Sometimes the justices can’t imagine what it’s like to be hauled out of the car for a traffic stop when you’re brown. But Brett Kavanaugh can certainly imagine what it’s like when some state actor says: Let’s find something bad about this person. It sounded like Kavanaugh thinking: Hey, this could happen to me, because it did happen to me. But this goes beyond Kavanaugh. The justices have had mortgages. They can imagine how one mistake—out of hundreds of pages of a mortgage application—could be turned against them.

We need to talk about these facts for a minute. Sauer led with a very strange opening about Lisa Cook’s Bonnie-and-Clyde-like criminal enterprise, painting her as a danger to humankind because of one accidental misrepresentation on hundreds of pages of forms. Several justices seemed keen to send this case back down for a hearing to determine what Cook actually did, or did not, do. But Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to think there’d be no point. In the end, does it matter what the facts of this case are?

We don’t really know, because there are several ways the court could decide the case in Cook’s favor, and a few of them don’t require resolution of the facts. Some justices, including the liberals, were pushing this idea of notice and a hearing—that Cook needed to be properly informed of this allegation, then given an opportunity to contest it. Kavanaugh also seemed to support the idea that Cook should have a real opportunity to respond, asking Sauer: “What’s the fear of more process here?” There seemed to be a real hunger for some sense of justice for Cook, who did not defraud anyone.

Roberts, by contrast, wanted to set aside this whole question of a hearing because that gets into complicated questions about due process. The chief seemed eager to say: Let’s accept that these are the facts. If they’re true, that’s not sufficient cause to remove Cook from the Fed. He was persistently pushing toward the idea that the facts don’t need “airing” out. We know what they are, and they do not rise to “cause” for Cook’s removal. That’s a clean solution, and the liberal justices will probably sign on if it’s necessary to reach five votes. But it would be a little bit unfortunate to deny Cook a true opportunity to rebut these allegations, because it deprives her of that ability to show, in a formal hearing, that she is not a criminal. And without that, there may be a cloud hanging over her continued service on the Federal Reserve Board. That would be pretty tragic.

How else do they resolve this case against Trump if they don’t want to go down that rabbit hole?

Well, we sense they’re going to rule against Trump, but we truly don’t know how it’ll happen. This is the one-in-a-million case in which it really would have made sense to just deny the emergency application without explanation in an unsigned order on the shadow docket, then let the lower courts hash it out. It’s the rare instance in which I wish they would not explain themselves, but now they may feel obligated to. So maybe we’ll get a majority for something clear and straightforward like Roberts wants, or order a hearing for Cook. Or maybe they’re just going to make a mess of the law and Trump will try to exploit the ambiguities to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell next.

It seemed to me, throughout this argument, the vibe from the court was: Yes, Donald Trump, we gave you this red Batphone. You’ve used it to call us every time you don’t get what you want and say it’s an emergency. And we’ve answered you and said yes. But the vibe today from the court was: Why are you calling us on the Batphone? The justices seemed mad that Trump was following the exact directive they laid out, which was to label everything an emergency, go to them with your hurt feelings, and ask them to fix it. It felt a little bit like the tariffs argument: Why are you bringing this to us? Well, because you taught him to. This felt like a room in which the howling winds of nothing were totally emblematic of where we are in the law right now.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Criminals can more easily pull off social engineering scams and other forms of identity fraud thanks to custom voice-phishing kits being sold on dark web forums and messaging platforms.

These kits are sold as a service to &quot;a growing number&quot; of digital intruders targeting victims&#39; Google, Microsoft, and Okta accounts, and they include real-time assistance to miscreants looking to intercept users&#39; credentials and multi-factor authentication codes, according to a Thursday Okta Threat Intelligence blog.

&quot;There are at least two kits that implement the novel functionality observed,&quot; Okta Threat Intelligence VP Brett Winterford told The Register.

&quot;The phishing kits have been developed to closely mimic the authentication flows of identity providers and other identity systems used by organizations,&quot; he said. &quot;The kits allow the attacker to monitor the phishing page as the targeted user is interacting with it and trigger different custom pages that the target sees. This creates a more compelling pretext for asking the user to share credentials and accept multi-factor authentication challenges.&quot;

This type of malicious activity has &quot;evolved significantly since late 2025,&quot; according to Winterford, who added that some ads for these phishing kits also look to recruit native English-speaking callers for the scams.

&quot;These callers pretend to be from an organization&#39;s helpdesk and approach targets using the pretext of resolving a support ticket or performing a mandatory technical update,&quot; Winterford said.

Last year, these types of Scattered Spider-like IT support call scams helped criminals gain access to dozens of companies&#39; Salesforce instances for large-scale data theft and extortion.

First, the attacker performs reconnaissance on their targets, learning users&#39; names, what apps they use, and phone numbers for IT support calls. These details can be found fairly easily on companies&#39; websites, employees&#39; LinkedIn pages, and other publicly available sources. Asking a chatbot to research potential targets makes recon even easier, and a lot faster.

The kits allow the attacker to monitor the phishing page as the targeted user is interacting with it and trigger different custom pages that the target sees

Next, the attacker uses the phishing kit to create a realistic looking login website, calls the victim using a spoofed support hotline or company phone number, and pretends to be from the company&#39;s help desk to convince the victim to visit the phishing page. &quot;The attacks vary from there, depending on the attacker&#39;s motivation and their interactions with the user,&quot; Winterford said.

If all goes according to plan, the victim enters their username and password into the phishing site, and it&#39;s automatically forwarded to the attacker&#39;s Telegram channel, and the attacker now has valid credentials for the legitimate sign-in page.

Here&#39;s where real-time assistance comes into play: While the victim is still on the phone, the attacker uses the compromised credentials and attempts to log in to the victim&#39;s account, noting whatever MFA challenges are used and updating the phishing site in real-time.

The attacker then asks the victim to enter a one-time password, accept a push notification, or complete a different type of multi-factor authentication (MFA) challenge. The fake page that the victim sees supports this request, thus making the social-engineering scam even more believable.

&quot;If presented a push notification (type of MFA challenge), for example, an attacker can verbally tell the user to expect a push notification, and select an option from their [command-and-control] panel that directs their target&#39;s browser to a new page that displays a message implying that a push message has been sent, lending plausibility to what would ordinarily be a suspicious request for the user to accept a challenge the user didn&#39;t initiate,&quot; the report says.

Plus, according to Okta, these kits can help attackers bypass push notifications that use number-matching challenges as a second form of verification and simply tell the targeted user to enter a specific number.

Either way, it&#39;s game over for the user and the attacker now has full control over the compromised account.

Okta&#39;s research echoes The Register&#39;s earlier reporting about &quot;impersonation-as-a-service,&quot; in which criminals package and sell tools for social engineering and identity fraud using a software-as-a-service-style business model.

&quot;As a bad actor you can subscribe to get tools, training, coaching, scripts, exploits, everything in a box to go out and conduct your infiltration operation that often combine[s] these social engineering attacks with targeted ransomware, almost always with a financial motive,&quot; security shop Nametag CEO Aaron Painter told us in an earlier interview. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/22/trump_greenland_rare_earths_hard/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US invasion of Greenland might be off the table for now, but the Trump administration won&#39;t have an easy time using the rare earth elements and critical minerals it claims it&#39;s getting access to as part of a deal with NATO.

Trump said on Wednesday that he and NATO had worked out the &quot;concept of a deal&quot; to extend the US&#39; security footprint on the island and rights to its minerals in perpetuity, without offering any additional details or specifics. Analysts at energy, chemicals, metals, and mining consultancy Wood Mackenzie published a report on Thursday following Trump&#39;s announcement, noting that Greenland&#39;s rare earth assets would be nigh impossible to extract and process on a commercial scale.

&quot;Greenland has significant, though relatively unexplored and undeveloped, reserves of metals and minerals,&quot; Wood Mackenzie analysts explained in the report. The autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark is believed to have the eighth-largest rare earth reserves in the world and the potential to produce 27 of the 34 minerals the EU defines as critical, but despite that it doesn&#39;t have a single operating rare earth mine.

The rare earth minerals available in Greenland are numerous. Cerium is believed to be the dominant material on the island, and it&#39;s used in everything from lighter flints to the oil-refining process to self-cleaning ovens. Also common is Lanthanum, which is used in cameras, telescopes, battery electrodes, and hydrogen storage systems, to name a few applications. There&#39;s also quite a bit of Neodymium on the island, which is used in things like rare-earth magnets, lasers, and electric motors.

Yttrium, Praseodymium, Europium, and others, all with critical tech applications, can each be found in Greenland, making it an attractive mining prospect – at least on paper.

&quot;Diversification of supply chains away from China became a key industry driver through 2025 and Greenland has the potential to become an important future supplier,&quot; the analysts added.

Others have certainly tried before – per the report, a copy of which was provided to The Register, multiple attempts to extract rare earths from Greenland have been underway, some for more than a decade, but with little to show for it.

One mine that site work began on in 2007 has been stuck in a legal quagmire since Greenland passed a law in 2021 that banned extraction of non-uranium minerals with excessive concentrations of the nuclear element. The site has levels three times the limit imposed by law.

Another site on the island has only completed exploratory drilling, and a third site is projected to open a pilot facility sometime this year.

&quot;Other projects in the country are similarly early-stage,&quot; the analysts noted.

That latter site with the planned pilot facility, we note, is planning to export rare earth minerals to the United States, as Greenland and the US have had a memorandum of understanding to cooperate with American companies on mineral sector development since 2019.

That&#39;s right - for all of Trump&#39;s bluster and threats justifying his action on Greenland in part on the need to secure mineral rights, the US and Greenland worked things out about seven years ago.

With all those critical rare earths under its ice sheets and frozen tundra, it stands to reason there&#39;s a good explanation for why they haven&#39;t been exploited yet, and it turns out there are several, according to the Wood Mackenzie analysts.

&quot;Infrastructure is limited, meaning any company looking to develop would have to create its own transport and energy infrastructure,&quot; the experts explained. &quot;The local population is small, and a lack of a large and established mining sector means skilled labour would have to be imported.&quot;

Additionally, the weather is harsh, daylight is limited, and the only ports that remain open year round are on the southwest coast. That leaves air travel as the only viable path to and from many sites, and weather disruptions would often take that off the table.

Then there&#39;s refinement, which either means getting them to Greenland&#39;s only modern port at its capital of Nuuk to ship them abroad for refining, or doing it in Greenland, which would require a whole bunch of infrastructure, reagents, and labor imports.

&quot;Either option faces significant costs,&quot; the analysts note. Locals are also hostile to increased mining in Greenland, Wood Mackenzie added, with high sensitivity to potential environmental and social impacts.

All in all, they said, there&#39;s not a lot going for Greenland that can&#39;t be duplicated more easily in other places with rare earth deposits, more infrastructure, available labor, and less need to invest excess capital.

&quot;We expect these to remain major limiting factors on Greenland&#39;s ability to establish a rare earth mining sector, irrespective of whether Greenland remains a Danish territory, becomes a US territory, or looks to independence,&quot; said Wood Mackenzie senior research analyst David Riley.

Whether that will change Trump&#39;s calculus will be something we&#39;ll have to wait to find out. Given how quickly he caved on his Greenland aggression after chatting with the adults in the EU, that could happen as soon as someone with expertise manages to catch his ear. ®

            <h2>AI conference's papers contaminated by AI hallucinations</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/22/neurips_papers_contaiminated_ai_hallucinations/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">GPTZero, a detector of AI output, has found yet again that scientists are undermining their credibility by relying on unreliable AI assistance.

The New York-based biz has identified 100 hallucinations in more than 51 papers accepted by the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS). This finding follows the company&#39;s prior discovery of 50 hallucinated citations in papers under review by the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

GPTZero&#39;s senior machine-learning engineer Nazar Shmatko, head of machine learning Alex Adam, and academic writing editor Paul Esau argue in a blog post that the availability of generative AI tools has fueled &quot;a tsunami of AI slop.&quot;

&quot;Between 2020 and 2025, submissions to NeurIPS increased more than 220 percent from 9,467 to 21,575,&quot; they observe. &quot;In response, organizers have had to recruit ever greater numbers of reviewers, resulting in issues of oversight, expertise alignment, negligence, and even fraud.&quot;

These hallucinations consist largely of authors and sources invented by generative AI models, and of purported AI-authored text.

The legal community has been dealing with similar issues. More than 800 errant legal citations attributed to AI models have been flagged in various court filings, often with consequences for the attorneys, judges, or plaintiffs involved.

Academics may not face the same misconduct sanctions as legal professionals, but the consequences from the careless application of AI can have consequences beyond squandered integrity.

The AI paper submission surge has coincided with an increase in the number of substantive errors in academic papers – mistakes like incorrect formulas, miscalculations, errant figures, and so on, as opposed to citations of non-existing source material.

A pre-print paper published in December 2025 by researchers from Together AI, NEC Labs America, Rutgers University, and Stanford University looked specifically at AI papers from three major machine learning organizations: ICLR (2018–2025), NeurIPS (2021–2025), and TMLR (Transactions on Machine Learning Research) (2022-2025).

The authors found &quot;published papers contain a non-negligible number of objective mistakes and that the average number of mistakes per paper has increased over time – from 3.8 in NeurIPS 2021 to 5.9 in NeurIPS 2025 (55.3 percent increase); from 4.1 in ICLR 2018 to 5.2 in ICLR 2025; and from 5.0 in TMLR 2022/23 to 5.5 in TMLR 2025.&quot;

Correlation is not causation, but when the error rate in NeurIPS papers has increased 55.3 percent following the introduction of OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT, the rapid adoption of generative AI tools cannot be ignored. The risk of unchecked AI usage for scientists is not just reputational. It may invalidate their work.

A spokesperson for NeurIPS didn&#39;t immediately respond to our request for comment. We&#39;ll update this story if we hear back post-publication.

GPTZero contends that its Hallucination Check software should be a part of a publisher&#39;s arsenal of AI-detection tools. That may help when attempting to determine whether a citation refers to actual research, but there are countermeasures that claim to be able to make AI authorship more difficult to detect. For example, a Claude Code skill called Humanizer says it &quot;removes signs of AI-generated writing from text, making it sound more natural and human.&quot; And there are many other anti-forensic options.

A recent report from the International Association of Scientific, Technical & Medical Publishers (STM) attempts to address the integrity challenges the scholarly community faces. The report says that the amount of academic communication reached 5.7 million articles in 2024, up from 3.9 million five years earlier. And it argues that publishing practices and policies need to adapt to the reality of AI-assisted and AI-fabricated research.

&quot;Academic publishers are definitely aware of the problem and are taking steps to protect themselves,&quot; said Adam Marcus, co-founder of Retraction Watch, which has documented many AI-related retractions, and managing editor of Gastroenterology & Endoscopy News, in an email to The Register. &quot;Whether those will succeed remains to be seen.

&quot;We&#39;re in an AI arms race and it&#39;s not clear the defenders can withstand the siege. However, it&#39;s also important to recognize that publishers have made themselves vulnerable to these assaults by adopting a business model that has prioritized volume over quality. They are far from innocent victims.&quot; ®

            <h2>Raspberry Pi flashes new branded USB drives that promise speedy performance</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/22/raspberry_pi_usb_drive/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Over the past few years, Raspberry Pi has released a slew of peripherals and accessories that offer great build quality and premium features, whether you’re using them with everyone’s favorite single-board computer or not. Today’s entry: a USB flash drive that promises high speeds, good looks, and strong durability.

The drive comes in 128 GB ($30 list price) or 256 GB capacity ($55) and plugs into any USB Type-A port, though it works best when attached to one that operates at USB 3 (aka USB 3.1 Gen 1 and USB 3.2 Gen 1) speeds of up to 5 Gbps. The snazzy-looking stick boasts an all-aluminum chassis with a Raspberry Pi logo on it and a hole you can use to attach it to a keyring.

The drive can be used for anything a regular USB drive is used for, but a logical use would be to boot your Pi – more about that later. That said, it has some premium features that should lead to better performance than your average USB stick. It uses a pseudo-SLC cache, which turns some of the native QLC (quad-level cell) NAND that comprises its regular storage memory into single-bit mode to improve performance, particularly on bursty workloads.

According to Raspberry Pi, the cache allows the drive to “be almost as fast as USB 3.0 can go” in sequential writes, but when a workload saturates the cache and it has to write straight to the QLC, the drive operates at speeds of 75 MB/s (128 GB capacity) and 150 MB/s (256 GB capacity). The company does not tout a sequential read speed but estimates random read and write speeds in terms of IOPS (Input / Output Operations per second) at a 4K block size.

At the 128 GB capacity, the drive is rated for 16,000 random 4K read IOPS and 21,000 random 4K write IOPS. At 256 GB capacity, those numbers jump up to 18,000 and 22,000 respectively.

These drives can be used with any compatible device, but if you are planning to deploy them as boot drives for a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, you should get better performance than from a microSD card, the most common boot device for Pis. Raspberry Pi’s own branded A2 microSD card ($15 for 32 GB) promises 5,000 random 4K read IOPS and 2,000 random 4K write IOPS on the Raspberry Pi 5 with lower rates of 3,200 / 1,200 IOPS on the Pi 4 (the Pi 5 has a faster card reader).

If you want the fastest Raspberry Pi storage money can buy and you have a Pi 5, then the solution is to get a Raspberry Pi SSD kit, which is available for as little as $55 US and contains both a 256 GB SSD and the M.2 Pi HAT+ you need to connect it. The 256 GB official Pi SSD boasts 4K random reads of 40K IOPS and 4K random writes of 70K IOPS, both much higher than the USB drive can provide. The Raspberry Pi 4 and earlier cannot use the SSD kit.

Raspberry Pi also touts the new flash drive as resilient, particularly when it comes to power failure. The company says that the drive survived even when being power cycled tens of thousands of times while reading and writing. Like an SSD, the drive also supports SMART health reporting, which detects imminent hardware failure, and TRIM for maintaining performance over time.

If you’re just out shopping for a USB 3 flash drive on the cheap, you can definitely save money over Raspberry Pi’s new offering, though it&#39;s hard to compare performance without having tested the new drives. As of this writing, Amazon in the US sells the Samsung Bar Plus flash drive, which also has an all-metal casing, for $22 and $32 for its 128 and 256 GB flavors. User reviews claim that the 256 GB capacity gets about 115 MB/s in sequential writes (no IOPS measurements are available, so this isn&#39;t a perfect apples-to-apples comparison). Unlike the Raspberry Pi flash drive, Samsung claims this drive is waterproof.

It may not be the most affordable choice on the market, but this vulture still wants a Raspberry Pi-branded flash drive because it looks really sleek and Pi has a long history of making high-quality gear. I own Raspberry Pi’s 15-inch portable monitor and, though it doesn’t stand out on the spec sheet, it has superior build quality, strong image output, and a very convenient kickstand. The company’s keyboard and mouse look a little like toys, but feel like they are built to last.

Even if you are not a Pi fan, the Raspberry Pi flash drive looks like it could serve you well while looking really nice on your desk or on your keychain. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Unknown attackers are abusing Microsoft SharePoint file-sharing services to target multiple energy-sector organizations, harvest user credentials, take over corporate inboxes, and then send hundreds of phishing emails from compromised accounts to contacts inside and outside those organizations.

The attackers likely used previously-compromised email addresses to gain initial access to &quot;multiple&quot; energy-sector organizations targeted in this campaign, according to Redmond, which detailed the digital intrusions in a Wednesday report.

These emails contained a SharePoint URL requiring user authentication and subject lines such as &quot;New Proposal - NDA&quot; to make them appear legitimate. People who clicked on the URL were redirected to a website that required them to enter user credentials, thus giving the criminals valid usernames and passwords to use in later stages of these attacks.

Then, the attackers signed in to the compromised accounts with another IP address and created an inbox rule to delete all incoming emails and mark all the emails as read. And from these compromised inboxes, the miscreants sent out new phishing emails - in one case involving more than 600 emails sent with another phishing URL.

&quot;The emails were sent to the compromised user&#39;s contacts, both within and outside of the organization, as well as distribution lists,&quot; the Microsoft researchers said. &quot;The recipients were identified based on the recent email threads in the compromised user&#39;s inbox.&quot;

In this particular case, after sending out the new phishing emails, the attacker kept an eye on the victim&#39;s inbox, deleting any out-of-office or undeliverable messages. They also read email responses and responded to any questions about the legitimacy of the phish. These emails and responses were also later deleted by the attacker.

Anyone from within an energy org who clicked on the malicious URL was also targeted for credential theft and account takeover.

The Register asked Microsoft how many organizations were compromised, if its threat hunters have any idea who is behind these attacks, and whether they remain ongoing. We didn&#39;t receive any answers from Redmond, but will update this story if and when that changes.

While the usual recommendation for any type of identity compromise is to reset the password, in these types of attacker-in-the-middle scams - where the criminal intercepts and relays messages between two parties, allowing them to steal sensitive data and snoop on victims&#39; communications - a password reset alone isn&#39;t sufficient to address the issue.

&quot;Even if the compromised user&#39;s password is reset and sessions are revoked, the attacker can set up persistence methods to sign-in in a controlled manner by tampering with MFA,&quot; Redmond warns. &quot;For instance, the attacker can add a new MFA policy to sign in with a one-time password (OTP) sent to the attacker&#39;s registered mobile number. With these persistence mechanisms in place, the attacker can have control over the victim&#39;s account despite conventional remediation measures.&quot;

Still, multi-factor authentication (MFA) &quot;remains an essential pillar&quot; in stopping a range of cyber threats, so do enable that.

Microsoft also suggests enabling conditional access policies that evaluate sign-in requests using additional identity-driven signals like user or group membership, IP location information, and device status. If these signals trigger a security alert, the suspicious sign-in is denied.

Investing in anti-phishing products that scan incoming messages and visited websites can also help. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most US workers in jobs exposed to AI are also relatively well placed to adapt if disruption leads to displacement, according to research summarized by the Brookings Institution. However, there are some careers with high percentages of female workers that are in a bad position.

Brookings&#39; analysis of a study for the National Bureau of Economic Research, released this week, argues that while many previous assessments have focused on how &quot;exposed&quot; different occupations are to AI, they often overlook what it calls &quot;a critical dimension: workers&#39; ability to adapt if job loss does occur.&quot;

That ability to adapt was based on more obvious factors, such as age and financial security, as well as other issues such as union membership, geography, and the state of local labor markets.

Once these factors were taken into consideration, the researchers concluded that “Of the 37.1 million U.S. workers in the top quartile of occupational AI exposure, 26.5 million also have above-median adaptive capacity.”

So, lawyers, software developers, and financial managers were all in “exposed” roles, but also had “strong pay, financial buffers, diverse skills, and deep professional networks.” They were well-placed to weather any AI-induced storms.

Other roles had much lower levels of exposure to AI and higher adaptivity. So, you might want to consider a future in dentistry, firefighting, or medicine. Or, if you like uniforms but not sharp objects, being a flight attendant could be an option. Butchers were rated amongst the least adaptable, but also amongst the least exposed to the impact of AI.

But, the researchers found, there are roughly 6.1 million workers who “face both high exposure to LLMs and low adaptive capacity to manage a job transition.”

“Many of these workers occupy administrative and clerical jobs where savings are modest, workers’ skill transferability is limited, and reemployment prospects are narrower.”

This, in turn, means that they are more likely to face longer job searches, less chance of actually finding new employment, and “more significant relative earnings losses compared to other workers.”

And, if you haven’t guessed it, “Of these workers, 86 percent are women.”

Geography also came into play. “The concentration of exposed and vulnerable workers is greatest in smaller metro areas and college towns, particularly in the Mountain West and Midwest—reflecting such areas’ elevated presence of administrative and clerical workers.” ®

After sharing a brief look at its new Talking Flower during a Nintendo Direct showcase last September that generated more questions than answers, Nintendo has finally revealed more details about what the interactive toy actually does and how much it costs. It shares some functionality with Nintendo’s Alarmo alarm clock, but the Talking Flower seems more like a talkative companion for fans of Super Mario Bros. Wonder.

First and foremost, as the name implies, the Talking Flower will just randomly speak a couple of times every hour when left alone, with phrases like “sometimes it’s nice to space out,” and “is it weird for flowers to talk?” A single button on the toy can be pressed to trigger random thoughts on demand, or you can press and hold the button to silence the Talking Flower for a while. There’s music, too, and at launch on March 12th, it will support 11 different languages, including English, Italian, and Japanese.

The toy is available for preorder starting today through Nintendo’s online store and other retailers (GameStop) for $34.99.

You can also set the Talking Flower to speak at specific times of day, such as greeting you in the morning or saying good night as you head to bed, and some of its random phrases are only triggered at specific times of the day. It’s got a built-in sensor so it can comment on the temperature in the room, and instead of using LEDs or a screen, the Talking Flower will just tell you when its batteries are running low.

Surprisingly, this wasn’t the only flower-related news from Nintendo today. The company also released an overview trailer for the upcoming Switch 2 update for Mario Wonder, and it includes a new power-up called the “bellabel flower.” That update is out on March 26th.

Bending Spoons purchased the video platform for $1.38 billion last year.

Vimeo is laying off employees around the globe just months after the Italian software company Bending Spoons acquired the platform for $1.38 billion, as reported earlier by Business Insider. Even though it’s not clear how many people were laid off, Dave Brown, Vimeo’s former brand VP, says in a post on LinkedIn that “a large portion of the company” was impacted.

Other former employees echo this statement in posts online, with one video engineer saying “almost everyone” at the company was laid off, “including the entire video team.” Another software engineer says he was laid off along with “a gigantic amount of the company.” Bending Spoons spokesperson Camilla Bettinelli confirmed the layoffs to The Verge, but declined to provide details about how many people were affected.

Earlier this week, Israeli outlet CTech reported that Vimeo is laying off “most” of its employees in the country. It marks the company’s second round of layoffs in less than six months, as it laid off 10 percent of workers in September — just one week before Bending Spoons announced plans to acquire it. The layoffs raise concerns about how this might impact the content hosted on the platform, such as the comedy shows created by Dropout.

Bending Spoons doesn’t have a great track record when it comes to acquisitions and layoffs. The company has laid off staff across many of the companies it has purchased over the years, including WeTransfer, Filmic, and Evernote.

Update, January 22nd: Added Bending Spoons’ response.

            <h2>Epic and Google have a secret $800 million Unreal Engine and services deal</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-22</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Sorry, I’m blowing this confidentiality.”

“Sorry, I’m blowing this confidentiality.”

A judge is questioning whether Epic Games and Google are settling their long-running antitrust fight partly because of a previously unannounced partnership involving the Unreal Engine, Fortnite, and Android. In a hearing in San Francisco today, the court revealed that Epic and Google have struck a new deal that apparently includes “joint product development, joint marketing commitment, joint partnerships.” California District Judge James Donato expressed concerns that the agreement — which he indicated would involve Epic “helping Google market Android” and Google newly “using Epic’s core technology” — could have led Epic to soften its demands for changes to the overall Android ecosystem.

Donato allowed Epic and Google to keep most of the details of the plan under wraps. But during the hearing, he quizzed witnesses, including Epic CEO Tim Sweeney and economics expert Doug Bernheim, on how it might impact settlement talks — revealing some hints in the process. “You’re going to be helping Google market Android, and they’re going to be helping you market Fortnite; that deal doesn’t exist today, right?” Donato asked Bernheim, who answered in the affirmative. He also described it as a “new business between Epic and Google.”

Sweeney’s testimony cracked the mystery a little further. He referred to the agreement as relating to the “metaverse,” a term Sweeney has used to refer to Epic’s game Fortnite. “Epic’s technology is used by many companies in the space Google is operating in to train their products, so the ability for Google to use the Unreal Engine more fullsome… sorry, I’m blowing this confidentiality,” Sweeney said.

Donato then offered a hard dollar figure on one part of the deal: “An $800 million spend over six years, that’s a pretty healthy partnership,” he said. We soon learned that refers to Epic spending $800 million to purchase some sort of services from Google: “Every year we’ve decided against Google, in this year we’re deciding to use Google at market rates,” he said. Sweeney did throw cold water on the idea that Epic and Google are jointly building a single new product together, though. “This is Google and Epic each separately building product lines,” he clarified, when Judge Donato asked what the term sheet referred to with the line “Google and Epic will work together.”

Google declined comment on the deal; Epic did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Donato seemed potentially leery of the partnership, asking Bernheim whether it could constitute a “quid pro quo” that reduced Epic’s incentive to push for terms that would benefit other developers. Currently, Epic is backing a settlement that would see Google reduce its standard app store fees worldwide and allow alternative app stores to register for easy installation on Android.

“I don’t see anything crooked about Epic paying Google off to encourage much more robust competition”

Sweeney disputed the notion that Epic might be getting paid off to soften its terms, when it’s the one paying out. “I don’t see anything crooked about Epic paying Google off to encourage much more robust competition than they’ve allowed in the past,” he said. “We view this as a significant transfer of value from Epic to Google.” He also says the Epic Games Store won’t get any special treatment from Android in the future under this deal.

It appears that the settlement arrangement is tied to the business deal. Judge Donato suggested that Epic and Google would only make the deal if the settlement goes through. Sweeney says the specific terms of the deal have not yet been reached, but admitted that he expects them to. He told Judge Donato that yes, he considers the settlement and deal “an important part of Epic’s growth plan for the future.”

Sweeney has said in the past that Epic won’t cut sweetheart deals with platforms. In 2023, after the Epic v. Google victory, he told The Verge that “we’ve always turned down special deals just for Epic. We’ve always fought on the principal that all developers should be, you know, given the same opportunities.”

Disclosure: Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company, has filed a lawsuit against Google, seeking damages from its illegal ad tech monopoly.

Advertising embedded in chatbots ‘raises significant concerns for consumer protection, privacy, and the safety of young users,’ Markey says.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) is pressing OpenAI about its move to bring ads to ChatGPT, and is asking several other companies whether they have similar plans. In letters to the CEOs of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Snap, and xAI, Markey writes that embedding ads into AI chatbots “raises significant concerns for consumer protection, privacy, and the safety of young users.”

OpenAI will start testing ads for free ChatGPT users in the coming weeks, and they’ll appear in the form of “sponsored” products and services at the bottom of conversations with the chatbot. The company says it will surface ads relevant to your chat, though it won’t show them to users under 18, or during conversations related to physical health, mental health, or politics.

Even with these safeguards in place, Markey says the addition of ads in ChatGPT and other AI platforms “represents a significant, and potentially dangerous transformation” in the ad industry, as a user’s “emotional connection” to the chatbot could allow companies to “prey on the very relationships their systems have fostered.” Markey also points to OpenAI’s statement that “conversational interfaces create possibilities for people to go beyond static messages and links,” potentially making it harder for someone to recognize what is and isn’t an ad in the future.

Markey brings up potential privacy risks as well, saying that AI companies must not use an individual’s “personal thoughts, health questions, family issues, and other sensitive information” for targeted advertising. And while OpenAI says it won’t show ads when users are talking about sensitive topics, Markey calls into question whether the company will still use this information to personalize ads in subsequent chats.

“AI companies have a responsibility to ensure that AI chatbots do not become another digital ecosystem structured to covertly manipulate users,” Markey writes. He’s giving OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Snap, and xAI until February 12th to answer questions about ads in AI chatbots and what they’re doing to protect users.

            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk celebrated the milestone, but its unclear how many people will be able to ride in Tesla’s newly unsupervised robotaxis in the immediate future.

Elon Musk celebrated the milestone, but its unclear how many people will be able to ride in Tesla’s newly unsupervised robotaxis in the immediate future.

Tesla is finally doing unsupervised robotaxi trips in Austin, Texas, according to a video posted on X. Elon Musk reposted the video, congratulating Tesla’s AI team for the milestone.

For months, Tesla’s robotaxis in Austin and San Francisco have included safety monitors with access to a kill switch in case of emergency — a fallback that Waymo currently doesn’t need for its commercial robotaxi service. The safety monitor sits in the passenger seat in Austin and in the driver seat in San Francisco. Neither service is fully open to the public yet, relying instead on customer waitlists.

Musk has said that the human monitors are only there because Tesla is being “paranoid about safety,” and not because of some deficiency in the company’s technology. He later predicted that the company would remove the safety monitors by the end of 2025.

It seems like he was off by a couple weeks. Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla’s VP for autonomy, provided some more context on X, saying the company was “starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.”

Whether this demonstration represents progress or perhaps a disaster waiting to happen, time will tell. Tesla still uses a waitlist for its robotaxi service, and is rumored to only have a couple dozen vehicles operating in Texas. And even with the safety monitors, Tesla’s robotaxis have crashed approximately eight times in just five months, according to Eletrek. Fans are obviously thrilled by Tesla’s progress, while critics call it a con designed to highlight a capability that doesn’t exist.

To some extent, this mirrors Waymo’s phased rollout strategy of starting with a handful of vehicles with safety monitors and a customer waitlist before gradually removing the monitors and opening up the list to everyone. The difference, of course, is that Waymo has driven over 100 million miles with its fully driverless, unsupervised cars. Tesla says its customers have driven 7.4 billion miles using Full Self-Driving, which is a Level 2 system that requires constant driver supervision. These are not comparable stats.

Meanwhile, Waymo continues to widen its lead over Tesla, reporting over 14 million paid rides in 2025 alone and plans to expand to 20 new cities in the coming year. Despite that, Musk has continued to insist that Tesla holds the advantage over the Alphabet-owned robotaxi operator due to its vast customer fleet that he insists will soon become fully autonomous. This, of course, ignores the reality that most Teslas on the road lack the necessary hardware to support fully autonomous driving.

            <div id="article-text">The company’s partnership with Flock is under new scrutiny amid concerns over who can access users’ footage.

The company’s partnership with Flock is under new scrutiny amid concerns over who can access users’ footage.

Ring’s partnership with Flock is sparking renewed online backlash this week, with influencers calling for people to smash their Ring cameras and claiming the company is part of the surveillance state amid heightened concerns over ICE actions.

Flock is an AI-powered surveillance camera company that has reportedly allowed government agencies — including ICE — to access data from its nationwide camera network. Amazon-owned home security company Ring announced a partnership with Flock last year as part of its new Community Requests tool. This allows local law enforcement agencies to request footage from nearby Ring users when investigating an active case.

“Ring has no partnership with ICE … and does not share video with them.”

According to reporting from Futurism, activists are pushing a grassroots campaign across social media, including TikTok and Bluesky, telling Ring users to get rid of their cameras to prevent footage from being used by ICE. However, Ring spokesperson Yassi Yarger told The Verge in an email that “Ring has no partnership with ICE, does not give ICE videos, feeds, or back-end access, and does not share video with them.”

Yarger also said that the Flock integration in question, which was announced last October, is not yet live. Meaning Flock does not have access to Community Requests.

“As we explore the integration, we will ensure the feature is built for the use of local public safety agencies only — which is what the program is designed for,” she said. According to Ring’s support site, local agencies are limited to city and county organizations.

Still, once footage is in the hands of local authorities, it’s out of Ring’s control. Ring founder Jamie Siminoff has told The Verge that he believes widespread cameras can prevent crime. But once deployed, the potential for such a large-scale local surveillance system to be used for other purposes is very real.

Since returning to the company last year, Siminoff has leaned into his belief that more cameras lead to safer communities, launching Community Requests last September.

This is essentially a rebrand of Ring’s controversial Request for Assistance feature, which was discontinued in 2024. Only, instead of direct partnerships with law enforcement, Community Requests works through integrations with “third-party evidence management platforms,” such as Flock and Axon, a Taser and body-cam company.

Any local agency partnered with either company can request users’ footage through the Ring’s apps. According to Yarger, currently, only the Axon partnership is live.

According to Ring, Community Requests sends a request from the local agency to both the Ring Neighbors app and the Ring app’s Community Feed. The request appears to all users in the area of an active investigation, and a user can choose to share footage or ignore the request. Ring says no one will be notified if you ignore a request.

If you don’t want to participate in Community Requests, you can disable it in the Ring or Neighbors app. Go to the app’s settings page, find the Neighbors Settings, then scroll down to Neighborhood Settings, click Feed Settings, uncheck Community Requests, and click Apply.

However, Ring — like many security camera companies — may provide footage to law enforcement without a warrant in what it deems an emergency.

To prevent anyone from accessing your Ring footage, you can enable end-to-end encryption (E2E) in the Ring app.

While your footage is still stored in Ring’s cloud, with E2E turned on, only the mobile device you set up the camera with can view the video; it cannot be accessed by Ring or used for Community Requests.

Enabling E2E means you lose several features, including person detection, rich notifications that show a snapshot of activity, and Ring’s new AI-powered descriptions, all of which rely on the cloud.

While most cloud-based security cameras encrypt footage in transit and at rest, they need to access it in the cloud to analyze it and enable those features.

If you want to avoid cloud-dependent cameras entirely, there are several other options for keeping your camera footage private and secure.

As mentioned, Ring cameras use the cloud to process footage for features like person detection; however, some security cameras can process video locally and fully encrypt it before sending it to the cloud. Generally, this requires a hub to process the footage.

If you are an iPhone user, Apple’s HomeKit Secure Video service is fully E2E encrypted. Video analysis is done locally on a home hub, such as a HomePod or Apple TV, and stored in your iCloud account. It requires compatible cameras, including models from Eve, Aqara, and Eufy.

Anker-owned Eufy is another company that offers local storage and video processing for its wide selection of cameras and video doorbells. The company had some serious security breaches involving the cloud in 2022, but its newer HomeBase hardware can run locally.

TP-Link’s Tapo, Aqara, and Reolink recently launched local hubs for storage and processing of footage from their cameras, and these companies also offer cameras and video doorbells with onboard local processing and local storage via microSD cards.

The new Matter standard now supports security cameras, which could open more options for local, secure storage and processing of camera footage.

Ultimately, any camera connected to the internet comes with the risk that it could be accessed by someone other than you, no matter what the company says. So it remains important to think carefully before adding any type of surveillance to your home or your neighborhood.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131692/dr-google-had-its-issues-can-chatgpt-health-do-better/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. It landed at an inauspicious time: Two days earlier, the news website SFGate had broken the story of Sam Nelson, a teenager who died of an overdose last year after extensive conversations with ChatGPT about how best to combine various drugs. In the wake of both pieces of news, multiple journalists questioned the wisdom of relying for medical advice on a tool that could cause such extreme harm.

Though ChatGPT Health lives in a separate sidebar tab from the rest of ChatGPT, it isn’t a new model. It’s more like a wrapper that provides one of OpenAI’s preexisting models with guidance and tools it can use to provide health advice—including some that allow it to access a user’s electronic medical records and fitness app data, if granted permission. There’s no doubt that ChatGPT and other large language models can make medical mistakes, and OpenAI emphasizes that ChatGPT Health is intended as an additional support, rather than a replacement for one’s doctor. But when doctors are unavailable or unable to help, people will turn to alternatives.

Some doctors see LLMs as a boon for medical literacy. The average patient might struggle to navigate the vast landscape of online medical information—and, in particular, to distinguish high-quality sources from polished but factually dubious websites—but LLMs can do that job for them, at least in theory. Treating patients who had searched for their symptoms on Google required “a lot of attacking patient anxiety [and] reducing misinformation,” says Marc Succi, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a practicing radiologist. But now, he says, “you see patients with a college education, a high school education, asking questions at the level of something an early med student might ask.”

The release of ChatGPT Health, and Anthropic’s subsequent announcement of new health integrations for Claude, indicate that the AI giants are increasingly willing to acknowledge and encourage health-related uses of their models. Such uses certainly come with risks, given LLMs’ well-documented tendencies to agree with users and make up information rather than admit ignorance.

But those risks also have to be weighed against potential benefits. There’s an analogy here to autonomous vehicles: When policymakers consider whether to allow Waymo in their city, the key metric is not whether its cars are ever involved in accidents but whether they cause less harm than the status quo of relying on human drivers. If Dr. ChatGPT is an improvement over Dr. Google—and early evidence suggests it may be—it could potentially lessen the enormous burden of medical misinformation and unnecessary health anxiety that the internet has created.

Pinning down the effectiveness of a chatbot such as ChatGPT or Claude for consumer health, however, is tricky. “It’s exceedingly difficult to evaluate an open-ended chatbot,” says Danielle Bitterman, the clinical lead for data science and AI at the Mass General Brigham health-care system. Large language models score well on medical licensing examinations, but those exams use multiple-choice questions that don’t reflect how people use chatbots to look up medical information.

Sirisha Rambhatla, an assistant professor of management science and engineering at the University of Waterloo, attempted to close that gap by evaluating how GPT-4o responded to licensing exam questions when it did not have access to a list of possible answers. Medical experts who evaluated the responses scored only about half of them as entirely correct. But multiple-choice exam questions are designed to be tricky enough that the answer options don’t give them entirely away, and they’re still a pretty distant approximation for the sort of thing that a user would type into ChatGPT.

A different study, which tested GPT-4o on more realistic prompts submitted by human volunteers, found that it answered medical questions correctly about 85% of the time. When I spoke with Amulya Yadav, an associate professor at Pennsylvania State University who runs the Responsible AI for Social Emancipation Lab and led the study, he made it clear that he wasn’t personally a fan of patient-facing medical LLMs. But he freely admits that, technically speaking, they seem up to the task—after all, he says, human doctors misdiagnose patients 10% to 15% of the time. “If I look at it dispassionately, it seems that the world is gonna change, whether I like it or not,” he says.

For people seeking medical information online, Yadav says, LLMs do seem to be a better choice than Google. Succi, the radiologist, also concluded that LLMs can be a better alternative to web search when he compared GPT-4’s responses to questions about common chronic medical conditions with the information presented in Google’s knowledge panel, the information box that sometimes appears on the right side of the search results.

Since Yadav’s and Succi’s studies appeared online, in the first half of 2025, OpenAI has released multiple new versions of GPT, and it’s reasonable to expect that GPT-5.2 would perform even better than its predecessors. But the studies do have important limitations: They focus on straightforward, factual questions, and they examine only brief interactions between users and chatbots or web search tools. Some of the weaknesses of LLMs—most notably their sycophancy and tendency to hallucinate—might be more likely to rear their heads in more extensive conversations and with people who are dealing with more complex problems. Reeva Lederman, a professor at the University of Melbourne who studies technology and health, notes that patients who don’t like the diagnosis or treatment recommendations that they receive from a doctor might seek out another opinion from an LLM—and the LLM, if it’s sycophantic, might encourage them to reject their doctor’s advice.

Some studies have found that LLMs will hallucinate and exhibit sycophancy in response to health-related prompts. For example, one study showed that GPT-4 and GPT-4o will happily accept and run with incorrect drug information included in a user’s question. In another, GPT-4o frequently concocted definitions for fake syndromes and lab tests mentioned in the user’s prompt. Given the abundance of medically dubious diagnoses and treatments floating around the internet, these patterns of LLM behavior could contribute to the spread of medical misinformation, particularly if people see LLMs as trustworthy.

OpenAI has reported that the GPT-5 series of models is markedly less sycophantic and prone to hallucination than their predecessors, so the results of these studies might not apply to ChatGPT Health. The company also evaluated the model that powers ChatGPT Health on its responses to health-specific questions, using their publicly available HeathBench benchmark. HealthBench rewards models that express uncertainty when appropriate, recommend that users seek medical attention when necessary, and refrain from causing users unnecessary stress by telling them their condition is more serious that it truly is. It’s reasonable to assume that the model underlying ChatGPT Health exhibited those behaviors in testing, though Bitterman notes that some of the prompts in HealthBench were generated by LLMs, not users, which could limit how well the benchmark translates into the real world.

An LLM that avoids alarmism seems like a clear improvement over systems that have people convincing themselves they have cancer after a few minutes of browsing. And as large language models, and the products built around them, continue to develop, whatever advantage Dr. ChatGPT has over Dr. Google will likely grow. The introduction of ChatGPT Health is certainly a move in that direction: By looking through your medical records, ChatGPT can potentially gain far more context about your specific health situation than could be included in any Google search, although numerous experts have cautioned against giving ChatGPT that access for privacy reasons.

Even if ChatGPT Health and other new tools do represent a meaningful improvement over Google searches, they could still conceivably have a negative effect on health overall. Much as automated vehicles, even if they are safer than human-driven cars, might still prove a net negative if they encourage people to use public transit less, LLMs could undermine users’ health if they induce people to rely on the internet instead of human doctors, even if they do increase the quality of health information available online.

Lederman says that this outcome is plausible. In her research, she has found that members of online communities centered on health tend to put their trust in users who express themselves well, regardless of the validity of the information they are sharing. Because ChatGPT communicates like an articulate person, some people might trust it too much, potentially to the exclusion of their doctor. But LLMs are certainly no replacement for a human doctor—at least not yet.

It’s supposed to be frigid in Davos this time of year. Part of the charm is seeing the world’s elite tromp through the streets in respectable suits and snow boots. But this year it’s positively balmy, with highs in the mid 30s, or a little over 1°C. The current conditions when I flew out of New York were colder, and definitely snowier. I’m told this is due to something called a föhn, a dry warm wind that’s been blowing across the Alps.

I’m no meteorologist, but it’s true that there is a lot of hot air here.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump arrived in Davos to address the assembly, and held forth for more than 90 minutes, weaving his way through remarks about the economy, Greenland, windmills, Switzerland, Rolexes, Venezuela, and drug prices. It was a talk lousy with gripes, grievances and outright falsehoods.

One small example: Trump made a big deal of claiming that China, despite being the world leader in manufacturing windmill componentry, doesn’t actually use them for energy generation itself. In fact, it is the world leader in generation, as well.

I did not get to watch this spectacle from the room itself. Sad!

By the time I got to the Congress Hall where the address was taking place, there was already a massive scrum of people jostling to get in.

I had just wrapped up moderating a panel on “the intelligent co-worker,” ie: AI agents in the workplace. I was really excited for this one as the speakers represented a diverse cross-section of the AI ecosystem. Christoph Schweizer, CEO of BCG had the macro strategic view; Enrique Lores, HP CEO, could speak to both hardware and large enterprises, Workera CEO Kian Katanforoosh has the inside view on workforce training and transformation, Manjul Shah CEO of Hippocratic AI addressed working in the high stakes field of healthcare, and Kate Kallot CEO of Amini AI gave perspective on the global south and Africa in particular.

Interestingly, most of the panel shied away from using the term co-worker, and some even rejected the term agent. But the view they painted was definitely one of humans working alongside AI and augmenting what’s possible. Shah, for example, talked about having agents call 16,000 people in Texas during a heat wave to perform a health and safety check. It was a great discussion. You can watch the whole thing here.

But by the time it let out, the push of people outside the Congress Hall was already too thick for me to get in. In fact I couldn’t even get into a nearby overflow room. I did make it into a third overflow room, but getting in meant navigating my way through a mass of people, so jammed in tight together that it reminded me of being at a Turnstile concert.

The speech blew way past its allotted time, and I had to step out early to get to yet another discussion. Walking through the halls while Trump spoke was a truly surreal experience. He had truly captured the attention of the gathered global elite. I don’t think I saw a single person not starting at a laptop, or phone or iPad, all watching the same video.

Trump is speaking again on Thursday in a previously unscheduled address to announce his Board of Peace. As is (I heard) Elon Musk. So it’s shaping up to be another big day for elite attention capture.

I should say, though, there are elites, and then there are elites. And there are all sorts of ways of sorting out who is who. Your badge color is one of them. I have a white participant badge, because I was moderating panels. This gets you in pretty much anywhere and therefore is its own sort of status symbol. Where you are staying is another. I’m in Klosters, a neighboring town that’s a 40 minute train ride away from the Congress Centre. Not so elite.

There are more subtle ways of status sorting, too. Yesterday I learned that when people ask if this is your first time at Davos, it’s sometimes meant as a way of trying to figure out how important you are. If you’re any kind of big deal, you’ve probably been coming for years.

But the best one I’ve yet encountered happened when I made small talk with the woman sitting next to me as I changed back into my snow boots. It turned out that, like me, she lived in California–at least part time. “But I don’t think I’ll stay there much longer,” she said, “due to the new tax law.” This was just an ice cold flex.

Because California’s newly proposed tax legislation? It only targets billionaires.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Yann LeCun is a Turing Award recipient and a top AI researcher, but he has long been a contrarian figure in the tech world. He believes that the industry’s current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems.

Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company&#39;s influential research lab that he founded.

LeCun sat down with MIT Technology Review in an exclusive online interview from his Paris apartment to discuss his new venture, life after Meta, the future of artificial intelligence, and why he thinks the industry is chasing the wrong ideas. Read the full interview.

In 2026, I’m going to be closely watching the price of lithium.

If you’re not in the habit of obsessively tracking commodity markets, I certainly don’t blame you. (Though the news lately definitely makes the case that minerals can have major implications for global politics and the economy.)

But lithium is worthy of a close look right now. The metal is crucial for lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage arrays on the grid.

Prices have been on quite the roller coaster over the last few years, and they’re ticking up again.

Cement hides in plain sight—it’s used to build everything from roads and buildings to dams and basement floors. But it’s also a climate threat. Cement production accounts for more than 7% of global carbon dioxide emissions—more than sectors like aviation, shipping, or landfills.

One solution to this climate catastrophe might be coursing through the pipes at Sublime Systems. The startup is developing an entirely new way to make cement. Instead of heating crushed-up rocks in lava-hot kilns, Sublime’s technology zaps them in water with electricity, kicking off chemical reactions that form the main ingredients in its cement.

But it faces huge challenges: competing with established industry players, and persuading builders to use its materials in the first place. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">In 2026, I’m going to be closely watching the price of lithium.

If you’re not in the habit of obsessively tracking commodity markets, I certainly don’t blame you. (Though the news lately definitely makes the case that minerals can have major implications for global politics and the economy.)

But lithium is worthy of a close look right now.

The metal is crucial for lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage arrays on the grid. Prices have been on quite the roller coaster over the last few years, and they’re ticking up again after a low period. What happens next could have big implications for mining and battery technology.

Before we look ahead, let’s take a quick trip down memory lane. In 2020, global EV sales started to really take off, driving up demand for the lithium used in their batteries. Because of that growing demand and a limited supply, prices shot up dramatically, with lithium carbonate going from under $10 per kilogram to a high of roughly $70 per kilogram in just two years.

And the tech world took notice. During those high points, there was a ton of interest in developing alternative batteries that didn’t rely on lithium. I was writing about sodium-based batteries, iron-air batteries, and even experimental ones that were made with plastic.

Researchers and startups were also hunting for alternative ways to get lithium, including battery recycling and processing methods like direct lithium extraction (more on this in a moment).

But soon, prices crashed back down to earth. We saw lower-than-expected demand for EVs in the US, and developers ramped up mining and processing to meet demand. Through late 2024 and 2025, lithium carbonate was back around $10 a kilogram again. Avoiding lithium or finding new ways to get it suddenly looked a lot less crucial.

That brings us to today: lithium prices are ticking up again. So far, it’s nowhere close to the dramatic rise we saw a few years ago, but analysts are watching closely. Strong EV growth in China is playing a major role—EVs still make up about 75% of battery demand today. But growth in stationary storage, batteries for the grid, is also contributing to rising demand for lithium in both China and the US.

Higher prices could create new opportunities. The possibilities include alternative battery chemistries, specifically sodium-ion batteries, says Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technologies and supply chains at BloombergNEF. (I’ll note here that we recently named sodium-ion batteries to our 2026 list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies.)

It’s not just batteries, though. Another industry that could see big changes from a lithium price swing: extraction.

Today, most lithium is mined from rocks, largely in Australia, before being shipped to China for processing. There’s a growing effort to process the mineral in other places, though, as countries try to create their own lithium supply chains. Tesla recently confirmed that it’s started production at its lithium refinery in Texas, which broke ground in 2023. We could see more investment in processing plants outside China if prices continue to climb.

This could also be a key year for direct lithium extraction, as Katie Brigham wrote in a recent story for Heatmap. That technology uses chemical or electrochemical processes to extract lithium from brine (salty water that’s usually sourced from salt lakes or underground reservoirs), quickly and cheaply. Companies including Lilac Solutions, Standard Lithium, and Rio Tinto are all making plans or starting construction on commercial facilities this year in the US and Argentina.

If there’s anything I’ve learned about following batteries and minerals over the past few years, it’s that predicting the future is impossible. But if you’re looking for tea leaves to read, lithium prices deserve a look.

He believes that the industry’s current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems.

Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. He is also a staunch advocate for open-source AI and criticizes the closed approach of frontier labs like OpenAI and Anthropic.

Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company&#39;s influential research lab that he founded. Meta has struggled to gain much traction with its open-source AI model Llama and has seen internal shake-ups, including the controversial acquisition of ScaleAI.

LeCun sat down with MIT Technology Review in an exclusive online interview from his Paris apartment to discuss his new venture, life after Meta, the future of artificial intelligence, and why he thinks the industry is chasing the wrong ideas.

Both the questions and answers below have been edited for clarity and brevity.

You’ve just announced a new company, Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI).  Tell me about the big ideas behind it.

It is going to be a global company, but headquartered in Paris. You pronounce it “ami”—it means “friend” in French. I am excited. There is a very high concentration of talent in Europe, but it is not always given a proper environment to flourish. And there is certainly a huge demand from the industry and governments for a credible frontier AI company that is neither Chinese nor American. I think that is going to be to our advantage.

So an ambitious alternative to the US-China binary we currently have. What made you want to pursue that third path?

Well, there are sovereignty issues for a lot of countries, and they want some control over AI. What I’m advocating is that AI is going to become a platform, and most platforms tend to become open-source. Unfortunately, that’s not really the direction the American industry is taking. Right? As the competition increases, they feel like they have to be secretive. I think that is a strategic mistake.

It’s certainly true for OpenAI, which went from very open to very closed, and Anthropic has always been closed. Google was sort of a little open. And then Meta, we’ll see. My sense is that it’s not going in a positive direction at this moment.

Simultaneously, China has completely embraced this open approach. So all leading open-source AI platforms are Chinese, and the result is that academia and startups, outside of the US, have basically embraced Chinese models. There’s nothing wrong with that—you know, Chinese models are good. Chinese engineers and scientists are great. But you know, if there is a future in which all of our information diet is being mediated by AI assistance, and the choice is either English-speaking models produced by proprietary companies always close to the US or Chinese models which may be open-source but need to be fine-tuned so that they answer questions about Tiananmen Square in 1989—you know, it’s not a very pleasant and engaging future.

They [the future models] should be able to be fine-tuned by anyone and produce a very high diversity of AI assistance, with different linguistic abilities and value systems and political biases and centers of interests. You need high diversity of assistance for the same reason that you need high diversity of press.

That is certainly a compelling pitch. How are investors buying that idea so far?

They really like it. A lot of venture capitalists are very much in favor of this idea of open-source, because they know for a lot of small startups, they really rely on open-source models. They don’t have the means to train their own model, and it’s kind of dangerous for them strategically to embrace a proprietary model.

You recently left Meta. What’s your view on the company and Mark Zuckerberg’s leadership? There’s a perception that Meta has fumbled its AI advantage.

I think FAIR [LeCun’s lab at Meta] was extremely successful in the research part. Where Meta was less successful is in picking up on that research and pushing it into practical technology and products. Mark made some choices that he thought were the best for the company. I may not have agreed with all of them. For example, the robotics group at FAIR was let go, which I think was a strategic mistake. But I’m not the director of FAIR. People make decisions rationally, and there’s no reason to be upset.

So, no bad blood? Could Meta be a future client for AMI?

Meta might be our first client! We’ll see. The work we are doing is not in direct competition. Our focus on world models for the physical world is very different from their focus on generative AI and LLMs.

You were working on AI long before LLMs became a mainstream approach. But since ChatGPT broke out, LLMs have become almost synonymous with AI.

Yes, and we are going to change that. The public face of AI, perhaps, is mostly LLMs and chatbots of various types. But the latest ones of those are not pure LLMs. They are LLM plus a lot of things, like perception systems and code that solves particular problems. So we are going to see LLMs as kind of the orchestrator in systems, a little bit.

Beyond LLMs, there is a lot of AI that is behind the scenes that runs a big chunk of our society. There are assistance driving programs in a car, quick-turn MRI images, algorithms that drive social media—that’s all AI.

You have been vocal in arguing that LLMs can only get us so far. Do you think LLMs are overhyped these days? Can you summarize to our readers why you believe that LLMs are not enough?

There is a sense in which they have not been overhyped, which is that they are extremely useful to a lot of people, particularly if you write text, do research, or write code. LLMs manipulate language really well. But people have had this illusion, or delusion, that it is a matter of time until we can scale them up to having human-level intelligence, and that is simply false.

The truly difficult part is understanding the real world. This is the Moravec Paradox (a phenomenon observed by the computer scientist Hans Moravec in 1988): What’s easy for us, like perception and navigation, is hard for computers, and vice versa. LLMs are limited to the discrete world of text. They can’t truly reason or plan, because they lack a model of the world. They can’t predict the consequences of their actions. This is why we don’t have a domestic robot that is as agile as a house cat, or a truly autonomous car.

We are going to have AI systems that have humanlike and human-level intelligence, but they’re  not going to be built on LLMs, and it’s not going to happen next year or two years from now. It’s going to take a while. There are major conceptual breakthroughs that have to happen before we have AI systems that have human-level intelligence. And that is what I’ve been working on. And this company, AMI Labs, is focusing on the next generation.

And your solution is world models and JEPA architecture (JEPA, or “joint embedding predictive architecture,” is a learning framework that trains AI models to understand the world, created by LeCun while he was at Meta). What’s the elevator pitch?

The world is unpredictable. If you try to build a generative model that predicts every detail of the future, it will fail.  JEPA is not generative AI. It is a system that learns to represent videos really well. The key is to learn an abstract representation of the world and make predictions in that abstract space, ignoring the details you can’t predict. That’s what JEPA does. It learns the underlying rules of the world from observation, like a baby learning about gravity. This is the foundation for common sense, and it’s the key to building truly intelligent systems that can reason and plan in the real world. The most exciting work so far on this is coming from academia, not the big industrial labs stuck in the LLM world.

The lack of non-text data has been a problem in taking AI systems further in understanding the physical world. JEPA is trained on videos. What other kinds of data will you be using?

Our systems will be trained on video, audio, and sensor data of all kinds—not just text. We are working with various modalities, from the position of a robot arm to lidar data to audio. I’m also involved in a project using JEPA to model complex physical and clinical phenomena.

What are some of the concrete, real-world applications you envision for world models?

The applications are vast. Think about complex industrial processes where you have thousands of sensors, like in a jet engine, a steel mill, or a chemical factory. There is no technique right now to build a complete, holistic model of these systems. A world model could learn this from the sensor data and predict how the system will behave. Or think of smart glasses that can watch what you’re doing, identify your actions, and then predict what you’re going to do next to assist you. This is what will finally make agentic systems reliable. An agentic system that is supposed to take actions in the world cannot work reliably unless it has a world model to predict the consequences of its actions. Without it, the system will inevitably make mistakes. This is the key to unlocking everything from truly useful domestic robots to Level 5 autonomous driving.

Humanoid robots are all the rage recently, especially ones built by companies from China. What’s your take?

There are all these brute-force ways to get around the limitations of learning systems, which require inordinate amounts of training data to do anything. So the secret of all the companies getting robots to do kung fu or dance is they are all planned in advance. But frankly, nobody—absolutely nobody—knows how to make those robots smart enough to be useful. Take my word for it.

You need an enormous amount of tele-operation training data for every single task, and when the environment changes a little bit, it doesn’t generalize very well. What this tells us is we are missing something very big. The reason why a 17-year-old can learn to drive in 20 hours is because they already know a lot about how the world behaves. If we want a generally useful domestic robot, we need systems to have a kind of good understanding of the physical world. That’s not going to happen until we have good world models and planning.

There’s a growing sentiment that it’s becoming harder to do foundational AI research in academia because of the massive computing resources required. Do you think the most important innovations will now come from industry?

No. LLMs are now technology development, not research. It’s true that it’s very difficult for academics to play an important role there because of the requirements for computation, data access, and engineering support. But it’s a product now. It’s not something academia should even be interested in. It’s like speech recognition in the early 2010s—it was a solved problem, and the progress was in the hands of industry.

What academia should be working on is long-term objectives that go beyond the capabilities of current systems. That’s why I tell people in universities: Don’t work on LLMs. There is no point. You’re not going to be able to rival what’s going on in industry. Work on something else. Invent new techniques. The breakthroughs are not going to come from scaling up LLMs. The most exciting work on world models is coming from academia, not the big industrial labs. The whole idea of using attention circuits in neural nets came out of the University of Montreal. That research paper started the whole revolution. Now that the big companies are closing up, the breakthroughs are going to slow down. Academia needs access to computing resources, but they should be focused on the next big thing, not on refining the last one.

You wear many hats: professor, researcher, educator, public thinker … Now you just took on a new one. What is that going to look like for you?

I am going to be the executive chairman of the company, and Alex LeBrun [a former colleague from Meta AI] will be the CEO. It’s going to be LeCun and LeBrun—it’s nice if you pronounce it the French way.

I am going to keep my position at NYU. I teach one class per year, I have PhD students and postdocs, so I am going to be kept based in New York. But I go to Paris pretty often because of my lab.

Does that mean that you won’t be very hands-on?

Well, there&#39;s two ways to be hands-on. One is to manage people day to day, and another is to actually get your hands dirty in research projects, right?

I can do management, but I don&#39;t like doing it. This is not my mission in life. It’s really to make science and technology progress as far as we can, inspire other people to work on things that are interesting, and then contribute to those things. So that has been my role at Meta for the last seven years. I founded FAIR and led it for four to five years. I kind of hated being a director. I am not good at this career management thing. I&#39;m much more visionary and a scientist.

Alex is a serial entrepreneur; he’s built three successful AI companies. The first he sold to Microsoft; the second to Facebook, where he was head of the engineering division of FAIR in Paris. He then left to create Nabla, a very successful company in the health-care space. When I offered him the chance to join me in this effort, he accepted almost immediately. He has the experience to build the company, allowing me to focus on science and technology.

You’re headquartered in Paris. Where else do you plan to have offices?

We are a global company. There’s going to be an office in North America.

New York is great. That’s where I am, right? And it’s not Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley is a bit of a monoculture.

What about Asia? I’m guessing Singapore, too?

We don’t have any issue recruiting. There are a lot of people in the AI research community who think the future of AI is in world models. Those people, regardless of pay package, will be motivated to come work for us because they believe in the technological future we are building. We’ve already recruited people from places like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and xAI.

I heard that Saining Xie, a prominent researcher from NYU and Google DeepMind, might be joining you as chief scientist. Any comments?

Saining is a brilliant researcher. I have a lot of admiration for him. I hired him twice already. I hired him at FAIR, and I convinced my colleagues at NYU that we should hire him there. Let’s just say I have a lot of respect for him.

When will you be ready to share more details about AMI Labs, like financial backing or other core members?

Soon—in February, maybe. I’ll let you know.

            <h2>Rethinking AI’s future in an augmented workplace</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/21/1131366/rethinking-ais-future-in-an-augmented-workplace/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are many paths AI evolution could take. On one end of the spectrum, AI is dismissed as a marginal fad, another bubble fueled by notoriety and misallocated capital. On the other end, it’s cast as a dystopian force, destined to eliminate jobs on a large scale and destabilize economies. Markets oscillate between skepticism and the fear of missing out, while the technology itself evolves quickly and investment dollars flow at a rate not seen in decades.

All the while, many of today’s financial and economic thought leaders hold to the consensus that the financial landscape will stay the same as it has been for the last several years. Two years ago, Joseph Davis, global chief economist at Vanguard, and his team felt the same but wanted to develop their perspective on AI technology with a deeper foundation built on history and data. Based on a proprietary data set covering the last 130 years, Davis and his team developed a new framework, The Vanguard Megatrends Model, from research that suggested a more nuanced path than hype extremes: that AI has the potential to be a general purpose technology that lifts productivity, reshapes industries, and augments human work rather than displaces it. In short, AI will be neither marginal nor dystopian.

“Our findings suggest that the continuation of the status quo, the basic expectation of most economists, is actually the least likely outcome,” Davis says. “We project that AI will have an even greater effect on productivity than the personal computer did. And we project that a scenario where AI transforms the economy is far more likely than one where AI disappoints and fiscal deficits dominate. The latter would likely lead to slower economic growth, higher inflation, and increased interest rates.”

Davis does not sugar-coat it, however. Although AI promises economic growth and productivity, it will be disruptive, especially for business leaders and workers in knowledge sectors. “AI is likely to be the most disruptive technology to alter the nature of our work since the personal computer,” says Davis. “Those of a certain age might recall how the broad availability of PCs remade many jobs. It didn’t eliminate jobs as much as it allowed people to focus on higher value activities.”

The team’s framework allowed them to examine AI automation risks to over 800 different occupations. The research indicated that while the potential for job loss exists in upwards of 20% of occupations as a result of AI-driven automation, the majority of jobs—likely four out of five—will result in a mixture of innovation and automation. Workers’ time will increasingly shift to higher value and uniquely human tasks.

This introduces the idea that AI could serve as a copilot to various roles, performing repetitive tasks and generally assisting with responsibilities. Davis argues that traditional economic models often underestimate the potential of AI because they fail to examine the deeper structural effects of technological change. “Most approaches for thinking about future growth, such as GDP, don’t adequately account for AI,” he explains. “They fail to link short-term variations in productivity with the three dimensions of technological change: automation, augmentation, and the emergence of new industries.” Automation enhances worker productivity by handling routine tasks; augmentation allows technology to act as a copilot, amplifying human skills; and the creation of new industries creates new sources of growth.

Ironically, Davis’s research suggests that a reason for the relatively low productivity growth in recent years may be a lack of automation. Despite a decade of rapid innovation in digital and automation technologies, productivity growth has lagged since the 2008 financial crisis, hitting 50-year lows. This appears to support the view that AI’s impact will be marginal. But Davis believes that automation has been adopted in the wrong places. “What surprised me most was how little automation there has been in services like finance, health care, and education,” he says. “Outside of manufacturing, automation has been very limited. That’s been holding back growth for at least two decades.” The services sector accounts for more than 60% of US GDP and 80% of the workforce and has experienced some of the lowest productivity growth. It is here, Davis argues, that AI will make the biggest difference.

One of the biggest challenges facing the economy is demographics, as the Baby Boomer generation retires, immigration slows, and birth rates decline. These demographic headwinds reinforce the need for technological acceleration. “There are concerns about AI being dystopian and causing massive job loss, but we’ll soon have too few workers, not too many,” Davis says. “Economies like the US, Japan, China, and those across Europe will need to step up function in automation as their populations age.”

For example, consider nursing, a profession in which empathy and human presence are irreplaceable. AI has already shown the potential to augment rather than automate in this field, streamlining data entry in electronic health records and helping nurses reclaim time for patient care. Davis estimates that these tools could increase nursing productivity by as much as 20% by 2035, a crucial gain as health-care systems adapt to ageing populations and rising demand. “In our most likely scenario, AI will offset demographic pressures. Within five to seven years, AI’s ability to automate portions of work will be roughly equivalent to adding 16 million to 17 million workers to the US labor force,” Davis says. “That’s essentially the same as if everyone turning 65 over the next five years decided not to retire.” He projects that more than 60% of occupations, including nurses, family physicians, high school teachers, pharmacists, human resource managers, and insurance sales agents, will benefit from AI as an augmentation tool.

As AI technology spreads, the strongest performers in the stock market won’t be its producers, but its users. “That makes sense, because general-purpose technologies enhance productivity, efficiency, and profitability across entire sectors,” says Davis. This adoption of AI is creating flexibility for investment options, which means diversifying beyond technology stocks might be appropriate as reflected in Vanguard’s Economic and Market Outlook for 2026. “As that happens, the benefits move beyond places like Silicon Valley or Boston and into industries that apply the technology in transformative ways.” And history shows that early adopters of new technologies reap the greatest productivity rewards. “We’re clearly in the experimentation phase of learning by doing,” says Davis. “Those companies that encourage and reward experimentation will capture the most value from AI.”

Looking globally, Davis sees the United States and China as significantly ahead in the AI race. “It’s a virtual dead heat,” he says. “That tells me the competition between the two will remain intense.” But other economies, especially those with low automation rates and large service sectors, like Japan, Europe, and Canada, could also see significant benefits. “If AI is truly going to be transformative, three sectors stand out: health care, education, and finance,” says Davis. “For AI to live up to its potential, it must fundamentally reshape these industries, which face high costs and rising demand for better, faster, more personalized services.”

However, Davis says Vanguard is more bullish on AI’s potential to transform the economy than it was just a year ago. Especially since that transformation requires application beyond Silicon Valley. “When I speak to business leaders, I remind them that this transformation hasn’t happened yet,” says Davis. “It’s their investment and innovation that will determine whether it does.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Europe races into the AI era, its policymakers are laying new pipes for the continent’s digital future. The European Commission’s proposed Digital Networks Act (DNA) promises to rewire the EU’s telecom landscape, with big implications for artificial intelligence infrastructure, connectivity equity, and the startup ecosystem.

Exposed as part of a broader push to make Europe “fit for the Digital Age,” the draft law aims to modernize how networks are built and regulated, from 5G towers in rural villages to fiber links between data centers.

I have to say it’s a bold vision of a more connected, innovative Europe, but one that must navigate a thicket of competing interests and unanswered questions.

For years, EU leaders have urged the creation of a true single market for digital services. The DNA is a centerpiece of that strategy, aligning with Europe’s Digital Decade goals for universal high-speed internet by 2030.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

How can we translate this? Well, I think Brussels wants to turn the patchwork of 27 national telecom systems into one seamless network. The Act’s core objective is to “harmonise the EU connectivity sector by addressing delays, inconsistencies, and fragmentation”, removing barriers to cross-border operations and stimulating investment in very high-capacity networks.

This mirrors the logic behind earlier EU tech regulations;  just as the Digital Markets Act tackled Big Tech gatekeepers, the Digital Networks Act targets the digital plumbing beneath them.

This reform doesn’t come out of the blue.

A Commission white paper in 2024 warned that without cutting-edge digital infrastructure, Europe’s digital economy would stall. It painted vivid scenarios: doctors unable to perform remote surgery, smart farms and self-driving cars hamstrung by slow connections.

Secure and sustainable networks are one of the “cardinal points” of the EU’s 2030 digital agenda.

The DNA is Brussels’ attempt to meet those needs by boosting investment, standardizing rules, and making sure that every corner of Europe can plug into the opportunities of the digital age.

At its core, the Act hands telecom operators some long-sought gifts. One headline measure would grant carriers unlimited radio-spectrum licenses, ending the era of auctions that force telcos to periodically renew their rights.

For Europe’s big mobile providers, this change offers certainty: they can invest in 5G and future 6G networks without fearing their spectrum will expire.

Regulators argue this will “increase investment predictability” and accelerate network roll-out.

In theory, more cell towers could now reach remote areas, and companies might more freely trade or lease unused frequencies to new players.

The DNA couples permanent licenses with “use-it-or-share-it” obligations to prevent hoarding. If an incumbent isn’t using its spectrum in, say, a rural region, it could be forced to share it or lose it,  allowing a competitor or community network to serve that area.

It’s a nod to connectivity equity: Europe doesn’t want scarce wireless spectrum lying fallow while some communities remain underserved.

Broadband for all is the mantra, and long license tenures will come with accountability to deliver on coverage.

Another provision tightens the oversight of dominant firms. Under current plans, if a telecom operator holds significant market power (SMP) in one market (for example, fixed broadband), regulators could extend that designation to a closely related market (like mobile services).

In practice, this means big incumbents might face extra obligations, from transparency to price controls, across their range of services. The idea is to prevent giants from leveraging their dominance in one domain to squelch competition in another.

That could open space for smaller internet providers or innovative ISPs to compete, a boon for consumer choice and startup entrants.

A cohort of six member states,  including France, Germany and Italy, has pushed back, urging Brussels not to centralize control over frequencies and mergers.

Spectrum auctions have long been jealously guarded as national turf (they can fill state coffers, after all), and capitals are wary of one-size-fits-all rules emanating from the EU.

These governments also worry that encouraging pan-European telecom mergers (another idea floated in the reform) could reduce competition at home. In their joint memo, they caution that while a level playing field between telecoms and tech firms is a laudable goal, “this does not necessarily imply the same regulations should apply”to both sectors.

It’s a reminder that the DNA, for all its single-market ideals, must reckon with political realities: Europe’s telecom revolution won’t happen without consensus among very different national markets.

Perhaps the most contentious debate surrounding the Digital Networks Act has been over who pays for the next-generation networks. Telecom giants have spent years lobbying for a “fair share” contribution from Big Tech, arguing that bandwidth-hungry services like Netflix, YouTube, and cloud platforms should chip in to finance the infrastructure that carries their content.

The draft Act steers clear of any direct “network usage fee” on content providers. Instead, it reaffirms Europe’s commitment to net neutrality, the principle that all internet traffic must be treated equally by providers.

Any cooperation with Big Tech will rely on voluntary “best practice” discussions moderated by EU regulators, not on legally mandated payments.

This decision followed intense pushback from many sides. Over the summer, consumer groups and tech industry alliances publicly warned against reviving the “fair share” idea under any guise, noting it had been “clearly rejected in previous consultations” for threatening consumers, competition and innovation.

Even a U.S.–EU trade agreement in late 2025 extracted a pledge from Brussels “not [to] adopt or maintain network usage fees”, highlighting the geopolitical stakes of singling out mostly American tech firms.

On the other hand, startups and digital rights advocates breathed a sigh of relief at the Commission’s stance. Allied for Startups, a coalition of European entrepreneurs, argued that net neutrality is essential for startup growth, preventing a two-tier internet that would “favour dominant players” and raise barriers for newcomers.

In their view, a “traffic tax” isn’t just about Google or Amazon’s bottom line, it would set a harmful precedent that could box out the little guys who rely on affordable, equal-access bandwidth to innovate.

By keeping the DNA free of explicit network fees, Europe is signaling that the open internet won’t be collateral damage in the drive for better infrastructure.

Beyond telecom boardrooms and Silicon Valley balance sheets, the Digital Networks Act is ultimately about the kind of digital society Europe wants to build.

A major motivation is preparing for a future where artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and IoT devices are ubiquitous, and will demand unprecedented bandwidth and low latency.

The Commission’s own analysis stresses that only with the “highest performance” networks will transformative technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, remote health care, and smart grids reach their potential.

In simple terms: if data is the new oil, Europe needs better pipes to pump it.

The Digital Networks Act sits alongside Europe’s broader tech push by focusing on the infrastructure AI needs to scale. Beyond regulating AI, the EU is investing in next-generation networks, from fiber to 5G and 6G, through initiatives such as the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.

Faster rollout of these networks would underpin everything from AI-driven industry to cloud services, all of which depend on high-capacity, cross-border connectivity.

The Act also addresses connectivity equity. While Europe’s digital goals assume universal gigabit access and widespread 5G, large parts of the continent still lag behind.

The proposal combines simpler deployment rules with tougher coverage obligations, while allowing flexibility where older networks cannot yet be switched off. The aim is to expand access without letting rigid deadlines slow progress.

Whether this works will depend on execution. Investment still favors dense urban markets, and rural coverage remains a challenge. If the Act can meaningfully lift fiber and 5G reach across Europe, it could help ensure the AI economy extends beyond major tech hubs to the rest of the continent.

From the perspective of Europe’s startups and innovators, the DNA is a double-edged sword that tilts promisingly toward opportunity. On one side, the Act’s push to harmonize telecom rules could tear down barriers that have long frustrated young companies.

Today, a cloud services startup or an IoT device maker in Europe must navigate a maze of national regulations when scaling up, from differing network standards to separate certification hoops in each country.

By creating a more unified framework (for instance, common rules on spectrum and infrastructure access), the DNA could make it easier for a startup in Portugal to expand its services to Poland or Finland without running into 27 different regulatory roadblocks.

Startups rely on an open and predictable internet, and on this front the Commission’s approach offers some reassurance. By preserving net neutrality and rejecting new network tolls, the Act allows young companies to reach users on equal terms, without the risk that deeper-pocketed rivals can buy preferential treatment.

For small fintech or AI startups, avoiding additional network costs matters, and under the current proposal they won’t be asked to shoulder them.

At the same time, founders are reading the fine print carefully. Proposals around a “level playing field” raise concerns that telecom-style regulation could spill over onto digital services, including smaller platforms.

The balance remains fragile: regulate too little and dominant players squeeze out challengers; regulate too broadly and compliance costs can smother the next generation of European tech companies.

As an ambitious blueprint for Europe’s digital infrastructure, the Digital Networks Act embodies a careful balancing act. It must entice telecom operators to spend the billions needed to upgrade networks for an AI-driven future, yet not at the expense of the open internet or new challengers.

It seeks to unify Europe’s connectivity market while respecting that one size may not fit all in a Union of 27. In the coming months, EU lawmakers and member states will debate and tweak the proposal, and the stakes are high.

The outcome will shape not just who foots the bill for Europe’s next-gen networks, but also who can innovate on those networks in the years ahead.

There will be bumps on this road, resistance from powerful telecom lobbies, wrangling between capitals and Brussels, and possibly even transatlantic frictions.

In the end, the Digital Networks Act is about Europe’s place in the digital world. A continent that pioneered GSM mobile standards and championed data privacy now wants to set the standard for equitable, innovation-friendly networks.

Striking a balance between investment and fairness, between scale and competition, won’t be easy. But it’s essential. If the EU succeeds, the reward could be a resilient digital backbone capable of supporting AI breakthroughs and economic growth across all its regions, without leaving its core values behind.

If it stumbles, Europe risks buffering on the sidelines while others surge ahead.

The coming debate will reveal whether Europe can indeed reshape its digital DNA for the better, or if old divides will slow down this grand connectivity project.

Either way, the world will be watching the EU’s next move in this high-stakes telecom reboot.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Berlin’s energy transition sector got a defining boost today as Cloover, a climate fintech based in Berlin, announced it has secured more than $1.2 billion in total capital commitments, combining Series A equity and a substantial debt facility to accelerate the rollout of its software and financing platform across Europe.

The financing package includes €18.8 million (approximately $22 million) in Series A equity, led by MMC Ventures and QED Investors, with participation from Lowercarbon Capital, BNVT Capital, Bosch Ventures, Centrotec, and Earthshot Ventures.

Alongside that, a €1.02 billion debt facility provided by a major European bank will be deployed directly as customer and installer financing through Cloover’s platform, backed by a €300 million guarantee from the European Investment Fund to support scalable, low-cost lending for clean energy projects.

For a company that only a few years ago was in seed-stage fundraising, the scale of these commitments marks a striking shift. The debt element is operational capital designed to help manufacturers, installers, and homeowners finance solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and other distributed energy technologies under a single unified system.

Cloover was founded in 2023 by Jodok Betschart, Peder Broms, and Valentin Gönczy, who arrived at the idea after interviewing hundreds of installers across Europe and hearing the same frustrations: fragmented software stacks, manual processes, and limited access to project financing. They saw a structural gap in the energy transition; demand for decentralised power had surged, but the financing and platform infrastructure to scale it weren’t keeping pace.

That gap is what Cloover’s platform intends to close. At its core is an integrated operating system that combines workflow management, procurement, financing, energy optimisation, and risk analytics into one environment that serves all parts of the distributed energy value chain. Installers can offer financing at the point of sale, streamline operations, and reduce administrative drag.

Homeowners, in turn, gain access to installations with lower upfront costs and financing terms linked to projected energy savings rather than traditional credit scoring.

Some investors now call Cloover the “Shopify for energy”, a digital backbone that supports the entire process of deploying distributed energy systems at scale. The model is built around scalable capital deployment combined with end-to-end software automation, including AI-driven tools for underwriting and operations.
The timing of this financing is noteworthy.

Across Europe, demand for residential solar and decentralised energy solutions is accelerating as regulatory pressure, rising electricity prices, and broader electrification trends push households and businesses toward clean alternatives. Yet installers often struggle with financing bottlenecks. Cloover’s platform embeds capital directly into the sales workflow, turning financing from a hurdle into a built-in feature.

In a statement, CEO Jodok Betschart framed the new financing as a way to enable energy independence without the friction of upfront costs or complex loan applications, noting that the company’s AI operating system connects stakeholders across the value chain.

For European climate tech and energy markets, the scale of Cloover’s backing is remarkable. Few startups in this space have bridged software infrastructure and finance at this magnitude, and the size of the debt commitment signals deep lender confidence in distributed energy as a growth asset class.

It sets a potential precedent for how renewable energy projects can be financed and adopted more quickly across the region, something both policymakers and industry leaders have identified as essential to meeting the EU’s climate goals.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To many readers, this may sound like a paradox: how can knowledge ever become invaluable?

In this article, I want to explore how corporate knowledge, when poorly structured and rigidly transferred, can slowly transform from an asset into a disadvantage. Not only for companies, but especially for employees. And over time, that disadvantage compounds.

The journey usually looks familiar. You apply for a job, speak with a recruiter, send your CV, go through interviews, and eventually receive the green-light email: “Congratulations, you’re hired.”

This moment takes us directly to the real turning point: the onboarding process.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Those first one, two, sometimes even three months when you are introduced to the people, the tools, the workflows, the strategies, and the “way things are done.” On paper, onboarding exists to accelerate integration and performance. In reality, in many corporations, it quietly becomes an indoctrination phase.

Relatable to anyone who has worked in large organizations, onboarding often shifts from enabling understanding to enforcing conformity. New hires are not only taught what the company knows, but also what the company no longer questions.

This is where corporate knowledge starts becoming invaluable.

Because instead of acting as a foundation to build on, it becomes a ceiling.

It tells you what to do, how to do it, and more importantly, what not to rethink. Over time, this “do according to the manual” culture doesn’t just standardize execution. It standardizes thinking. And standardized thinking is the natural enemy of innovation.

History shows us a consistent pattern: breakthroughs rarely come from the center of an industry. They come from the edges.

Elon Musk was not an automotive executive. He treated cars as computers on wheels and energy systems. The result? An entire industry forced to reset its assumptions.

Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp were not transportation insiders. They were technologists. They saw GPS-enabled phones, invisible payments, and drivers that didn’t need to be owned. They reframed taxis not as a fleet problem, but as a software and trust problem. And the taxi industry, as it existed, effectively ended.

These examples point to a simple truth: transformative ideas usually emerge from new mental models, not from perfected manuals.

Yet most onboarding processes are designed to remove new mental models as quickly as possible.

They don’t ask: “What do you see that we no longer notice?”
 They ask: “How fast can you adapt to how we already work?”

Most programs teach tools, not systems. New hires learn where to click, not how to think. They are trained on CRMs, scripts, workflows, and reporting routines, but not on AI-assisted decision-making, signal-based prospecting, or how to design work alongside automated agents.

As a result, organizations scale activity instead of intelligence.

Even worse, onboarding still assumes that humans should work like software: following rigid processes, filling manual reports, executing predefined sequences. Instead of being taught how to orchestrate software, delegate to AI, and concentrate on judgment, creativity, and relationships.

Over time, this creates a paradoxical outcome: the more “knowledge” an organization accumulates, the harder it becomes for new ideas to survive inside it.

And when knowledge can no longer be challenged, recombined, or re-imagined, it stops being knowledge.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a Davos dominated by talk of tariffs, subsidies, and geopolitical risk, Europe used the stage to question its own economic limits. At the World Economic Forum, Ursula von der Leyen put forward one of the clearest signals yet that the European Union is preparing a structural shift in how it treats business, competitiveness, and economic power.

The phrase that stuck, “Europe Inc”, is not the name of a regulation, nor a new Brussels invention ready to roll out. It is a political framing for a shift that the European Commission wants to accelerate.

What Europe Inc actually refers to is an idea long discussed in EU policy circles and now pushed into the spotlight: the so-called 28th regime. An optional, EU-wide corporate framework that would sit alongside national systems and allow companies to operate across the bloc under a single legal structure.

The problem it is meant to solve is real and well-documented. Europe has a single market in theory, but in practice, companies still face 27 different company laws, registration processes, capital requirements, and administrative timelines. Startups incorporate in one country, then struggle to expand. Scaleups hit legal friction. Many leave.

The Commission’s answer is simplification through centralisation. Under the proposed 28th regime, entrepreneurs would be able to set up a company digitally, once and use that structure across the EU. One registration, one legal form, one set of rules. The ambition presented at Davos goes further: company creation within 48 hours, fully online.

That figure matters. It is also where political ambition risks being read as immediate reality.

The 48-hour setup is not in force. It is a target attached to a proposal that still needs to be formally drafted, negotiated, and approved by both the European Parliament and member states. Nothing in current EU law allows this yet. What exists is intent, not implementation.

Von der Leyen was explicit about why this push is happening now. Global conditions have hardened. Trade is increasingly weaponised. Industrial policy has returned, unapologetically, in the US and China.

Supply chain shocks and energy crises exposed Europe’s vulnerabilities. In that environment, regulatory fragmentation stops being a technical issue and becomes a strategic one.

Europe Inc is Brussels admitting that rules alone do not build power. Scale does. There is also a political recalibration underway. The EU has traditionally defined itself as a regulator first, a market shaper second.

The message from Davos suggests a change in emphasis: competitiveness, capital mobilisation, and strategic autonomy are moving closer to the centre of EU policymaking.

Still, limits remain. The 28th regime, as currently described, would be optional. It would not harmonise taxation overnight. Labour law, insolvency rules, and social policy remain largely national domains. Europe Inc would coexist with national systems, not replace them.

That coexistence is both its strength and its risk. Optional frameworks can attract fast-growing companies, but they can also deepen a two-speed Europe if not carefully designed. This tension is not resolved yet.

What Davos revealed is not a finished Europe Inc, but a Commission willing to say openly that Europe’s economic model, as it stands, is too slow for the world it operates in. Whether Europe Inc becomes a meaningful tool or another unrealised promise will depend less on slogans and more on legislation, compromise, and political courage across 27 capitals.

For now, Europe Inc is best understood as a warning shot. Europe intends to compete as a bloc, not as a collection of administrative borders. The clock, as von der Leyen implied, is already running.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/odoo-tops-7-billion-valuation">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian business software company Odoo, also a unicorn, has reached a fresh milestone. Growth investor General Atlantic has increased its stake in the firm, buying additional shares from regional backer Wallonie Entreprendre and pushing Odoo’s valuation to roughly €7 billion.

This move isn’t a typical funding round where a company raises new capital. Instead, it’s a secondary transaction: General Atlantic bought existing shares that were previously held by Wallonie Entreprendre, the investment arm of Belgium’s Walloon region. After the deal, Wallonie Entreprendre still holds about 3 % of the company.

Odoo was founded in 2002 in Belgium and has grown steadily from a small project into a global software platform. It offers an integrated suite of business applications used by small and medium-sized enterprises for everything from finance and sales to HR and marketing.

The software is built on an open-core model that encourages developers around the world to build add-on apps, creating a vast ecosystem of nearly 40,000 extensions.

Today, Odoo counts more than 170,000 paying customers in around 180 countries. That global footprint and the steady revenue growth it has delivered helped convince General Atlantic to deepen its involvement.

Since first investing in the company in 2023, the firm has supported Odoo’s expansion into new markets and helped refine its commercial strategy.

Part of what makes this update noteworthy is how Odoo has expanded its product offerings. Its newest versions include AI-infused features and automation tools that make the suite more attractive to businesses looking to replace outdated, fragmented systems with a single, unified digital platform.

For the European tech scene, this development highlights a shift in how successful software companies grow and attract capital. Rather than chasing quick exits or IPOs, some founders are choosing secondary share deals to let early investors realise gains while keeping strategic control.

That path can make it easier for companies to stay private longer and focus on building value over time.

I don’t know what is happening in Belgium or what they are having for breakfast, but the country itself has quietly become a place where software businesses can scale internationally.

Odoo is one of its standout success stories, showing that strong product focus, community-driven development, and global reach can win serious backing from major growth investors.

            <div id="article-text">For a long time, tech events were built around scale. The bigger the crowd, the stronger the perception of success. Attendance numbers became a proxy for impact, and festivals grew year after year because that was what the industry expected.

That model no longer fits how tech leaders work today.

Over the past years, I have spent time in conversations with founders, executives, and operators who carry real responsibility inside their organizations. As a community builder, I often speak with them before they commit to attending events. Their questions are direct. They want to know who will be in the room, how discussions are structured, and whether the environment allows honest exchange.

Almost none of them ask how many people will attend.

This is a meaningful signal. Leaders who run companies do not optimize for visibility. They already have it. They want rooms where time leads to insight, clarity, and decisions.

As CEO of Tekpon AI Summit, I have had a front row seat to how decision makers actually want to engage today. I have watched what happens on large stages. I have also watched what happens when ten relevant people sit around one table with no audience and no agenda beyond honest discussion.

The difference in outcome is hard to ignore. In small rooms, people speak openly. They share challenges they would never publish. They explore partnerships without formalities. They make decisions faster because trust forms naturally when everyone present has earned their place in the conversation.

In larger settings, the dynamic changes. Conversations stay cautious. Stories become polished. The real questions are postponed, usually for later. Later often disappears into busy schedules.

Large conferences still play a role. They introduce new voices to the ecosystem. They create energy. They give exposure to early-stage founders. That contribution remains valuable.

But they are no longer where serious business gets done.

The work that shapes companies happens in environments where attention is protected and trust forms quickly. Where people can speak without performing. Where context is shared. Where participants know that what is said in the room stays in the room. These conditions are difficult to build at a mass scale and natural in small, curated settings.

This has already changed how senior decision makers allocate their time. Many are reducing their presence at large events. They are choosing closed discussions, private dinners, and carefully selected gatherings where every participant has a reason to be there. They are not rejecting conferences. They are rejecting formats that do not respect their attention.

The industry is slow to react to this shift. Event strategies still chase attendance growth, sponsorship volume, and social media reach. Meanwhile, the people shaping companies are quietly changing their behavior. They are voting with their calendars.

This gap will continue to widen. Events that optimize for volume will struggle to attract senior leaders. Once you see this up close, it becomes hard to unsee. The criteria for choosing where to meet have changed. Not loudly, not publicly, but consistently.

Some will still chase scale. Others will keep building large festivals and broad platforms. There is nothing wrong with that. But the people shaping companies are already making different choices. They are selecting rooms where conversations move faster, trust forms naturally, and time feels respected.

That is where tech leaders now choose to meet.
