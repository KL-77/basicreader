            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Black holes have long captured the imagination of both scientists and the general public. These exotic objects—once thought to be merely hypothetical—have also conceptually inspired countless artists all over the world. A generous sampling of such work is featured in Conjuring the Void: The Art of Black Holes.

Author Lynn Gamwell spent ten years as director of the New York Academy of Science’s Gallery of Art and Science. She has an extensive background writing about the intersection of math, art, and science. So she was a natural choice to speak at the annual conference of Harvard’s interdisciplinary Black Hole Initiative a few years ago. Gamwell focused her talk on the art of black holes, and thus the seeds for what would become Conjuring the Void were sown.

“I was just astounded at how much art there is [about black holes], and I was specifically interested in Asian art,” Gamwell told Ars. “There’s just something about the concept of a black hole that resonates with the Eastern tradition. So many of the themes—the science of black holes, void, nothingness, being inescapable—relate to the philosophy of Buddhism and Taoism and so on.”

Gamwell opens the book by chronologically summarizing key developments in the science of black holes, from Isaac Newton and John Mitchell’s 1783 concept of “dark stars,” to the predictions of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity and such Nobel Prize-winning discoveries as the LIGO collaboration’s 2016 detection of gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes, and the Event Horizon Telescope’s first image of a black hole in 2019. That discussion provides a springboard to showcase all the examples of black-hole-inspired art Gamwell unearthed during her research, from early 20th century illustrations to cutting-edge contemporary art.

Gamwell sees echoes of Mitchell’s dark stars, for instance, in Edgar Allan Poe’s short story, “A Descent Into the Maelstrom,” particularly the evocative 1919 illustration by Harry Clarke. “This seemed to have been an early analogy to a black hole for many people when the concept was first proposed,” said Gamwell. “It’s a mathematical construct at that point and it’s very difficult to imagine a mathematical construct. Poe actually envisioned a dark star [elsewhere in his writings].”

The featured art spans nearly every medium: charcoal sketches, pen-and-ink drawings, oil or acrylic paintings, murals, sculptures, traditional and digital photography, and immersive room-sized multimedia installations, such as a 2021-2022 piece called Gravitational Arena by Chinese artist Xu Bing. “Xu Bing does most of his work about language,” said Gamwell. For Gravitational Arena, “He takes a quote about language from Wittgenstein and translates it into his own script, the English alphabet written to resemble Chinese characters. Then he applies gravity to it and makes a singularity. [The installation] is several stories high and he covered the gallery floor with a mirror. So you walk upstairs and you see it’s like a wormhole, which he turns into an analogy for translation.”

“Anything in the vicinity of a black hole is violently torn apart owing to its extreme gravity—the strongest in the universe,” Gamwell writes about the enduring appeal of black holes as artistic inspiration. “We see this violence in the works of artists like Cai Guo-­ Qiang and Takashi Murakami, who have used black holes to symbolize the brutality unleashed by the atomic bomb. The inescapable pull of a black hole is also a ready metaphor for depression in the work of artists such as Moonassi. Thus, on the one hand, the black hole provides artists with a symbol to express the devastations and anxieties of the modern world. On the other hand, however, a black hole’s extreme gravity is the source of stupendous energy, and artists such as Yambe Tam invite viewers to embrace darkness as a path to transformation, awe, and wonder.”</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/in-the-90s-wing-commander-privateer-made-me-realize-what-kind-of-games-i-love/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Ever since 1993, I think I’ve unconsciously judged almost every game by how well it can capture how Wing Commander: Privateer made me feel.

Steam and PlayStation (the two platforms I use the most) have been doing a year-in-review summary akin to the wildly popular Spotify Wrapped for the past few years. Based on these, I can report that my most-played games in 2025 were, from most hours down:

With the exceptions of Civilization VII and Unreal Tournament, every one of those games is some kind of open-world experience that’s all about immersing you in a far-flung land (or galaxy).

I like what I like, and my knowing that’s what I like began in the early 1990s with Wing Commander: Privateer.

Privateer taught me that I love games that are spaces for living out whatever fictional life I create for myself much more than I love games that are guiding me through an authored story and a series of carefully designed challenges.

Yes, it has a story and story missions, but they’re hardly the point, partly because they’re not really that good. What’s exciting about this game is exploring new systems, seeing the beautiful CG artwork for their settlements, learning about your ships’ capabilities and upgrading them slowly over time, and attaining mastery of the pseudo-simulated economy.

The story that matters in Privateer is the story I am telling myself in my head. To this day, the games I most love offer at least a taste of that experience.

To say this game was influential on later titles would be an understatement, but we, of course, have to acknowledge that this formula was originally popularized by 1984’s Elite. Privateer just married that formula with Wing Commander‘s universe and flight mechanics, with a far more hand-crafted setting. That setting is key, though. I like the original Elite, and this certainly wasn’t the case back in the mid-’80s, but today, it plays like a tech demo for what’s to come.

Privateer was the full package. Later, we got the X series, EVE Online, Elite Dangerous, Starfield, and even No Man’s Sky, a game I love so much I’m literally writing the book on it.

None of those games was made by Privateer lead Chris Roberts, of course. He would go on to work on Freelancer, probably the most accessible space trading/pirating game ever made, and an underappreciated gem, even if it didn’t live up to the hype that surrounded it. (Roberts left the project mid-way, and it was finished by others who dropped many of his impossibly ambitious ideas for it.)

Now we have Star Citizen. We here at Ars have covered that game as much as anybody, and it’s fair to say a lot of the coverage has not been positive. I won’t retread all that drama here; if you know, you know, and if you don’t, it’s easy to dig up.

But all that is to say that there are few space games today that aren’t directly inspired by Wing Commander: Privateer, and Privateer inspired me too: it inspired me to love sandbox and open-world games.

It’s odd that a game that was so heavily inspired by a title almost a decade its senior (Elite) still managed to be ahead of its time, and maybe that says as much for Elite as it does for Privateer

Privateer was re-released with Windows support via GOG in 2011, but it took me until recently to revisit it for the first time since the 1990s. Yes, it has ancient graphics now, but they’re endemic to a particular era of PC game graphics that I find extremely nostalgic, so they work for me.

In terms of mechanics and systems, everything Privateer does is done far better and to greater depths by at least one later space game. And to boot, it has more friction and frustrations, and while the game is ultimately pretty easy once you get the hang of it, it’s hard to learn.

But like Freelancer after it, it hits a sweet spot balancing all these aspects that makes it still stand out. Elite Dangerous is the best at the simulation and economy aspects, Star Citizen has more impressively realized ships and settlements, and No Man’s Sky is more accessible while still delivering on the fantasy (and it offers a much wider range of activities).

I don’t know if it’s just nostalgia for that aforementioned 1990s DOS game aesthetic speaking, though, but I’m of the opinion that none of Privateer‘s spiritual successors have matched the character and draw of its setting. Seeing this side of the Wing Commander universe is a treat, and I feel that not even modern games that were entirely about having that same sense of culture and place (like Starfield, for example) don’t quite get there.

I’d be curious how it reads to people who never played it back in the day, though. Like I said, this is a pantheon game for me. If someone who plays Elite Dangerous, Starfield, Star Citizen, or No Man’s Sky today goes back and tries Wing Commander: Privateer out, does it hold up for them, too?

If that describes you and you give it a shot, let me know.

            <div id="article-text">When we put together our top 20 games of last year, we specifically called out Civilization 7, Avowed, Doom: The Dark Ages, and Grand Theft Auto 6 as big franchise games we were already looking forward to for 2025. While one of those games has been delayed into 2026, the three others made this year’s list of Ars’ favorite games as expected. They join a handful of other highly anticipated sequels, ranging from big-budget blockbusters to long-gestating indies, on the “expected” side of this year’s list.

But the games that really stood out for me in 2025 were the ones that seemed to come out of nowhere. Those range from hard-to-categorize roguelike puzzle games to a gonzo, punishing mountainous walking simulation, the best Geometry Wars clone in years, and a touching look at the difficulties of adolescence through the surprisingly effective lens of mini-games.

As we look toward 2026, there are plenty of other big-budget projects that the industry is busy preparing for (the delayed Grand Theft Auto VI chief among them). If next year is anything like this year, though, we can look forward to plenty more games that no one saw coming suddenly vaulting into view as new classics.

When I was younger, I wanted—and expected—virtually every game I played to blow me away with something I’d not seen before. It was easier to hit that bar in the ’90s, when both the design and technology of games were moving at an incredible pace.

Now, as someone who still games in his 40s, I’m excited to see that when it happens, but I don’t expect it, Now, I increasingly appreciate games that act as a sort of comfort food, and I value some games as much for their familiarity as I do their originality.

That’s what Assassin’s Creed Shadows is all about (as I wrote when it first came out). It follows a well-trodden formula, but it’s a beautifully polished version of that formula. Its world is grand and escapist, its audio and graphics presentation is immersive, and it makes room for many different playstyles and skill levels.

If your idea of a good time is “be a badass, but don’t think too hard about it,” Shadows is one of the best Assassin’s Creed titles in the franchise’s long history. It doesn’t reinvent any wheels, but after nearly two decades of Assassin’s Creed, it doesn’t really need to; the new setting and story are enough to separate it, while the gameplay remains familiar.

No game this year has made me feel as hated as Avowed. As an envoy for the far-off Aedryan empire, your role in Avowed is basically to be hated, either overtly or subtly, by almost everyone you encounter in the wild, semi-colonized world of the Living Lands. The low-level hum of hatred and mistrust from the citizens permeates everything you do in the game, which is an unsettling feeling in a genre usually characterized by the moral certitude of heroes fighting world-ending evil.

Role-playing aside, Avowed is helpfully carried by its strong action-packed combat system, characterized as it is by thrilling moment-to-moment positional jockeying and the juggling of magic spells, ranged weapons, and powerful close-range melee attacks. The game’s quest system also does a good job of letting players balance this combat difficulty for themselves—if a goal is listed with three skull symbols on your menu, you’d best put it off until you’ve leveled up a little bit more.

I can take or leave the mystical mumbo-jumbo-filled subplot surrounding your status as a “godlike” being that can converse with spirits. Aside from that, though, I’ve never had so much fun being hated.

The term “walking simulator” often gets thrown around in some game criticism circles as a derisive term for a title that’s about nothing more than walking around and looking at stuff. While Baby Steps might technically fit into that “walking simulator” model, stereotyping it in that way does this incredibly inventive game a disservice.

It starts with the walking itself, which requires meticulous, rhythmic manipulation of both shoulder buttons and both analog sticks just to stay upright. Super Mario 64, this ain’t. But what starts as a struggle to take just a few short steps quickly becomes almost habitual, much like learning to walk in real life.

The game then starts throwing new challenges at your feet. Slippery surfaces. Narrow stairways with tiny footholds. Overhangs that block your ridiculously useless, floppy upper body. The game’s relentless mountain is designed such that a single missed step can ruin huge chunks of progress, in the proud tradition of Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy.

This all might sound needlessly cruel and frustrating, but trust me, it’s worth sticking with to the end. That’s in part for the feeling of accomplishment when you do finally make it past that latest seemingly impossible wall, and partly to experience an absolutely gonzo story that deals directly and effectively with ideas of masculinity, perseverance, and society itself. You’ll never be so glad to take that final step.

The idea of bouncing a ball against a block is one of the most tried-and-true in all of gaming, from the basic version in the ancient Breakout to the number-filled angles of Holedown. But perhaps no game has made this basic concept as compulsively addictive as Ball x Pit.

Here, the brick-breaking genre is crossed with the almost as storied shoot-em-up, with the balls serving as your weapons and the blocks as enemies that march slowly but relentlessly from the top of the screen to the bottom. The key to destroying those blocks all in time is bouncing your growing arsenal of new balls at just the right angles to maximize their damage-dealing impact and catching them again so you can throw them once more that much faster.

Like so many roguelikes before it, Ball x Pit uses randomization as the core of its compulsive loop, letting you choose from a wide selection of new abilities and ball-based attacks as you slowly level up. But Ball x Pit goes further than most in letting you fuse and combine those balls into unique combinations that take dozens of runs to fully uncover and combine effectively.

Add in a deep system of semi-permanent upgrades (with its own intriguing “bounce balls around a city builder” mini game) and a deep range of more difficult settings and enemies to slowly unlock, and you have a game whose addictive pull will last much longer than you might expect from the simple premise.

Usually, when formulating a list like this, you can compare a title to an existing game or genre as a shorthand to explain what’s going on to newcomers. That’s nearly impossible with Blue Prince, a game that combines a lot of concepts to defy easy comparison to games that have come before it.

At its core, Blue Prince is about solving the mysteries of a house that you build while exploring it, drafting the next room from a selection of three options every time you open a new door. Your initial goal, if you can call it that, is to discover and access the mysterious “Room 46” that apparently exists somewhere on the 45-room grid. And while the houseplan you’re building resets with every in-game day, the knowledge you gain from exploring those rooms stays with you, letting you make incremental progress on a wide variety of puzzles and mysteries as you rebuild the mansion from scratch again and again.

What starts as a few simple and relatively straightforward puzzles quickly unfolds fractally into a complex constellation of conundrums, revealed slowly through scraps of paper, in-game books, inventory items, interactive machinery, and incidental background elements. Figuring out the more intricate mysteries of the mansion requires careful observation and, often, filling a real-life mad scientist’s notepad with detailed notes that look incomprehensible to an outsider. All the while, you have to manage each day’s limited resources and luck-of-the-draw room drafting to simply find the right rooms to make the requisite progress.

Getting to that storied Room 46 is enough to roll the credits on Blue Prince, and it serves as an engaging enough puzzle adventure in its own right. But that whole process could be considered a mere tutorial for a simply massive endgame, which is full of riddles that will perplex even the most experienced puzzlers while slowly building a surprisingly deep story of political intrigue and spycraft through some masterful environmental storytelling.

Some of those extreme late-game puzzles might be too arcane for their own good, honestly, and will send many players scrambling for a convenient guide or wiki for some hints. But even after playing for over 100 hours over two playthroughs, I’m pretty sure I’m still not done exploring all that Blue Prince has to offer.

This one will be controversial: I love Civilization VII.

Civilization VII launched as a bit of a mess. There were bugs and UI shortcomings aplenty. Most (but not all) of those have been addressed in the months since, but they’re not the main reason this is a tricky pick.

The studio behind the Civilization franchise, Firaxis, has long said it has a “33/33/33″ approach to sequels in the series, wherein 33 percent of the game should be familiar systems, 33 percent should be remixes or improvements of familiar systems, and 33 percent should be entirely new systems.

Critics of Civilization VII say Firaxis broke that 33/33/33 rule by overweighting the last 33 percent, mainly to chase innovations in the 4X genre by other games (like Humankind). I don’t disagree, but I also welcome it.

Credit is due to the team at Firaxis for ingeniously solving some longstanding design problems in the franchise, like using the new age transitions to curb snowballing and to expunge systems that become a lot less fun in the late game than they are in the beginning. Judged on its own terms, Civilization VII is a deep, addictive, and fun strategy game that I’ve spent more than 100 hours playing this year.

My favorite Civ game remains Civilization IV, but that game still runs fine on modern systems, is infinitely replayable out of the box, and enjoys robust modding support. I simply didn’t need more of the same from this particular franchise; to me, VII coexists with IV and others on my hard drive—very different flavors of the same idea.

I’m not sure I like what my minor CloverPit obsession says about me. When I fell into a deep Balatro hole last year, I could at least delude myself into thinking there was some level of skill in deciding which jokers to buy and sell, which cards to add or prune from my deck, and which cards to hold and discard. In the end, though, I was as beholden to the gods of random number generation as any other Balatro player.

Cloverpit makes the surrender to the vagaries of luck all the more apparent, replacing the video-poker-like systems of Balatro with a “dumb” slot machine whose handle you’re forced to pull over and over again. Sure, there are still decisions to make, mostly regarding which lucky charms you purchase from a vending machine on the other side of the room. And there is some skill involved in learning and exploiting lucky charm synergies to extract the highest expected value from those slot machine pulls.

Once you’ve figured out those basic strategies, though, CloverPit mostly devolves into a series of rerolls waiting for the right items to show up in the shop in the right order. Thankfully, the game hides plenty of arcane secrets beneath its charming PS1-style spooky-horror presentation, slowly revealing new items and abilities that hint that something deeper than just accumulating money might be the game’s true end goal.

It’s this creepy vibe and these slowly unfolding secrets that have compelled me to pour dozens of hours into what is, in the end, just a fancy slot machine simulator. God help me.

Jenny Jiao Hsia, AP Thomson; Windows, MacOS

Jenny is your average suburban Asian-American teenager, struggling to balance academic achievement, chores, an overbearing mother, romantic entanglements, and a healthy body image. What sounds like the premise for a cliché young adult novel actually serves to set up a compelling interactive narrative disguised as a mere mini-game collection.

Consume Me brilliantly integrates the conflicting demands placed on Jenny’s time and attention into the gameplay itself. Creating a balanced meal, for instance, becomes a literal test of balancing vaguely Tetris-shaped pieces of food on a tray, satisfying your hunger and caloric limits at the same time. Chores take up time but give you money you can spend on energy drinks that let you squeeze in more activities by staying up late (but can lead to debilitating headaches). A closet full of outfits becomes an array of power-ups to your time, energy, or focus.

It takes almost preternatural resource management skills and mini-game execution to satisfy all the expectations being placed on you, which is kind of the meta-narrative point. No matter how well you do, Jenny’s story develops in a way that serves as a touching semi-autobiographical look at the life of co-creator Jenny Jiao Hsia. That biography is made all the more sympathetic here for an interactive presentation that’s more engaging than any young adult novel could be.

Death Stranding 2: On the Beach should not be fun. Much like its predecessor, the latest release from famed game designer Hideo Kojima is about delivering packages—at least on the surface. Yet the process of planning your routes, managing inventory, and exploring an unfathomably strange post-apocalyptic world remains a winning formula.

The game again follows Sam Porter Bridges (played by Norman Reedus) on his quest to reconnect the world as humanity faces possible extinction. And yes, that means acting like a post-apocalyptic Amazon Prime. Standing in the way of an on-time delivery are violent raiders, dangerous terrain, and angry, disembodied spirits known as Beached Things.

It’s common to hear Death Stranding described as a walking simulator, and there is indeed a lot of walking, but the sequel introduces numerous quality-of-life improvements that make it more approachable. Death Stranding 2 has a robust fast-travel mechanic and better vehicles to save you from unnecessary marches, and the inventory management system is less clunky. That’s important in a game that asks you to traverse an entire continent to deliver cargo.

Beyond the core gameplay loop of stacking heavy boxes on your back, Death Stranding 2 has all the Kojima vibes you could want. There are plenty of quirky gameplay mechanics and long cutscenes that add depth to the characters and keep the story moving. The world of Death Stranding has been designed from the ground up around the designer’s flights of fancy, and it works—even the really weird stuff almost makes sense!

Along the way, Death Stranding 2 has a lot to say about grief, healing, and the value of human connection. The game’s most poignant cutscenes are made all the more memorable by an incredible soundtrack, and we cannot oversell the strength of the mocap performances.

It may take 100 hours or more to experience everything the game has to offer, but it’s well worth your time.

Since the days of Donkey Kong Country, I’ve always felt that Mario’s original ape antagonist wasn’t really up for anchoring a Mario-level platform franchise. Donkey Kong Bananza is the first game to really make me doubt that take.

Bonanza is a great showcase for the new, more powerful hardware on the Switch 2, with endlessly destructible environments that send some impressive-looking shiny shrapnel flying when they’re torn apart. It can’t be understated how cathartic it is to pound tunnels up, down, and through pretty much every floor, ceiling, and wall you see, mashing the world itself to suit your needs.

Bonanza also does a good job aping Super Mario Odyssey’s tendency to fill practically every square inch of space with collectible doodads and a wide variety of challenges. This is not a game where you need to spend a lot of time aimlessly wandering for the next thing to do—there’s pretty much always something interesting around the next corner until the extreme end game.

Sure, the camera angles and frame rate might suffer a bit during the more chaotic bits. But it’s hard to care when you’re having this much fun just punching your way through Bananza’s imaginative, colorful, and malleable world.

For a series that has always been about dodging, Doom: The Dark Ages is much more about standing your ground. The game’s key verbs involve raising your shield to block incoming attacks or, ideally, parrying them back in the direction they came.

It’s a real “zig instead of zag” moment for the storied Doom series, and it does take some getting used to. Overall, though, I had a great time mixing in turtle-style blocking with the habitual pattern of circling-strafing around huge groups of enemies in massive arenas and quickly switching between multiple weapons to deal with them as efficiently as possible. While I missed the focus on extreme verticality of the last two Doom games, I appreciate the new game’s more open-world design, which gives completionist players a good excuse to explore every square inch of these massive environments for extra challenges and hidden collectibles.

The only real problem with Doom: The Dark Ages comes when the game occasionally transitions to a slow-paced mech-style demon battle or awkward flying dragon section, sometimes for entire levels at a time. Those variations aside, I came away very satisfied with the minor change in focus for a storied shooter series.

Anyone who has read my book-length treatise on Minesweeper knows I’m a sucker for games that involve hidden threats within a grid of revealed numbers. But not all variations on this theme are created equal. Dragonsweeper stands out from the crowd by incorporating a simple but arcane world of RPG-style enemies and items into its logical puzzles.

Instead of simply counting the number of nearby mines, each number revealed on the Dragonsweeper grid reflects the total health of the surrounding enemies, both seen and unseen. Attacking those enemies means enduring predictable counterattacks that deplete your limited health bar, which you can grow through gradual leveling until you’re strong enough to kill the game’s titular dragon, taunting you from the center of the field.

Altogether, it adds an intriguing new layer to the logical deduction, forcing you to carefully manage your moves to maximize the impact of your attacks and the limited health-restoring items scattered throughout the field. And while finishing one run isn’t too much of a challenge, completing the game’s optional achievements and putting together a “perfect” game score is enough to keep puzzle lovers coming back for hours and hours of compelling logical deduction.

At first blush, Nightreign feels like a twisted perversion of everything that has made FromSoft’s Souls series so compelling for so many years. What was a slow-paced, deliberate open-world RPG has become a game about quickly sprinting across a quickly contracting map, leveling up as quickly as possible before taking on punishing bosses. A moody solitary experience has become one that practically requires a group of three players working together. It’s like an Elden Ring-themed amusement park that seems to miss the point of the original.

Let the purists belly ache about how it’s not really Elden Ring. They’re right, but they’re missing the point. Nightreign condenses the general vibe of the Elden Ring world into something very different but no less enjoyable. What’s more, it packs that vibe into a tight experience that can be easily squeezed into a 45-minute sprint rather than requiring dozens of hours of deep exploration.

That makes it the perfect excuse to get together with a few like-minded Elden Ring-loving friends, throw on a headset, and just tear through the Lands Between together for the better part of an evening. As Elden Ring theme parks go, you could do a lot worse.

Ghost of Yotei from Sucker Punch Productions starts as a revenge tale, featuring hard-as-nails Atsu on the hunt for the outlaws who murdered her family. While there is plenty of revenge to be had in the lands surrounding Mount Yotei, the people Atsu meets and the stories they have to tell make this more than a two-dimensional quest for blood.

The game takes place on the northern Japanese island of Ezo (modern-day Hokkaido) several centuries after the developer’s last samurai game, Ghost of Tsushima. It has a lot in common with that title, but Ghost of Yotei was built for the PS5 and features a massive explorable world and stunning visuals. It’s easy to get sidetracked from your quest just exploring Ezo and tinkering with the game’s photo mode.

The land of Ezo avoids some of the missteps seen in other open-world games. While it’s expansive and rich with points of interest, exploring it is not tedious. There are no vacuous fetch quests or mindless collecting (or loading screens, for that matter). Even when you think you know what you’re going to find at a location, you may be surprised. The interesting side quests and random encounters compel you to keep exploring Ezo.

Ghost of Yotei’s combat is just as razor-sharp as its exploration. It features multiple weapon types, each with unlockable abilities and affinities that make them ideal for taking on certain foes. Brute force will only get you so far, though. You need quick reactions to parry enemy attacks and strike back—it’s challenging and rewarding but not frustrating.

It’s impossible to play Ghost of Yotei without becoming invested in the journey, and a big part of that is thanks to the phenomenal voice work of Erika Ishii as Atsu. Some of the game’s pivotal moments will haunt you, but luckily, the developer has just added a New Game+ mode so you can relive them all again.

There’s a moment in the second section of Hades 2 where you start to hear a haunting melody floating through the background. That music gets louder and louder until you reach the game’s second major boss, a trio of sirens that go through a full rock-opera showtune number as you dodge their bullet-hell attacks and look for openings to go in for the kill. That three-part musical presentation slowly dwindles to a solo as you finally dispatch the sirens one by one, restoring a surprisingly melancholy silence once more.

It’s this and other musical moments casually and effortlessly woven through Hades 2 that will stick with me the most. But the game stands on its own beyond the musicality, expanding the original game’s roguelike action with a compelling new spell system that lets you briefly capture or slow enemies in a binding circle. This small addition adds a new sense of depth to the moment-to-moment positional dance that was already so compelling in the original Hades.

Hades 2 also benefits greatly from the introduction of Melinoe, a compelling new protagonist who gets fleshed out through her relationship with the usual rogue’s gallery of gods and demigods. Come for her quest of self-discovery, stay for the moments of musical surprise.

A quickie sequel in the year or two after Hollow Knight’s out-of-nowhere success in 2017 might have been able to get away with just being a more-of-the-same glorified expansion pack. But after over eight years of overwhelming anticipation from fans, Silksong had to really be something special to live up to its promise.

Luckily, it is. Silksong is a beautiful expansion of the bug-scale underground universe created in the first game. Every new room is a work of painterly beauty, with multiple layers of detailed 2D art drawing you further into its intricate and convincing fallen world.

The sprawling map seems to extend forever in every direction, circling back around and in on itself with plenty of optional alleyways in which to get lost searching for rare power-ups. And while the game is a punishingly hard take on action platforming, there’s usually a way around the most difficult reflex tests for players willing to explore and think a bit outside the box.

Even players who hit a wall and never make it through the sprawling tunnels of Silksong’s labyrinthine underground will still find plenty of memorable moments in whatever portion of the game they do experience.

In a real-time-strategy genre that can often feel too bloated and complex for its own good, The King Is Watching is a streamlined breath of fresh air. Since the entire game takes place on a single screen, there’s no need to constantly pan and zoom your camera around a sprawling map. Instead, you can stay laser-focused on your 5×5 grid of production space and on which portion of it is actively productive under the king’s limited gaze at any particular moment.

Arranging tiles to maximize that production of basic resources and military units quickly becomes an all-consuming juggling act, requiring constant moment-to-moment decisions that can quickly cascade through a run. I’m also a big fan of the game’s self-selecting difficulty system, which asks you to choose how many enemies you think you can take in coming waves, doling out better rewards for players who are willing to push themselves to the limit of their current capabilities.

The bite-size serving of a single King Is Watching run ensures that even failure doesn’t feel too crushing. And success brings with it just enough in the way of semi-permanent ability expansions to encourage another run where you can reach even greater heights of production and protection.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance was a slog that I had to will myself to complete. It was sometimes a broken and janky game, but despite its warts, I saw the potential for something special. And that’s what its sequel, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, has delivered.

While it’s still a slow burn, the overall experience has been greatly refined, the initial challenge has been smoothed out, and I’ve rarely been more immersed in an RPG’s storytelling. There’s no filler, as every story beat and side quest offers a memorable tale that further paints the setting and characters of medieval Bohemia.

Unlike most RPGs, there’s no magic to be had, which is a big part of the game’s charm. As Henry of Skalitz, you are of meager social standing, and many characters you speak to will be quick to remind you of it. While Henry is a bit better off than his humble beginnings in the first game, you’re no demigod that can win a large battle single-handedly. In fact, you’ll probably lose fairly often in the early goings if more than one person is attacking you.

Almost every fight is a slow dance once you’re in a full suit of armor, and your patience and timing will be the key to winning over the stats of your equipment. But therein lies the beauty of KC:D II: Every battle you pick, whether physical or verbal, carries some weight to your experience and shapes Bohemia for better or worse.

After the incredible success of Mario Kart 8 and its various downloadable content packs on the Switch, Nintendo could have easily done a prettier “more of the same” sequel as the launch-window showcase for the Switch 2. Instead, the company took a huge gamble in trying to transform Mario Kart’s usual distinct tracks into a vast, interconnected open world.

This conceit works best in “Free Roam” mode, where you can explore the outskirts of the standard tracks and the wide open spaces in between for hundreds of mini-challenges that test your driving speed and precision. Add in dozens of collectible medallions and outfits hidden in hard-to-reach corners, and the mode serves as a great excuse to explore every nook and cranny of a surprisingly detailed and fleshed-out world map.

I was also a big fan of Knockout Mode, which slowly whittles a frankly overwhelming field of 24 initial racers to a single winner through a series of endurance rally race checkpoints. These help make up for a series of perplexing changes that hamper the tried-and-true Battle Mode formula and long straightaway sections that feel more than a little bit stifling in the standard Grand Prix mode. Still, Free Roam mode had me happily whiling away dozens of hours with my new Switch 2 this year.

For decades now, I’ve been looking for a twin-stick shooter that fully captures the compulsive thrill of the Geometry Wars franchise. Sektori, a late-breaking addition to this year’s top games list, is the first game I can say does so without qualification.

Like Geometry Wars, Sektori has you weaving through a field filled with simple shapes that quickly fill your personal space with ruthless efficiency. But Sektori advances that basic premise with an elegant “strike” system that lets you dash through encroaching enemies and away from danger with the tap of a shoulder button. Advanced players can get a free, instant strike refill by dashing into an upgrade token, and stringing those strikes together creates an excellent risk-vs-reward system of survival versus scoring.

Sektori also features an excellent Gradius-style upgrade system that forces you to decide on the fly whether to take basic power-ups or save up tokens for more powerful weaponry and/or protection further down the line. And just when the basic gameplay threatens to start feeling stale, the game throws in a wide variety of bosses and new modes that mix things up just enough to keep you twitching away.

Throw in an amazing soundtrack and polished presentation that makes even the most crowded screens instantly comprehensible, and you have a game I can see myself coming back to for years—until my reflexes are just too shot to keep up with the frenetic pace anymore.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tis the season when professional Santas are in peak demand, but many who choose this line of work often view it as a higher calling and maintain some aspects of the identity all year round—even those who don’t fit the stereotypical popular image of Santa, according to a paper published in the Academy of Management Journal.

Co-author Christina Hymer of the University of Tennessee got the idea for the study during the COVID pandemic, when she spent a lot of time watching Christmas movies with her toddler. One favorite was 2003’s Elf, starring Will Farrell as a full-sized human raised among elves who goes to New York City to find his biological father. The film prompted her to wonder about why someone would want to be Santa Claus and what their experiences in that role would be.

Hymer and her co-authors partnered with the leader of a “Santa school” to analyze archival surveys of 849 professional Santas, and conducted a new survey of another 382 Santas. They also did over 50 personal interviews with professional Santas. (One subject showed up in full costume for his zoom interview, with a North Pole background, and signed off with a merry “ho! ho! ho!”)

Hymer et al. found that professional Santas tend to fall into one of three categories. The first is a prototypical Santa: straight, portly white men with natural white beards. There are also semi-prototypical Santas who might fit the traditional physical characteristics in some respects but not others—they might be younger, or slimmer, or clean-shaven. Finally, there are non-prototypical Santas who are well outside the traditional depiction: people of color, women, disabled Santas, or LGBTQ+ Santas.

“There are pretty strong societal expectations around what Santa looks like, but we found that most anybody can be Santa if their heart desires it,” said co-author Borbala Csillag of Oregon State University. “When we looked at the people behind the suit, we found that the folks playing Santa are really more diverse than would be expected. The expectations for playing the role may seem exclusive, but they are surmountable. Think about your attributes in a comprehensive way so you can identify the dimensions of the role that are well-fitting. You will likely find attributes that map to that calling, even if they are not obvious at first.”

Frankly, what’s most interesting about the paper isn’t those three fundamental categories, but the personalized glimpses it gives of the people who choose to become professional Santas. While a few Santas might make six figures, most do not, and may even lose money being Santa—they do it anyway for the sheer love of it. Professional Santas usually don’t see the role as seasonal; many build their identities around it, whether they fit the stereotypical Kris Kringle image or not. “My feeling is, if you’re Santa all the time, you have to live as Santa and give up whoever you are,” said one subject. “I’m just striving to be a better person.”

They’ll wear red and green all year round, for instance, or maintain a full white beard.  One Santa trained himself to make “Ho, ho, ho!” his natural laugh. Another redecorated his house as “Santa’s house,” complete with Christmas trees and Santa figurines.

Sometimes it’s viewed as a role: a gay professional Santa, for instance, deliberately suppresses his sexual orientation when playing Santa, complete with partnering with a Mrs. Claus for public appearances. However, a female Santa who goes by Lynx (professional Santas typically take on pseudonyms) who is also a church leader, likens the job to a divine calling: “I can connect with people and remind them they’re loved,” she said. (She also binds her breasts when in costume because “Santa doesn’t have them double-Ds.”)

Perhaps that sense of a higher calling is why even non-prototypical Santas like Lynx persevere in the fact of occasional rejection. One Black Santa recalled being denied the position at a big box store once the interviewer found out his ethnicity, telling him the store didn’t hire Black or Hispanic Santas. “That hurt my heart so much,” he said. A disabled Santa who uses a scooter during parades recalled being criticized by other professional Santas for doing so—but stuck with it.

And while Bad Santa (2003) might be a fun holiday watch, actual “bad Santas” caught smoking, drinking, swearing, or otherwise behaving inappropriately are not popular figures within their community. “You’re never off,” one subject opined. “You lose a little bit of your identity because you can’t let your hair down and be yourself. You don’t know who’s watching you.”

“You’re Santa Claus 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year,” another Santa said. “If you act out, you risk shattering the magic.”

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/speed-act-passes-in-house-despite-changes-that-threaten-clean-power-projects/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The House of Representatives cleared the way for a massive overhaul of the federal environmental review process last Thursday, despite last-minute changes that led clean energy groups and moderate Democrats to pull their support.

The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, or SPEED Act, overcame opposition from environmentalists and many Democrats who oppose the bill’s sweeping changes to a bedrock environmental law.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and backed by Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), passed the House Thursday in a 221-196 vote, in which 11 Democrats joined Republican lawmakers to back the reform effort. It now heads to the Senate, where it has critics and proponents on both sides of the aisle, making its prospects uncertain.

The bill seeks to reform foundational environmental regulations that govern how major government projects are assessed and approved by amending the landmark 1970 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), signed into law under the Nixon administration. NEPA requires federal agencies to review and disclose the environmental impacts of major projects before permitting or funding them. Although NEPA reviews are only one component of the federal permitting process, advocates argue that they serve a crucial role by providing both the government and the public the chance to examine the knock-on effects that major projects could have on the environment.

Critics of the law have argued for years that increasingly complex reviews—along with legal wrangling over the findings of those reviews—have turned NEPA into a source of significant, burdensome delays that threaten the feasibility of major projects, such as power plants, transmission lines, and wind and solar projects on federal land.

Speaking on the floor of the House Thursday before the vote, Westerman described the SPEED Act as a way to “restore common sense and accountability to federal permitting.” Westerman praised the original intent of NEPA but said the law’s intended environmental protections had been overshadowed by NEPA becoming “more synonymous with red tape and waste.

“What was meant to facilitate responsible development has been twisted into a bureaucratic bottleneck that delays investments in the infrastructure and technologies that make our country run,” Westerman said.

After the bill’s passage through the House on Thursday, the SPEED Act’s Democratic cosponsor, Golden, praised the bill’s success.

“The simplest way to make energy, housing, and other essentials more affordable is to make it possible to actually produce enough of it at a reasonable cost,” Golden said in a press release following the vote. “The SPEED Act has united workers, businesses, and political forces who usually oppose each other because scarcity hurts everyone.”

According to an issue brief from the Bipartisan Policy Center, the bill aims to reform the NEPA process in several key ways. First, it makes changes to the ways agencies comply with NEPA—for example, by creating exemptions to when a NEPA review is required, and requiring agencies to only consider environmental impacts that are directly tied to the project at hand.

It would also drastically shorten the deadline to sue a federal agency over its permitting decision and constrain who is eligible to file suit. Current law provides a six-year statute of limitations on agency decisions for permitting energy infrastructure, and two years for transportation project permits. Under the SPEED Act’s provisions, those deadlines would be shortened to a mere 150 days and only allow lawsuits to be filed by plaintiffs who demonstrated in public comment periods that they would be directly and negatively impacted by the project.

NEPA does not require the government to make particular decisions about whether or how to move forward with a project based on a review’s findings. However, critics argue that in the decades since its passage, interest groups have “weaponized” the NEPA process to delay or even doom projects they oppose, sometimes forcing agencies to conduct additional analyses that add costly delays to project timelines.

Although climate activists and environmental groups have used NEPA to oppose fossil fuel projects, such as the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, oil and gas interests are far from the only group seeking respite. Some voices within the clean energy industry have called for permitting reform, too, arguing that delays stemming from the current permitting process have had a negative impact on America’s ability to build out more climate-friendly projects, including some offshore wind projects and transmission lines to connect renewables to the grid.

So when Westerman and Golden introduced the SPEED Act in the House, a hodgepodge of odd alliances and opposition groups formed in response.

The American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, launched a seven-figure advertising campaign in recent months pushing lawmakers to pursue permitting reform, according to a report from Axios. And the bill also initially enjoyed support from voices within the clean power industry. However, last-minute changes to the bill—designed to win over Republican holdouts—undermined the SPEED Act’s cross-sector support.

The bill’s opponents had previously raised alarm bells that fossil fuel interests would disproportionately benefit from a more streamlined review process under the current administration, citing President Donald Trump’s ongoing war against wind and solar energy projects.

In recent months, the Trump administration has sought to pause, reconsider, or revoke already approved permits for renewable energy projects it dislikes. Those moves particularly impacted offshore wind developments and added significant uncertainty to the feasibility of clean energy investments as a whole.

A bipartisan amendment to the SPEED Act, added during the Natural Resources Committee’s markup in November, sought to address some of those concerns by adding language that would make it more difficult for the administration to “revoke, rescind, withdraw, terminate, suspend, amend, alter, or take any other action to interfere” with an existing authorization.

However, that measure encountered resistance from key Republican voices who support Trump’s attacks on offshore wind projects.

On Tuesday, Republican lawmakers in the Rules Committee were able to amend the SPEED Act in a way that would facilitate the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to axe renewable energy projects. The changes were spearheaded by Andy Harris (R-Md.) and Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.), two vocal proponents of Trump’s energy policies. The amendment fundamentally undermined the technology-neutral aspirations of the bill—and any hope of receiving widespread support from moderate Democrats or the clean power industry.

According to Matthew Davis, vice president of federal policy at the League of Conservation Voters, Harris and Van Drew’s amendment would allow the administration to exclude any project from the bill’s reforms that the Trump administration had flagged for reconsideration—something the administration has done repeatedly for renewable projects like offshore wind.

The result, Davis argued, is that the bill would speed up the environmental review process for the Trump administration’s preferred sources of energy—namely, oil and gas—while leaving clean energy projects languishing.

“They couldn’t pass the rule on Tuesday to even consider this bill without making it even better for the fossil fuel industry and even worse for the clean energy industry,” Davis said.

In a public statement following Thursday’s vote, Davis described the amended SPEED Act as “a fossil fuel giveaway that cuts out community input and puts our health and safety at risk to help big polluters.”

The American Clean Power Association, which represents the renewable energy industry, previously hailed the bill as an important step forward for the future of clean energy development. But after the Rules Committee’s changes on Tuesday, the organization dropped its support.

“Our support for permitting reform has always rested on one principle: fixing a broken system for all energy resources,” said ACP CEO Jason Grumet in a Wednesday statement. “The amendment adopted last night violate[s] that principle. Technology neutrality wasn’t just good policy—it was the political foundation that made reform achievable.”

The American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), a nonprofit trade and advocacy organization, echoed that sentiment.

“Durable, bipartisan, technology-neutral permitting reforms that support and advance the full suite of American electricity resources and the necessary expansion of transmission infrastructure to get that electricity from where it’s generated to where it’s needed are essential to meeting that challenge reliably, securely, and most importantly, affordably,” said ACORE CEO Ray Long. “Unfortunately, the changes made on the House floor are a disappointing step backward from achieving these objectives.”

Following the SPEED Act’s passage through the House on Thursday, advocacy group Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES) issued a public statement praising the bill’s success while noting how the recent amendments had affected the law.

“While we are concerned that post committee additions to the bill could put the certainty of a range of projects at risk, this bill’s underlying reforms are critical to advancing American energy,” CRES President Heather Reams said in the statement.

Even before the move to strip protections for renewables from the bill, some critics—like Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.)—said that the legislation didn’t go far enough to curtail the president’s “all-out assault” against clean power, arguing that the bill does nothing to restore approvals that have already been canceled by the administration and doesn’t address other roadblocks that have been put in place.

“The administration cannot be trusted to act without specific language, in my view, to protect the clean energy projects already in the pipeline and to prevent the Interior Secretary from unilaterally stopping projects that are needed to lower costs and improve grid reliability,” Levin told Inside Climate News in an interview ahead of the House vote.

Both Levin and Davis pointed to a July memo from the Department of Interior that requires all wind and solar projects on federal land to receive higher-level approval from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

“The administration is not even returning the phone calls of project developers. They are not responding to applications being submitted,” Davis said. “That sort of approach is in stark contrast with the ‘white glove, concierge service’—and that’s a quote from the Trump administration—the service they are providing for fossil fuel companies to access our public lands.”

The SPEED Act’s opponents also dispute the idea that NEPA reviews are one of the primary causes of permitting delays, arguing that reports from the Congressional Research Service and other groups have found little evidence to support those claims.

“Often missing in the conversation around NEPA is the empirical research that’s been done, and there’s a lot of that out there,” said Jarryd Page, a staff attorney at the Environmental Law Institute, in a September interview with Inside Climate News.

That research points to resource constraints as one of the biggest roadblocks, Page said, like not having enough staff to conduct the environmental reviews, or staff lacking adequate experience and technical know-how.

Debate over NEPA and the reform of the permitting process will now move into the Senate, where experts say the SPEED Act will likely undergo further changes.

“I think as the bill goes forwards in the Senate, we’ll probably see a neutral, across-the-board approach to making sure the process is fair for all technology types,” Xan Fishman, an energy policy expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center told ICN after Thursday’s vote.

Fishman stressed it would be crucial to ensure permits for projects wouldn’t suddenly be cancelled for political reasons, but said he was optimistic about how the SPEED Act would be refined in the Senate.

“It’s great to see Congress so engaged with permitting reform,” he said. “Both sides of the aisle see a need to do better.”

This was a pretty good year for television, with established favorites sharing space on our list with some intriguing new shows. Streaming platforms reigned supreme, with Netflix and Apple TV dominating our list with seven and five selections each. Genre-wise, we’ve got a bit of everything: period dramas (The Gilded Age, Outrageous), superheroes (Daredevil: Born Again), mysteries (Ludwig, Poker Face, Dept. Q), political thrillers (The Diplomats, Slow Horses), science fiction (Andor, Severance, Alien: Earth), broody fantasy (The Sandman), and even an unconventional nature documentary (Underdogs).

As always, we’re opting for an unranked list, with the exception of our “year’s best” selection at the very end, so you might look over the variety of genres and options and possibly add surprises to your eventual watchlist. We invite you to head to the comments and add your own favorite TV shows released in 2025.

Most of us have seen a nature documentary or two (or three) at some point in our lives, so it’s a familiar format: sweeping, majestic footage of impressively regal animals accompanied by reverently high-toned narration (preferably with a tony British accent). Underdogs takes a decidedly different approach. Narrated with hilarious irreverence by Ryan Reynolds, the five-part series highlights nature’s less cool and majestic creatures—the outcasts and benchwarmers more noteworthy for their “unconventional hygiene choices” and “unsavory courtship rituals.” (It’s rated PG-13 due to the odd bit of scatalogical humor and shots of Nature Sexy Time.)

Each of the five episodes is built around a specific genre. “Superheroes” highlights the surprising superpowers of the honey badger, pistol shrimp, and the invisible glass frog, among others, augmented with comic book graphics; “Sexy Beasts” focuses on bizarre mating habits and follows the format of a romantic advice column; “Terrible Parents” highlights nature’s worst practices, following the outline of a parenting guide; “Total Grossout” is exactly what it sounds like; and “The Unusual Suspects” is a heist tale, documenting the supposed efforts of a macaque to put together the ultimate team of masters of deception and disguise (an inside man, a decoy, a fall guy, etc.). Green Day even wrote and recorded a special theme song for the opening credits.

While Reynolds mostly followed the script (which his team helped write), there was also a fair amount of improvisation—not all of it PG-13. The producers couldn’t use the racier ad-libs. But some made it into the final episodes, like Reynolds describing an aye-aye as “if fear and panic had a baby and rolled it in dog hair.” We also meet the velvet worm, which creeps up on unsuspecting prey before squirting disgusting slime all over their food, and the pearl fish, which hides from predators in a sea cucumber’s butt, among other lowly yet fascinating critters. Verdict: Underdogs is positively addictive. It’s my favorite nature documentary ever.

Dep. Q is a rare show that commits to old tropes—an unlikable but smart central character revisits cold cases—and somehow manages to repackage them in a way that feels distinctive. To get a sense of the show, you only have to describe its precise genre. You might call it a murder mystery, and there are murders in it, but one of the mysteries is whether a key player is alive or not, given that a lot of her story takes place in flashbacks with an uncertain relationship to the present. It’s almost a police procedural, except that many of the police are only following procedures grudgingly and erratically. It’s not really a whodunnit, given that you only end up learning who done some of it by the time the first season wraps up. And so on.

Amid all the genre fluidity, the show does a great job of balancing the key challenge of a mystery program: telling you enough that you can make reasonably informed guesses on at least some of what’s going on without giving the whole game away and making it easy to figure out all the details. And the acting is superb. Matthew Goode does a nice job of handling the central character’s recent trauma while helping you understand why he has a few loyal co-workers despite the fact that he was probably unlikable even before he was traumatized. And Alexej Manvelov (who I’d never seen before) is fantastic as a former Syrian policeman who drops occasional hints that he had been an active participant in that country’s police state.

There are definitely quibbles. The creation of a cold case squad happens on the flimsiest of motivations, and the fantastic Kelly Macdonald is badly underused. But the show is definitely good enough that I’m curious about some additional mysteries: Can the team behind it continue to avoid getting bogged down in the tropes in season two, and which of the many threads it left unresolved will be picked up when they try?

          Marvel/Disney+

Enthusiasm was understandably high for Daredevil: Born Again, Marvel’s revival of the hugely popular series in the Netflix Defenders universe. Not only was Charlie Cox returning to the title role as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, but Vincent D’Onofrio was also coming back as his nemesis, crime lord Wilson Fisk/Kingpin. Their dynamic has always been electric, and that on-screen magic is as powerful as ever in Born Again, which quickly earned critical raves and a second season.

Granted, there were some rough spots. The entire season was overhauled during the 2023 Hollywood strikes, and at times it felt like two very different shows. A weird serial killer subplot was primarily just distracting. There was also the controversial decision to kill off a major character from the original Netflix series in the first episode. But that creative choice cleared the decks to place the focus squarely on Matt’s and Fisk’s parallel arcs, and the two central actors do not disappoint.

Matt decides to focus on his legal work while Fisk is elected mayor of New York City, intent on leaving his criminal life behind. But each struggles to remain in the light as the dark sides of their respective natures fight to be released. The result is an entertaining, character-driven series that feels very much a part of its predecessor while still having its own distinctive feel.

I confess I might have missed Boots had it not been singled out and dismissed as “woke garbage” by the Pentagon—thereby doubling the show’s viewership. I was pleased to discover that it’s actually a moving, often thought-provoking dramedy that humanizes all the young men from many different backgrounds who volunteer to serve their country in the US military. The show is based on a memoir (The Pink Marine) by Greg Cope White about his experiences as a gay teen in the military in the 1980s when gay and bisexual people weren’t allowed to serve. Boots is set in the early 1990s just before the onset of the “Don’t ask, don’t tell” era.

Miles Heizer stars as Cameron Cope (Cope White’s fictional alter ego), a closeted gay teen in Louisiana who signs up as a recruit for the US Marine Corps with his best (straight) friend Ray (Liam Oh). He’s not the most promising recruit, but over the course of eight episodes, we see him struggle, fail, pick himself back up, and try again during the grueling boot camp experience, forming strong bonds with his fellow recruits but all the while terrified of being outed and kicked out.

Heizer gives a powerful performance as Cameron, enhanced by the contrast with Max Parker’s stellar portrayal of the tightly wound Sergeant Liam Robert Sullivan—a decorated Marine inexplicably reassigned to train recruits while harboring his own secrets. Nor is Miles’ story the only focus: We learn more about several characters and their private struggles, and those inter-relationships are the heart and soul of the show. Netflix canceled the series, but this one season stands tall on its own.

This charming Emmy-nominated comedy series has made our “Best of TV” list every season, and 2025 is no exception. Only Murders in the Building (OMITB) stars Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez as Charles, Oliver, and Mabel, all residents of the same Manhattan apartment complex, the Arconia. The unlikely trio teams up to launch their own true crime podcast whenever someone dies in the building under suspicious circumstances, chronicling their independent investigation to solve the murder. There’s no shortage of podcast fodder, as this single building has a shockingly high murder rate.

S5 focused on the death of the building’s doorman, Lester (Teddy Coluca), found floating in the Arcadia’s fountain in the season finale. The discovery of a severed finger leads our team to conclude that Lester was murdered. Their quest involves a trio of billionaires, the mayor (Keegan-Michael Key), a missing mafioso (Bobby Cannavale) and his widow (Tea Leoni), and maybe even the building’s new robotic assistant, LESTR (voiced by Paul Rudd). As always, the season finale sets up next season’s murder: that of rival podcaster Cinda Canning (Tina Fey), who lives just long enough to reach the Arcadia’s gates and place one hand into the courtyard—technically dying “in the building.” One assumes that OMITB will eventually run out of fresh takes on its clever concept, but it certainly hasn’t done so yet.

I unequivocally loved the first season of The Sandman, the Netflix adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s influential graphic novel series (of which I am a longtime fan). I thought it captured the surreal, dream-like feel and tone of its source material, striking a perfect balance between the anthology approach of the graphic novels and grounding the narrative by focusing on the arc of its central figure: Morpheus, lord of the Dreaming. It was a long wait for the second and final season, but S2 retains all those elements to bring Dream’s story to its inevitably tragic yet satisfying end.

As always, the casting is extraordinary and the performances are note-perfect across the board. And Netflix did not skimp on the visuals, which bring the graphic novel imagery to vivid life. I still appreciate how the leisurely pacing lets the viewer relax and sink into this richly layered fictional world. Part I kicked off with an Endless family reunion that led Dream into revisiting Hell and agreeing to his sister Delirium’s request to look for their absent brother, Destruction. That sets in motion a chain of events that leads to the tragedy that unfolds in Part II. The bonus episode, in which Death gets one day (every hundred years) to be human—an adaptation of the standalone Death: The High Cost of Living—serves as a lovely coda to this unique series, which is pretty much everything I could have wanted in an adaptation.

Ludwig is a clever twist on the British cozy mystery genre. David Mitchell stars as John Taylor, a reclusive eccentric who creates puzzles for a living under the pseudonym “Ludwig.” When his identical twin brother, Cambridge DCI James Taylor (also Mitchell), goes missing, his sister-in-law Lucy (Anna Maxwell Martin) convinces John to go undercover. John reluctantly pretends to be James to gain access to the police department in hopes of finding out what happened to his twin. He inevitably gets drawn into working on cases—and turns out to be exceptionally good at applying his puzzle skills to solve murders, even as his anxiety grows about his subterfuge being discovered.

The best crime shows deftly balance cases-of-the-week with longer character-driven story arcs, and Ludwig achieves that balance beautifully. The writers brought in a puzzle consultant to create the various crosswords that appear in the series, as well as a special cryptic crossword done in character as Ludwig that appeared in The Guardian. The first season ended with a bit of a cliffhanger about what’s really been going on with James, but fortunately, the BBC has renewed Ludwig for a second season, so we’ll get to see more of our cryptic crime-solver.

Poker Face is perfect comfort TV, evolving the case-of-the-week format that made enduring early TV hits like Columbo and Murder, She Wrote iconic. The second season takes the endlessly likeable BS-detector Charlie Cale (Natasha Lyonne) to the end of the road after she overcomes fleeing the mob in her 1969 Plymouth Barracuda. Along the way, Charlie pals around with A-list guest stars and solves crimes, winding her way from Florida to New York as each delightful new caper serves not to ramp up tension but to disrupt how viewers anticipate Charlie will move. Some might think that the lack of tension made the season weaker. But creator Rian Johnson recently revealed that he expects Poker Face to cast a new lead detective every two years. That makes it seem clear that Charlie’s second season was more about release.

In the most memorable episode of the season, “Sloppy Joseph,” the front row of an elementary school talent show suddenly becomes a bloody splash zone when a bullied boy is framed for killing the class pet, a gerbil, with a giant mallet. That scene is perhaps an apt metaphor for Johnson’s attempt to keep modern-day viewers from turning away from their TVs by shattering expectations. It’s unclear yet if his formulaic TV hijinks will work, but if anyone decides to pick up Poker Face after Peacock declined to renew it, Peter Dinklage is next in line to become the world’s greatest lie detector.

I was a latecomer to this eminently watchable show created by Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park), who also gave us the Emmy-winning sensation Downton Abbey. Instead of following the adventures of post-Edwardian British aristocracy and their domestic servants, the focus is on ultra-wealthy Americans and their domestic servants in the 1880s and the social tensions that arise from the “old money” versus “new money” dynamic of this rapidly changing period. The Gilded Age has been described as an “operatic soap” (rather than a soap opera), replete with a hugely talented ensemble cast donning lavish costumes and cavorting in extravagantly opulent settings. It’s unadulterated, addictive escapism, and the series really hit its stride in S3.

Old Money is represented by Agnes van Rhijn (Christine Baranski), a wealthy widow who lives with her spinster sister Ada (Cynthia Nixon); orphaned niece Marian (Louisa Jacobson); and son and heir Oscar (Blake Ritson), a closeted gay man seeking to marry a rich heiress. Living just across the street is New Money, personified by robber baron/railroad tycoon George Russell (Morgan Spector) and his socially ambitious wife Bertha (Carrie Coon) and their two children. You’ve got Marian’s friend Peggy (Denee Benton) representing the emerging Black upper class and a colorful assortment of domestics in both houses, like aspiring inventor Jack (Ben Ahlers), who dreams of greater things.

Fictionalized versions of notable historical people occasionally appear, and two figure prominently: Caroline Astor (Donna Murphy), who ruled New York society at the time, and her simpering sycophant Ward McAllister (Nathan Lane). (The Russells are loosely inspired by William and Ava Vanderbilt.) The stakes might sometimes seem small—there’s a multi-episode arc devoted to which of two competing opera houses New York’s social elite will choose to sponsor—but for the characters, they are huge, and Fellowes makes the audience feel equally invested in the outcomes. There were a few rough edges in the first season, but The Gilded Age quickly found its footing; it has gotten better and more richly textured with each successive season and never takes itself too seriously.

The Mitford sisters were born to be immortalized one day in a British period drama, and Outrageous is happy to oblige. There were six of them (and one brother), and their scandalous exploits frequently made global headlines in the 1930s. This is ultimately a fictionalized account of how the rise of Hitler and British fascism fractured this once tight-knit aristocratic family. The focus is on smaller, domestic drama—budding romances, failed marriages, literary aspirations, and dwindling fortunes—colored by the ominous global events unfolding on a larger scale.

Nancy (Bessie Carter) is the primary figure, an aspiring novelist with a cheating husband who feels increasingly alienated from her older sister and bestie Diana (Joanna Vanderham). Diana married a baron but becomes enamored of Oswald Mosley (Joshua Sasse), leader of the British fascist party, embarking on a torrid affair. Another sister, Unity (Shannon Watson), is also seduced by Nazi ideology and has a major crush on Hitler. Meanwhile, Jessica (Zoe Brough) is drawn to the Communist cause, which rankles both her siblings and her traditionally conservative parents.

Things come to a head when Unity goes to study in Germany and becomes completely radicalized, even publishing a vicious anti-semitic screed that shames the family. Diana also goes all-in on fascism when she leaves her husband for Mosley, whom Nancy loathes. Jessica elopes with her Communist cousin to Spain to be on the front lines of that civil war, leading to a lifelong estrangement from Diana. Nancy, the political moderate, is caught in the middle, torn between her love for her sisters and her increasing discomfort with Diana and Unity’s extreme political views.

The Mitford sisters were prolific letter writers all their lives, so there was plenty of material for screenwriter Sarah Williams to draw on when fictionalizing their stories at such a pivotal point in the family’s (and the world’s) history. Outrageous is quite historically accurate in broad outlines, and there are plenty of moments of wry, understated humor amid the family tensions. The gifted cast makes the sisters come alive in all their flawed humanity. There’s no word yet on a second season, and this one ends on a suitable note, but there’s so much more story left to tell, so I hope Outrageous returns.

I’ll admit I wasn’t sure how well A Man on the Inside would fare with its sophomore season after knocking it out of the park in S1. I should have known showrunner Mike Schur (The Good Place) could pull it off. Ted Danson plays Charles Nieuwendyk, a recently widowed retired engineering professor. In S1, he was hired by private detective Julie Kovalenko (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) to go undercover at a San Francisco retirement community to solve the mystery of a stolen ruby necklace. In S2, Charles returns to his academic roots and goes undercover at fictional Wheeler College to solve the mystery of a stolen laptop—a crime that just might have implications for the survival of the college itself.

Charles even falls in love for the first time since his wife’s death with music professor Mona Margadoff (Mary Steenburgen, Danson’s wife IRL), despite the two being polar opposites. The show continues to be a welcome mix of funny, sweet, sour, and touching, while never lapsing into schmaltz. The central Thanksgiving episode—where Mona meets Charles’s family and friends for the first time—is a prime example, as various tensions simmering below the surface erupt over the dinner table. Somehow, everyone manages to make their respective peace in entirely believable ways. It’s lovely to see a series grapple so openly, with so much warmth and humor, with the loneliness of aging and grief and how it can affect extended family. And the show once again drives home the message that new beginnings are always possible, even when one thinks one’s life is over.

When real-life political administrations refer to officials as Darth Vader in unironically flattering terms, maybe George Lucas made the Dark Lord of the Sith a little too iconic. Showrunner Tony Gilroy made no such effort in his depiction of the fascists in Andor.

During Andor‘s run, which ended this year with S2, the Empire is full of sad corporate ladder climbers who are willing to stab another in the back to get to the next rung of the Imperial hierarchy. The show makes it clear that these are not people to emulate. If more fans watched the show, maybe that message could have landed for them.

For people who grew up with Star Wars and want something more to chew on in our adulthood than endless callbacks to the original trilogy, Andor is revelatory. It colors the war of light versus dark with large amounts of gray because sometimes, as one character puts it, you have to use the tools of your enemy to defeat them (save for genetically gifted farmboys). Maybe most of Star Wars was always supposed to be for kids, but prestige TV viewers got a glimpse of what the universe could feel like if it took itself more seriously. Rather than use the broad strokes of a war of good versus evil, Andor painted between the lines to demonstrate how systemic oppression can look a lot more personal than firing a giant space laser.

For all its great writing and themes, Andor also delivered high stakes and suspense. Although we already knew the outcome of the story, we still held our breath during tense scenes with characters who make the ultimate sacrifice for a future they will never see.

My personal end-of-year TV list would never be complete without a nod to The Cowboy Channel, i.e., the only place where armchair enthusiasts like myself can follow our favorite cowboys and cowgirls throughout the rodeo season. The goal is to rack up enough money to qualify for the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo (NFR), held at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas every December. This year, I’ve picked the channel’s stellar annual coverage of the NFR itself to highlight. The entire season comes down to this: an intense 10-day competition in which the top 15 athletes in each event duke it out night after night in hopes of winning a coveted championship gold buckle. And night after night, The Cowboy Channel is there with live commentary and post-round analysis.

What I love most is just how unpredictable the NFR can be. Part of that is the substantial monetary rewards that come with round wins; an athlete coming in at #1 in earnings can see even a substantial lead evaporate over just a few nights. Part of it has to do with who wins the average, i.e., who performs the best over ten nights collectively in each event. Winning the average comes with a substantial payout that can lead to unexpected upsets in the final results. But mostly it’s just the human factor: The best in the world can have a bad night, and young rookies can have the night of their lives. An ill-timed injury can knock an athlete out of the competition entirely. And sometimes the judges make inexplicably bad calls with major consequences (*cough* Stetson Wright in Round 6 saddle bronc *cough*).

It’s all part of the excitement of rodeo. The Cowboy Channel’s in-depth coverage lets us experience all that drama even if we can’t attend in person and lets us savor how the story unfolds in each subsequent round. We celebrate the wins, mourn the losses, and cheer mightily for the final champions. (Stetson did just fine in the end.) Then we gear up to do it all over again next year.

The blockbuster success of the 1986 film Top Gun—chronicling the paths of young naval aviators as they go through the grueling US Navy’s Fighter Weapons School (aka the titular Top Gun)—spawned more than just a successful multimedia franchise. It has also been credited with inspiring future generations of fighter pilots. National Geographic took viewers behind the scenes to see the process play out for real with the documentary series Top Guns: The Next Generation.

Each episode focuses on a specific aspect of the training, following a handful of students from the Navy and Marines through the highs and lows of their training. That includes practicing dive bombs at breakneck speeds, successfully landing on an aircraft carrier by “catching the wire,” learning the most effective offensive and defensive maneuvers in dogfighting, and, finally, engaging in a freestyle dogfight against a seasoned instructor to complete the program and (hopefully) earn their golden wings. NatGeo was granted unprecedented access, even using in-cockpit cameras to capture the pulse-pounding action of being in the air, as well as more candidly intimate behind-the-scenes moments as the students grapple with their respective successes and failures. It’s a riveting watch.

My first draft of what was supposed to be a 300-ish word blurb describing why Alien: Earth is fantastic ended up exploding into a Defector-esque narrative deep dive into my ever-evolving relationship with Alien 3 as a film and how Alien: Earth has helped reshape my appreciation for that poor broken baby of a movie by mixing the best of its visual techniques into A:E’s absolutely masterful cocktail of narrative stylings—but I’ll spare you all of that.

Here’s the short version without the bloviating: Alien: Earth is the thing I’ve been waiting for since I walked out of the theater after seeing Alien 3 in the summer of 1992. Unlike Alien Resurrection, any of the AvPs, or the wet-fart, falls-apart-like-mud-in-the-third-act swing-and-miss of Alien: Romulus, A:E gets nearly everything right. It’s grounded without being stodgy; exciting without being stupid; referential without being derivative; fun without being pandering; respectful of the lore while being willing to try something new; and, above all else, it bleeds craftsmanship—every frame makes it obvious that this is a show made by people who love and care for the Alien universe.

The thing that grabs me anew with every episode is the show’s presentation and execution—a self-aware blending of all the best things Scott, Cameron, and Fincher brought to their respective films. As I get older, I’m drawn more and more to entertainment that shows me interesting things and does so in ontologically faithful ways—and oh, does this show ever deliver.

Each episode is a carefully crafted visual and tonal mix of all the previous Alien films, with the episodes’ soundtracks shifting eras to match the action on-screen—like Alien 3’s jumpy choir flash-cut opening credits melding into Aliens’ lonely snare drums. The result is a blended world made of all the best things I remember from the films, and it works in the same way the game Alien: Isolation worked: by conjuring up exactly what the places where we used to have nightmares looked and felt like, and then scaring us there again.

I have heard that The Internet had some problems with the show, but, eh, everybody’s going to hate something. I vaguely remember some of the complaints having to do with how some of the new alien life-forms seem to be scarier or deadlier than our beloved and familiar main monster. All I’ve got for that one is a big fat shrug—I’m fine with our capital-A-aliens sharing the stage with some equally nasty new creatures. The aliens are always more interesting as devices to explore a story than as dramatic ends themselves, and I mean, let’s face it, in the past 40-plus years, there’s not much we haven’t seen them do and/or kill. They’re a literary force, not characters, and I’m way more interested in seeing how they shape the story of the people around them.

The tl;dr is that Alien: Earth is awesome, and if you haven’t watched it, you absolutely should. And when I was a kid, I used to regularly get put in time-out in recess for stiff-arming other kids while pretending to be a power loader, so you should consider my tastemaking credentials in this matter unimpeachable.

In the most violent series to ever catch the world’s attention by playing beloved children’s games, it turns out that the most high-stakes choice that creator Hwang Dong-hyuk could make was to put a child in the arena. For Squid Game‘s final season, Hwang has said the season’s pivotal moment—a pregnant girl birthing a baby during a game of hide-and-seek with knives—was designed to dash viewers’ hopes that a brighter future may await those who survive the games. By leaving the task of saving the baby to the series hero, Seong Gi-hun, whose own strained relationship with his daughter led him into the games in the first season, Squid Game walked a gritty tightrope to the very end.

The only real misstep was involving the goofiest set of cartoon villain VIPs more directly in the games. But we can forgive Hwang the clunky Dr. Evil-like dialogue that slowed down the action. He’s made it clear that he put everything into developing dramatic sequences for the game players—losing teeth, barely eating, rarely sleeping—and he fully admitted to The New York Times that “I have a cartoonish way of giving comic relief.

Let’s be clear: The Diplomat is a soap opera. If you’re not into cliffhangers, intense levels of drama, and will-they-won’t-they sexual tension, it’s probably not going to be for you. Sometimes there’s so much going on that it becomes almost farcical. If that doesn’t scare you off, what do you get in return?

Superb actors given rich and intriguing characters to inhabit. A political drama that nicely finds a balance between the excessive idealism of The West Wing and the excessive cynicism of Veep. A disturbingly realistic-feeling series of crises that the characters sometimes direct, and sometimes hang on for dear life as they get dragged along by. And, well, the cliffhangers have been good enough to get me tuning in to the next season as soon as it appears on Netflix.

Kerri Russell plays the titular diplomat, who is assigned to what seems like a completely innocuous position: ambassador to one of the US’s closest allies, the UK. Rufus Sewell portrays her husband, a loose-to-the-point-of-unmoored cannon who ensures the posting is anything but innocuous. Ali Ahn and Ato Assandoh, neither of whom I was familiar with, are fantastic as embassy staff. And as the central crisis has grown in scale, some familiar West Wing faces (Allison Janey and Bradley Whitford) have joined the cast. Almost all of the small roles have been superbly acted as well. And for all the dysfunction, cynicism, and selfish behavior that drive the plot forward, the politics in The Diplomat feels like pleasant escapism when compared to the present reality.

Apple TV+’s Murderbot, based on Martha Wells’ bestselling series of novels The Murderbot Diaries, is a jauntily charming sci-fi comedy dripping with wry wit and an intriguing mystery. Murderbot the TV series adapts the first book in the series, All Systems Red. A security unit that thinks of itself as Murderbot (Alexander Skarsgård) is on assignment on a distant planet, protecting a team of scientists who hail from a “freehold.”

Mensah (Noma Dumezweni) is the team leader. The team also includes Bharadwaj (Tamara Podemski) and Gurathin (David Dastmalchian), who is an augmented human plugged into the same data feeds as Murderbot (processing at a much slower rate). Pin-Lee (Sabrina Wu) also serves as the team’s legal counsel; they are in a relationship with Arada (Tattiawna Jones), eventually becoming a throuple with Ratthi (Akshaye Khanna). Unbeknownst to the team, Murderbot has figured out how to override his governor module that compels it to obey the humans’ commands. So Murderbot essentially has free will.

The task of adapting Wells’ novellas for TV fell to sibling co-creators Paul Weitz and Chris Weitz. (Wells herself was a consulting producer.) They’ve kept most of the storyline intact, fleshing out characters and punching up the humor a bit, even recreating campy scenes from Murderbot’s favorite show, The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon. (John Cho and Clark Gregg make cameos as the stars of that fictional show-within-a-show.) The entire cast is terrific, but it’s Skarsgård’s hilariously deadpan performance that holds it all together as he learns how to relate to the humans—even forming some unexpectedly strong bonds.

Fans of Slow Horses (see below), rejoice: with Down Cemetery Road, Apple TV has blessed us with another exciting mystery thriller series based on the works of Mick Herron—in this case, his 2003 novel introducing private investigator Zoë Boehm (Emma Thompson). Ruth Wilson co-stars as Sarah, an artist rather unhappily married to a finance bro. A neighboring building is destroyed by an explosion, and Sarah tries to deliver a get-well card to a little girl who survived from her young classmates. She’s inexplicably rebuffed, and her dogged attempts to figure out what’s going on lead her to seek the help of Zoë’s PI partner and estranged husband Joe (Adam Godley). What Joe finds out gets him killed, setting Sarah and Zoë on a collision course with high-placed government officials trying to cover up a pending scandal.

Thompson and Wilson make a dynamic pair. This is Thompson’s meatiest role in a while: Her Zoë is all flinty cynicism and tough exterior, masking an inner vulnerability she’s learned to keep buried. Wilson’s Sarah is the polar opposite in many ways, but she’s equally dogged, and both women are eccentrics who tend to rub people the wrong way. They’re united in a common goal: find the missing girl and bring her kidnappers (and Joe’s killer) to justice. Down Cemetery Road takes a bit of time to set up its premise and its characters, but the pace builds and builds to a big, satisfying finale. It’s not quite on the level of Slow Horses, but it’s pretty darned close.

After watching five episodes of the nine-episode first season of Apple TV’s Pluribus, I’m still not sure if I should be rooting for protagonist Carol Sturka or not. On the one hand, Carol is one of the last true “individuals” on Earth, fighting to maintain that individuality against a creepy alien pseudo-virus that has made almost everyone else part of a creepy, psychically connected hive mind. Reversing that effect, and getting the world “back to normal,” is an understandable and sympathetic response on Carol’s part.

On the other hand, it’s unlear that being absorbed into the hive mind is a change for the worse, on a humanity-wide scale. Unlike Star Trek’s Borg—who are violent, shambling drones that seem to have an overall miserable existence—the new hive-mind humanity is unfailingly pacifist, intelligent, capable, and (seemingly) blissfully, peacefully happy. In a sense, this virus has “solved” human nature by removing the paranoia, fear, anger, and distrust that naturally come from never truly knowing what’s going on in your neighbor’s head.

The fact that Pluribus has so far been able to navigate this premise without coming down strongly on one side or the other is frankly incredible. The fact that it has done it with consistent humor, thrills, and amazing cinematography transforms it into a must-watch.

There are many things I enjoy about Slow Horses, the Apple TV thriller about some not-great spies based on Mick Herron’s novels of the same name. The plots are gripping. The acting can be sublime. It’s shot well. And in its fifth season, which began streaming this September, Slow Horses engages more with the author’s humor than in seasons past. But with a plot involving the honeypotting of the deluded computer expert almost-extraordinaire Roddy Ho (played to perfection by Christopher Chung), that would be hard to avoid.

Slough House is a rundown MI5 office used as a dumping ground for employees in disgrace—the slow horses. They can’t be fired, but they can quit, and working for Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman) is meant to make that happen. Lamb is a veteran of the dirtiest days of the Cold War, knowing not only where most of the bodies are buried but having helped put a few of them there himself. His legendary field prowess is only dwarfed by his repellent personality, mocking and belittling everyone in sight—but often deservedly so.

Each member of his team is there for a different sin, and throughout the season—which involves a plot to destabilize the British government, ripped from an MI5 playbook—we see evidence of why they’ve been consigned to the slow horses. These are not invincible operators, just flawed human beings, perfectly capable of screwing up again and again. And yet, our lovable bunch of losers usually manages to come through in the end, showing up “the Park&quot;—MI5’s (fictional) head office in London’s Regent’s Park, which is usually a step behind Lamb’s quick and devious thinking.

The adaptation is faithful enough to the books to give me deja vu during the first episode, and with just six episodes in a season, the payoff comes relatively quickly. I can’t wait for season 6.

The second season of Severance was never going to be able to live up to the constant, slow rollout of gut punches that characterized the first season. Those first 10 episodes ably explored the most important implications of the titular severance procedure, which splits a single person into separate “innie” and “outtie” consciousnesses with distinct sets of memories. The audience got to explore those implications along with the “innie” characters, who were struggling against the boundaries of their odd cubicle life right up until that thrilling final shot.

With so much now revealed and understood, a lot of that fire fell out of the second season of the show. Sure, there were still some loose ends to tie up from the mysteries of the first season, and plenty of new, off-puttingly weird situations on offer. And the new season definitely has quite a few high points, like the big twist revealed when the “innies” get to have a rare outdoor excursion or the extended flashback showing a character trapped in a seemingly endless sequence of social tests she can’t remember afterward.

But S2 also spent entire episodes exploring backstories and mysteries that didn’t have nearly as much emotional or plot impact. By the time the final episode arrived—with a rescue sequence that required an inordinate amount of suspension of disbelief—I found myself wondering just how much more interesting juice there was to squeeze from the show’s brilliant original premise. I worry that the show is trending in the direction of Lost, which drew things out with a lot of uninteresting padding before finally resolving the plot’s core puzzle box in an unsatisfying way. I’m still along on that ride for now, but I really hope it’s going somewhere soon.

Paul William Davies created this delightful mystery comedy, loosely based on a bestselling nonfiction book by Kate Andersen Brower about the maids, butlers, cooks, florists, doormen, engineers, and others dedicated to ensuring the White House residence runs smoothly. In the middle of a state dinner for the visiting Australian prime minister, White House Chief Usher A.B. Wynter (Giancarlo Esposito) is found dead in the third-floor game room. Everyone initially assumes it was suicide.

Enter private detective Cordelia Cupp (Uzo Aduba), who most definitely does not think it was suicide and proceeds to investigate. She has about a dozen suspects, and her blunt, rather eccentric personality means she’s not remotely intimidated by the august setting of this particular murder. Cupp even takes the odd break in sleuthing to do a bit of birdwatching on the White House grounds. (It’s her goal to see all the birds President Teddy Roosevelt recorded during his tenure.) Birdwatching is more than a lifelong hobby for Cupp; it’s central to her character and to how she approaches solving crimes. Bonus: Viewers learn a lot of fascinating bird trivia over eight episodes.

Davies has devised a clever narrative structure, telling the story in flashbacks during a Congressional hearing (presided over by former US Sen. Al Franken playing a fictional senator from Washington state). It’s a good mystery with plenty of unexpected twists and snappy dialogue. Each episode title refers to a famous murder mystery; the camerawork is inventive and fun; and everyone in the cast knocks it out of the park. I especially loved pop star Kylie Minogue’s cameo playing a fictional version of herself as a state dinner guest. Davies apparently couldn’t convince her fellow Australian Hugh Jackman to also make a cameo. But Ben Prendergast’s winking portrayal of “Hugh Jackman&quot;—only seen from behind or with his face obscured—is actually funnier than having the real actor.

It would be a mistake to dismiss The Residence as a mere bauble of a murder mystery just because of its playful, lighthearted tone. The show really does capture what is special and unique about the people who keep the White House residence functioning and why they matter—to each other and to America. Cupp’s final speech after unmasking the killer drives home those points with particular poignancy.

Netflix sadly canceled this excellent series, so there won’t be a second season—although I’m not sure how the writers could improve on such a tour de force. Do we really need Cupp to solve another elaborate murder in the White House? If I’m being honest, probably not. But she’s such a great character. I’d love to see more of her, perhaps in a Knives Out-style franchise where the location and main suspects continually change while the central detective stays the same. Somebody make it so.</div>

            <h2>After Outcry, Firefox Promises “Kill Switch” That Turns Off All AI Features</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The backlash against AI invading almost every aspect of the computing experience is growing by the day.

Particularly as an onslaught of lazy AI slop subsuming news feeds, the tech is starting to feel like a massive distraction — and huge parts of the internet are disillusioned or even fuming in anger.

For instance, a vast number of Windows users refused to upgrade after Microsoft announced it would turn the operating system into a so-called “agentic OS.”

Even household names in the open-source industry aren’t safe. After being appointed as the new CEO of open-source software company Mozilla, whose Firefox browser has long been lauded as a compelling alternative to Google’s Chrome and Apple’s Safari, Anthony Enzor-DeMeo announced that it would be tripling down on AI.

In a December 16 blog post, Enzor-DeMeo announced that Firefox would become a “modern AI browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions.”

But a ringing backlash quickly forced the company into damage control mode.

“I’ve never seen a company so astoundingly out of touch with the people who want to use its software,” one disillusioned user tweeted in response to the news.

“I switched back to Firefox late last year BECAUSE it was the last AI-free browser,” another lamented. “I shoulda known.”

“Please don’t turn Firefox into an AI browser,” yet another begged. “That’s a great way to push us to alternatives.”

The outcry was formidable enough for Mozilla to clarify the company’s new CEO’s comments.

“Something that hasn’t been made clear: Firefox will have an option to completely disable all AI features,” the company wrote in an update on Mastodon. “We’ve been calling it the AI kill switch internally. I’m sure it’ll ship with a less murderous name, but that’s how seriously and absolutely we’re taking this.”

An open letter posted to the Firefox subreddit took issue with Enzor-DeMeo’s new direction.

“Ironically, in a post announcing this new direction and highlighting ‘agency and choice,’ there was little mention of user input or feedback,” the letter reads. “This highlights a disconnect that many of us experience daily: Mozilla has a pattern of struggling to implement and support basic features, and much of the time fails to even acknowledge serious user feedback.”

“Firefox doesn’t need to become Google or Microsoft to succeed by both business and user standards,” the letter goes on. “It’s beloved precisely because it’s not. I hope that distinction isn’t lost as Mozilla enters its ‘next chapter’ as part of a ‘broader ecosystem of trusted software.&#39;”

In an apparent effort to reassure the company’s most diehard fans, Enzor-DeMeo took to the comments.

“Rest assured, Firefox will always remain a browser built around user control,” he wrote. “That includes AI. You will have a clear way to turn AI features off. A real kill switch is coming in Q1 of 2026.”

However, his attempts to calm the situation ended up fanning the flames even further.

“If a ‘kill switch’ is the official control for this, then the entire organization needs to stop referring to your ‘AI’ features as ‘opt-in,&#39;” one user responded. “This is clearly opt-out.”

“If Mozilla can’t agree to that basic definition, I don’t see how users are supposed to trust it’ll actually work,” the user added.

Interestingly, the competing browser company Vivaldi, whose browser is based on Google’s open-source Chromium project, has taken a dramatically different approach.

In an August blog post, Vivaldi CEO Jon von Tetzchner accused other companies like Google and Microsoft of “reshaping the address bar into an assistant prompt, turning the joy of exploring into inactive spectatorship.”

“We will continue building a browser for curious minds, power users, researchers, and anyone who values autonomy,” von Tetzchner wrote.

“If AI contributes to that goal without stealing intellectual property, compromising privacy or the open web, we will use it,” he added. “If it turns people into passive consumers, we will not.”

            <div id="article-text">The International Space Station was painstakingly assembled segment by segment, launched into orbit by many expensive and logistically complex rockets.

Now there’s intense interest in a radically different model: launching space habitats that can inflate like balloons once they’re in space, creating far more room for astronauts inside — and maximizing the amount of orbital real estate they can claim with just a single launch.

Case in point, the aptly-named startup Max Space recently unveiled plans for its private space habitat, dubbed Thunderbird Station, that can expand to a whopping 12,300 cubic feet — roughly a third of the volume of the ISS — while only requiring a single launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

Max Space is tentatively planning to launch the massive inflatable by 2029, giving future space travelers “unprecedented volume usable in all dimensions, per the firm’s website.

While it remains to be seen whether the company will ultimately be successful in its ambitious endeavor — it’s only one of several companies working on inflatable space habitats — it’s an exciting vision for a far roomier and potentially luxurious future in our planet’s orbit.

It’s especially pertinent because the retirement of the ISS is a mere five years away, which could leave NASA without the ability to conduct scientific experiments in space. The agency has since called on the private industry to come up with a successor.

The Thunderbird Station concept features large, domed windows allowing astronauts to take in epic views while “huge screens for live Earth and space views” double for “entertainment and communications.”

Individual pods give astronauts privacy as well. The layout of the interior is also reconfigurable, allowing astronauts to “adapt and create working and living areas inside the space station that are fit for purpose — even during a mission,” per the firm.

After NASA announced a revision to its existing Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations (CLD) program in August, Max Space decided to throw its hat into the ring.

“It was pretty clear that was an opportunity for us to put a proposal forward to show how these modules can really be used for human habitation,” Max Space CEO Saleem Miyan told SpaceNews. “That CLD proposal gave us an incentive to strategically look at how we would bring forward the roadmap, and so that’s exactly what we’ve done.”

But going from concept to reality will be anything but easy. Max Space is hoping to launch a scaled-down prototype no sooner than early 2027 in a SpaceX rideshare mission.

A key test will be whether the module can withstand impacts from micrometeoroids and space debris, an important quality for anything orbiting an increasingly cluttered space. Just this month, China sent two astronauts outside its space station to install debris protection panels after one of its docked spacecraft sustained damage.

Despite plenty of engineering challenges to still overcome, Miyan is already eying even more ambitious targets, arguing that the habitat could be modified for lunar and Mars missions as well.

“We see so many interesting applications where habitats, whether human-rated or not, are required,” he told SpaceNews. “Those are the areas where I think we’re going to stand out.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While we’ve made major strides in generating renewable energy, storing that green power to use when the Sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing remains a major engineering challenge.

Researchers have developed many creative concepts — storing it in cranes that hoist humongous concrete blocks up and down, inside hot giant rocks, or spinning turbines by pumping water out of deep, decommissioned mines — none have yet proved practical enough for wide deployment.

Now, as IEEE Spectrum reports, a Milan-based company called Energy Dome has come up with an intriguing approach that stores energy in enormous domes that are filled with compressed carbon dioxide gas.

The idea behind the “CO2 battery” is simple. By compressing the gas using excess green power, it can later be depressurized to spin large turbines. A fully charged facility can store a formidable 200 megawatt-hours of electricity — enough to power around 6,000 homes for a full day.

To charge, the battery uses a thermal-energy storage system to cool the CO2 down to ambient pressure, and a condenser turns it into a liquid over a span of ten hours. To discharge it, the CO2 is evaporated and heated to power the turbine.

The goal is to bridge the gap between when renewable energy is available and when it’s actually needed through a “long-term duration energy storage” (LDES) solution. For instance, solar energy generation may hit its peak during the day, but peak household demand lags hours behind when people are home in the evening.

The idea has even caught the attention of Google, which announced a partnership with Energy Dome earlier this year. Now, IEEE Spectrum reports that the tech giant “plans to rapidly deploy the facilities in all of its key data-center locations in Europe, the United States, and the Asia-Pacific region.”

Energy Dome is currently working on a pilot CO2 battery built on five hectares of flat land in Sardinia, Italy. If successful, it wants to expand rapidly, popping up similar facilities across the world, starting with a separate plant in Karnataka, India. Authorities are also working on laying the groundwork for another in Wisconsin.

Google’s senior lead for energy strategy, Ainhoa Anda, told IEEE Spectrum that one big benefit of the approach is that it’s one-size-fits-all.

“We’ve been scanning the globe seeking different solutions,” he said, adding that “standardization is really important, and this is one of the aspects that we really like” about Energy Dome.

“They can really plug and play this,” Anda added.

The tech giant is looking to start in places where the electricity grid is already reliable and has a surplus of renewable energy that needs to be stored. Nearby data centers can then tap into the CO2 battery.

Unlike other renewable energy storage solutions, CO2 batteries don’t need special minerals, supply chains for complex parts, or constant upkeep.

And it’s not just Google looking to harness the benefits of LDES. China is also working on constructing CO2 batteries, according to IEEE.

Nonetheless, questions surrounding the concept’s long-term economic viability remain. For one thing, a CO2 battery’s footprint is considerably larger than a lithium-ion battery storage facility. There’s also the shortcoming that plagues all bubbles: the threat of a puncture, which could release thousands of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.

But proponents argue it’s worth the risks.

“It’s negligible compared to the emissions of a coal plant,” Energy Dome CEO Claudio Spadacini told IEEE Spectrum.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If Elon Musk is to be believed, millions of driverless Tesla Robotaxis are set to conquer the streets of America by next year.

Right now, however, his tiny fleet would be stretched thin covering a couple city blocks.

With Tesla remaining tight-lipped about how many self-driving cabs it has in operation, Texas A&M engineering student Ethan McKanna tells Electrek that he’s created an online tracker that keeps tabs on the automaker’s service in Austin, Texas by reverse-engineering its ride-hailing app. It shows that just 32 different Tesla Model Ys are currently operating as part of the Robotaxi network — and worse yet, most of the cars don’t even operate concurrently: the data suggests that fewer than ten robotaxis are giving rides at the same time.

Taken together, it’s an embarrassing reality check to Musk’s grand promises about scaling up the program at an impossible pace.

“This is speculative on my part, but it’s my best guess based on the little data we have and can collect,” McKanna told Electrek. “One person I talked to who scoped out the depot and recorded videos told me he believes there are 1-5 out at a time.”

“The highly sporadic wait time shifts and my experience of consistently getting the same vehicle multiple times when I use the service in the data all corroborate that,” he added.

McKanna’s data lines up with Tesla fans’ rough estimates of the size of the service, which launched in late June with around a dozen cars. It would also mean that Musk’s boast that it had “doubled” its fleet was technically true.

To gather the data, McKanna explained that he found that the Robotaxi app’s API is able to fetch ETA estimates from Tesla prior to booking a ride.

“I have a server where every 5 minutes I ping Tesla at ~10 points in both service areas, pull the wait time, and store it,” he explained. “If a wait time is offered, I count it as available, if ‘high service demand’ or any other type of error is shown, it is marked as unavailable.”

The tracker pings 11 different services locations within the city. A map created using the data shows that the Robotaxis are unavailable in most locations, suggesting that the “high service demand” error is actually covering up the fact that there’s little to no supply available.

Musk has staked Tesla’s future on Robotaxis — part of his broader pivot to AI, robotics, and automation — and to support it, he’s made a number of incredible claims that are yet to be borne out, if ever. He promised that over a thousand Robotaxis would be patrolling Austin “within a few months” of launching, and that over a million autonomous Teslas would be hitting the streets in 2026 after releasing the Robotaxi software to Tesla owners. In July, he also predicted that Robotaxi operations would cover “half the population of the US by the end of the year.”

The actual performance of the cabs would suggest they are far from being ready for primetime. For one, they still rely on the supervision of an in-car human “safety monitor,” who have already had to make several interventions. The cars have been caught violating traffic laws and have gotten into a number of accidents, the details of which Tesla has censored heavily. (Musk recently revealed that Tesla is testing letting its Robotaxis go fully driverless without any human supervision in the car.)

In sum, it’s not a great look for the Robotaxi fleet. But Musk should know by now that size isn’t everything, right?

            <div id="article-text">For the tech of the future, generative AI sure is making a lot of enemies in a very short time.

If 2023 was the year of AI’s awakening and 2024 the year of its frantic adoption, then it’s safe to say 2025 will be remembered as the year it all came crashing back down to reality. From boardrooms to classrooms, from game studios to Senate committees, this will be the year many remember as the one when AI finally wore out its welcome.

For many small towns throughout the US, the AI boom has come wafting in on a cloud of noxious smog that critics say is leading to to increased cancer risk and hostile takeovers of local infrastructure, not to mention skyrocketing electricity bills. That being the case, it’s no surprise a huge number of rural communities have spent the year organizing and agitating to shut down the tech industry’s data center projects wherever they pop up.

Indeed, from the Great Lakes to the Pacific Northwest, it seems the one thing people can agree on is that the data centers powering the AI gold rush make horrible neighbors.

Beyond the data centers, AI is helping corporations increase the rate at which they exploit workers — both on the job and at home. Back in spring, for example, Visa announced plans to let AI agents loose on customers’ financial information, one of many companies to experiment with a pivot to AI customer service.

Of course, most Americans would rather bash their heads against the wall then talk to an AI customer service agent — not that there’s much of a difference, they’d argue — as consumer sentiment surveys show. The hatred is so palpable that Americans have even taken to accusing human customer service agents of being AI when they don’t get their way.

Corporate big wigs aren’t the only ones getting fat off the AI boom, to be sure. With newfound tools to pump out ultra-realistic content at an industrial scale, Facebook scammers, art forgers, and racist influencers are also getting in on the fun.

This kind of wild west approach has fueled a rise in protest movements like Pause AI, a group calling for a halt of AI development until we can figure out what the hell is going on. 2025 even gave us our first anti-AI hunger strikes, spontaneous protests by activists in San Francisco and London. Others have risen up against AI-powered surveillance dragnets powered by companies like Flock Safety.

Amidst the outcry, a handful of politicians in the US seem to have taken notice. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, for example, recently kicked off a campaign calling for a pause on the “unregulated sprint to develop and deploy AI.” He’s joined in his crusade by New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who recently blasted Republican legislators for their attempts to pass a 10-year ban on state regulation of AI.

Though the two progressive lawmakers might not have much support from their Democratic colleagues, they’re joined by divisive right-wing figures like Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene and Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who have defied their own Republican party in voicing opposition to AI initiatives.

“I’m not buying the narrative that they are trying to sell us on this,” DeSantis said at a recent roundtable on AI, according to the Washington Times.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The adoption rate of AI tools has skyrocketed in the programming world, enabling coders to generate vast amounts of code with simple text prompts.

Earlier this year, Google found that 90 percent of software developers across the industry are using AI tools on the job, up from a mere 14 percent last year.

But all that convenience has come with some glaring drawbacks. The tools have repeatedly been found to be unreliable and inaccurate, which can lead to mistakes falling through the cracks and even forcing some programmers to put in long hours to identify and correct them.

Adding to the reality check, a new report by AI software company CodeRabbit found that code generated by an AI was far more error-prone than the human-written stuff — and by a significant margin. Across the 470 pull requests the company analyzed, AI code produced an average 10.83 issues per request, while human-authored code produced just 6.45.

In other words, AI code produced 1.7 times more issues than human code, once again highlighting major weaknesses plaguing generative AI tools.

“The results?” CodeRabbit concluded in its report. “Clear, measurable, and consistent with what many developers have been feeling intuitively: AI accelerates output, but it also amplifies certain categories of mistakes.”

Worse yet, the company found that AI-generated code produced a higher rate of “critical” and “major” issues, in a “meaningful rise in substantive concerns that demand reviewer attention.”

AI code was also most likely to contain errors related to logic and correctness. However, the biggest weakness CodeRabbit found was in code quality and readability, which are issues that can “slow teams down and compound into long-term technical debt.”

Then there are serious cybersecurity concerns, with generated code introducing issues related to improper password handling that could lead to protected information being exposed, among other insecure practices.

On the upside, CodeRabbit found that AI code was adept at keeping spelling errors at a minimum. Humans were twice as likely to introduce misspellings.

It’s far from the first time we’ve heard of flaws plaguing AI-generated code. In a September report, management consultants Bain & Company concluded that despite being “one of the first areas to deploy generative AI,” the “savings have been unremarkable” in programming and “results that haven’t lived up to the hype.”

Security firm Apiiro also found in its research that developers who used AI produce ten times more security problems than their counterparts who don’t use the tech.

As a result, programmers are forced to pick over the generated code to ensure no glaring issues fall through the cracks. According to a July study from the nonprofit Model Evaluation and Threat Research, programmers were actively being slowed down by AI assistance tools compared to when they made do without them.

In short, while companies made sky-high promises about the tech making programmers’ lives much easier, reality looks far more nuanced. CodeRabbit’s report suggests a shift in the kinds of tasks human developers could soon be required to do — like solving issues being introduced by error-prone AI coding tools.

“These findings reinforce what many engineering teams have sensed throughout 2025,” said CodeRabbit AI Director David Loker in a statement. “AI coding tools dramatically increase output, but they also introduce predictable, measurable weaknesses that organizations must actively mitigate.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/27/ny-governor-hochul-signs-bill-requiring-warning-labels-on-addictive-social-media/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed a bill this week that will require social media platforms to show warning labels to younger users before they’re exposed to features such as autoplay and infinite scrolling.

State legislators passed the bill —  S4505/A5346 — back in June, with text calling for mental health warnings on “addictive social media platforms,” which are defined as platforms offering “an addictive feed, push notifications, autoplay, infinite scroll, and/or like counts as a significant part” of their services, though exception can be made if the attorney general determines those features are used for “a valid purpose unrelated to prolonging use of such platform.”

The announcement from Hochul’s office said these platforms will have to display warnings “when a young user initially uses the predatory feature and periodically thereafter.” Those users would not be able to bypass the warnings.

The announcement compares the proposed warning labels to those that have been added to products such as tobacco, alcohol, and media with flashing lights. Then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said last year that social media platforms should add warning labels.

“Keeping New Yorkers safe has been my top priority since taking office, and that includes protecting our kids from the potential harms of social media features that encourage excessive use,” Hochul said in a statement.

One of the bill’s sponsors, Assemblymember Nily Rozic, made a similar point in a statement of his own:, “New York families deserve honesty about how social media platforms impact mental health. By requiring warning labels based on the latest medical research, this law puts public health first and finally gives us the tools we need to make informed decisions.”

California lawmakers have proposed a similar bill.

Last year, New York passed laws requiring that social media platforms obtain parental consent before showing children “addictive feeds” and before collecting or selling the personal data of users under 18.

This isn’t Hochul’s only end-of-year tech regulation; she also recently signed the AI safety-focused RAISE Act.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">French startup Ÿnsect shot into the spotlight when “Iron Man” star Robert Downey Jr. touted its merits on the “Late Show” during Super Bowl weekend 2021. Now, nearly four years later, the insect farming company has been placed into judicial liquidation — essentially bankruptcy — for insolvency.

The company’s demise is hardly a surprise, as Ÿnsect had been embattled for months. Still, there is plenty to unpack about how a startup can go bankrupt despite raising over $600 million, including from Downey Jr.’s FootPrint Coalition, taxpayers, and many others.

Ultimately, Ÿnsect failed to fulfill its ambition to “revolutionize the food chain” with insect-based protein. But don’t be too quick to attribute its failure to the “ick” factor that many Westerners feel about bugs. Human food was never its core focus.

Instead, Ÿnsect focused on producing insect protein for animal feed and pet food, two markets with very different economics and margins that the company never quite chose between.

That indecision extended to its M&A strategy. In 2021, Ÿnsect acquired Protifarm, a Dutch company raising mealworms for human food applications, adding a third market to the mix. Even as the company announced the deal, then-CEO Antoine Hubert admitted it would take a couple of years for human food to represent just 10% to 15% of Ÿnsect’s revenue.

“We still see pet food and fish feed being the largest contributor to our revenues in the coming years,” Hubert declared at the time. In other words, Ÿnsect was acquiring a company in a market segment that would remain marginal for years — at a time when the startup desperately needed revenue growth.

And revenue was the problem. According to publicly available data, Ÿnsect’s revenue from its main entity peaked at €17.8 million in 2021 (approximately $21 million) — a figure reportedly inflated by internal transfers between subsidiaries. By 2023, the company had racked up a net loss of €79.7 million ($94 million).

So how did a company with such meager revenue raise over $600 million? The answer wasn’t hype-driven crossover funds paying ambitious multiples during the 2021 funding frenzy. Instead, Ÿnsect attracted impact-focused investors like Astanor Ventures and public investment bank Bpifrance that bought into a compelling sustainability vision.

Its pitch to them was simple — offering an alternative to resource-intensive proteins like fishmeal and soy. That same thesis also attracted significant capital to competitors like Better Origin and Innovafeed, and it seemed promising.

But the vision collided with market reality. Animal feed is a commodity market driven by price, not sustainability premiums. In a perfect world, insect protein would be fully circular, with insects fed on food waste that would otherwise go to landfill. But in practice, factory-scale insect production typically ends up relying on cereal by-products that are already usable as animal feed — meaning insect protein just adds an expensive extra step. For animal feed, the math simply wasn’t working.

Ÿnsect eventually recognized this. Pet food proved to be a different equation: It is less price-driven than animal feed and a far better market for insect protein, even with competition from other alternative proteins such as lab-grown meat. By 2023, the company refocused its strategy on pet food and other higher-margin segments, with Hubert citing broader economic pressures.

“In an environment where there is inflation on energy and raw materials but also on the cost of capital and debt, we cannot afford to invest loads of resources in markets which are the least remunerative (animal feed), while you have other markets where there is a lot of demand, good returns and higher margins,” Hubert said at the time.

The 2023 pivot to pet food came too late. By then, Ÿnsect had already committed to a massive, capital-intensive bet that would ultimately doom the company. That bet was Ÿnfarm, a “giga-factory” in Northern France that the company billed “the world’s most expensive bug farm.” Built for insect production at scale, the facility consumed hundreds of millions in funding — money spent before Ÿnsect had proven its business model or figured out its unit economics.

To oversee Ÿnfarm’s launch, Ÿnsect brought in Shankar Krishnamoorthy, a former executive at French energy giant Engie. When that move to pet food failed to save the company, Krishnamoorthy replaced Hubert as CEO.

Ÿnsect then shut down the production plant it had acquired from Protifarm and cut jobs. But shuttering one facility while operating a giga-factory built for the wrong market couldn’t solve the fundamental problem.

The company ultimately failed, and in a statement following the liquidation announcement just weeks ago, its newest and last CEO, a turnaround specialist named Emmanuel Pinto, said its remaining assets are now up for grabs. “We hope that the extensive technical and industrial expertise developed by the Ynsect teams, as well as the commercial relationships they have established, will be put to productive use and make a valuable contribution both to Europe’s protein independence and to the fight against climate change,” he wrote in a statement quoted by French media.

For Professor Joe Haslam, who teaches a course on Scaling Up in the MBA Program at IE Business School, “Ÿnsect’s struggles are not a mystery and not mainly about insects. They are the result of a mismatch between industrial ambition, capital markets, and timing, compounded by some execution and strategy choices.”

The fact that Ÿnsect failed doesn’t mean the entire insect farming sector is doomed. Competitor Innovafeed is reportedly holding up better, in part because it started with a smaller production site and is ramping up incrementally.

For Prof. Haslam, Ÿnsect exemplifies a broader European problem. “Ÿnsect is a case study in Europe’s scaling gap. We fund moonshots. We underfund factories. We celebrate pilots. We abandon industrialization. See Northvolt [a struggling Swedish battery maker], Volocopter [a German air taxi startup], and Lilium [a failed German flying taxi company],” he said.

The failure has prompted some soul-searching. Hubert himself co-founded Start Industrie, an association advocating for policies to support French industrial startups — a recognition that Europe needs more than just funding to build the next generation of deep tech companies.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In recent years, people have been increasingly looking for new ways to form platonic connections, as loneliness and social isolation have become more prevalent.

In 2023, the U.S. Surgeon General went so far as to label this issue a public health crisis. Remote workers, who miss the everyday interactions found in an office, and younger individuals eager to create their adult social circles based on shared interests and hobbies, are among those seeking meaningful friendships.

Thanks to online dating apps, the stigma associated with finding connections online has largely faded away. This has welcomed a new wave of apps focused on fostering friendships and building local communities.

According to estimates from Appfigures, over a dozen local-focused friendship apps have collectively generated approximately $16 million in consumer spending in the U.S. so far this year. Some notable examples include Timeleft, Meet5, and Bumble’s BFF. Additionally, these apps have garnered approximately 4.3 million downloads thus far in 2025.

The apps aim to provide a less awkward solution than, for instance, approaching a stranger at the gym or local café and trying to strike up a conversation. These platforms clearly indicate that everyone using the app is looking for the same thing — friendship, not romance — making it much less intimidating to initiate conversations.

From major players like Meetup to newer ones like 222, there are plenty of apps that cater to the growing demand for meaningful friendships. We’ve compiled a list of them for you to try out.

The app 222 is an iOS-only social events platform that facilitates in-person meetups by pairing a group of strangers based on their personality test results. The app sends invitations to nearby public social events, such as wine bars and comedy clubs. There is then a vetting process, and selected participants are notified on the day of the event. A bonus for those who feel socially anxious: You’re allowed to bring a plus-one.

The service charges a $22.22 curation fee or a monthly subscription for the same price.

Dating giant Bumble is among the more established players to enter the friendship space, launching its friend-finding feature in 2016, which then spun out into a stand-alone app in 2023. The friend-making app has recently undergone a significant redesign, with an increased emphasis on facilitating group meetups, catering to users’ desires to grow their social circles.

BFF is available for free download on iOS and Android devices.

Clyx is another emerging app in the group-based social networking landscape, with a strong focus on discovering local events. The social platform helps users find community events by integrating data from platforms like Ticketmaster and TikTok. Additionally, Clyx allows users to upload their contact lists, helping them see which events their friends plan to attend. The app also includes a feature that recommends other users to connect with at these events.

As of now, Clyx operates exclusively in two cities: Miami and London. However, it has plans to expand to additional areas in the near future, with New York City and São Paulo at the top of the list. The app is available on the App Store and Google Play Store.

Les Amís is a friendship app tailored for women, transgender, and LGBTQ+ individuals that leverages AI to match users based on similar interests and encourages participation in local events, such as pottery classes, book clubs, and wine tastings. Matches are made every Monday, allowing users to chat and plan meetups later in the week.

Available on iOS and Android, Les Amís serves cities across Europe, including Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Madrid, Paris, and Stockholm. In the U.S., the app is available in Austin and New York, with plans to expand to Boston, Miami, and Los Angeles.

The app uses a paid membership model that varies by city, with fees of $70 in New York and €55 in Amsterdam.

The local event-discovery platform has been around since 2002, helping millions of users connect with others who share similar interests. Users can RSVP to events; join groups that cater to a variety of hobbies, professions, or social causes; and create their own groups and events. They can also chat with group members and post updates and photos from gatherings.

This European community-building app recently launched in the U.S., targeting users over 40 who want to meet new people in their area and participate in group activities such as picnics, concerts, and hiking. Notably, in a short time, there have been around 777,000 U.S. downloads so far across the App Store and Google Play Store, according to Appfigures estimates.

Pie is another one of the newer social apps on the market. It features an AI-driven quiz designed to predict which users are most likely to be compatible with each other. Each person who RSVPs to a Pie event takes a brief personality assessment, and the algorithm organizes attendees into groups of six, who are then added to a group chat within the Pie app, allowing them to interact with each other before the event.

Currently, the app is only available in Austin, Chicago, and San Francisco. Users can download Pie from the App Store and Google Play Store.

Timeleft is a relatively new platform that helps you organize weekly dinner dates with groups of strangers. The app uses a special algorithm to match you with others, taking into account your age, gender, and personality. Users are matched with four other people, but they only learn minor details about them the night before, including their occupations and zodiac signs.

Dinners take place at a selected restaurant on Wednesday evenings at 7:00 p.m. To help everyone break the ice, the app offers a game with conversation starters. After dinner, there is an after-party at a local bar.

Users can book dinners online or through the app. In terms of pricing, it varies depending on the country and restaurant. Users pay for a ticket up front and are responsible for covering their own dinner and drinks.

Wyzr Friends is an activity-based friendship app designed for adults 40 and older, catering to empty nesters, those who are divorced, and other users seeking to connect with like-minded individuals. Users can thumbs up or down potential friends and arrange in-person activities based on shared interests, such as going to the movies or hiking.

It’s available on iOS and Android devices in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Ireland, the Philippines, Singapore, and Mexico.

Mmotion is a newly launched friendship app that blends location tracking with social discovery to help users connect with people nearby and explore new bars and restaurants in their area. Upon joining, users can participate in interest-based groups — such as hiking, basketball, or art — view a map of active users, and send messages to those nearby. The app also highlights new places on the map, making it easy to find a restaurant or venue to try.

Mmotion is currently only available to users in New York City on iOS and Android devices. Users must first submit an application to be considered.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Each year, we ask some top investors what they think the next year will bring. Last year, some investors thought the IPO market would be back up and running by now (which didn’t quite happen), while others thought the momentum behind AI was poised to accelerate (and they were right). This year, TechCrunch did the same thing, talking to five investors from various markets about what they are preparing for in 2026.

James Norman, Managing Partner, Black Ops VC

Raising in 2025 requires a shift from “visionary” to “battle-tested.” In previous years, capital has been a primary moat; now investors are wary of “pilot purgatory,” where enterprises test AI solutions without an urgent need to buy. In 2026, the bar is rising. Founders must prove to VCs they have more than just traction; they need a distribution advantage. Investors are digging deeper into repeatable sales engines, proprietary workflow/processes, and deep subject matter expertise that holds up against the “capital arms race.” VCs no longer care about who’s first to market with a flashy demo. They want to know who’s building something that can last, earn trust, and scale long-term.

We believe the funding markets will always be available for the best founders, but the bar will rise. At the earliest stages, especially in AI application software, I do expect fewer mega seed rounds given intense competition and capital already deployed across many categories. Founders will need to stand out with unique distribution channels or perspectives, not just by relying on a large market opportunity and strong backgrounds. Capital moats have already formed around crowded sectors. At the Series A and B stages, top-quartile rounds will require clear evidence of explosive momentum. The market has now adjusted to these expectations with increased scrutiny on the sustainability of revenue.

Allen Taylor, Managing Partner, Endeavor Catalyst

Bigger, faster, better: bigger total addressable market, faster growth, better unit economics. We made 50 investments last year across 25 countries, and we expect to do more this year, so we’re seeing founders at very different stages and in very different markets. The strongest founders aren’t just showing what they’ve built so far — they’re helping investors understand where the business is going next. Real revenue and real customers still matter, but they’re not sufficient on their own. As an investor, I’m always asking: Where is this company today, and where could it realistically be in the next 12, 18, or 24 months? The founders who raise are the ones who can answer that question clearly and credibly.

Dorothy Chang, Partner, Flybridge Capital

A lot of founders are finding it easy to build new things because generative AI coding tools are so advanced today. But in truth, those tools are leveling the playing field for everyone, and competition is more fierce than ever. So founders building for venture scale need to make sure that they are (1) truly tackling a big idea, not just something that’s easy to vibe code; (2) building in a problem area that they are uniquely positioned to win; and (3) bringing something proprietary that can’t easily be replicated. This could be a contrarian approach with unique insights, proprietary access to data, deep networks/relationships, a technological advantage, etc. These aren’t new concepts, but the stakes and expectations are higher than ever.

For founders selling to enterprises, I think the entire world has gotten smarter on the value that AI can deliver, and as such, proving — showing line of sight to ROI — will be more important than ever to investors. Founders who can prove that their products offer much higher value have the best shot at raising capital.

As a fund, we remain industry-agnostic generalists, but we are always sharpening our lens. Today we’re looking for “high-context founders.” In a world where AI has commoditized the ability to write code, the winning edge is now lived experience. We want to invest in the founder who has spent years in the trenches of a complex industry and possesses the bespoke expertise that can be 10x’d by AI. For us, the ideal investment is a marriage of deep subject matter expertise and a “day zero” distribution advantage, meaning founders don’t just know what to build but already know exactly who is going to buy it.

We are particularly interested in sleepy or legacy industries that sit outside core tech founder appetite, where AI can offer step-change ROI that drives adoption. These markets have lower competition and moats driven by complexity that often come with less obvious sectors. We also believe 2026 will be a great year for infrastructure supporting foundational model development, as well as frontier research categories like embodied AI and world models. Healthcare remains a major focus given clear signs of buyer demand; we focus on systems of record and platforms rather than point solutions.

Outside the United States! The best risk-adjusted venture returns are not in Silicon Valley anymore. They are in markets like Poland, Turkey, and Greece.

When you invest across 25 countries in a single year, you stop thinking of venture as something that happens in one place and then spreads outward. Twenty years ago, roughly 90% of venture dollars went to the United States. That flipped in 2018. Today, more than half of venture investment — and more than half of the world’s unicorns — are outside the U.S.

We see this every day. Founders in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia are building venture-scale companies — often serving massive markets from the start. In our pipeline, it’s normal to see founders from Venezuela building in Iraq, or from Sudan building global businesses.

I’m most interested in founders who are tackling massive problems and leveraging technology for forward progress. I’m rather unmoved by the plethora of startups focused on agentically automating workflows for specific verticals. I’m much more interested in the larger platform shifts that will define this era of technological and societal progress.

We’ve seen tremendous impact on software from AI. I think the next frontier is at the intersection of software and hardware. Most of the world’s GDP is locked up in physical industries, and software-only solutions aren’t enough to fully unlock the world’s growth potential.

Yes, the IPO market is likely to thaw, not because conditions are suddenly ideal, but because the system is running out of viable alternatives. We’re approaching a tipping point where the private market’s ability to sustain multibillion-dollar valuations, often disconnected from profitability or liquidity, is wearing thin. Years of “paper markups” have postponed reality, but they haven’t eliminated it. Companies, boards, and late-stage investors increasingly need a mechanism to reset expectations, generate real liquidity, and re-establish price discovery.

Private credit has acted as a stopgap, extending runways without forcing valuation discipline. But that bridge is starting to look more like a pressure cooker. Debt can delay decisions, not solve structural capital needs, especially for companies built for equity-style growth. At some point, fresh capital becomes necessary, and public markets remain the only place capable of providing it at scale. Their growth narratives and strategic importance can provide the “air cover” needed to reopen the IPO window. Once investors re-engage around category-defining leaders, it creates permission for the broader high-growth software sector to follow.

I think we will see a reopening of the IPO markets driven by the backlog of companies planning to list. Many large tech IPOs are anticipated, including darlings like Anthropic and OpenAI, and I believe one of these mega IPOs will drive considerable momentum for others.

Yes — 2026 will be a big year for IPOs in New York as dozens of the top companies simply decide “it’s time.” It will also be a banner year for tech IPOs in places folks are not used to seeing them — like the stock market in Saudi Arabia.

I think people underestimate how global the thaw will be. We’ve had nearly four years of muted IPO activity, which has created a backlog of high-quality companies that are ready to be public. When the window opens, it won’t just be U.S. companies stepping through it. There’s already a cohort of major U.S.-listed technology companies from Latin America, including MercadoLibre and Nubank, and there’s another wave right behind them that public-market investors haven’t fully priced in yet. I don’t think all of those companies list in 2026, but several will.

What’s even more unexpected is what happens locally. You’re going to see meaningful technology IPOs in places like Saudi Arabia, listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). When companies like Tabby [a buy now, pay later outfit] go public locally, it will challenge assumptions about where global tech outcomes happen.

We’re looking to make slightly fewer, more concentrated bets. There is a ton of startup activity, so when we meet founders who really stand out, we want to be able to back up our high conviction with a higher check size and higher ownership percentage.

I think a hard catalyst would be required to reset the IPO markets — something akin to mega AI players facing unprecedented cost increases or sharp revenue declines. Think, for example, of energy prices sharply rising, such that it’s unaffordable to offer compute for AI training and inference.

We’re entering what I’d describe as a clearing event for the venture market, and next year will separate durable platforms from transient ones. The fallout will hit Fund I managers who haven’t found their footing, and active Fund II managers struggling with a [distributions-paid-in-capital, or DPI] drought from 2021 vintages. Traditional institutional anchors, particularly university endowments, are effectively in repair mode. After being squeezed by the absence of liquidity in 2021 and 2022, many are leaning on secondaries, pacing adjustments, and portfolio-smoothing strategies just to maintain existing commitments.

That means fewer new relationships and far less tolerance for emerging or undifferentiated managers. Stepping into their place are family offices that have moved from passive LP roles to active market forces. They aren’t just filling the “LP oxygen” left by retreating institutions; they are scoping direct mandates and using [registered investment advisors] to hunt for unique, high-conviction strategies.

In 2026, there is no viable middle ground. You need to have a clinical, defensible track record and/or truly unfair access to differentiated deal flow. Lightly grounded generalist positioning, soft networks, and “good enough” performance won’t survive this cycle.

We believe we are in the early innings of AI transformation, so we expect next year to be a strong vintage. Capital continues to concentrate in a select number of winners so we focus on being selective and operationally supporting our companies to earn our right to concentrate. We are advising our portfolio companies to strengthen their balance sheets in case of a downturn in 2026 while focusing on building for the long term rather than optimizing for fast funding.

Amazing time to back the boldest founders building for the next 10+ years! From a fund manager’s perspective, 2026 looks strong on both deployment and liquidity. Last year we had 12 liquidity events — all through M&A and secondaries. That matters because venture has grown dramatically over the last two decades, while paths to liquidity didn’t keep pace. What’s changing now is that venture is building a more complete liquidity toolkit — M&A, secondaries, and IPOs working together.

That’s critical when founders are committing 10, 15, even 20 years to building companies. At the same time, we’re seeing real structural shifts in core sectors. Financial technology, especially stablecoins, moved from experimentation to mainstream adoption in 2025, particularly in markets like Latin America and Africa. In those places, this isn’t speculative technology; it’s infrastructure. That combination is why 2026 looks like a strong year to be deploying capital.

We’re still searching for phenomenal European founders building groundbreaking companies. Great companies are formed in all cycles.

In 2026, the “AI curiosity” that fueled the last two years is being replaced by a demand for application and scale. We are moving from the era of building models to the era of building businesses. The fastest, most innovative companies aren’t the ones with the largest LLMs; they are the ones using AI to solve high-value, domain-specific problems that were previously too complex or too manual to scale. Investors aren’t looking for “AI startups” anymore; we’re looking for exceptional tech founders who have found a way to use this intelligence to 10x the efficiency of a massive, traditional market.

We expect investor and startup interest to continue at all-time highs. However, I do think we will start to see tuck-in acquisitions, acquihires, and wind-downs in highly concentrated sectors such as coding automation, sales automation, marketing, and advertising as market share starts to concentrate in select assets.

It will continue. But by the end of 2026, I predict AI will stop being a separate category, as it will just be a part of all new technology companies being built.

There’s a lot of breathless talk about AI right now — and that’s understandable. We’re still very early in understanding what this technology will actually change. In moments like this, excitement tends to run ahead of clarity. Some companies will be transformational, many won’t, and pricing will take time to adjust as real use cases emerge. The opportunity isn’t in labeling everything as “AI.” It’s in understanding where AI meaningfully changes cost structures, speed, or decision-making inside real businesses. That’s where durable value gets created.

This is one of those moments when the fog is thick, and that’s when outcomes diverge the most.

I don’t see it slowing down anytime soon. We’ve seen a lot of dollars go into infrastructure and theory; this year we’ll see a lot more of that investment more clearly turn into enterprise value at the application level.

AI will remain a hot topic, barring negative hard catalysts that dramatically change conditions, like an energy crisis or a rise in default rates.

One of the most unexpected shifts of 2026 will be the quiet end of the “ChatGPT-first” era in startups. Not because generative AI loses importance, but because no single model remains the default starting point. GPT is no longer consistently best-in-class for search, image generation, or video, which fundamentally changes how tech companies architect their products. The savvy founders in 2026 have already graduated to a multi-model world, and instead their focus has shifted to specialization.

For example, Anthropic has effectively captured the developer’s mindshare because Claude Code is better at building with you, and Google has finally activated its structural advantages. With Gemini 3, it’s pairing top-tier image and video generation with deep multimodal capability and native access to Google’s search and data ecosystem. That combination is proving hard to compete with. Model choice becomes an infrastructure decision, not a moat. The winners in 2026 won’t be the companies that “use GPT,” but the ones that orchestrate multiple models seamlessly, abstract complexity away from users, and build proprietary workflows on top.

We expect to see many successful startups built with only one or two rounds of capital. AI tooling (especially coding automation) enables many early-stage companies to accomplish profitability without excessive burn. From a technology perspective, while LLMs are expected to be everywhere, companies will start to scale back usage in favor of more controlled use as enterprises prioritize explainability, cost, and reliability. This could drive heavier use of small models, deterministic and probabilistic hybrid models, world models, or simulation modeling.

The end of the Russia-Ukraine war will bring about a renaissance of investing in Ukrainian founders, who are some of the best in the world! Two additional things will genuinely surprise people. First, international companies — especially from Latin America — going public in New York at scale. Second, major technology IPOs coming out of the Middle East, listed locally. When companies like Tabby go public on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul), it will reset expectations about where global tech leadership lives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Attend a public event in Canada and you will likely hear it open with a land acknowledgment. In the city of Vancouver, for example, the script might read:

“This place is the unceded and ancestral territory of the hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ and Sḵwx̱wú7mesh speaking peoples, the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations, and has been stewarded by them since time immemorial.”

I’ve been present for many of these recitations, which are common in liberal areas of the United States too. They are usually received by their audiences as a Christian invocation might once have been: a socially required ritual in which only some believe, but at which it would be rude to scoff. After all, what harm does it do?

In the past few months, Canadians have learned that these well-meaning pronouncements are not, in fact, harmless. Far from it. Canadian courts are reinterpreting these rote confessions of historical guilt as legally enforceable admissions of wrongful possession.

In August, a British Columbia court ruled that the titles to public land across 800 acres south of downtown Vancouver must be subordinated to a new “Aboriginal title” belonging to a group of about 5,500 Indigenous Canadians.

Although the judge in question has claimed that this decision does not apply to private land, the logic of this ruling has proved so muddled that it has called into question not only the private titles of some 150 landowners in the region but also the ownership of almost every piece of private land in British Columbia—and possibly all of Canada. Some Americans may try to apply this precedent to the U.S. too.

The effects of the decision have been swift and harsh. Commercial-property values have collapsed in the city of Richmond because of uncertainty over titles. A hotel valued by its lenders at more than 110 million Canadian dollars in August traded hands for $51.5 million in October. I spoke this month with a landowner who had a major Canadian lender terminate discussions on a $35 million construction loan after the decision. At least one lease on an industrial building has been called into question because the tenant no longer knows whether the landlord still owns the premises.

To offset the damage, the government of British Columbia has offered $150 million in loan guarantees to local landowners, putting taxpayers on the hook.

The dollar amounts at stake are enormous. Before the ruling deflated values, the more than 100 homes, businesses, and commercial properties in the area were valued at $2 billion. Yet because this case ostensibly doesn’t apply to private landowners—who are expected to litigate their own cases—they were denied any opportunity to defend their interests. At an earlier phase in the proceedings, advocates for the plaintiffs argued, “It foments adversity and unnecessary hostility to frame this as a claim against private property holders”—a clever move, which the British Columbia courts accepted in 2017.

Eight years later, the judge in the case continued to dismiss concerns about property rights and the integrity of titles. Such talk, Justice Barbara Young ruled in her decision over the summer, “inflames and incites rather than grapples with the evidence and scope of the claim in this case.”

In the name of justice for historical misdeeds, the judge decided it was acceptable to deny Canadian landowners basic due process before depriving them of their rights.

The decision in Cowichan Tribes v. Canada “grapples with the evidence” in ways that may seem exotic, if not bizarre, to most legal scholars. Many claims for aboriginal title in Canada turn on “oral history”—stories and songs about the past preserved by the claimants. Such testimony would normally be prohibited by the rule against hearsay evidence, which exists to screen out unverifiable statements. The judge in this case acknowledged in her decision that “the ‘truth’ lying at the heart of oral history and tradition evidence can be elusive.” Yet she allowed this “elusive” truth to become the basis of a claim for billions of dollars’ worth of Canadian property. (Cowichan leaders did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)

If the logic of Cowichan is upheld, there is scarcely a landholding in British Columbia—or much of the rest of Canada—for which ownership is secure. My wife and I own 20 acres of rural property in Ontario. Our title, like that of most of my neighbors, traces back to Crown grants issued more than 200 years ago. All of those titles could be retroactively voided if the Cowichan precedent becomes Canadian law.

The lands at issue in Cowichan are situated in the delta of the Fraser River. About 35 kilometers upstream lies the city of Port Coquitlam, which marks the eastern verge of greater Vancouver. Much of Port Coquitlam is undeveloped. The terrain was once too boggy and hilly for construction projects and is now protected as parkland. At the center of the city, however, is a highly developable 244-acre parcel formerly occupied by a provincial mental hospital. If building rules are relaxed, that parcel would be very valuable.

In 2016, an Indigenous group filed a still-pending land claim against the city of Port Coquitlam. The members want control of much of the city’s open spaces, including the former-hospital parcel, riverside parklands, and the premier athletic facility, Gates Park. The Kwikwetlem First Nation is even smaller than the Cowichan; it has a registered population of 560. In an interview this month, the group’s leadership disavowed interest in private lands, but the value of the public land sought is more than enough to make every member of the group a multimillionaire.

At the opposite end of Canada, the federal government agreed in February to pay $17.5 million to two Indigenous groups in tiny Prince Edward Island. Ontario is negotiating a claim for 36,000 kilometers, including the land underneath Canada’s Parliament buildings. In New Brunswick, the federal government paid $145 million in 2021—and now faces a demand for more than half of the province. An Indigenous group recently filed a Cowichan-like claim for much of the parkland on the Quebec side of the Ottawa River, opposite the Canadian capital of Ottawa—along with $5 billion in cash.

The Cowichan decision is an extreme but logical extension of an unresisted political revolution.

Among many Canadians in positions of influence, an idea has taken hold that Canada’s founding was a great crime that must be atoned for. The term usually applied to this atonement is reconciliation. That term is misleading. Reconciliation implies some kind of mutuality, but the Canadian version is strictly one-way: Demands by Indigenous nations and affiliated nongovernmental groups produce concessions, which invite yet more demands, which beget yet more concessions.

The Canadian national conscience is rightly troubled by the serious social problems afflicting Indigenous Canada. Indigenous people have shorter lifespans than other Canadians. They are less likely to graduate from high school. Their communities have been devastated by substance abuse. Indigenous women are disproportionately likely to suffer violence from the men in their lives. Indigenous men are more likely than other Canadians to go to prison.

Canadian politicians have directed considerable resources to trying to improve these ghastly trends. The federal Indigenous budget nearly tripled over the 10 years of the Justin Trudeau government, exceeding $32 billion a year—almost what Canada spent on national defense in the past fiscal year.

Yet these funds are often spent without concern for how they are used or whether they help anyone. A September 2025 federal report, for example, found that from April 2020 to March 2023, an Indigenous federation in Saskatchewan received $30 million for COVID-related programs, of which nearly $23 million went to expenditures deemed “questionable.”

Is this scale of suspicious spending typical? It’s hard to say. The Conservative government of Stephen Harper proposed the First Nations Financial Transparency Act, passed in 2013, which called for Indigenous communities to publish their accounts and salary structures. The Trudeau government, elected in 2015, promptly announced that it would not enforce this law—and even reinstated funding for Indigenous groups whose funds had been suspended for past violations.

Despite this support, the past decade has been calamitous for Indigenous people. Life expectancy for First Nations people in British Columbia dropped 7.1 years from 2015 to 2021, according to the nonprofit Indigenous Watchdog. Life expectancy for First Nations people in Alberta fell seven years from 2019 to 2023 and is now nearly two decades shorter than that of other Albertans, according to the province’s health statistics. Manitoba has seen similar trends.

The principal culprit has been a surge in deaths by drug overdose. In British Columbia, Indigenous people are six times more likely to die of a drug overdose than non-Indigenous residents. In Alberta, the disparity is eight times; in Ontario, nine.

As Indigenous people’s conditions have worsened in Canada, Natives’ advocates have become more radical in their critique of Canadian society.

In May 2021, a researcher announced a terrible discovery, which the CBC reported: “Remains of 215 children found buried at former B.C. residential school, First Nation says.” Other reports swiftly amplified this story with new grim details, including claims of about 751 unmarked graves near a different school in Saskatchewan. These reports were accepted and repeated by Prime Minister Trudeau and his government, and they triggered a spasm of national remorse. Flags over federal buildings were lowered for more than five months, the longest formal mourning in Canadian history. Provinces, cities, universities, schools, and other institutions engaged in rituals of contrition.

In 2021, Canada made September 30 a national day for truth and reconciliation. In May 2022, Prince Charles—Canada’s future head of state—visited the country to express contrition for the suffering of “survivors” of residential schools. Pope Francis visited that July to “beg forgiveness for the evil committed by so many Christians.” By October 2022, a motion to condemn Canada’s residential-school system as “genocide” passed the federal Parliament by unanimous consent.

Despite exhaustive investigations, however, no human remains were in fact found at the Kamloops, B.C., school or at any other alleged site of “mass graves.” Numerous claims of unmarked graves at other locations turned out to be nothing more sinister than rural cemeteries that had fallen into neglect.

There is no denying that abuses occurred at these residential schools, which ran from the 19th century to the 1990s and separated more than 150,000 Indigenous children from their families and communities to assimilate them into the dominant culture. The Harper government formally apologized for these abuses in 2008 and paid nearly $2 billion in compensation. But the more dire accusations of children buried in secret graves ultimately unraveled. Many Canadians began to feel as if they had been hoaxed. Grave Error, a book debunking the charges of genocide at residential schools, became a national best-seller.

Radicalization on one side, and resentment on the other, have grown together.

Now, in a generous impulse to share Canada’s wealth with First Nations, courts appear poised to destroy the systems that created the wealth in the first place.

The big cash transfers of the past decade proved only an opening bid for an even more audacious ambition: the redistribution of land rights from “settlers”—as non-Indigenous Canadians were invited to call themselves—to Indigenous groups. Unlike the ballooning federal Indigenous budgets of the past decade, which were approved by a majority in the Canadian Parliament, the matter of land redistribution has been left to the courts.

In the 20th century, aboriginal lawsuits typically turned on a breach of some treaty between the Crown and a Native population. In the 1984 case Guerin v. the Queen, for example, the aboriginal owners of treaty land in Vancouver sued the government over a deviously unfavorable lease and ultimately recovered $10 million in compensatory damages.

The problem raised by cases like Guerin, however, was how to win in the absence of a treaty violation. A solution was found in a magic word in the Canadian constitution: and.

The Canadian constitution assumed its modern form in 1982. Section 35 of the constitution affirms “the existing aboriginal and treaty rights” of Canada’s aboriginal population. Aboriginal and treaty rights? That conjunction has opened the enticing possibility that there might exist constitutionally enforceable aboriginal rights not specified in any treaty.

In the 1997 case Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, the supreme court approved a claim to 58,000 kilometers of Crown land. The Indigenous plaintiffs contended that even in the absence of a treaty, they held an “aboriginal title” to the land because of their continuing relationship to the area—a relationship proved by the plaintiff group’s songs, legends, and oral traditions. Once a hazy concept, “aboriginal title” has expanded into a right with real bite. In 2004, the supreme court of Canada ruled that the government had a duty to consult and accommodate Indigenous people anywhere that aboriginal title existed, or might later be found to exist.

That is the meaning of the phrase unceded and ancestral territory in those seemingly benign land acknowledgements. The phrase is not just a well-meaning observation about history; it’s an assertion of a continuing property right.

The traditional theory of Canadian land law is that private ownership traces back to a grant or sale by the Crown. But if large areas of Canada had remained aboriginal all along—if they never belonged to the Crown in the first place—how then could the Crown grant or sell them? The whole subsequent chain of transactions must be invalid.

The invalidation of Crown grants underlies the Cowichan outcome. It is also now prompting a powerful backlash.

On December 11, an appellate court in New Brunswick decisively rejected a Cowichan-like case for the redistribution of private land in that province: “A declaration of Aboriginal title over privately owned lands, which, by its very nature, gives the Aboriginal beneficiary exclusive possession, occupation, and use would sound the death knell of reconciliation with the interests of non-Aboriginal Canadians.” The New Brunswick decision does not overturn the Cowichan case, because Canadian federalism does not work that way. It does, however, complicate the Cowichan precedent, creating a contradiction left to other courts to resolve.

Once an aboriginal title is recognized, its holders can collect formal and informal rents from those who seek to develop what is Indigenous land. Such rents are now an everyday feature of Canadian life.

British Columbia will host seven matches of the 2026 World Cup. News broke early this month that the B.C. government paid $18 million to Indigenous groups in an unexplained connection to the Cup. The government and the groups offered only hazy explanations of what the payment was for, but it looks a lot like a fee to not raise objections. Another Indigenous group was offered $10,000 per person, presumably so it would not object to the reopening of a major gold mine in northwestern British Columbia.

From the May 2021 issue: Return the national parks to the tribes

Canada faced serious economic troubles even before the reelection of President Donald Trump in 2024. Business investment per worker declined from 2015 to 2025, the term of Trudeau’s prime ministership. Canada’s labor-productivity growth effectively stalled after 2017. According to a 2024 report for the Business Council of Canada, “The number of energy and natural resource major projects completed in Canada dropped by 37 percent between 2015 (88 projects) and 2023 (56 projects).” Also, critical-minerals production is down, “in many commodities by double digits since 2018.” Judicial decisions about the rights of these lands are not the only reason for Canada’s big construction slowdown, but they don’t help.

The uncertainty cast over private property by the Cowichan decision poses a particularly serious threat to Canadian investment and development. The judge in the Cowichan case offered little guidance to private landowners, and mostly recommended that the provincial government negotiate with the Cowichan on their behalf.

More than a few British Columbians doubt the commitment and effectiveness of their government’s advocacy for landowners. The government of New Democratic Premier David Eby has gone beyond even Trudeau’s federal government in its pursuit of a reconciliation agenda. In 2019, the province formally adopted the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into its local law. This was justified at the time as another benign goodwill gesture. But this month, a B.C. court ruled that this law really is law. It held that the province must now consult with Indigenous groups before approving any new mining project—and potentially any new land development—anywhere in the province.

B.C.’s attorney general, Niki Sharma, insisted to me that her team would vigorously defend private-property rights in court. She vows to appeal the Cowichan decision to the highest courts in Canada. But local officials are skeptical of the province’s pledges. Brad West, the mayor of Port Coquitlam, was dismissive of Sharma’s assurances when I met him earlier this month: “Just about everything that they said wouldn&#39;t happen is now happening.”

Canada has worked itself into a box. Prime Minister Mark Carney arrived in office this year with promises to accelerate the big national-development projects that stalled in the Trudeau years. But just when Canada most urgently needs to jump-start the country’s economic growth, the country’s courts are inventing new obstacles to development.

This bout of judicial activism justifies itself as reconciliation. In reality, it’s a formula for division, resentment, and backlash. Canada is moving in a dangerous direction when it can least afford such misjudgments and mistakes.</div>

How do you measure a year? In cups of coffee, yes, but also in the rushed early-morning breakfasts, the many trips to the grocery store, the slow dinners spent with friends. Each tells a story of how we filled our days.

Some of this year’s food preferences reflect how Americans’ lives have changed. As my colleague Yasmin Tayag explained in May, diners serving the classic American breakfast—eggs, potatoes, and coffee—were once a staple of affordability. Now, as supply shortages and tariffs affect these foods, stepping out for breakfast “can require a level of budgeting once reserved for fancy brunch.”

It’s not just prices that have changed; so, too, have Americans’ taste preferences. In August, Ellen Cushing wrote about how food is becoming spicier. More than half of American consumers are likely to buy an item described as spicy—up from 39 percent in 2015, she reported. Then there are the fried-chicken sandwiches. Consumption has increased 19 percent at American restaurants, threatening the burger’s long-held dominance.

Today’s newsletter explores how to understand the food that Americans ate this year.

The classic American version hasn’t changed much in a century. Now it faces an identity crisis.

More Americans are setting their mouth on fire—for extreme sport, and for everyday thrills.

Wraps are popular again. So is a certain kind of physique.</div>

            <h2>A ‘Trump Class’ Folly on the High Seas</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-27</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/trump-navy-drones-ships/685445/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, Donald Trump announced a new class of U.S. Navy battleships, which will be named after him. The Navy said that the new warship type “will be the most lethal surface combatant ever constructed.” The president portrayed the move as a boost for American shipbuilding and vowed to be personally involved in the ships’ development. “The U.S. Navy will lead the design of these ships along with me,” he said, “because I’m a really aesthetic person.” Yet the “Trump class” battleship program seems optimized more to produce a scary-looking vessel than to address the rapidly changing threats to American military power on the open seas.

Late last month, Ukraine’s military signaled a major shift in how wars between nations will be waged in the coming years. Using the country’s homegrown Sea Baby naval drones, Ukrainian forces badly damaged two oil tankers off the coast of Turkey, in the Black Sea. Shortly thereafter, another oil tanker was attacked, reportedly also by the Ukrainians, in waters thousands of miles away, in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Senegal. A similar attack on a tanker occurred earlier this month in the Mediterranean Sea.

All of these vessels are believed to be part of the so-called shadow fleet of tankers that, despite multinational sanctions against Russia, have been sailing the world’s oceans and delivering large quantities of Russian oil. Disrupting the invader’s oil industry, thereby starving the Kremlin of revenue, has become essential to Ukraine’s survival, and the use of cheap weaponry to disable faraway oil tankers is a crucial part of the country’s military strategy.

The conflict that began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has revealed the erosion of many post–World War II norms, including on the high seas. After many decades of relative peace on the world’s oceans, one can easily forget that civilian ships were once a routine target of military operations during wartime. But long-range anti-ship technology has become so effective—and so cheap relative to other ways of attacking an enemy—that the risk to merchant vessels will rise sharply. Even countries such as Ukraine, which has limited means and minimal naval experience, can thwart their enemies’ maritime interests in ways that have been almost unthinkable for 80 years.

Deliberate attacks on civilian shipping were widespread in the first half of the 20th century. Both world wars included major campaigns to destroy commercial shipping, resulting in the sinking of many millions of tons of merchant vessels. During both conflicts, German U-boats attacked vessels in waters all around the world, with the goal of starving the United Kingdom of supplies and forcing it to sue for peace.

Over time, naval practices adapted to the submarine threat. By using convoys—large groups of merchant vessels protected by British, American, and Canadian escort vessels—the Allies were able to better protect their shipping. An intense technology race occurred between submarines and their pursuers. The development of sonar, radar, long-range aircraft, and self-guided weapons helped tilt the balance against the U-boats. Ultimately, the Allies destroyed so many enemy submarines that the campaign became too expensive for the Germans to continue.

Since then, Germany’s defeat in both world wars has served as a cautionary tale to countries that might be inclined to target civilian shipping, and the overwhelming dominance of the U.S. Navy has further dissuaded most other nations’ armed forces from attempting similar campaigns. Yet however much the threat to civilian ships has disappeared from the public mind, a successful war against merchant trade could be devastating. By one estimate, approximately 90 percent of world trade is carried by ships. The scale of this movement of goods and raw materials—without which much economic activity around the world would simply cease—requires a global fleet of about 50,000 merchant vessels with crews totaling more than 1 million merchant sailors, according to the International Chamber of Shipping.

In this context, what the Ukrainians have been doing since November is ominous. In the next large state-to-state war, Russia’s shadow oil tankers won’t be the only casualty, and naval drones such as the Sea Baby won’t be the only culprits. Submarines, so consequential during World War II, remain potent weapons for sinking merchant ships—particularly in combination with other technologies. Anti-ship missiles, launchable from the air or the ground, are more accurate and destructive than ever, and have gained longer range. Aerial drones, which have become ubiquitous in the war in Ukraine, both on the battlefield and in the attacks on city and civilian infrastructure, represent a further threat.

Merchant ships, using their own resources, cannot reliably defend themselves against these technologies. Even if they travel in convoys protected by warships and aircraft, efforts to fend off all drone and missile attacks could easily fail because of the cost differential between offensive and defensive weapons. Systems to attack shipping are inexpensive, and equipping even large warships with sufficient weaponry to protect them will be an enormous challenge.

The Ukrainians have used unmanned aerial vehicles to attack Russian naval bases and logistics infrastructure, and their anti-ship missile, the Neptune, sank the largest Russian warships in the Black Sea. Even though none of these systems is as powerful as their Western or Chinese equivalents would be, they have done extraordinary damage to Russian naval capabilities.

A war between large powers, such as the United States and China, would be devastating for worldwide shipping. But the fundamental difficulty of defending shipping extends to warships as well. U.S. aircraft-carrier battle groups may be the world’s most expensive concentrations of weapons systems. They are made up of a range of warships, including the carriers themselves—the newest of which, the USS Gerald R. Ford, cost an estimated $13 billion. They carry large numbers of F-35s, some of the most expensive aircraft in the world. And they are also crewed by thousands of specialized sailors, who cannot be replaced quickly. And yet, for all their extraordinary cost and value, carriers are vulnerable to attack and must be defended primarily by escorting vessels.

The Chinese would only have to calculate the number of missiles and drones the U.S. could intercept at any one time and deploy more than that—which, considering Chinese manufacturing capacity, would not be a challenge. The balance of power in naval warfare is shifting from the ships that seek to defeat outside attacks to the technologies that do the attacking.

The implications in the Pacific Ocean are frightening for the U.S. Navy—and offer one more reason, based on present trends, the United States is poised to lose an extended war in the region. A strategy that failed the Germans in the world wars is far more likely to succeed today, and the impact on the global economy and power balance could be profound.</div>

How to describe this year … Slop? Rage-baiting? Pantone white? Yes, and: The Katie Miller Podcast.

If you’re wondering who Katie Miller is and why high-level officials keep going on her podcast: She made a name for herself during the first Trump administration by denying that the Department of Homeland Security was separating families. This year, she was an adviser to the Department of Government Efficiency, a brilliant effort that did not in fact save money but certainly did destroy a lot of goods and services! She is also Stephen Miller’s wife. Yes, that Stephen Miller—the architect of the administration’s immigration policy, an exercise in wanton cruelty that has demanded 3,000 arrests of undocumented immigrants daily and has taken a wrecking ball to thousands of lives.

Since August, Katie has hosted a soft-focus podcast in which she interviews administration-adjacent figures and people who I guess must be, by some definition, celebrities? (A large potted plant is there also.) At the end of almost every episode, she poses the question: “If you could host a dinner party with three people, dead or alive, who’s at the table, and what are you eating?” So far, the guests, and their varied answers, have offered what I think is the perfect encapsulation of this very strange year. Forget your top 10 movies and top 11 news stories—“The Top 10 Dream Dinners Hosted by Guests on The Katie Miller Podcast” is the year-end ranking that 2025 deserves.

I have taken the liberty of organizing these dinners into a list, from most to least likely to go well. Let’s begin.

10. Kellyanne Conway, media commentator and President Donald Trump’s former adviser

This is Jesus’s first cameo at one of these dinners! It will not be his last. Kellyanne Conway has a lot to ask him, and she anticipates that he would also have a lot to ask her. (Speaking of people trying to go directly to the Roman-Catholic source, we got a new Chicago-style pope this year! Note that he is not invited to this dinner.) This is the first episode to introduce what will become a persistent problem: the debate over whether Jesus counts as a dinner guest who’s dead or alive. Theologically this is a rich question, I feel! I am Episcopalian, though.

Guests: the entire Miracle on Ice men’s hockey team from 1980

“Who are you?” I picture the men’s hockey team asking. “I’m Kash Patel, children’s-book author and director of the FBI,” Kash Patel responds, through a mouthful of chicken-parm hero sandwich (his meal of choice). “Recently I’ve been in the news because the FBI keeps detaining the wrong people of interest in high-profile cases, and I keep making agents provide security to my country-singer girlfriend.” I feel that the conversation would trail off quickly after this point.

8. Cheryl Hines, actor and wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Guests: Her grandmother Ruth, Carol Burnett, and Maya Angelou

I am arriving at the theory that if your grandma is going to your imaginary dinner, it should just be all family. I’d love to have my grandma at such an event, but I think if Carol Burnett were also at the dinner, she might clam up.

In case you’re wondering why Cheryl Hines is getting interviewed—her husband is the current health secretary, who is diligently working to reintroduce the measles virus to its original habitat (inside of people’s respiratory systems), where it had been hunted almost to extinction. It is rare to have a measles conservationist in this sort of position, but that’s the Trump administration for you: trying things that have never been tried before. What if the conspiracy theorists were inside the FBI instead of outside it? What if we didn’t have an East Wing?

7. Adena Friedman, Nasdaq president and CEO

Guests: Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and the astronaut Sally Ride

I’m getting worried about the stock market! It kept going up this year, largely because we keep spending more on AI in hopes that this certainly-not-bubble will lift all boats and eventually result in profits. The architects of AI even got to be Time magazine’s Person(s) of the Year. STOP PUTTING AI INTO ALL OF MY THINGS! I don’t want it there. It’s like the letter u that British people are always dropping into words: It adds nothing and leaves me unsettled.

Friedman’s dinner features three “trailblazers” who would be eating a Thanksgiving dinner. She said these might be very different conversations, but I can actually see this meal going well! As long as they don’t discuss the stock market—having led the country through the Great Depression, FDR might bring up some questions that could kill the mood.

Guests: Isaac Newton, Donald Trump, and Abraham Lincoln (a popular pick)

Given that Trump described Abraham Lincoln as someone who “did something that was a very important thing to do, and especially at that time,” I think it is likely that Trump does not know who Abraham Lincoln is or what he did, and the possibility of a dinner party where Trump is forced to reveal this in real time is intriguing to me. My sense is that he would try to bring up that his uncle was a professor at MIT and then compliment Lincoln on his height. He might be disappointed to hear that Lincoln spent so much time fighting against the Confederacy. I don’t know what Isaac Newton would do; maybe drop an apple.

Including Trump in this dinner when that seat could go to literally any human being living or dead is the kind of pandering we have come to expect from the vice president, whose other 2025 highlights include complaining to Europe about the “enemy within,” being one of the last to see Pope Francis alive, and suggesting that he hopes his Hindu wife will awaken to Jesus one day.

Guests: Maya Angelou (again!), Albert Einstein, and Ozzy Osbourne

This one gets points subtracted for the menu, which is: French fries, red wine, peanut butter, hot sauce, and ice cream—I have to assume not together, but Michaels did say that this was all that they would need, so, who knows! “What is The Biggest Loser’s trainer doing on this podcast?” you ask. This year, she came out swinging in defense of Trump’s directive to the Smithsonian to say nicer things about America and stop harping on about slavery. “​​Do you realize that only less than 2 percent of white Americans owned slaves? You realize that slavery is thousands of years old?” she said on a CNN panel. “I’m surprised that you’re trying to litigate who was the beneficiary of slavery,” the CNN host Abby Phillip responded. Have fun at your dinner with Maya Angelou, Jillian.

Guests: Jesus, Abraham Lincoln, and George Washington

Mike Johnson calls this dinner “very American-centric,” which raises some questions for me. Did I miss important information in the Bible about Jesus’s nationality, or, conversely, important information about the establishment of religion in the Constitution? Will Jesus bring a translator with him? In Johnson’s episode, he sounds stressed, as he should be—he’s had a busy year: passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and as few other bills as possible, shutting the government down, and blocking and then reluctantly allowing the release of the Epstein files. An ambitious brief for anyone! And that’s not all that he has to worry about: In the course of this interview, he agreed that his brain (and, perhaps, the brains of all men?) was like a waffle.

Guests: Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelensky, and Vladimir Putin

When he hasn’t been ordering the extrajudicial killings of people in boats or kicking the press out of the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth has spent most of 2025 lecturing people who have better things to do about how much he hates beards. I wonder if he will be able to restrain himself from doing so at this dinner. (Then again, the Ukrainian president is used to being lectured on his appearance in lieu of any progress on the war engulfing his country.) Knowing Vladimir Putin, he may skip the dinner entirely, forcing Trump and Hegseth to pursue him down the tarmac to his plane, with their steak (well-done) and Thousand Island dressing in hand. (That’s the menu Hegseth picked. “The unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable,” as Oscar Wilde put it.)

2. Elon Musk, CEO of too many companies to name, former DOGE honcho

Guests: William Shakespeare, Nikola Tesla, and Benjamin Franklin

Elon Musk imagines that his guests would enjoy an epic 12-course meal of probably not cheeseburgers, but maybe little, tiny cheeseburgers, which never taste as good as the big ones, but if someone really tried, they could be made to. (He riffed, if that is the word I want, on this cheeseburger question for what felt like ages.) Having to hear from Musk and be subject to his whims has been, unfortunately, a feature of 2025. His DOGE efforts are why we don’t have USAID any more—resulting in an estimated hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths, providing him with a new first line in his obituary, and forcing Tesla owners to buy a little disclaimer bumper sticker for their car.

I have put this dinner pretty high on the list because I think that if Nikola Tesla had the whole Musk situation properly explained to him, fisticuffs would almost certainly ensue. The idea of Tesla and Musk fighting each other over tiny cheeseburgers while William Shakespeare and Ben Franklin look on … to me, this is an ideal party.

1. Katie Miller, podcast host extraordinaire

As far as I can tell, we never hear who is joining beyond the “Grandmother of Europe.” Katie Miller starts to tell Senator Katie Britt about her own dinner picks and never finishes! Tantalizingly incomplete. Who would the other guests be? Perhaps Stephen Miller, who, allegedly, “only eats mayonnaise.” (“With french fries, or, like, period?” J. D. Vance asked during his episode. “Period,” Miller said, later elaborating: “It’s whatever.”) The only dinner worse than one where Elon Musk fights Nikola Tesla while William Shakespeare and Ben Franklin look on is one where Katie Miller and Queen Victoria try to carry on a conversation while Stephen Miller sits silently next to them, eating mayonnaise.

The next time you’re at the airport or checking into a hotel, you might notice a traveling group that looks, at least at first glance, a little unwieldy: young kids, their parents, and their grandparents, all vacationing together regardless of age or mobility limits.

A scene like this would have been rare a few decades ago, according to Susan Rugh, a history professor at Brigham Young University who wrote about the history of family travel in her book Are We There Yet?: The Golden Age of American Family Vacations. The classic 20th-century family vacation was typically a nuclear one, comprising a mom, a dad, and their young kids. Grandparents and other relatives seldom came along. But more and more, research shows, families tend to bring multiple generations with them. This, in turn, has changed people’s preferred travel destinations, and even the very purpose of travel: Multigenerational groups are much more likely to take simple, relaxed beach vacations than to embark on logistics-heavy city visits or road trips.

Are your parents addicted to their phone? In this episode of Galaxy Brain, Charlie Warzel explores how technology is affecting an older generation of adults. Instead of a phone-based childhood, Warzel suggests, we may be witnessing the emergence of a phone-based retirement—one shaped by isolation, algorithmic feeds, and platforms never designed with aging users in mind.

To untangle whether this is a genuine crisis or a misplaced moral panic, Warzel speaks with Ipsit Vahia, chief of geriatric psychiatry at Mass General Brigham’s McLean Hospital in Massachusetts and a leading researcher on technology and aging. Vahia emphasizes that older adults are anything but a single category, and that screen use can be both protective and harmful, depending on context. The key, Vahia argues, is resisting reflexive judgment. Ultimately, this is an issue not of screens versus humans, but of how families navigate connection in a world where attention is mediated by devices in every age group.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Ipsit Vahia: Don’t go, You’re spending too much time on the phone. Instead, perhaps ask, What are you watching on your phone? What apps are you into? This is what I do with my phone. You could use their phone use as a conversation starter, as a way to meet them where they are, as a way to perhaps enter their world rather than expecting them to jump straight into your world. And, you know, it can just be the basis of strengthening connection rather than breaking it.

Charlie Warzel: I am Charlie Warzel, and this is Galaxy Brain. About a year ago, around the holidays, I began to hear a similar complaint. People were heading home, often with their kids in tow, to be with family. It was there that they noticed that their parents, or grandparents, or older relatives were behaving differently.

Broadly, the complaint was that their older loved ones seemed consumed by their devices—constantly on TikTok or Instagram or Facebook, watching vertical-reel videos. Sometimes they said they found it hard to hold a conversation. In multiple instances, people reported that some of these adults seemed to not pay much attention to their grandchildren.

Most of the people that I spoke to recognized it pretty quickly. It was the same thing they’d seen in their own kids: a screen-time problem. So, naturally I was curious. I wanted to get a sense of the scale of this. So I asked around on social media. I got dozens of responses over the year. From young people, from older people. Lots, lots of people.

Some older folks, they wrote in to tell me that they felt bad about how much time they were beginning to spend on social media. Others told me they’d found joy in the process and that there was no problem and I was over-hyping it. But many confirmed the anecdotes. Some feared that their loved ones were growing depressed or anxious as a result of a problematic relationship with their screens.

Others worried about older relatives falling victim to scams. Almost all of them, though, stressed that this felt like an emergent phenomenon—something that had popped up since the pandemic. I heard stories like this one from Josh.

Josh: It’s super interesting to watch my kids and my dad interact in the same space. With my kids, they love screens. They’ll spend an hour most mornings watching Bluey or Sesame Street or something. But when it’s off, they generally switch gears. They’ll go bike, they’ll do gymnastics, they’ll play board games. They engage with the world around them. My dad, on the other hand, is constantly glued to his screen.

He’s reading the news; he’s scrolling through his email. With my dad, there is no off switch. When we look at photos from his trips to see us, they show the kids engaging with their grandma, playing games, being silly, while grandpa’s in the background playing a game on his iPad.

Kim: I’m 55. I have tween twin girls. I worry a lot and spend a lot of time controlling their screen time. And it’s kind of a joke, because if they saw the amount of screen time that I have in a day, it is way more.

Warzel: Kyle worries about what his parents are seeing.

Kyle: It’s really tricky to talk to my parents about anything news-related.

My parents are both, you know—they’re very intelligent, they’re thoughtful people. But media literacy is a problem for them in a way that it isn’t for my teenage kids who were kind of raised with an understanding of the dynamics of digital content. I mean, we all spend our days staring at screens. But the screens that my parents are staring at is this really toxic combination of Facebook and Fox News.

So it gives them these distorted views of things. You know, like: Portland is violent; New York City is super dangerous; immigrants are selling fentanyl to schoolkids; isn’t [Zohran] Mamdani anti-Semitic? You know, that kind of thing. And it’s hard to break through that information bubble. I’ll call my mom out sometimes for sharing disinformation online. But like, how do you tell your mom she’s participating in a Russian disinformation campaign? I sound like the crazy person in that conversation.

Warzel: But perhaps the most affecting one came from a nurse in the United Kingdom

Nurse: I’m a nurse in the U.K., working in an inpatient ward. Most of our patients are in the 50-plus age group, and the majority have smartphones or iPads. When you’re stuck as a patient in the hospital, a lot of the time you’re bored or lonely or both. That can mean loads of really excessive screen time. It’s probably the 50-to-75 age group I’m most worried about, because they’re tech savvy enough to be where they want to be online, but they’re not necessarily media literate.

They might not recognize harms or understand how algorithms funnel consumption in certain directions. Some of it is fairly benign, like being obsessed with fake-AI animal stuff or compilation videos of babies. And sometimes it’s actually been pretty funny, like when folk end up in an autoplay cul-de-sac of Chinese-language videos.

But I do think the negative effects of excessive scrolling are bleeding through more, mostly in the anti-immigration stuff we hear. And the conspiracy thinking, medical distrust too.

Warzel: These testimonies struck me in part because they sound quite a lot like the concerns voiced for years by parents about children and devices. In the last decade-plus, there have been endless panics—many warranted, and others less borne out by the evidence—about children and screens. That their young minds are being influenced or warped by devices designed to take advantage of them. In most cases, screen panics position children as defenseless, even agentless.

They’re confronting this force that’s powerful enough to cause problematic behaviors among their underdeveloped minds. But now it seems the problem exists on the opposite side of the age spectrum. Data suggest there’s a reason people might be noticing this more now, because more people are aging into a retirement era with more fluency with smartphones and tablets and social media. On YouTube, for example older people are among the platform’s fastest-growing demographic. It’s possible that the pandemic and the attendant isolation accelerated all this adoption, from rideshare apps to Zoom. The confluence here seems very real. Older individuals may have extra time, and they may be more socially isolated than other demographics—and they’re seeing their retirement era just collide with this extremely powerful algorithmic world of social networks, apps, on-demand streaming services, and even the arrival of generative AI.

These are things that confound people of all age groups. But older people are not by any means a monolith, and technological tools are very clearly lifelines for aging people. As well as tools that can bring great joy, information—help them live full and creative lives. This is a really complicated issue, and so I wanted to speak with an expert and find the perfect guest here.

Dr. Ipsit Vahia is the chief of geriatric psychiatry at Mass General’s McLean Hospital. He’s the director of its technology and aging laboratory, and he’s been studying this phenomenon—and more importantly, working with patients in clinical settings. He joins me now to talk about all of this.

Vahia: Thank you for having me. Delighted to be here.

Warzel: So you head up the technology and aging laboratory at McLean Hospital. Can you tell me what you all do there?

Vahia: Sure. So it’s a clinical-research laboratory that’s focused on understanding the way older adults use technology, and then also leveraging technology in a clinical setting with older adults with dementia or other mental-health challenges.

So we have a broad range of areas in which we do research. This includes early diagnostics, technologies for monitoring and supporting clinical decision making. But they’re also developing interventions using tech.

Warzel: So how did you get into this line of work, especially working with people on the furthest side of the age spectrum there?

Vahia: There’s actually an origin story there. When I was a trainee, it was when smartphones first came about, and I think I remember this incident very specifically. It was the year 2009. I was a trainee in California, and my wife and I were out for dinner with friends, and we had a 4-year-old child in tow. And he was doing what 4-year-olds do. He was boisterous, and I saw a simple thing. Again—this is circa 2009, so this is quite common now.

But in 2009, I had never seen this before, where my friend took out his smartphone and gave it to his child. And the child was engaged with it, and we didn’t hear a peep from him. We made it through four courses of dinner. Glass of wine, even.

Vahia: Now it’s default. But back then, the thing that it really made me think about was that: If this engagement with the screen could sort of stabilize the behavior of a child, could it do the same for someone that was, you know, functioning at the level of a child? Which is to say: someone with dementia. Could we use these devices to engage them? Could we use these devices to reduce agitation?

A little after that, when iPads came out, there was a different incident. So when I was working on the inpatient unit, we had a routine. And the routine would be that every morning started out with everyone gathering in the community area. And we would just read from the newspaper. And this was intended to sort of create the sense of community. A shared activity that brought everyone together. It also let us assess how people did in that group setting, because it’s a predictor of how they might do when they were on the outside. Now, on the morning that I was supposed to lead the meeting, the newspaper never showed up.

It was stolen, lost; we don’t know. But this was when iPads had just come out, and I happened to have a personal iPad with me. And an interesting thing happened that morning where, in the absence of the newspaper, I was able to pull out the newspaper’s website on the iPad. And we kind of went through the same exercise, but now it was digital.

And what happened was someone raised their hand and asked me—can you access only The San Diego Union-Tribune? I was training at UC San Diego, so that was the local paper. And I said, well, no, I can access any newspaper that has a website. Now, this was a Monday morning, and it was a very specific question. He said, “I’m from Pittsburgh. Can you tell me what they’re saying about the Steelers game last evening?” And so I did. I was able to pull up the column, and we talked about that when this happened. Another person raised their hand, and he’s like, “Well, that’s great. I’m from St. Louis. Can you find out what they’re saying about the Rams last evening?” And so I was able to do that.

And now, suddenly everyone was asking not for this one-size-fits-all newspaper reading, but they were able to get what was most important to them. And that was sort of the other big moment where I realized that you could, you know—with this device that we already had figured out engages people—we could also personalize the intervention.

And in many ways it was not about the tech at all. It was about what the tech made possible. And there’s a difference, because I think, to this day, some of the way we think about this is about the tech. But I’ve always thought about technology as a conduit to problem-solving and an intervention.

So as a clinician, the thing that we anchor our work around is: What is the patient need? Or, what is the clinical problem? And then think about—is the technology we have before us able to solve some of these?, And that served us well. I think that served us well.

Warzel:  So tell me a little bit about—you work with this elderly population; you’re working on these types of interventions.

You’re also deeply attuned to the way that they use and interact with technology. Broadly speaking, how would you classify how people on this side of the age spectrum are using technology? Are they a monolith? Are they extremely different and varied? Like, how would you describe, you know, the elderly’s interactions with technology?

Vahia: Thanks for that question. I think that’s the question that really gets at the heart of it all. So, I think if our listeners learn exactly one thing from this entire podcast, it should be that. Older adults are probably the most heterogeneous group of all the age groups. And we don’t always think of it that way, right?

We think of the elderly as this one monolithic entity. I love your use of that word. And nothing could be farther from the truth. So if you pause and just think about this for a second. We think of everyone over 65 as part of this one block, right? We have infants, and then we have toddlers, and then we have pre-K kids, and then we have elementary school. And we are quite sophisticated in the way we compartmentalize people across the age span.

But then we get to age about 65, and they’re all seen as this one block.

So. In the “elderly” group, if we consider people in their 90s and people in their 60s, these people are 30 years apart. If you’ve seen and understood one older adult’s use of technology, you’ve really seen and understood one older adult’s use of technology.

Yeah, and I think this overgeneralization does not serve us well. Which is not to say that there is not truth in the data. I think older adults, as a whole, do use less technology, but it varies quite a bit by. age cohort. So, you know, 80-year-olds may not be quite as digitally literate around apps or mobile phones, but 60-year-olds assuredly are very proficient as a group. Now there’s exceptions, obviously, on both ends.

Warzel: Well, that makes a lot of sense. Right? You would expect that between a 65-year-old and a 95-year-old, there’s 30 years there—there’s a lot of life and context experience. And I think you’re right that we do paint people in a lot of age brackets, but especially the elderly, with this really broad brush.

But I am curious from what you are seeing—and this will contextualize a little bit of what I want to dig into in this conversation—but do you notice that there is a different effect on older generations in terms of the way that they are using technology than, say, younger generations?

Like, if you were taking the bucket of zero to 10 versus, let’s say, like 75 to 85. Do older generations use—like, is the effective technology different than what you see on younger generations?

Vahia: It is, again, with the understanding that one size does not fit all. Older adults as a whole—they’re slower to take up new technology, and they’re much more methodical about it. So I think older adults as a whole are less likely to just experiment or play with tech. They adopt technology when it serves a clear and defined purpose in their lives on the whole. So a great example was what we found during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, right? Among older adults, being tech proficient actually predicted better mental health—and that’s because most of them use technology or newly adopted technology to stay connected. I’ll give you an example from our own work. We, like most health-care systems, sort of had this en-masse migration to telemedicine through Zoom or whatever. And we found that most of our patients were not already using this technology, and so we had to train them on how to use it.

And an interesting thing happened. We found that, of the people who were the majority that figured out how to use telemedicine through phones, et cetera, the ones who did best were the ones that learned Zoom. Not to keep their doctor’s appointments, but it was because their church started doing services virtually, or their family started having gatherings virtually. And then, once they learned it, they were using it way better and way more regularly and effectively than, say, younger populations. So the data are fascinating, because they find that high technology use in teenagers and adolescents is associated with worse mental health and is a predictor of sort of more isolation and loneliness, even depression. Whereas in older adults, engaging in technology seems to be protecting them from isolation and loneliness, and it seems to be enhancing connectivity. Now this finding might evolve over time, but broadly I think tech use and tech engagement is a positive for older adults, when broadly it’s more of a negative for younger adults.

Warzel: So that’s really fascinating and I think helpful in grounding what I want to get into here. Because there is a, I guess you’d call it like a meme online. But this is really just a whole bunch of anecdotal evidence that suggests that—I’ll put it this way—I have done a lot of reporting, talking to different people about elderly people and screen-time use. And a lot of what I’ve seen is these anecdotes from younger people. They go home for the holidays; they see that their loved ones who are older are kind of deeply engaged with their phones, with their iPads, with social media. In a way that younger people are recognizing—it’s potentially problematic. Or at least it makes them uncomfortable, right?

They come home; they say, I brought my kids over, you know, grandma and grandpa. Or Mom and Dad weren’t paying as much attention, right. They were just kind of stuck in their devices. This is really worrisome. And I have so many of these anecdotes that have piled up. Or you go on places like Reddit, and you see this “Help; my mom or dad has this screen-time problem.” And there is this developing feeling. I think you’re starting to see some news articles, and things like that, that say we associate screen-time problems with younger generations. We’re always worried about adolescents. And what they’re seeing—perhaps there is also this problem on the other side of the age spectrum.

I am curious: What is your reaction to all of that anecdotal evidence? Like, are you seeing this too? This idea that, where also technology may be beneficial, but are you seeing a screen-time problem forming generationally?

Vahia: So that is so interesting. Because I think the answer is yes. And I think we are seeing increased screen time among older adults as a whole. I think this is definitely true. But there’s a lot of nuance there. Because, I’ll preface it by saying that younger generations—you know, people are more similar to each other in the routines of their lives than not, right? Everyone goes to school. So there is sort of these like activities and routines that extend across the community.

And then, once we get older, you know, elementary-school kids are more like each other than middle-school kids. And middle-school kids are probably a little bit more like each other than high-school kids. And college kids are not quite as like each other. And then, you just continue to separate out. So as you get into late life, people have just had unique life experiences. And while there are similarities, I think there’s also a lot of differences in that life experience. And I think why that is relevant is—we have fewer sorts of ways to determine what constitutes problematic screen use.

So yes, there is increase in screen time; there is increase in screen use. But when that becomes problematic, you really kind of need to get into the weeds with each person to sort of decide if this is a good thing, if it is just what it is, or if it is a problem. To the example of people seeing their older loved ones at the holidays and finding out that they’re spending a lot more time with their phone than they used to. I hear that story in my clinic. I actually see that in my family—like, that’s probably familiar to a lot of people. And the way I think about it is, I mean, yes—you observe it when you meet them during the holidays. The problem is, you’re not there the rest of the time. And what are they doing with their lives the rest of their time? And is this a habit that formed because they just didn’t have all that much going on? And so, now their life is running more through their phone, through their perspective. Is it possible that they have a nice routine? Their phone is a big part of it, for better or worse. And your arrival is actually the disruption. Which is not—

Warzel: That’s so important though, right? Because there is this idea that you are dropping in to getting this window into their lives. Right? And when we talk about some of the issues, especially with people who are much older. Being isolated, being untethered from reality. Real life, right? Like, like civic life, right? If you can’t drive; if you’re in a rural or a remote location. And I think that’s a really helpful observation that this influx of people, or, you know, around the holidays or something is actually like aberrant is, is abnormal.

And the rest of the time these devices could be serving a really smart purpose. Or a really helpful purpose, rather. I wonder, though, when it comes to some of what is being seen—this is a separate part of this. It’s not just that when I hear these anecdotes that are reported that I am, or that they’re coming home and watching their loved ones be deeply embedded in their devices. A lot of the worry, too, is around what they are looking at, right?

This notion that they are scrolling on Facebook, you know, what me and my colleagues are calling “reel slop,” right? Like r-e-e-l. Where they’re seeing these AI-generated videos of things that are either, you know, misinforming them, or just strange and kind of detached from reality. And, like, really low quality, right?

Like, these aren’t the mitigations that you are talking about, where it’s allowing someone to play puzzle games that are sort of, you know, keeping their brain elastic. This is, like—kind of tuning everything out and just being washed over with low-quality slop content.

Is that a worry? This idea that the phones are helpful—and the connection is helpful and the tether is helpful—but what they’re seeing is potentially harmful, because it’s really low quality?

Vahia: It is a worry. And I think it’s real, and it’s consequential. So, the dark side to all of this screen news has a few different dimensions. I actually think the biggest one is that as older adults are spending more time on the phone, it’s getting easier for scammers to target them. And I think the screen-based scam targeting older adults—I think that is a real problem and a real threat. And with AI, it’s becoming even more sophisticated, because sometimes these scam tools can be really quite hard to distinguish from humans. Especially when the AI is talking to people. So I think that’s a risk. The slop is a risk too. Much has been said and written about misinformation in general, and older adults I think do tend to be a little bit more trusting of a technology that they adopt. I think that that innate skepticism isn’t always there.

And, again, the devil’s always in the details, right? If someone’s just scrolling through a social-media feed where they’re watching a video after the other, that’s a little bit different than two people forwarding content to each other. Or on a chat group, where there’s also communication and correspondence.

I think one of those things is—neither of them is great, but one of those is slightly better than the other. Because one of them involves interaction and communication, and the other one is just much more passive, which is less ideal.

Warzel: You know, participating in the same way, having sort of a panoply of options.

If you talk to younger people about their phones—and by younger people, I mean all the way up to, let’s say, 55, right? They’ll tend to complain about their use. They’ll talk about their doomscrolling, or I wanna get off this, or, It’s not helping me live my best life. But what are you hearing from older people that you meet with in terms of self-reporting? Are they worried about the time that they’re spending on their devices? Are they okay with it? How do people seem to feel about it?

Vahia: In preparation for this conversation, I kind of polled my colleagues. I work in a team with nine other aging and mental-health specialists. And I just told our team that, Have you seen this? Has anyone brought this up?

And the answer surprised me. That no one’s actually had any of their patients—and we see several hundred people—no one could really acknowledge or remember someone coming to them with problematic screen use as something to address. I think they were there for other things, and you sometimes uncovered a lot of screen use. But unlike, say, you know, substance use or alcohol use, or even things like gambling, we haven’t come across yet the issue of too much screen time as a bona fide problem that requires a mental-health professional. Others may have. So I think I’ll be watching the response to this to see if anyone can share a story. But we are seeing clear reports of more time being spent on the screen.

So, where my head’s at is—we are seeing people spending more time on their phone. But it’s not necessarily being thought of as a problem. And that’s interesting, isn’t it? Because if you’re spending way too much time doing something, you usually know when it’s a problem, versus when it’s not. And I see that as a signal that it’s probably got at least some benefits, or some positives.

Warzel: But do you think there’s also a literacy quality there? And what I mean by that is: Something I see from, especially, people in a younger generation than me—Gen Z, Gen Alpha—there is a real understanding, innately, having grown up around this technology, that they know they’re being manipulated at all times.

They know they’re being pushed by these algorithms into this thing. And there’s a frustration there, I think, because of just the understanding of the technology. It being so innate. Do you feel like maybe a little of this—maybe the lack of what you’re hearing on the end of the older people—comes from maybe not having that same media literacy? Understanding of the ways that the technologies work?

Vahia: I do think that that’s a part of it. But I also think it’s specific to this moment in time, and that digital literacy just takes time to trickle up the lifespan. So I think we are starting to see this shift. But these things are always going to start at the younger, more hyper-connected, more tech-literate generations, and then trickle up the age span.

There’s also the kinds of tech that older adults use. They tend to trust more mature, more subtle technologies rather than the latest, greatest thing. So, you know, most people are still happier about something like Facebook—which at this point counts as mature technology or at least a mature platform—and they’re less prone to whatever the newest ones are. Snapchat. We are paying attention to ChatGPT and sort of the new generative-AI models. I think a lot of people have their eyes on this, because every now and then we kinda see these leaps in tech adoption. So older adults historically were less prone to using computers. And by computers, I mean the classic desktops.

And then they were also—they used laptops a little bit more. But they were behind when cell phones emerged; they were not as quick to adopt cell phones. They were also slower to adopt smartphones. And then the tablets arrived, and that just seemed to mark this whole en masse onboarding of the technology because—it’s that Goldilocks phenomenon. iPads were just right. I think the screen was larger. The keys were larger. So just easier to type for people with sensory impairment or visual impairment. But also, they were so easy to use. You didn’t need to upload software; you didn’t need to download software. It was all kind of right there. You had to tap it. It was easy. So I think you see these generational leaps around ease and efficiency of use. And a lot of us believe that as these generative AI has gotten more—you know, as we’ve moved from typing to speaking, that’s marking a shift. It’s just so easy now, where you have a device and you tap in, and something is talking to you. And it talks back, and you can have a conversation.

So I think you have these like leaps every few generations of technology, and just simplicity of use. So I think we’re on the threshold of seeing a lot of change, as these voice-based AIs become commonplace.

Warzel: Are you seeing a lot of—just anecdotally—a lot of adoption of the voice-based AI?

Vahia: We are. We are. And, you know, it’s anxiety-provoking. Because I think it really brings all of the things that we’ve talked about to a head. That—I think it creates huge opportunities, but it also creates massive risks.

Warzel: Right. We recently had Kasmir Hill, a New York Times reporter, on the podcast, who’s done a lot of reporting around what people are informally calling “AI psychosis.” That’s not a medical definition, obviously, but this idea of problematic behaviors with chatbots. And something that she has noted, in the reporting that we talked a lot about, was this idea of the ways that these chatbots are so engaging, right? It’s not just that they mimic human nature and that they are conversing. Which I think—with someone who may be more isolated in general, or feeling like that—that is extremely attractive as a proposition.

But also this idea that they are prompting you to continue to engage, right? They are also sort of asking questions at the end of it. Wanting you to go further. And the more that people do engage, the higher the likelihood that you start to lose touch with what it is you are.

And this goes to people who are younger, too. This is happening sort of everywhere. The sooner you might lose touch with, Oh, I’m talking to a large language model, not a person, not a thing. Are you seeing any problematic examples of those interactions with chatbots? With some of the people that you’re seeing in the clinic?

Vahia: So personally, not yet. But it’s a matter of time. Because the thing that I’m nervous about is that bots—it’s that validation function. They rarely contradict during conversation. It’s more, it’s what you said. Like they’re designed to be facilitating, but they’re also designed to be validating. So a bot will not say no. A bot will say yes, but also if it wants to contradict.

And I think there’s a real risk there—that if someone has a question about something, and it’s risky. I’ll make up a ridiculous example. But, say, if an older adult were to ask their daughter, Should I send my bank-account information to this Nigerian prince? Their daughter would be, No. A bot might say, Well, that’s an interesting question. Here’s what you should know about this—that there is a scam like this, that maybe you should do this. Maybe you should do this. Maybe you should do that. And there’s a difference, qualitatively. Because one puts an end to a risky conversation, and the other may not put it quite as … sorry. One puts an end to the risky conversation, and the other may continue that conversation because it is designed to engage. And I think that is risky. Because that validation function, right? The bot rarely makes you feel bad by telling you you’re wrong. Even when it tells you you are wrong, it offers alternatives or other ways to continue the discussion.

Warzel: Well—and I think we, you know, should be clear here—or these purposes, that’s hypothetical. You know, it is possible these chatbots will—or that in some cases when you prompt them—will caution people against sending money to, you know, the theoretical Nigerian prince. But I get what you’re saying. Something you said earlier too, I think is very striking to this phenomenon. You know, I mentioned this, you know, short-form video-slop stuff that has historically been very prevalent on Facebook, and also Instagram. You mentioned that older people tend to adopt these more mature technologies, right? Like a Facebook. And I think what’s interesting as a technology reporter is that some of these younger, newer social platforms—they struggle with all kinds of emergent problems, but they’re also iterating out of them a little bit faster. Right? They’re sort of pushing the boundaries a little bit.

It’s interesting to me that you have these people who are on a platform like Facebook, that isn’t updating in the same way, right? Like it is happy to kind of keep that engagement. To not have those rules against, you know, these types of fake AI-slop images. And it feels, to me, like a danger that is not talked about enough potentially. That by not sort of evolving out of the platforms—like a Gen Z person might do—or being on the newest, latest, greatest thing that there is actually a little bit of this. Yeah, there is a danger of using an older platform that is not evolving in the same ways. Because then they get trapped with the lower-quality content. And I think that’s super fascinating.

Warzel: So one of the things that you’ve brought up here—that I think is one of the most salient points for people listening at home who may be dealing with an elderly relative or a loved one who they feel has a problematic relationship with some of their technology—is this idea that it can be really positive. That we should stop, pause, think about what role this is serving in their life.

You are in a clinic with people. You are using this technology in a way that is supposed to have positive interventions. Talk to me about some of the positives you’re seeing here with elders and technology use.

Vahia: So there’s many levels of it, right? The one thing I really try and emphasize is that you don’t have to always be using the most state-of-the-art, high-tech, fresh-off-the-lab tech.

There’s a strong case to be made for just teaching people to use well-established stuff. Properly. A very simple example is: I have people on our team whose job is to teach older adults how to use Uber and Lyft. Why? Because many of them don’t drive. Many of them are isolated. They’re used to calling a car service, or they’re used to calling for the ride. And of course these are benefits, not things they paid for. But, I mean, if I had a dollar for every time we showed someone how easy it is to call a car service that will take you anywhere. It can transform lives, food deliveries, and other examples.

So, you know, is it or is it not “technology” to teach someone how to use a widespread app? I would argue it is, because you are enhancing digital literacy, but you’re doing it around specific function. So some of it is just—people’s mood improves, people’s anxiety goes down. If you can simplify everyday functions that may be a challenge for them.

Warzel: What about in general? I mean, like, there’s those apps that help. But I think, you know, are you seeing positive effects with the social-media use?

Vahia: We can. But it depends on which social-media use. So, a big one is just text messaging, or things like WhatsApp or the Messenger apps. Why? Because if people’s social-media uses anchored around interaction and communication—rather than just the passive consumption of content—that’s a different thing. It’s sort of what I alluded to earlier. That in my family, I have people that—it’s actually quite specific to WhatsApp, that there are people on multiple WhatsApp groups just forwarding what you might consider slop. But it’s one thing to scroll by yourself in your room to watch slop. And it’s another thing to forward slop to each other. And then talk about that slop—whether it be “Is this real?” or “This is so stupid; what do you think?” So there is almost always value in interaction and communication.

I think in-person’s better … but in-person is not always an option, right? And so, you know, slop—when consumed in isolation—I think is almost universally a problem. Slop as giving people a common thing to talk about, that might not have too many common things to talk about? Now that’s a little more nuance, isn’t it?

That’s a little more positive. We know art therapy works. We know music therapy works. But very few people can play an instrument or draw. But if you give them an app that’s equalized artistic talent or musical skill, that’s a positive. So it’s not really about the tech; it’s about how you use it and how you apply it. And I think the art of digital medicine lies in that. The art of digital medicine, the art of digitally based psychiatry, the art of AI use lies in that. I’ll give you an example from an ongoing study, where we have a project where we are comparing a human geriatric-care manager versus an app that is trained on working with caregivers.

And this is all specific to dementia. Which is—it’s a very simple question. We generated, you know, a list of common caregiver questions. And we asked the same question to an AI chatbot and to a human geriatric-care manager. And then we did a third thing. We gave the human care manager access to the bot to see if they could come up with a hybrid answer.

But before we even get into what we found, the biggest finding was that it took our human six weeks to answer all the questions and compose their responses. It took the bot 13 minutes. And a lot of us sort of picked up on the fact that—even though we would not really question that you want a human resource, you want someone to help really work through whatever it is that ails you—the truth is, our human is not going to be available for a three-hour conversation at 11:30 in the night. AI is.

And AI is close enough to the … it’s not perfect, but there is something to be said for efficiency and access. I’m not saying it’s right. I’m saying you can’t discount it.

Warzel: All of that is so conflicting to me.

It’s right, because in one sense, I was kind of laughing earlier. Because of this notion of art therapy, music therapy … and then slop therapy, right? Like, sending it around to others and being connected. And I think that’s important, because it adds a rub to, you know, we look at somebody sort of canonically. There’s this … I don’t know if you’ve heard of Shrimp Jesus. Have you heard of Shrimp Jesus?

Vahia: I don’t think I’ve heard of Shrimp Jesus.

Warzel: Okay. It’s an AI-slop representation of this Christlike figure, but it’s a shrimp. And it was one of the early versions of AI slop that was very popular. And it seemed like … it was not fooling, but sort of bewildering, a lot of elderly Facebook users. Something like that. Anyway, those things are always presented as awful, right? That there’s somebody, they’re like brain rotting instead of generative in any way.

And I think that we have reflexively—especially someone like myself, a technology reporter—have classified something like slop as bad, right? You’re not gaining anything from it. And yet, what you’re asking people to consider is that, just as a meme—as a thing to trade back and forth, a building block of conversation, however silly it may be—or in general, if it’s fostering that kind of tether and that connection, I think that it’s important. And so that’s kind of confounding to think about. Something I wanted to ask you is: I feel like there is this idea that the technology is very helpful to people when it tethers them to reality, right?

Isolation. Loneliness. But I think what we’re also seeing, at the same time, is some of this tech, some of what they’re consuming is actually distancing them from reality. It’s blurring the lines of what is real. So you have this thing, it feels like two things are happening at once, right? Almost at the exact same time. Do you agree with that?

Vahia: I do. I do. And I think that conflict that you’re feeling, that confusion. That asking of, Well, which is it? Is it good or is it bad?

Vahia: That’s actually the appropriate response, because nobody knows. But I think there are some guardrails to this, because the real answer is not, “Nobody knows.” But the real answer is, “It depends.” It depends on the person; it depends on the situation; it depends on the circumstance. I get asked all the time—you know, we now have therapy chatbots. And I get asked all the time—am I worried that these things are going to take away human jobs? And I don’t think so. In fact, I think it’s really sharpening the human effect. And I think it’s very close to what you said. That on the one hand, people value technology that tethers them to reality. But there’s also an untethering. And that’s exactly right, isn’t it? I think that the human function there is to then find the tethering, and to prevent that disconnection and that confusion.

And sometimes it’s as simple as acknowledging the confusion to begin with. We react poorly to ambiguity. I think there is this preference for clarity, and sometimes all we have to do is help people hold their ambiguity. But then do it while giving them some tools around how to then remain connected.

So: brain rot, slop. I think no one would argue … that’s probably not a good thing. But if brain-rot slop is giving you something to talk to people, preferably in the same room and face to face, and if you’re older? If it’s giving you something to laugh at, or something to at least make sure that everyone else is just as puzzled about it as you are? And then maybe it gives you an excuse to call up your grandchild and say, Well, what the hell is this thing? It makes no sense. Then, something positive has sprouted from that slop.

And, I think in many ways, I think there is a certain collective responsibility not to be absorbed by all of this—but to absorb it instead and assimilate AI as a piece that can promote. And this is all very Pollyanna. I’m not saying this is easy. I’m not saying this is how it’s going to go. This is messy, complicated stuff. But there is a reality where this can all be sort of leveraged into a collective positive.

Warzel: Yeah, my concern having covered this for a long time with the social platforms is that I think you’re right. And I would just want to say that I don’t want to paint with too broad a brush on this, and there could be these positive externalities from even the lowest-quality type of content. I think that’s something we all need to keep in mind. Where I worry—where I break a little bit from you is that these companies are generally very poor stewards of the regulations and the rules and the looking out for. And they do optimize for this engagement.

And if you have a segment of the population—be it 11-year-olds, or be it 84-year-olds who are showing signs of deeper and deeper engagement with a certain type of thing—the chances are it’s going to be fed to them at higher and higher rates. Right? And, that, to me is the concern. And that’s not on you, or that’s not on the people who are using this technology. That is, very simply, on people who are in charge of building and designing these platforms not serving their users properly. And that’s distinct from any kind of user behavior.

What I wanted to sort of end on here is: This episode’s going to come out during the holiday season. People are going to be at home. People are probably going to be experiencing this, we’ll call it a “phenomenon,” but just this experience of maybe seeing an older loved one immersed in a device. Maybe feeling a sense of concern. How do you suggest that people breach those conversations? And what should they be saying to someone if they do feel this way?

Vahia: Such a great question. I would say first—if you feel distress, see if you can hold it within you, and resist the temptation to jump to a conclusion about it. So don’t go, You’re spending too much time on the phone. Instead, perhaps ask, What are you watching on your phone?

What apps are you into? This is what I do with my phone. You could use their phone use as a conversation starter, as a way to meet them where they are, as a way to perhaps enter their world rather than expecting them to jump straight into your world. And, it can just be the basis of strengthening connection rather than breaking it.

But who among us responds well to being told whatever it is we are enjoying is wrong? Like, no one enjoys that. So, don’t do that if it bothers you. Fair game. But keep an open mind, and inquire and learn and assess what’s going on—rather than declaring it good or bad.

Warzel: I think it’s so smart that if we are talking about a behavior that seems to be isolating somebody, or seems to be drawing a human disconnect, that the appropriate way to respond to it is to connect with them, right? Not to disengage—or shame them in some way that may draw them further into their device, or further away from the loved ones in their life who they feel like they’re judging.

I think there’s something rather lovely about using this as an opportunity to foster the kind of connection that they may not be feeling. And that may be drawing them into that device.

Vahia: Yeah. It could be a reason to bond, rather than a reason to separate. Because we all bond over things we share in common. For better or worse, too much phone use is something we all share in common these days. Might as well use it.

Warzel: I think that’s a great place to end it. Dr. Vahia, thank you so much for coming on Galaxy Brain.

Vahia: Such a pleasure. Thank you for having me, Charlie, and for focusing on this. It matters.

This is what happens when you dumb people down to create low information voters, you wind up with a populace that doesn&#39;t know how anything works, including themselves.

One of the dumbest features of midwits is that they think they control their impulses.

For most impulses, your awareness of them is borderline irrelevant to affecting outcomes that come as their result. We&#39;ve established this beyond reasonable doubt in fMRI. Delusion machine that tells us that &quot;our conscious mind is behind our decision making&quot; is nothing but one small feature of our actual decision making machine.

Most of which has made the decision based on inputs before it ever hit your conscious mind. Agai

Seems like an appropriate response to OP, who apparently also feels superior.

Everyone is dumb, some of the time. Especially, when they call others &quot;dumb.&quot; There is much more complexity to this issue, than just lack of intelligence.

You&#39;re right, we have a populace that doesn&#39;t know how things work. How many people know how an automatic transmission works? Electric circuits? Of course, computers and software. Not knowing how things work, doesn&#39;t make people dumb. It makes them human. Only a few people *do* know how things work. That&#39;s why we&#39;re engineers and others aren&#39;t.

Maybe. Or maybe many millions of years of evolution has created brains that make snap judgements because it is more efficient to do so. Evolution has probably created a rule that if something looks odd, it likely is odd and ought to be treated as such. Much of this sort of processing isn&#39;t done at a conscious level - so overriding it is hard.

Everyone is a big dumb-dumb then, including you and me.

That&#39;s how human brains work, no amount of understanding will change that. You can work around the problem, like they do in aviation, using strict protocols, but even with that in mind, sometimes, &quot;glitches&quot; in radio communication have deadly consequences, including the worst accident in the history of aviation, the Tenerife disaster.

And the proper response to a technology that is flawed is to fix it, not have people learn how to deal with it. Education

How frequent were the glitches and what were their duration.

I can see persistent stuttering video causing me to have a negative perception. But, one or two Max Headroom moments in a half hour call will have zero effect.

Personally, I don&#39;t understand people&#39;s obsession with most video calls.  I push back on them whenever possible.  I am just fine with a phone call.  I don&#39;t need nor want to see your face, and you don&#39;t need to see mine.  Nor do I need all the hassle and wasted time that goes with it.... almost every time the others saying, can you hear me?  And I out out of sync?  I can&#39;t see you, etc; plus long links, waiting rooms, poor connections, software problems, bandwidth issues, entering passwords, other technical

1) Many non-interactive Webinars are at heart advertising.  The prescribed time is there to force engagement on you.  The effect is similar to the glitch effect - by making you think of this as important, they hope to get more of your attention and perhaps think better of the topic.

2) Cheaper.  If they give a prescribed time they do not have to pay for video storage and similar services. You can just throw up a time and use an existing video conferencing service you alrea

Can you claim that you were denied parole due to a technical glitch? Or that you lost a job prospect for the same reason? Can a care provider claim their ISP or similar is responsible for worsening patient outcomes?

You can sue for anything. In case of something like parole, it would get thrown out immediately because of obvious qualified immunity.

Can you claim that you were denied parole due to a technical glitch? Or that you lost a job prospect for the same reason? Can a care provider claim their ISP or similar is responsible for worsening patient outcomes?Oh, a couple years ago I had a job interview that someone insisted on doing on Zoom. The sole reason I lost the job? The camera was malpositioned. They told the recruiter it was &quot;the worst interview we&#39;ve ever had.&quot; The actual interview went well: It was the Zoom video part of the call that didn&#39;t.

Yes. It&#39;s kind of like dressing for success. How you present yourself matters. And a decent internet connection doesn&#39;t have to be expensive anymore, even cellphone tethering provides good connection quality these days.

When I started working remotely, I went to the trouble to repaint my office (which used to be a bedroom) a neutral color that would look good on camera. I added lighting and wall art positioned to look good on camera. I don&#39;t mind if people&#39;s rooms are visible in the background, but at least

Personally, I judge people on whether they can correctly use &quot;too&quot; when appropriate. ;)

It makes things so frustrating. My boss insists on using VOIP on his cell phone because according to him having a data only plan and using VOIP is cheaper than getting a regular mobile plan.

Most of the time I talk to him it&#39;s just constantly cutting out and the call quality just isn&#39;t the same.  Even when it&#39;s behaving reasonably well it just has weird behaviours and often times you have to call two or three times before it really works.

I keep on telling him he needs to switch it out, but he&#39;s really stubbo

It&#39;s not the VOIP, it&#39;s your boss&#39;s specific plan or carrier. VOIP doesn&#39;t have to be choppy.

That&#39;s a company culture thing. My previous company was always audio only. My current company is much more interested in having people on camera. Audio only is fine for information-focused meetings. But for interviews and 1x1s, where the context is more personal, I insist on camera-on.

Oh, and audio-only doesn&#39;t eliminate glitches, if you&#39;ve got a bad connection.

Back when everything was in person, people counseled job seekers to &quot;dress for success&quot;--to wear clothes that would communicate a professional appearance. Interviewers would often not give a second chance to people who came in scruffily or too-casually dressed.

These days, if you don&#39;t know how to handle yourself on camera, or if your background isn&#39;t presentable, or your connection is glitchy, it&#39;s seen as not being prepared.

When I last interviewed for a job 3 years ago, I literally practiced video calls to

The price for decorative form-factors varies from $95 to $1,100 with the EasyCard bearing the higher prices.

One difference is the 60-120 minutes play length of audio cassette is still as useful today as it was at the time, while the 1.44 Mb capacity of HD floppy discs wouldn&#39;t be useful for nearly anything. Also the cassettes were reliable for hundreds of reads of the music, while floppy discs were randomly failing.Or you&#39;d need to make floppy discs better enclosed and in high densities.

Wow, another slashdotter with TDR. Big surprise lol.

What do worker protection laws have to do with taxes and the current administration? Are you saying that protection laws can&#39;t exist without taxes?

And medical bankruptcy.... did you just make that up? This was news to me and seemed insane, so I searched and couldn&#39;t find anything even close to that. The only thing done was the reversal of rules that prevented medical debt from appearing on credit reports. Um, ok. Why should your debt be hidden from credit

How are toll roads not &quot;taxing appropriately&quot;? The people who benefit from them directly are the ones who support them, it seems like a perfect system.

They are always more expensive because they have to make a profit, and they distort the market by making it easier for larger players to get preferential rates, or simply eat the cost until their competitors fold.

They are always more expensive because they have to make a profit, They aren&#39;t always more expensive, and they don&#39;t have to make a profit. Private toll roads tend to want profit, but public toll roads don&#39;t have that goal. 
Toll roads are always annoying, but things like fast trak (auto pay methods where you don&#39;t need to stop) make them less annoying.

You haven’t driven a toll road lately. Better sit down when you see what it costs to travel the entirety of the PA turnpike. You can I-80 but it’s much further north or route 30 which is a country road with red lights in every town.

The problem with toll roads is that tolls can really only effectively be placed on a minority of roads. Their very existence will distort the roads that people will use (possibly causing congestion elsewhere, for example). Tolls create a two-tiered system where one road costs extra money to use. This will ultimately lead to less than optimum routing of traffic.

A gas tax was in many ways the perfect (as perfect as one can get) tax. You paid into the road system (all of it) according to how much you used it.

Agreed.  It mostly worked.  But it doesn&#39;t work at all with EV&#39;s, and less effectively with HEV&#39;s, and gets out of whack for others when fuel prices swing (because road maintenance cost doesn&#39;t swing with fuel prices; and the tax doesn&#39;t change, it is just a percent per unit of fuel, regardless of the fuel price).

Your link doesn&#39;t discuss changes in progressivity over time.  The US has probably the most progressive tax system in the world (https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/measuring-tax-progressivity-high-income-countries-oecd doesn&#39;t quantify it for the US as a whole, but &quot;the US tax system is even more progressive than Canada&quot;).  It has gotten more progressive over time, including definitely during the Silent Generation and Baby Boomers.  See, for example, https://chicagounbound.uchicag...  [uchicago.edu] and https://taxfou [taxfoundation.org]

A search for &quot;sales tax&quot; in the uchicago pdf has one hit, with this phrase:

Similarly, they [authors of a study] allocate sales taxes to consumers, notwithstanding remittance by retailers.

Basically, a study that&#39;s supposed to be about tax progressivity completely ignores one of the most regressive taxes. And when they do discuss it, it&#39;s so they can pretend that sales taxes are not paid by consumers.

That&#39;s just stupid, at muitiple leves.Yes, you are.  You ignored the context of that sentence: that Saez and Zucman were being inconsistent in that allocation because otherwise &quot;They argue that the appropriate incidence assumption for distributional
  analysis is to allocate taxes based on remittance obligations.&quot;  That would mean allocating sales tax to the retailer.  The sentence you complained about is not in any way an argument to ignore sales tax, it is merely part of the explanation for why Saez and Zucman were excluded from the lite

As long as the donor class doesn&#39;t have to pay the bill of it.

I think that&#39;s a good idea if it stops increasing fuel taxes.

If they just tack on more fuel taxes, then EVERYONE is paying taxes for interstates that many of them don&#39;t even use. So....Yeah, how about you maintain them by charging the people that actually use them? Does that really sound insane to you???

This is how all taxes should be. You should tax/charge the people who use or want to use services. Don&#39;t keep piling on taxes that everyone must pay.

I mean goddamn the Dems love their slavery.

Not True.  Most toll roads are interstates.  In MD, I-95, in Indiana I-80, in PA I-70 plus many others

I don&#39;t drive that stretch of 95 in MD. I don&#39;t drive interstates in PA.

I pay enough in fucking insurance and other things I&#39;m required to pay for in order to have a car; I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m going to pay $23 to drive on a fucking road on top of it.

A lot of toll road proponents seem to think that the &quot;user pays&quot; model should fund roads, and that people who don&#39;t use a certain road shouldn&#39;t be funding them. But that is a completely stupid approach. Public resources need to be publicly funded because the correct model is not &quot;user pays&quot; but &quot;beneficiary pays&quot; and people who don&#39;t use toll roads benefit greatly by not having people who do use toll roads drive through their towns / neighbourhoods.

Our road network, free for all to use, was once a crown jewel of America.

Now they&#39;re picking the jewel out of the crown, smashing it, and running off with the jagged pieces as if they were prizes.

Next I guess I should do the rail network. If you could arrange all US freight trucks end to end in the right place, they would reach the moon. And then you&#39;d have a cool physics toy!

Pennsylvania actually had the gall to claim the turnpike tolls would go away when the road was finished. Now it’s a bloated cash cow with a chunk going to the state police. https://www.ttnews.com/article... [ttnews.com]

The curb weight of a Toyota Camry is between ~3200 and ~3500 pounds.  For comparison, a Tesla Model 3 is between ~3500 and ~4000 pounds.

The curb weight for a Ford F-150 is between 4000 and 6000 pounds. The F150 Lightning is roughly 6000-6900 pounds, all depending on trim level and options.

An ICE Kia Nora curb weight (2020) is 3854 pounds a 2023 Niro EV is around the same, 3833 pounds.  .

A Hummer curb weight is about 6400 pounds. A Hummer EV is around 9000 pounds.

So while EVs tend to be a little heavier, they

I learned in engineering long ago that road damage was proportional to the 4th power of vehicle weight. This is not a complete picture; much road damage is environmental due to temperature fluctuations, etc. But is is mostly accurate in terms of road damage due to the flexing of the roads due to vehicle weight.The myth of electric vehicles being twice the weight may be a result of confusing the cost due to weight. A 19% increase in weight being a 100% increase in road damage.Or maybe it&#39;s just the all too c

Everytime you eat a tomato or a steak you are indirectly paying the tolls. It&#39;s shared infrastructure that is the backbone of our economy. Adding inefficient tax revenue to the operation of this infrastructure will have negative consequences to our economy.

When toll roads are 100% run by the states...maybe.

But the ones in our state...are run by fucking Australia. They get their cut...then the state gets theirs. As a result...they get to do this like misread your tag and bill you $95 for it. They close toll gates and force you to pay by phone.

Maybe if the tolls weren&#39;t run like a scam. But they are...and I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m letting some foreign company get a huge cut for something the state should be doing.

We need to replace the income tax with something similar. Get rid of April 15 and all of paperwork hassles to comply, and hope you got it right. The real benefit would be the government no longer knows all of your income and spending.

Maybe we should have pay-to-use Police and Fire departments? What, you don&#39;t have the money to pay for the Police to stop that burglar? Sorry, we won&#39;t help. House on fire but you can&#39;t find your credit card (oops, left it in the house!)? Sorry, can&#39;t put it out. Call 911 and ask for the expedited service? That&#39;ll cost you.

(Yes, I know in the good old days these were private services... but there&#39;s a good reason that it became the responsibility of the government - it just works better.)

They talked about replacing income tax with a flat federal sales tax for years.

Well..they&#39;ve effectively put a federal tax on everything we buy...AND they&#39;re keeping income taxes.

So...no...the problem is you don&#39;t pay for what you use. You pay for what everyone else uses and some fuckers gold toilet.

Not efficient. There is a cost to administer the collection of the toll. Actually a pretty massive infrastructure is required. All the roads these days need a special reader to pick up the toll tag and a plate reader for those that don&#39;t have the special tag. Then there is the bill mailout structure. It is not cheap. From https://www.kxan.com/investiga...  [kxan.com]  &quot;TTEC’s contract was originally worth $145 million. &quot; That is 145M that could have gone to road maint or bldg. And that is jus

Between paying for HOA fees, higher rates for health insurance, and road tolls, your low tax state isn&#39;t cheap to live in.

A higher highway death toll?   Proponents of this have to be careful at milking their cash cow lest some who are either strapped for cash or just downright cheap get back off those roads and onto &quot;surface roads&quot; and drive, say, US40 instead of Interstate 70, where likelihood of crashes and traffic deaths are higher.   Plus, congestion to towns that these old highways run thru could be another price to pay, as those places start screaming for a bypass, that also may go unused if it is again tolled and those

It would appear that rocket science is still as hard as ever. It should come as no surprise that the maiden launch of a new rocket will probably fail. Gather that data and try again.

Apparently those Brazilian rocket scientists are no brain surgeons.

It doesnâ(TM)t benefit anyone to apologize. People see it as a sign of weakness. Even if you are sorry.

Just saying, they need to stand up, figure it out and try it again. .. but perhaps with a cost effective dummy payload instead.

Iâ(TM)ve read a handful of articles and all of them talk about Brazil and its space program. . . but this rocket is *south korean*! I was only launched from Brazil, not developed by brazilian scientists/engineers.

Why this emphasis on tying bad news to Brazil? I see this going on on Slashdot for quite some time, and many commenters seem to share this apparent sentiment.

Is Brazil so damn awesome that most slashdotters (mostly US-based, I would assume) have this need of making fun of it?

And pardon my typos. âoeIt was launchedâ.

Last year, I bought a pack of Meross smart light bulbs, because NY Times Wirecutter said they were the choice to work with Apple’s HomeKit.  The one bulb I installed worked great with Siri, but only for a little while.  Once HomeKit could no longer see the device, you had to delete it and re-add it, which meant climbing up to the ceiling fan and removing the globe to get to the bulb to scan the QR code printed on the bulb.  After it dropped the third time, I gave up and just use the Meross app to control it.  Dimmimn, color, and color temperature are all controllable.

Home Automation has been promised for at least 11 years now (Apple introduced HomeKit in September 2014; not sure when Amazon opened their APIs to third party vendors).  And for a lot of people, it doesn’t work better than old-fashioned power switches.  Yes, home automation offers new features, you can control them from a distance, or with your voice.  But they also have costs, in configuring, and repairing configurations, and obsolescence, that the preceding technology just didn’t have.

Always look for stuff that can run Tasmota, or another open source firmware. There are lightbulbs that do.

Then you get full control, reliability, and no end of support date.

They do a pretty good job of cross-silo integration. I have products from a half-dozen unrelated companies working together under the Home Assistant umbrella.

At this point I&#39;d be just as happy if 3rd party hardware all just used wifi or USB-serial, plus enough documentation for Home Assistant to integrate them.

The Thread stuff is intriguing, though. It&#39;ll be interesting to see if the new standard gets traction or just fades away like so many before it.

During his first year back in office, President Donald Trump amassed an unprecedented amount of power in pursuit of his far-reaching agenda. His quests to crush the Democratic Party’s electoral power, seize control over the economy, and deport millions of immigrants were all actively abetted by the Supreme Court’s Republican-appointed justices. Time and again—often over the shadow docket, with no explanation—the 6–3 supermajority cleared the path for Trump’s aggressive executive overreach. Those who believed that SCOTUS might serve as a modest check on the administration’s abuses were proved wrong almost weekly, as the court’s far-right bloc delivered win after win to the president it had helped return to the White House. The justices’ rare rebuke to Trump on Tuesday over his deployment of the National Guard in Chicago illustrated just how far outside the law this president must go before a majority is willing to tell him no.

On this week’s year-end episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern ponder the two big questions posed by this alliance: Why did the Supreme Court conservative supermajority align with Trump, and what consequences might it face for its choices? A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: A year ago, we were operating under the theory that three of the six conservative justices were not all in for MAGA and genuinely cared about democracy. That was a mistake. Instead, what we have seen is the so-called center go all in for Trump, doubling and tripling down on the idea that this administration is like every other administration and any judge who tries to thwart it is a woke liberal—including fistfuls of Trump judges who aren’t auditioning for the Supreme Court. And just as the Supreme Court went after DOJ officials during Jack Smith’s prosecution of Donald Trump, it’s now going after judges who stand in the president’s way, suggesting that they are anti-Trump zealots suffering from “Trump derangement syndrome,” while we the justices are normal and must put a stop to it.

Why? It’s hard to believe that they go to cocktail parties with only the furthest of the far-right donors. It’s hard to believe that they don’t occasionally read the Washington Post or the New York Times. So what is going on? And this is the real thing I think we haven’t grappled with, but I’m not sure people who are watching the court have yet satisfactorily explained it, at least to my ears. What possible benefit is there to being the stewards of the MAGA destruction of America?

Mark Joseph Stern: My top-line thesis—and I want you to dispute it, because I don’t know if it’s entirely right—is that these justices have fully cast their lot with Trump and Trumpism. And a big part of Trumpism is antidemocratic, ensuring that political minorities can entrench their own power through undemocratic institutions like the Senate, the Electoral College, and the judiciary, as well as through voter suppression and assaults on democracy. Trumpism seeks to perpetuate a system that privileges the elites, the wealthy, white people, Christians, non-LGBTQ+ people. And I fear that the Supreme Court is now intertwined with that perception of who deserves power and who can legitimately exercise power—which is Trump and his GOP and their supporters. So it fills the need to protect Trump’s entire project from the direct forces of actual democracy.

That’s why one of the big pieces of this puzzle is voting rights. The Supreme Court is currently on the brink of delivering another blow to the Voting Rights Act in Callais v. Louisiana. It has been green-lighting voter suppression for so long. Just this month it reinstated Texas’ racial gerrymander that benefits Republicans. Any conversation of this kind needs to start there, because what we are seeing is the court trying to accelerate and facilitate the Trump agenda—and, on the other side of it, trying to ensure that the people can no longer shake loose this regime or really do anything to stop it and reverse what it has done, because there’s only one true way. It’s originalism and Trumpism, which are increasingly the same thing. And anyone who contests that is wielding an illegitimate claim to power. That justifies taking away voting rights and equal representation and democracy and whatever is necessary to ensure that what the regime’s doing now can just keep going forever.

When I started doing these New Year’s shows, it really struck me that we get absolutely caught up in individual big-ticket cases that weigh toward Trump and the culture wars, without looking at all the cases in the aggregate. When you’re covering the court, it is very easy to think, in the moment: The only case that matters is tariffs. Or transgender athletes. Or birthright citizenship. And, to be sure, every one of those cases is a blockbuster. But if you look at the big themes this year, you’re exactly right: It’s the voting cases. There are a lot of voting cases on the docket. We’ve talked about Callais and Texas’ gerrymander. There’s also campaign finance, plus a major case about mail ballots that the court will hear this term.

I think we really need to see the trend line, which is: The Supreme Court now has six votes to do anything it wants. And it is constantly taking cases about how people vote, where people vote, how their votes are counted, how campaigns are financed. While the big-ticket cases with huge social justice and racial justice implications do matter, it’s the democracy cases that have the biggest impact. We’re barreling into the midterms, and the 2028 election after that. And the way for the Supreme Court to achieve all the big-ticket items it wants is to make sure that Donald Trump and the Republican Party have a permanent majority.

By the way, these democracy cases don’t always get treated as seriously in the public conversation. They can be arcane; explaining campaign finance is a two-bourbon job right now. These are abstractions, and they can get devalued in the discourse. But we have to reckon with the fact that if you are a six-justice supermajority and you want to make sure you can do all the stuff you want to do for the next 10 or 20 years, you need to ensure that nothing will stop you, not even an election.

I do want to add that the birthright citizenship case, while absolutely a social justice issue, is also a democracy case. It’s about who counts as an American. And if the Trump administration gets its way, it would radically reduce the number of people who have a constitutional claim to birthright citizenship and are therefore able to participate in basic aspects of civic life. And that’s a theme that sounds in a lot of these other cases: Who gets to be a full and equal American citizen, and who gets something more like skim-milk citizenship? You see it in democracy cases and civil rights cases alike: Straight white men get the highest form of American citizenship. They can’t stop winning, while everybody else is losing.

That really does lead me to this stakes question, because we ask all the time on this show: What are the stakes for women? For LGBTQ+ communities? For immigrants? But I want to ask the question: What are the stakes for the Supreme Court? Because it seems to me we don’t think nearly hard enough about what is on the line for those six MAGA justices if they don’t shrink democracy enough to change electoral outcomes.

I think they have reached a point of no return, and they are scared of what happens if the political winds switch direction. At least some of them must understand that they have failed to act as independent jurists. In the mind of a majority of Americans, they are a political body, and as I said, they have cast their lot with Trumpism. If they had spent the past year truly standing up to Trump from time to time, I don’t think they’d have as much to fear from Republicans losing political power. I doubt there would be as much Democratic appetite for Supreme Court reform, including term limits and court expansion.

The Republican-appointed justices could have played this smarter if their goal was to stave off Democratic backlash. Giving Trump just 25 percent more losses would have given a lot of people the impression, rightly or wrongly, that the court was more or less doing its job. Americans want to see one branch stand in the way of another when it looks like there is an abuse of power. At this point, though, the justices have gone too far down this road to turn around. And they should be worried, because there is a very real chance that the entire Trumpist project will fall apart. And they are now so intertwined with Trumpism that they might collapse with it. That’s why it is so important for them to weaponize these democracy cases. There may come a time when the only way they can maintain their grasp on power is to oppress the majority.

Over the past calendar year, the Supreme Court’s center has shifted to the right and then more to the right, and the justices’ decisions have time and again facilitated Trump’s agenda. But the Roberts majority is not simply focused on what the current president wants; it has its sights set on a larger project: voting. Suppressing and constraining and problematizing the core function of democratic rule.

In this episode, Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern reflect on the significant developments at the Supreme Court over the past year with an eye toward the implications of the court’s decisions on democracy, voting rights, and the erosion of checks and balances. Looking back at the past year at One First Street, Dahlia and Mark trace the cases that reveal the court’s long game, with elections coming quickly, and discuss the forces for and against democracy being exerted within and without the high court. Then, they turn to the urgent matter of what you and I can do about it.

On Nov. 17, Abdallah Hadian, a civilian imam, strode into a state correctional facility in New York with a firearm. Moments later, he went into the administration building and placed the gun to his head.

Word of the 55-year-old imam’s suicide traveled nearly as quickly as the bullet that took his life.

In prison, no one bats an eye at hearing that an inmate killed themselves. This is especially true among fellow prisoners. Hearing that a fellow prisoner was stabbed to death, or overdosed, elicits a shrug, maybe a nervous laugh. Although we attribute such incidents to the violent and miserable nature of the place we inhabit, most people on the outside chalk these deaths up to the so-called mental health crisis inside correctional facilities, a phenomenon that gets significant attention. It adds to the unfair narrative of prisoners being bloodthirsty lunatics, a framing that benefits tough-on-crime politics.

As a prisoner, though, when you hear that a civilian staff member who left their family every day to go to the awful confines of prison—the same prison where Robert Brooks was murdered—took their own life in such a shocking fashion, it makes you wonder what we’re doing wrong. More importantly, the question swings in the air: What might someone who is living in the free world but considering killing themselves learn from prisoners about hanging on?

I’ve been there. I’m serving my 16th year for manslaughter. In 2009 a drunken argument with my girlfriend devolved into a physical altercation with deadly weapons. She stabbed me, I stabbed her, she died. I immediately attempted to end it all.

Obviously, I didn’t succeed. In the hospital, I soldiered through the physical misery of a collapsed lung. Then I wrestled with the shame and guilt of killing someone that I had loved, emotions that were all the more amplified when I was forced to relive the trauma in court. I’d be lying if I told you that I hadn’t contemplated every means of suicide.

I believe that I Iived through that awful and tragic experience to be held accountable, not only by the victim’s family but, less sympathetically, to the mirror. The pressures of life, which in that moment felt unbearable, proved bearable.

In my role as a journalist, I found purpose and draw from that dark place when reporting stories about characters who have their own dark encounters. I think it has enabled me to develop as a writer who draws out the humanity of prisoners that the tabloids leave behind. In interviewing the subjects of my stories, I always find myself threading our shared experiences into narratives pegged to universal themes like parenting, drug use, and—for obvious reasons a reoccurring motif—the feeling of the walls closing in. But the experience of isolation in prison is not monolithic.

Like most of the prisons I’ve had the displeasure of living in, Eastern NY Correctional Facility during the “happiest time of the year” offers no gifts under a Christmas tree. No “Happy Holidays” decorations. Just yellowed suicide-prevention memorandums posted on the bulletin board. Guys live here under the weight of life sentences and have been away from their families and loved ones for decades. Other guys haven’t gotten visits in years but still find reasons to wake up, to put both feet on the ground, and, oddly enough, even to smile.

I can’t help but admire the resiliency of old-timers, some of whom have lost every family member, who have more time in prison than I have on this earth. They keep it simple, play Scrabble or spades and talk shit. Once able-bodied men, they walk with canes, one step at a time.

It is the coping mechanisms of the prisoner, our survival under this added layer of extreme inhumanity, that may make us the most apt case studies for suicide prevention.

One day this season, I overheard some of the GED students inside our school building tell the prison’s acting educational supervisor, Nicole Cooke, that they didn’t have anything to be grateful for during the holidays.

“I didn’t like that,” she told me from behind a large wooden desk. This gave her an idea.

She had a tree painted on the wall, leaving the branches bare. Photocopied drawings of jars containing the words I’m thankful for were distributed to everyone who wanted to decorate the tree. She told guys to write what they were grateful for inside the paper jars, which stood in for the tree’s leaves.

Although the gratitude tree remained on the wall for about a month, as I attended my classes I walked right past it without reading a single jar.

The same day that I went inside the school building to finally put my own note on the gratitude tree, the jars had been taken down. I spoke with Cooke, and she removed them from her drawer and handed me the stack of paper jars. I sat down alone in the academic library and counted 82 altogether. I plucked through them one by one, reading their contents. Forty-six of them contained the word family or mi familia. Some included only a word or two, like mom or even Ms. Cooke. Suddenly, I realized that in my hands these small pieces of paper weighing next to nothing contained something so heavy and intimate—people and things that gave my community a sense of hope and purpose, reasons for living. I felt a little wrong riffling through them, but I was inspired to witness a collective will to live. As Albert Camus said, “Rarely is suicide committed through reflection.”

That’s when I noticed that a handful of these jars had been filled out by staff, people who, like Hadian, the imam, get to go home every day. Their end-of-year reflections had been displayed side by side with the prisoners’ jars on the tree: a shared message of thankfulness and hope displayed for everyone who took part or who bothered to look.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus is another entry in our occasional “Dear (Juris)Prudence” series, in which we invite listeners to ask their burning questions about the law and answer them as best we can. Write to amicus@slate.com to pose a question to Dahlia and Mark. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dear (Juris)Prudence,What does recovery look like for us as a nation? Even if we elect a Democratic president, House, and Senate in 2028, how can we legislate or otherwise repair the damage to the law, norms, precedent, etc., when we still have a Supreme Court that ignores law, norms, precedent, and maybe even the 14th Amendment?

Dahlia Lithwick: This is really an existential question as much as a legal one, but I know you’ve given it some thought.

Mark Joseph Stern: I think anyone who cares about salvaging American democracy needs to be asking those exact questions. And it’s pretty clear to me that the very first item on the agenda needs to be envisioning what the next Democratic president—let’s say, President AOC—should do in the first 24 hours of their time in office. That means embracing the maximalist vision of executive power that Trump has established to undo the damage that he is currently inflicting. Trump has amassed vast new powers for the president, and the next Democrat in the White House simply cannot surrender them. That would be unilateral disarmament, and a disservice to the country. What he or she needs to do instead is wield those powers aggressively for good, repair everything that’s broken, help the people Trump has hurt, and push forward with their own goals.

How does that cash out? First, let’s remember that the Supreme Court has now effectively granted the president authority to impound federal funds duly appropriated by Congress and to abolish federal agencies established and funded by Congress. I think that is terrible and anti-constitutional. But thanks to the Supreme Court, that is now the law. So let’s talk about what President AOC can do with those powers in 2029. On Day 1, she needs to impound ICE’s budget. She needs to refuse to spend the billions of dollars that Congress has appropriated to the agency and fire tens of thousands of immigration agents immediately, starting with those who committed acts of violence and discrimination—which, by that point, may be almost all of them. Close as many immigrant detention facilities as possible and free the detainees.

Then turn to Customs and Border Protection. Fire CBP chief Greg Bovino. Fire every single agent who participated in the horrific operations in Chicago, D.C., and L.A. Refuse to pay out a penny in benefits to any agent who broke the law. Release all the information about ICE and CBP’s immigration sweeps, including the names of every agent who participated. Start investigations and prosecutions of any law-breaking agent whom Trump doesn’t pardon. Repurpose the billions of dollars in savings as a reparations fund for every victim. Run the reparations program through a new agency established by executive order. Pay to return noncitizens who were wrongly deported back to the country. Transform ICE and CBP’s headquarters into the nerve center of a new Truth and Reconciliation Agency, and use this extra money to pay out damages to the victims of the mass deportation campaign. This would be 100 percent legal under the precedent established by Trump and the Supreme Court.

Remember: Trump has illegally fired tens of thousands of civil servants, closed agencies like USAID unilaterally, refused to pay out billions of dollars appropriated by Congress, halted our refugee program, shuttered the Education Department, paid reparations to Jan. 6 defendants and quite possibly himself. I think all of that should be illegal, but the Supreme Court has said that it is not. And you just cannot fight fire with a dripping faucet. So I say: Take these powers and use them to undo Trump’s legacy and really flood the zone. Blitz the country with these executive orders on Day 1 and dare anybody to stop you.

At the same time, the next Democratic president is going to be a “unitary executive” thanks to the Supreme Court. So purge every federal agency of Trump holdovers. Start with the Federal Trade Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, every other formerly independent agency. Oust every single Trump appointee at any agency in the executive branch. The Supreme Court is about to let the president do that, and it needs to see the consequences of its actions when the president isn’t named Donald Trump. Take his name off the Kennedy Center, the Institute of Peace, and every other institution that he has illegally branded. This needs to be a top-to-bottom reconstruction of the executive branch using the precedents that Trump himself established. That is the only way a true recovery can begin, and that is what needs to happen within 24 hours of the next Democrat reentering the White House.

I want to hurl myself in front of one objection you’re going to get, which is: But then the Supreme Court’s going to say all of that is illegal! My response is: Good, that’ll take three years to litigate. Run out the clock in the million ways that we have learned that the clock can be run out. And if everything is enjoined on Day 1 by every single Trump judge and then the Supreme Court, then we have another conversation. But I absolutely agree: Democrats should not petition, hands outstretched to the Supreme Court, for the maximalist version of presidential power when it’s not Donald Trump in office. They need to say: Cool, this is what the rule is now. Let’s go.

The other thing I want to say is that baked into Jacob’s question is this issue of: How do we reinstate norms? How do we get the other side to abide by the entire complicated web of unenforceable feelings about, say, a separation between the Justice Department and the White House? And how prosecutors conduct themselves in court? And on and on? If we can learn any lesson from President Joseph Biden’s regime, it’s that you cannot simply adhere to norms and hope the other side will look around and say: Hey, I forgot—norms are awesome! That is not the way to go back to living under soft, unenforceable norms of democracy. You cannot bring a shrimp fork to a knife fight. We have to disabuse ourselves of that idea.

Because norms survive in a system like ours when both sides feel that they have something to gain from them and something to lose when they go away. And right now, under Trump, the Republican Party believes that it can only gain from shattering norms, because Democrats are too timid and afraid of their own shadow. And the only way to disabuse the GOP of that notion is to show them what happens to their side when the norms are gone. We cannot restore the norms magically by having one side abide by them. That would only make things worse by reiterating to the Republican Party that it might as well shatter any norms it wants because Democrats will just go back to abiding by them, even when they constrict the political fortunes and the power of Democratic lawmakers. It can’t work that way. It can only work if Democrats give Republicans a taste of their own medicine and remind them why the norms were there in the first place.

I often say that norms are not an end in themselves. Norms are a means to a larger end, which is a functioning democratic state. And the notion that we can rebuild a world of norms unilaterally is the enduring failure of the Biden administration.

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Today&#39;s Christmas bork comes from London&#39;s Victoria train station, just before the festive season got underway, and is an update to the old IT standby: &quot;It isn&#39;t DNS. It can&#39;t be DNS... It was SSL.&quot;

In this case, the victim is one of the digital advertising screens so beloved of public spaces these days. Rather than having a human paste up posters regularly, these things allow seamless content updates to delight passing travelers until, of course, the bork fairy pays a visit.

This example of the fairy&#39;s evil work can be found at one of the station&#39;s entrances and is both an example of an unhappy update and the infamous Progress Bar of Lies.

To our uneducated eye, the screen appears to be running a version of Android. The wheels have come off during an update, possibly due to an issue in an SSL library. The message also references BoringSSL, Google&#39;s fork of OpenSSL tweaked for the ad slinger&#39;s needs and &quot;not intended for general use.&quot;

A hopeful progress bar is visible, but all is not well within the signage. It&#39;s probably not a touchscreen, so prodding the &quot;Update Immediately&quot; and &quot;Browse Update File&quot; buttons is unlikely to help.

With luck, a tired administrator will be notified that passengers are not being shown ads and will resolve the problem remotely. Or at least rotate the screen so that tired, emotional customers do not inadvertently topple over while trying to read the text.

Still, while a Progress Bar of Lies might be on display here, it&#39;s a step up from what lies beyond, where Victoria train station has what can only be described as a Departure Board of Optimism. Here, SSL means something quite different – Signals, Staff shortages, and Leaves – in the canon of UK transportation bork. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most of today’s desktop web browsers come with a ton of built-in AI features, but the good news is that, in most cases, no one is forcing you to use them, and you can at least hide them from view. Removing the most egregious AI tools from Chrome is pretty simple, but it requires a few steps.

By default, a large Gemini button appears in the top-right area of the browser window, constantly trying to lure you into using Google’s chatbot. To hide it, right click on the button and select Unpin. Unfortunately, this doesn’t kill the keyboard shortcut (Alt + G on some platforms), which invokes Gemini, but there’s another way to make that happen.

If you want to do more than just hide Gemini, navigate to chrome://settings/ai/gemini. If you unpinned Gemini, you’ll see that “Show Gemini at the top of the browser” has been set to off. If not, toggle it off. Now, turn all the other switches off, including “Show Gemini in system tray and turn on keyboard shortcut” and “Page content sharing,” which sends content from your tabs to Gemini.

Google would really, really like you to use AI mode instead of its regular search. This type of search is a chatbot that returns direct answers instead of giving you a list of web resources. Perhaps it’s the future of all search, but if so, it’s a bleak future where publishers and content creators have their work hoovered up and plagiarized by a bot that may or may not give correct information and only occasionally cites sources.

To encourage you to use AI mode, Google has put an “AI mode” button on the right side of the Omnibox (what Chrome calls its address bar). So, when you enter a search query in the box, you can click this button to forgo regular search and send your question directly to AI mode. You can also use it by hitting Tab + Enter after entering your query.

It’s easy enough to just not click the AI Mode button, but perhaps for some folks, its very presence and the possibility of accidentally activating it is offensive. To disable the AI Mode button, first navigate to chrome://flags in your browser.

You should get at least three results. Most importantly, set “AI Mode Omnibox entrypoint” to &quot;Disabled&quot; so the button disappears. I also recommend enabling “AI Entrypoint Disabled on User Input” and disabling “Omnibox Allow AI Mode Matches” so you make sure the AI mode is hidden in other ways.

It’s not enough that Google Docs and Gmail both have built-in AI writing features. The Chocolate Factory also wants to help you write content that might go into text-based forms on the web. The Help me write feature activates when you right click on a text field and click “Help me write,” after which it pops up a menu to have you either start writing or make a request for it to compose a message for you.

However, sometimes I have also had the browser pop up a message trying to encourage me to use “Help me write” while I was typing into a text field, though I have not seen that behavior recently. You can make sure that it does not nag you to use “Help me write” by navigating to chrome://settings/ai/helpMeWrite and toggling “Offer writing help” to off.

On my browser, it was disabled by default, but Google also offers “History search, powered by AI,” which allows you to search your browser history, not just by the names of the pages you visited but also by their content. When this feature is enabled, it sends information about your browsing habits and the pages you query to Google.

To make sure that History Search is disabled, navigate to chrome://settings/ai/historySearch and toggle the single option to off.

By default, the Chrome Omnibox searches Google and returns results from its main search tab (aka the “All” tab). The main search tab on Google gives you web results as you would expect, but on many queries, an AI Overview appears on top of the page, forcing you to scroll down just to see actual listings from the Internet.

To purge AI Overviews from your Google search, you have a couple of options. First, you can install an extension called Bye Bye, Google AI, which I have personally written and can vouch for. It uses CSS to hide AI Overviews and, if you choose, can also hide Google-sponsored links, images, videos, and “people also ask” boxes.

If you don’t want to install an extension, you can configure your Chrome browser to search Google’s “Web” tab, which only shows results from the web, skipping AI Overviews as well as images, videos, and answer boxes. To set Chrome to search the web tab from the Omnibox, start by navigating to chrome://settings/searchEngines.

Click the Add button next to Site search.

A dialog box appears. Fill in the fields as follows and then click the Add button.

Add Google (Web Only) site search - Click to enlarge

Click the … menu next to Google (Web Only) and select Make default.

From now on, when you search from the Omnibox, Chrome will send your query straight to the Web tab on Google, ensuring that you only get web pages without an AI Overview on top of them. ®

            <h2>From AI to analog, cybersecurity tabletop exercises look a little different this year</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/26/end_of_year_tabletop_exercises/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s the most wonderful time of the year … for corporate security bosses to run tabletop exercises, simulating a hypothetical cyberattack or other emergency, running through incident processes, and practicing responses to ensure preparedness if when a digital disaster occurs.

&quot;We&#39;re ultimately testing how resilient is the organization,&quot; said Palo Alto Networks Chief Security Intelligence Officer Wendi Whitmore in an interview with The Register. &quot;It&#39;s not if we get attacked, it&#39;s: How quickly do we respond and contain these attacks.&quot;

And this year, organizations need to account for the speed of AI, both in terms of how attackers use these tools to find and exploit bugs, and how defenders can use AI in their response.

&quot;Threat actors are exploiting CVEs at an increased rate with AI,&quot; Google Cloud&#39;s Office of the CISO Public Sector Advisor Enrique Alvarez told The Register. &quot;Tabletop exercises should consider a scenario where a CVE is published affecting a software system in use by the company with an immediate exploit via a cyber adversary.&quot;

Whitmore said her threat analysts see a vulnerability released with exploits attempted within five minutes.

&quot;On the defender side, like our own SOC: We&#39;re looking at 90 billion attack events coming in per day, which we can synthesize down into 26,000 that are correlated, and then one per day that requires human manual intervention of tier-three analysts to dive in, and run additional queries and analysis,&quot; she added.

Indeed, if 2025 taught us anything, it&#39;s that criminals and state-backed threat actors are increasingly adding AI to their arsenals, while enterprises&#39; AI use vastly expands their attack surface.

From the attackers&#39; side, this means more targeted, convincing phishing emails, faster reconnaissance and scanning for vulnerabilities, and troves of sensitive data that can be quickly scanned and stolen. Meanwhile, defenders need to ensure their LLMs aren&#39;t leaky, and AI agents aren&#39;t accessing data that they shouldn&#39;t have access to.

The Reg asked several incident responders to weigh in on best practices for these year-end tabletop exercises as they face more AI generated or assisted attacks, and take measures to secure their internal AI systems and models.

Tabletop exercises now need to reflect two realities: attackers using AI to move faster, quieter, and at massive scale, and attackers targeting the AI systems we deploy

&quot;Tabletop exercises now need to reflect two realities: attackers using AI to move faster, quieter, and at massive scale, and attackers targeting the AI systems we deploy,&quot; Tanmay Ganacharya, VP of Microsoft threat protection research, told The Register.

&quot;The best exercises simulate adaptive, AI-powered phishing and rapid moving attack chains, while also preparing teams for scenarios targeting AI systems like prompt injection, misconfiguration, and AI-driven data exfiltration,&quot; Ganacharya said. &quot;The goal is to rehearse faster decisions, verify information in low trust environments, and ensure teams understand how AI changes every stage of the kill chain.&quot;

Ultimately, the goal of these exercises is to educate both the C-suite and technical responders about what can happen, and for them to practice their responses to various security scenarios while identifying areas for improvement.

&quot;As much as it is about establishing muscle memory and ensuring that you have a good process and can execute against that process, it&#39;s also just as much about education,&quot; Mark Lance, GuidePoint security VP of digital forensics and incident response and threat intel, told The Register. &quot;So for instance, a senior leadership team learning about ransomware typically walks away from it saying, &#39;I know more about this and the potential risks and threats associated with it.&#39;&quot;

One way organizations can account for the influx of AI-related threats is to use AI to develop scenarios, said Bill Reid, a security advisor to healthcare and life sciences organizations in Google Cloud&#39;s Office of the CISO. &quot;Want to test AI fakes? Make one and use it in the tabletop exercise,&quot; he told The Register.

In addition to using AI to develop the exercises, companies should also use it to &quot;measure and facilitate exercises and outcomes,&quot; said Taylor Lehman, director of Google Cloud Office of the CISO&#39;s healthcare and life sciences division.

&quot;Expose information about your environment - like threats, controls, vulnerabilities, assets of all types, key risks, stakeholders, customer personas, etc. - to AI systems who can then help craft very meaningful and very specific, realistic scenarios that will help you hone the scenario and deliver specific types of outcomes you want as part of an exercise,&quot; Lehman told The Register.

Other new-ish AI threats include deepfakes, and this especially affects Google Cloud&#39;s financial services clients, Alvarez said. Because of this, many organizations in the financial sector have - or should - add deepfakes, both audio and video, to their scenarios.

&quot;However, the use of AI-generated attacks is not only deepfakes,&quot; Mandiant Consulting director David Wong said. &quot;AI is also used in each stage of the attack lifecycle and increases the volume and speed of the attacks. Designers of tabletop exercises must adapt to the speed and volume in their scenarios.&quot;

When a deepfake CEO demands a money transfer, the drill shouldn&#39;t be about detection software, but strictly testing a mandatory out-of-band verification via a standard phone call

Alvarez also suggests reaching out to a local FBI Field Office and asking the Cyber Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAC) if they can provide an agent to participate. &quot;This is a good way to establish a point-of-contact at the field office for future reference and communication,&quot; he said, adding that for full-scale exercises including C-suite, board members, and other internal stakeholders, consider reaching out to CISA to participate, too.

CISA, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, also provides several free resources designed to help companies conduct their own exercises covering a range of threat scenarios.

One Google Cloud Office of the CISO senior consultant, Anton Chuvakin, advocated for analog - and caution - when it comes to &quot;fighting AI with more AI. Instead, focus your tabletop exercises on introducing analog friction to break the adversary&#39;s speed,&quot; he told The Register. &quot;When a deepfake CEO demands a money transfer, the drill shouldn&#39;t be about detection software, but strictly testing a mandatory out-of-band verification via a standard phone call.&quot;

Plus, don&#39;t rely only on online files, he added. &quot;Exercises must practice reverting to minimum viable business operations, utilizing offline golden copies of data and robust approval processes that an algorithm cannot spoof,&quot; Chuvakin said. &quot;If you can&#39;t trust what you see on the screen, your strongest defense is actually process, not technology.&quot;

All the experts The Reg talked with recommended at least one or two tabletops per year, and tailoring these exercises to specific audiences, separating C-suite leaders and technical responders, for example.

&quot;From my prior FBI experience, the vast majority of companies have never done a tabletop exercise,&quot; Alvarez said. &quot;A good starting point or goal should be at least twice a year with the second tabletop exercise incorporating the lessons learned from the first.&quot;

Participation should vary based on the scenario, according to Ganacharya, with the C-suite participating &quot;at least semiannually because AI-powered attacks demand executive level decisions.&quot;

Technical drills, such as trialing new ransomware procedures, may only require the Security Operations Center (SOC) and incident response teams, while high-impact scenarios like insider leaks and reputational risk should also include legal, PR, HR and senior leadership.

Other operational leaders may require more frequent exercises with targeted scenarios, Ganacharya said. This includes deputies, directors, and SOC leaders - the people that executives rely on to carry out day-to-day operations.

And, as always, remember Murphy&#39;s Law. As Ganacharya put it: &quot;Every exercise should include alternates, because real incidents rarely happen when your first choice responder is available.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">interview According to Remedio CEO Tal Kollender, the only way to beat the bad guys hacking into corporate networks is to &quot;think like a hacker,&quot; and because not everyone is a teenage hacker turned cybersecurity startup chief executive, she built an AI to do this.

&quot;My thought was: if I have a hacker mindset, why not adapt it into defense,&quot; Kollender told The Register. &quot;Because if you don&#39;t think like a hacker, you won&#39;t be able to beat them, right?&quot;

We sat down (virtually) with Kollender to discuss her former life hacking video games and how that led her to start Remedio (formerly Gytpol). The startup recently raised $65 million in its first-ever funding round on a $300 million valuation, and its clients include household names Colgate-Palmolive and Kraft Heinz.

&quot;Curiosity is the name of the game,&quot; she said. &quot;I was always curious. What brought me to what I do now is solving some problems from a different angle.&quot;

For example: one plus one equals two. &quot;But in order to get to two, you don&#39;t really need one plus one,&quot; Kollender said. &quot;There are other ways - two plus zero minus two plus four. There are various options to get to the results.&quot;

Her first lesson in this came from an Israeli online game that Kollender describes as a cross between Tetris and Icy Tower. She had been ranked No. 1, and then overnight, an unknown player beat her. &quot;I was pretty jealous and upset, and at the same time I said, &#39;there&#39;s no way someone can beat me because I&#39;m the best.&#39;&quot;

The other player&#39;s &quot;impossible&quot; score led her to figure out how to hack into the game&#39;s database and write her own impossible score, before moving on to hacking Sony PlayStation games, chat apps, and phones.

Later, while serving in the Israeli Air Force and training to become a fighter pilot, the Israel Defense Forces reassigned her to the IT Corp Cyber Security-Systems Division.

On the defender side and in the private sector, Kollender previously worked as a system security architect at Dell EMC before starting her own company with co-founders Gilad Raz and Yakov Kogan in 2019.

&quot;We wanted to change the way companies fix things, without any business disruption,&quot; she said. To this end, Remedio uses AI to find and auto-remediate vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, weak controls, compliance gaps, and other security threats across corporate devices.

As criminals increasingly use AI to do these same things - scan for vulnerabilities, missing patches, and misconfigurations - it becomes a battle of AI versus AI, and a race between defenders and attackers.

Digital intruders used to break into networks and spend months snooping around, searching for credentials to allow lateral movement and steal valuable data. &quot;Now, they do it in weeks or days. That&#39;s how fast AI has made things,&quot; Kollender said. &quot;And if defenders don&#39;t keep up the pace and grow&quot; their own usage of the technology, &quot;then the attackers might beat us.&quot;

As several former teenage hackers found out in their formative years, Kollender refuses to get beat at her own game, whether that&#39;s a video game or cyber defense. ®

            <h2>Coming Wi-Fi 8 will bring reliability rather than greater speed</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-26</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/26/coming_wifi_8_reliability/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Wi-Fi 8 will be a step change in connectivity, if Intel can be believed, and will be able to adapt intelligently to local conditions to deliver a reliable service without the slowdowns users often experience when the network is congested.

The next-gen release of Wi-Fi is not expected to be available in devices for a couple of years, but the industry seems determined that it will fix the issues that meant previous releases did not always live up to user expectations.

&quot;The focus of Wi-Fi has always been on: how can we make it faster? You&#39;ll see that with Wi-Fi 8, that&#39;s going to change a little bit,&quot; said Intel Fellow and wireless chief technology officer Carlos Cordeiro.

This means that the upcoming standard will not increase the peak theoretical data rate and will not introduce wider channels, or higher order modulations compared with Wi-Fi 7. Instead, the new capabilities will be subtler.

&quot;What you&#39;re going to see is that we can get better rate at a given range. What I mean by that is, if you take an access point (AP) and a Wi-Fi 7 device, and you get a given data rate, then you replace that with a Wi-Fi 8 device, you&#39;ll be able to get a higher data rate at that same location, at that same range.&quot;

Cordeiro says that Intel sees Wi-Fi 8 as the &quot;connective technology for the AI era,&quot; one where in the not-too-distant future, everyone will have massive amounts of compute and storage available to them over the network, and this means that you can&#39;t allow the wireless connection to become the bottleneck to accessing all those resources.

&quot;So you really need high performance, which you know, Wi-Fi largely already is. But we need to make it more reliable. We need to make it more low latency. We need to make it, you know, more intelligent,&quot; he explained.

This means making devices and the network kit more context-aware, able to predict user needs, and adapt to them.

Cordeiro highlighted use cases that illustrate the challenges Wi-Fi 8 is aiming to address for users.

The first one is operating on a campus network, such as a university or corporate office site. Here, roaming and co-existence are key capabilities, but it currently can take tens of milliseconds for roaming from one AP to another to happen.

&quot;So we took a very conscious effort in Wi-Fi 8 to define something we call seamless roaming, where we&#39;re going to push down to the Wi-Fi technology a lot of the key negotiations and preparation for roaming, so that we can get it into single-digit low milliseconds, and do that with zero packet loss, right? So that if you&#39;re doing Wi-Fi calling, you can move from one AP to the other, and you won&#39;t notice the switch.&quot;

In a home environment, you might have someone on a conference call, someone else playing a game and another person watching a Netflix video. In situations like this, where there is a mix of traffic, you have to be able to prioritize, Cordeiro says, and so Wi-Fi 8 will have much better capabilities around quality of service, to be able to indicate low latency traffic and allow the network to prioritize it.

&quot;How can we deal with the fact that some devices are very high-end, some devices are very low-end, but they are in the same network, and you want to make sure that those low-end devices don&#39;t clog the channel, that everybody can get access and make better use of the spectrum,&quot; he explained.

This is also an area of focus in crowded office environments, where interference management and longer device battery life are desirable.

Another technology being developed with Wi-Fi 8 is the ability to sense the environment using the radio waves emitted by the devices.

&quot;We expect to see Wi-Fi devices able to detect the distance to other devices that are nearby, not only the distance, but what is the direction to those devices, with the ability to become a sensor to detect distance, to detect the presence of people, to detect gestures,&quot; Cordeiro claimed.

&quot;Essentially what we are doing is that we&#39;re going to be able to make devices be context aware, aware of their surroundings, and that&#39;s going to enable and open up the ability for new applications to be developed,&quot; he added.

One such scenario Cordeiro suggests is one where a user is in an online meeting on their laptop, and gets up and walks away holding their phone.

&quot;Automatically, the laptop and the phone will realize that they are moving away from each other, and this Teams session could transfer to my phone. I don&#39;t have to do anything automatically. I move away, the Teams session goes to my phone, and then when I come back to my PC, the Teams session automatically transfers back to the PC,&quot; he explained.

Others include waking up your PC when you approach it, or having it automatically lock itself if you walk away, or even detecting and acting on gestures, such as swiping to move to the next slide in a presentation.

In an Intel White Paper on Wi-Fi 8, the company lists some of the enhancements that aim to deliver these capabilities. Link reliability and performance will be improved through smarter use of modulation and coding schemes (MCS), for example.

Currently, if a device supports multiple spatial streams (MIMO), all streams use the same coding scheme. Wi-Fi 8 changes this so each stream can use the best possible encoding for its conditions, meaning that if one stream has a weaker signal, it can send data in a more robust way while other streams use an MCS optimized for speed.

Wi-Fi 8 adds more intermediate modulation steps, which means that medium signal strength users should see a better data rate than with Wi-Fi 7, who may have to choose a less optimal modulation.

It also promises better error correction via low-density parity check (LDPC) codewords that are double the length of those in Wi-Fi 7, meaning fewer retransmissions and a connection that can extend further.

Multiple access points will also be able to work together to optimize transmissions, making sure they do not transmit at the same time on the same channel, for example. With an enterprise network, two APs might take turns millisecond by millisecond, which avoids collisions, and devices therefore waste less time waiting and retrying.

Giving better access for critical applications will come via an enhanced version of EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access) called Prioritized EDCA. Under this, if a device marks traffic as high priority (like video), the network will let those packets through first even in crowded conditions, Intel says.

Security is also being stepped up in Wi-Fi 8 with encryption for control frames, which prevents spoofing attacks such as fake disconnect messages. Support for IEEE P802.11bi will extend protection to the association process and other management frames that were previously exposed, providing stronger encryption for Wi-Fi handshakes and improving privacy.

As previously noted, Wi-Fi 8 will build on the basic specifications of Wi-Fi 7, which is still being gradually adopted in new devices and access points / wireless routers. This means that it will be capable of operating in the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands of the wireless spectrum, and uses 320 MHz channel bandwidth, double that of previous releases.

According to Intel, it will be backwards compatible, in the sense that Wi-Fi 5/6/7 devices will work with Wi-Fi 8 APs (and vice versa), just without the benefits of the new capabilities.

Chipmaker Broadcom recently announced a portfolio of Wi-Fi 8 silicon, but Cordeiro said Intel was holding off until the availability of certification, because certification guarantees a minimal level of interoperability.

&quot;We want to avoid any problems in the market. We want to make sure that clients and access points from various vendors work seamlessly, and so in our case, we do expect to have solutions once certifications are in place,&quot; he said.

Intel&#39;s pitch for Wi-Fi 8 is that it will &quot;just feel better,&quot; taking the raw speed of Wi-Fi 7 and adding intelligence to deliver that speed consistently, keeping latency-sensitive apps running without hiccups. The proof of the pudding, of course, will be in the eating. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion When Microsoft recently decided to open source the seminal text adventure game Zork, I contemplated revisiting it during the festive season... until I realized I&#39;ve spent much of 2025 experiencing the worst of such games when using AI chatbots.

Adventure games like Zork and its many imitators invited players to explore a virtual world, often a Tolkien-esque cave, that existed only as words.

&quot;You enter a dark room. A Goblin pulls a rusty knife from its belt and prepares to attack!&quot; was a typical moment in such games. Players, usually armed with imagined medieval weapons, might respond &quot;Hit Goblin&quot; in the expectation that phrase would see them draw a sword to smite the monster.

But the game might respond to &quot;Hit Goblin&quot; by informing players &quot;You punch the Goblin.&quot;

The Goblin would dodge the punch and stab the player with the rusty knife.

Game over... until the player tried &quot;Hit Goblin with sword&quot; or &quot;Stab Goblin&quot; or whatever other syntax the game required, assuming they didn&#39;t just give up out of frustration at having to guess the correct verb/noun combination.

Adventure games were big in the 1980s, a time when computers were flaky and unpredictable, and AI was an imagined technology. Games that required obscure syntax were mostly tolerable and generally excused.

I&#39;m less tolerant of AI making me learn its language.

For example, I recently prompted Microsoft&#39;s Copilot chatbot to scour data available online and convert some elements of it into a downloadable spreadsheet. The bot accepted that request and produced a Python script that it claimed will write a spreadsheet.

In other AI experiments, I have found that the same prompt produces different results on different days. One prompt I use to check I haven&#39;t left any terrible typos in stories produces responses in a different format every time I use it. Microsoft has also, in its wisdom, decided to offer different versions of Copilot in Office and in its desktop app. Each produces different results from the same prompt and the same source material.

Using AI has therefore become a non-stop experiment in &quot;Hit/Kill/Stab/Smite Goblin.&quot;

And when Copilot starts using a new model, which it does without any change to its UI, prompts that worked reliably in the past produce different results, meaning I need to relearn what works.

My point here is not that chatbots do dumb things and make mistakes. It&#39;s that working with this tech feels like groping through a cave in the dark – a horrible game I call &quot;PromptQuest&quot; – while being told this is improving my productivity.

After Copilot gave me a Python script instead of a spreadsheet, I played a long session of PromptQuest during which Microsoft&#39;s AI responded to many different prompts by repeatedly telling me it was ready to make a spreadsheet, would make it available to download, and had completed the job to my satisfaction.

It never delivered the spreadsheet, and my frustration grew to the point at which I instructed Copilot to produce a progress bar so I could see it work.

A progress bar produced by Microsoft Copilot

You can see the results above. Ironically, I think it looks a lot like the output of a text adventure game. ®

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

If you’re taking it easy during the slow, in-between week between Christmas and New Year’s, now’s a good time to catch up on deals you might’ve missed. Many of our favorite discounts from the past week are still hanging around, making this an especially convenient moment to shop. Whether you’re eyeing a new phone, gearing up for travel, or just looking to treat yourself before the year wraps up, we’re seeing notable price drops on Google’s Pixel 10 lineup, AirTags, and a wide selection of Nintendo Switch games, along with a handful of other Verge-approved picks worth grabbing now. Here are the best deals worth checking out before the year comes to a close.

This model touts a 6.3-inch 1080p OLED that supports up to a 120Hz refresh rate. It has the same Tensor G5 processor found in all Pixel 10-series phones, but with a slightly lower 12GB RAM count compared to 16GB on the Pro. Verge reviewer Allison Johnson notes in her review that those who want to take great — not just good — photos should get the 10 Pro instead.

In addition to have extra memory for handling tasks more swiftly than the Pixel 10, its cameras pack improvements, both in terms of hardware and AI-enhanced software, like the sometimes great, sometimes terrible Pro Res Zoom mode that’s powered by generative AI. Its portrait mode is improved, according to our review.

The Pixel 10 Pro XL is the larger version of Google’s flagship, with a 6.8-inch OLED screen, Google’s Tensor G5 chip, and support for Pixelsnap wireless charging at up to 25W.

Google’s Pixel 10 phones are among the best Android phones you can buy, and this week they’ve dropped to some of their lowest prices yet. Amazon is selling the Pixel 10 for $499 ($300 off) with promo code PIXEL10, marking its second-best price to date. If you want better cameras, Amazon is also offering record-low prices on the Pixel 10 Pro and 6.8-inch Pixel 10 Pro XL, down to $649 ($350 off) and $799 ($400 off), respectively, with the same code.

All three phones support Qi2 wireless charging with built-in magnets and run on Google’s snappy Tensor G5 chip. In her review, The Verge’s Allison Johnson called the Pixel 10 a great, basic Android phone with meaningful upgrades, including a bright 6.3-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness. It also adds a dedicated telephoto lens — a first for a non-Pro Pixel — which makes a noticeable difference for portraits.

If you’re aiming for great (not just good) photos, though, the 6.3-inch Pixel 10 Pro or 6.8-inch Pro XL are better picks. Both offer improved main and 48-megapixel ultrawide cameras, and additional AI-powered features like Pro Res Zoom and an upgraded portrait mode. They also come with extra memory for smoother multitasking along with sharper displays.

Anker’s 25,000mAh power bank sports two built-in USB-C cables (one of which is retractable), plus one USB-C and USB-A port. It tops out at 165W when charging two devices simultaneously, or 130W when charging three or four.

Anker’s Laptop Power Bank is once again on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $87.99 ($47 off), which matches the record-low price we last saw a month ago. A favorite among Verge staffers, the 25,000mAh / 90Wh power bank features a retractable USB-C cable along with a second built-in USB-C cable that doubles as a handle for easier portability. You also get a handy LCD screen that shows remaining battery life, total power output, and temperature at a glance. It includes a USB-A port and an extra USB-C port as well, letting you charge a MacBook Pro and up to three other devices at the same time. Power output tops out at 165W when charging two devices, or up to 130W with more plugged in — and since it’s carry-on compliant, you can bring the power bank along on flights.

CD Projekt Red has delivered on an incredibly ambitious vision: a vast virtual city with a complex narrative and roleplaying system. Read our review.

The first mainline Mario title for the Nintendo Switch, Super Mario Odyssey, doesn’t disappoint. The game brings plenty of fun, new mechanics, and ample charm. Read our review.

Echoes of Wisdom finally lets you play as Nintendo’s titular heroine. The game mixes the top-down perspective of 2D Zelda games with gameplay from the series’ newer, open-world 3D entries. Read our review.

If you’re looking to stock up on Nintendo Switch games, now’s a great time to do it. Nintendo is currently taking up to 50 percent off some of its best-known titles. That includes a number of first-party Nintendo games like Super Mario Odyssey ($39.99 down from $59.99), along with Princess Peach: Showtime ($41.99 down from $59.99) and The Legend of Zelda, Echoes of Wisdom (also $41.99 down from $59.99).

The deals aren’t limited to Nintendo’s own catalog, either. A number of well-known third-party games are included as well, from popular releases like Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition ($39.99 down from $69.99) to game of the year contenders such as Hades 2 ($22.49, down from $29.99) and Hollow Knight: Silksong ($15.99, down from $19.99). Just mark your calendar — most of these deals run through January 4th.

            <div id="article-text">Hades II, Silksong, and a whole lot more.

Hades II, Silksong, and a whole lot more.

I played a lot of games on my Steam Deck this year. It seemed like there was a never-ending list of incredible indie games to try — The Verge wrote about a lot of them! — and many worked brilliantly on Valve’s handheld gaming PC. Some bigger games made a splash on Steam Deck, too, and while they may not look as good as on a beefy PC, I’m usually happy to deal with that simply because I can play them on the couch or out of the house.

If you’re unwrapping a Steam Deck for the holidays this year, or have some Steam gift cards burning a hole in your pocket, here are some of my recommendations of games released in 2025 that you might want to check out. (And if you want more ideas, check out my favorites from 2024.)

Ball x Pit blends elements from games like Breakout, Vampire Survivors, and city builders into a delightful, genre-blending roguelike. In the main part of the game, you shoot balls toward an ever-advancing group of enemies, and after picking up a bunch of gems and upgrades, you’ll eventually turn into a force of nature with balls flying all over the screen. After a run, you can build up a base to improve your stats and unlock characters — some of which are quite clever, like one that turns Ball x Pit into a turn-based game. And with runs usually taking less than 15 minutes or so, it’s a great game to pick up and play on your Steam Deck.

Sandfall Interactive’s debut RPG floored me earlier this year; it’s an outstanding package with exhilarating turn-based battles, a great parrying system, memorable characters, a gripping story, and music that I still come back to even though I finished the game months ago. On Steam Deck, the game doesn’t look quite as good as it does on my PS5, but it’s still playable and was recently verified for Valve’s handheld PC. Folks on ProtonDB also have some suggestions to tweak settings to make the visuals better. If Steam Deck is your only platform that can play the game, it’s still a decent place to experience The Game Awards’ Game of the Year.

I know I put Hades II on my version of this list last year, but the roguelike got its big 1.0 update in September, and it’s damn good. Supergiant Games builds on the first Hades with a new protagonist, new boons to bring to battle, a bunch of new characters to give ambrosia to, two new routes to explore, and another banger-filled soundtrack. Supergiant even tweaked the ending to make it better. Hades II is Supergiant at the top of its game, and just like my colleague Ash Parrish said in 2024, it’s the perfect Steam Deck game.

After years of waiting and lots of clown makeup, Hollow Knight’s sequel finally launched in September, and thankfully, it was actually worth the wait. Silksong doesn’t reinvent the wheel; it’s still an atmospheric Metroidvania with adorable bug creatures, tough-as-nails bosses, and some bullshit. But I loved that formula in the original Hollow Knight, and it’s still excellent in Silksong.

If you’re looking for some relaxing puzzles, pull up a chair with Is This Seat Taken?. In the game, you’re responsible for finding seats for a bunch of adorable geometric shapes who have different needs. Some might want to sit next to a window, or maybe just not next to someone who smells. But if you can’t find a seating arrangement that works for everyone, you can just move on to the next puzzle without any big penalty; it keeps the stakes low, and sometimes, some low-stakes puzzling is what fits the bill.

I have very fond memories of playing the original Lumines: Puzzle Fusion on a PlayStation Portable, and more than 20 years after the release of that game, the Tetris Effect-like Lumines Arise captures that same magic. The trance-y visuals, amazing music, and absorbing Lumines puzzling sucked me in and briefly let me forget about everything else in the world; like my colleague Andrew Webster, I found Arise to be an almost perfect zen puzzle game.

Earlier this year, I wrote that Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo would feel right at home on your Game Boy Advance — and that’s part of what makes it such a good fit for the Steam Deck. The game is a top-down adventure where you battle enemies and explore the game’s world with a magical yo-yo, and you’ll get cool yo-yo tricks like the ability to “walk the dog” to cross bodies of water. With excellent pixel art and music filled with blaring horns, it feels like a spiritual successor to the GBA games I loved growing up.

The Drifter is inspired by the old-school LucasArts point-and-click adventure game formula, but instead of telling a silly, Monkey Island-like story, it cleverly turns the format into a dark, gripping thriller. You can play with a mouse to point and click, of course, but if you want to use the Steam Deck’s controls or a gamepad, The Drifter also offers a really smart control scheme that uses both joysticks to let you walk around and see what you can interact with. The story is full of exciting, mind-bending twists. And if you’re anything like me, it will probably keep you up long after your bedtime.

            <h2>Trump’s war on offshore wind faces another lawsuit</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2025-12-26</strong></p>

            <div id="article-text">An offshore wind developer says the Trump administration is limiting future power supply as AI gobbles up more electricity.

An offshore wind developer says the Trump administration is limiting future power supply as AI gobbles up more electricity.

Dominion Energy, an offshore wind developer and utility serving Virginia’s “data center alley,” filed suit against the Trump administration this week over its decision to pause federal leases for large offshore wind projects. The move puts a sudden stop to five wind farms already under construction, including Dominion’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project.

The complaint Dominion filed Tuesday alleges that a stop work order that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued Monday is unlawful, “arbitrary and capricious,” and “infringes upon constitutional principles that limit actions by the Executive Branch.” Dominion wants a federal court to prevent BOEM from enforcing the stop work order.

“Virginia needs every electron we can get as our demand for electricity doubles.”

The suit also argues that the “sudden and baseless withdrawal of regulatory approvals by government officials” threatens the ability of developers to construct large-scale infrastructure projects needed to meet rising energy demand in the US.

“Virginia needs every electron we can get as our demand for electricity doubles. These electrons will power the data centers that will win the AI race,” Dominion said in a December 22 press release. Virginia is home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world, according to the company.

The rush to build out new data centers for AI — along with growing energy demand from manufacturing and the electrification of homes and vehicles — has put added pressure on already stressed power grids. Rising electricity costs have become a flashpoint in Virginia elections, and in communities near data center projects across the US, as a result. Delaying construction on the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind farm raises project costs that customers ultimately pay for, Dominion warns.

Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, who is named as one of the defendants in the suit, said that the 90-day pause on offshore wind leases would allow the agency to address national security risks, which were apparently recently identified in classified reports. The US Department of Interior also cited concerns about turbines creating radar interference.

“I want to know what’s changed?” national security expert and former Commander of the USS Cole Kirk Lippold told the Associated Press. “To my knowledge, nothing has changed in the threat environment that would drive us to stop any offshore wind programs.”

The Trump administration previously halted construction on the Revolution Wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Empire Wind project off the shore of New York before a federal judge and BOEM lifted stop work orders. Those projects have now been suspended again. President Donald Trump issued a presidential memorandum upon stepping into office in January withdrawing areas on the outer continental shelf from offshore wind leasing, which a federal judge struck down earlier this month for being “arbitrary and capricious.”

Dominion Energy says it had already obtained all the federal, state, and local approvals necessary for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind farm, which broke ground in 2024. The company has already spent $8.9 billion to date on the $11.2 billion project that was expected to start generating power next year. Fully up and running, the offshore wind farm is supposed to have the capacity to produce 9.5 million megawatt-hours per year of carbon pollution-free electricity, about as much as 660,000 homes might use in the US.

Because you can’t be trusted to remember which group chat someone dumped a happy hour invite in.

There are plenty of dating apps out there and apps that turn your chaos of work obligations into easily actionable lists. There is also a growing number of apps that help you make new friends. The pitch for Rodeo is a bit different in that it uses AI to help you schedule activities with your existing friends.

The company was started by a pair of former Hinge execs who felt it was more difficult than it should be to make plans with friends. Parenting, work, 37 different group chats — all of this can lead to things like maintaining your relationships falling by the wayside.

Rodeo can take social media posts for events or restaurants, or even just screenshots of group chats, and streamline the act of turning them into actual plans with friends. For instance, if you upload a screenshot of an Instagram ad for a movie, it will pull in theaters where it’s playing and showtimes and let you buy tickets. There is also a shortcut to send an invite to a friend you want to “wrangle” into your plans.

Activities can also be sorted into lists for things you might want to save for later, like good date night restaurants, or things to do with your old college buddies, like a local paintball spot. Those lists can be collaborative too, so you can invite all your former frat bros to a specific list to make suggestions.

Somewhat surprisingly, the founders Sam Levy and Tim MacGougan aren’t loudly advertising the AI component of their app. While LLMs and other AI-adjacent tech are all the rage in Silicon Valley, it seems these two got the memo that Americans want AI to stay out of their personal lives. However, it is the AI element that sets Rodeo apart. Sharing collaborative lists, bookmarking restaurants to go to, and sending calendar invites for events to friends is something anyone can do with just a Gmail account. Rodeo is saving you the hassle of manually pulling in all the details for events or venues and turning them into invites and actions.

The company isn’t completely avoiding buzzwords. According to Business Insider, Levy describes the app as “a ‘second brain’ for planning activities with friends and family.” So Rodeo is clearly hoping that the obsession with organization that has driven the success of tools like Notion, Obsidian, and My Mind will work for its fledgling social app.

Rodeo is available as an invite-only beta right now, but you can download the iOS app to get on the waiting list.

The modular PC company Framework is adjusting the price of its DDR5 RAM modules once again as the cost of memory continues to surge. In an update on Wednesday, Framework said it will charge $10 per GB for 8GB, 16GB, and 32GB, with “slightly higher” prices for the 48GB and up.

Framework first announced a price hike on memory earlier this month, citing “substantially higher costs” from suppliers and distributors. With this most recent increase in place, the 8GB variation jumped from $60 to $80, the 16GB option increased from $120 to $160, and the 32GB variation went from $240 to $320. Meanwhile, the price tag of the 48GB option more than doubled from $240 as of June 2025 to $620. The 64GB (2 x 32GB) and 96GB (2 x 48GB) modules are also more expensive, priced at $640 and $1,240, respectively.

The price increase affects the configurable memory options that come with Framework’s DIY Edition laptop, as the company is still not selling standalone DDR5 RAM modules to preserve its inventory. To avoid higher prices on its DIY Edition laptop, Framework notes users can order the device without memory, allowing them to reuse an existing module or find a cheaper option using the link to PCPartPicker that Framework now provides directly on its website.

This likely won’t be the end of price hikes for Framework, as suppliers indicate that “prices will continue to increase going into early 2026,” according to the post. “We have absorbed and continue to absorb some of the price increases to be able to offer this new pricing, but it is very likely we’ll need to adjust module prices again within the next month,” Framework says. “We’ll only increase prices to cover increases in costs, and we’ll bring prices back down as costs come down in the future.”

The International Data Corporation expects the global memory shortage to “persist well into 2027” as memory makers like Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix shift their resources toward the lucrative AI industry.

Unlike the day after Thanksgiving, when people are rushing online and to the stores to look for deals, the day after Christmas is usually a time to recover from the festivities and check your budget to see how much all that gifting has cost you. However, if you’re in a shopping mood, or if you suddenly realized you forgot somebody important, there are still some deals out there.

For example, Nintendo is offering a bunch of its best-known games at deals ranging from 25 to 50 percent off. These include Princess Peach: Showtime ($41.99 down from $59.99), The Legend of Zelda, Echoes of Wisdom (also $41.99 down from $59.99), Super Mario Odyssey ($39.99 down from $59.99), and a slew of others. Non-Nintendo Switch games, like Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition ($39.99 down from $69.99) for Switch 2, are available as well.

Princess Peach: Showtime! is the first Nintendo game to star the Mushroom Kingdom royal in nearly 20 years, and it’s a welcome return to form. Peach finds herself having to fight, puzzle, and platform her way through different sets in a community theater. Read our review.

Echoes of Wisdom finally lets you play as Nintendo’s titular heroine. The game mixes the top-down perspective of 2D Zelda games with gameplay from the series’ newer, open-world 3D entries. Read our review.

The first mainline Mario title for the Nintendo Switch, Super Mario Odyssey, doesn’t disappoint. The game brings plenty of fun, new mechanics, and ample charm. Read our review.

CD Projekt Red has delivered on an incredibly ambitious vision: a vast virtual city with a complex narrative and roleplaying system. Read our review.

So if you’ve received a new Switch 2 for the holidays — or you gifted yourself one — this is a great way to start assembling your game library for the new year.

Amazon is still offering major discounts on some of its smart speakers. For example, the Amazon Echo Spot, a nifty bedside smart speaker / clock, is on sale at Amazon for $44.99 down from $79.99, the lowest price it has sold for. If you want something with a screen, the Echo Show 5 is available at Amazon for $59.99, down from $89.99, and while it’s gone down as low as $39.99 in the past, this isn’t a bad price if you want one now. Read our reviews of the Echo Spot and the Echo Show 5.

Anker’s Prime Charger is a charging station that supports 250W output via four USB-C and two USB-A ports. It’s now at its lowest price of $99.99 (down from $169.99, a savings of $70) at Amazon and at Anker (using the code WS7DV2I5IMSW).

You can still get an Apple Airtag for $19 (down from $29) at Walmart — and after all, how can you have too many of these handy trackers (our choice as best tracker for iPhone users), especially if you’ve gotten any holiday gifts that you really don’t want to misplace? Read our original review.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It&#39;s been a busy and productive year here at MIT Technology Review. We published magazine issues on power, creativity, innovation, bodies, relationships, and security. We hosted 14 exclusive virtual conversations with our editors and outside experts in our subscriber-only series, Roundtables, and held two events on MIT’s campus. And we published hundreds of articles online, following new developments in computing, climate tech, robotics, and more.

As the year winds down, we wanted to give you a chance to revisit a bit of this work with us. Whether we were covering the red-hot rise of artificial intelligence or the future of biotech, these are some of the stories that resonated the most with our readers.

We did the math on AI’s energy footprint. Here’s the story you haven’t heard.

Understanding AI’s energy use was a huge global conversation in 2025 as hundreds of millions of people began using generative AI tools on a regular basis. Senior reporters James O’Donnell and Casey Crownhart dug into the numbers and published an unprecedented look at AI’s resource demand, down to the level of a single query, to help us know how much energy and water AI may require moving forward.

We’re learning more about what vitamin D does to our bodies

Vitamin D deficiency is widespread, particularly in the winter when there’s less sunlight to drive its production in our bodies. The “sunshine vitamin” is important for bone health, but as senior reporter Jessica Hamzelou reported, recent research is also uncovering surprising new insights into other ways it might influence our bodies, including our immune systems and heart health.

Senior editor Will Douglas Heaven’s expansive look at how to define AI was published in 2024, but it still managed to connect with many readers this year. He lays out why no one can agree on what AI is—and explains why that ambiguity matters, and how it can inform our own critical thinking about this technology.

Ethically sourced “spare” human bodies could revolutionize medicine

In this thought-provoking op-ed, a team of experts at Stanford University argue that creating living human bodies that can’t think, don’t have any awareness, and can’t feel pain could shake up medical research and drug development by providing essential biological materials for testing and transplantation. Recent advances in biotechnology now provide a potential pathway to such “bodyoids,” though plenty of technical challenges and ethical hurdles remain.

It’s surprisingly easy to stumble into a relationship with an AI chatbot

Chatbots were everywhere this year, and reporter Rhiannon Williams chronicled how quickly people can develop bonds with one. That’s all right for some people, she notes, but dangerous for others. Some folks even describe unintentionally forming romantic relationships with chatbots. This is a trend we’ll definitely be keeping an eye on in 2026.

The electric grid is bracing for disruption from more frequent storms and fires, as well as an uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. And in many ways, the publicly owned utility company Lincoln Electric in Nebraska is an ideal lens through which to examine this shift as it works through the challenges of delivering service that’s reliable, affordable, and sustainable.

Exclusive: A record-breaking baby has been born from an embryo that’s over 30 years old

This year saw the birth of the world’s “oldest baby”: Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived on July 26. The embryo he developed from was created in 1994 during the early days of IVF and had been frozen and sitting in storage ever since. The new baby’s parents were toddlers at the time, and the embryo was donated to them decades later via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

How these two brothers became go-to experts on America’s “mystery drone” invasion

Twin brothers John and Gerald Tedesco teamed up to investigate a concerning new threat—unidentified drones. In 2024 alone, some 350 drones entered airspace over a hundred different US military installations, and many cases went unsolved, according to a top military official. This story takes readers inside the equipment-filled RV the Tedescos created to study mysterious aerial phenomena, and how they made a name for themselves among government officials.

Our newsroom has published this annual look at advances that will matter in the long run for over 20 years. This year’s list featured generative AI search, cleaner jet fuel, long-acting HIV prevention meds, and other emerging technologies that our journalists think are worth watching. We’ll publish the 2026 edition of the list on January 12, so stay tuned. (In the meantime, here’s what didn’t make the cut.)

We asked Al Jean, the longest-serving showrunner, about all the conspiracy theories.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

It’s a popular example of the “Mandela effect,” or a collective false memory. And while some people may laugh and move on, others spend years searching for an explanation.

A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas—but they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s getting harder to beat the heat. During the summer of 2025, heat waves knocked out power grids in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. Global warming means more people need air-­conditioning, which requires more power and strains grids. But a millennia-old idea (plus 21st-century tech) might offer an answer: radiative cooling. Paints, coatings, and textiles can scatter sunlight and dissipate heat—no additional energy required.

“Radiative cooling is universal—it exists everywhere in our daily life,” says Qiaoqiang Gan, a professor of materials science and applied physics at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Pretty much any object will absorb heat from the sun during the day and radiate some of it back at night. It’s why cars parked outside overnight are often covered with condensation, Gan says—their metal roofs dissipate heat into the sky, cooling the surfaces below the ambient air temperature. That’s how you get dew.

Humans have harnessed this basic natural process for thousands of years. Desert peoples in Iran, North Africa, and India manufactured ice by leaving pools of water exposed to clear desert skies overnight, when radiative cooling happens naturally; other cultures constructed “cool roofs” capped with reflective materials that scattered sunlight and lowered interior temperatures. “People have taken advantage of this effect, either knowingly or unknowingly, for a very long time,” says Aaswath Raman, a materials scientist at UCLA and cofounder of the radiative­cooling startup SkyCool Systems.

Modern approaches, as demonstrated everywhere from California supermarket rooftops to Japan’s Expo 2025 pavilion, go even further. Normally, if the sun is up and pumping in heat, surfaces can’t get cooler than the ambient temperature. But back in 2014, Raman and his colleagues achieved radiative cooling in the daytime. They customized photonic films to absorb and then radiate heat at infrared wavelengths between eight and 13 micrometers—a range of electromagnetic wavelengths called an “atmospheric window,” because that radiation escapes to space rather than getting absorbed. Those films could dissipate heat even under full sun, cooling the inside of a building to 9 °F below ambient temperatures, with no AC or energy source required.

That was proof of concept; today, Raman says, the industry has mostly shifted away from advanced photonics that use the atmospheric-window effect to simpler sunlight-scattering materials. Ceramic cool roofs, nanostructure coatings, and reflective polymers all offer the possibility of diverting more sunlight across all wavelengths, and they’re more durable and scalable.

Now the race is on. Startups such as SkyCool, Planck Energies, Spacecool, and i2Cool are competing to commercially manufacture and sell coatings that reflect at least 94% of sunlight in most climates, and above 97% in humid tropical ones. Pilot projects have already provided significant cooling to residential buildings, reducing AC energy needs by 15% to 20% in some cases.

This idea could go way beyond reflective rooftops and roads. Researchers are developing reflective textiles that can be worn by people most at risk of heat exposure. “This is personal thermal management,” says Gan. “We can realize passive cooling in T-shirts, sportswear, and garments.”

Of course, these technologies and materials have limits. Like solar power grids, they’re vulnerable to weather. Clouds prevent reflected sunlight from bouncing into space. Dust and air pollution dim materials’ bright surfaces. Lots of coatings lose their reflectivity after a few years. And the cheapest and toughest materials used in radiative cooling tend to rely on Teflon and other fluoropolymers, “forever chemicals” that don’t biodegrade, posing an environmental risk. “They are the best class of products that tend to survive outdoors,” says Raman. “So for long-term scale-up, can you do it without materials like those fluoropolymers and still maintain the durability and hit this low cost point?”

As with any other solution to the problems of climate change, one size won’t fit all. “We cannot be overoptimistic and say that radiative cooling can address all our future needs,” Gan says. “We still need more efficient active air-conditioning.” A shiny roof isn’t a panacea, but it’s still pretty cool.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If the past 12 months have taught us anything, it’s that the AI hype train is showing no signs of slowing. It’s hard to believe that at the beginning of the year, DeepSeek had yet to turn the entire industry on its head, Meta was better known for trying (and failing) to make the metaverse cool than for its relentless quest to dominate superintelligence, and vibe coding wasn’t a thing.

If that’s left you feeling a little confused, fear not. As we near the end of 2025, our writers have taken a look back over the AI terms that dominated the year, for better or worse.

Make sure you take the time to brace yourself for what promises to be another bonkers year.

As long as people have been hyping AI, they have been coming up with names for a future, ultra-powerful form of the technology that could bring about utopian or dystopian consequences for humanity. “Superintelligence” is that latest hot term. Meta announced in July that it would form an AI team to pursue superintelligence, and it was reportedly offering nine-figure compensation packages to AI experts from the company’s competitors to join.

In December, Microsoft’s head of AI followed suit, saying the company would be spending big sums, perhaps hundreds of billions, on the pursuit of superintelligence. If you think superintelligence is as vaguely defined as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, you’d be right! While it’s conceivable that these sorts of technologies will be feasible in humanity’s long run, the question is really when, and whether today’s AI is good enough to be treated as a stepping stone toward something like superintelligence. Not that that will stop the hype kings. —James O’Donnell

Thirty years ago, Steve Jobs said everyone in America should learn how to program a computer. Today, people with zero knowledge of how to code can knock up an app, game, or website in no time at all thanks to vibe coding—a catch-all phrase coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy. To vibe-code, you simply prompt generative AI models’ coding assistants to create the digital object of your desire and accept pretty much everything they spit out. Will the result work? Possibly not. Will it be secure? Almost definitely not, but the technique’s biggest champions aren’t letting those minor details stand in their way. Also—it sounds fun! — Rhiannon Williams

One of the biggest AI stories over the past year has been how prolonged interactions with chatbots can cause vulnerable people to experience delusions and, in some extreme cases, can either cause or worsen psychosis. Although “chatbot psychosis” is not a recognized medical term, researchers are paying close attention to the growing anecdotal evidence from users who say it’s happened to them or someone they know. Sadly, the increasing number of lawsuits filed against AI companies by the families of people who died following their conversations with chatbots demonstrate the technology’s potentially deadly consequences. —Rhiannon Williams

Few things kept the AI hype train going this year more than so-called reasoning models, LLMs that can break down a problem into multiple steps and work through them one by one. OpenAI released its first reasoning models, o1 and o3, a year ago.

A month later, the Chinese firm DeepSeek took everyone by surprise with a very fast follow, putting out R1, the first open-source reasoning model. In no time, reasoning models became the industry standard: All major mass-market chatbots now come in flavors backed by this tech. Reasoning models have pushed the envelope of what LLMs can do, matching top human performances in prestigious math and coding competitions. On the flip side, all the buzz about LLMs that could “reason” reignited old debates about how smart LLMs really are and how they really work. Like “artificial intelligence” itself, “reasoning” is technical jargon dressed up with marketing sparkle. Choo choo! —Will Douglas Heaven

For all their uncanny facility with language, LLMs have very little common sense. Put simply, they don’t have any grounding in how the world works. Book learners in the most literal sense, LLMs can wax lyrical about everything under the sun and then fall flat with a howler about how many elephants you could fit into an Olympic swimming pool (exactly one, according to one of Google DeepMind’s LLMs).

World models—a broad church encompassing various technologies—aim to give AI some basic common sense about how stuff in the world actually fits together. In their most vivid form, world models like Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 and Marble, the much-anticipated new tech from Fei-Fei Li’s startup World Labs, can generate detailed and realistic virtual worlds for robots to train in and more. Yann LeCun, Meta’s former chief scientist, is also working on world models. He has been trying to give AI a sense of how the world works for years, by training models to predict what happens next in videos. This year he quit Meta to focus on this approach in a new start up called Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs. If all goes well, world models could be the next thing. —Will Douglas Heaven

Have you heard about all the people saying no thanks, we actually don’t want a giant data center plopped in our backyard? The data centers in question—which tech companies want to built everywhere, including space—are typically referred to as hyperscalers: massive buildings purpose-built for AI operations and used by the likes of OpenAI and Google to build bigger and more powerful AI models. Inside such buildings, the world’s best chips hum away training and fine-tuning models, and they’re built to be modular and grow according to needs.

It’s been a big year for hyperscalers. OpenAI announced, alongside President Donald Trump, its Stargate project, a $500 billion joint venture to pepper the country with the largest data centers ever. But it leaves almost everyone else asking: What exactly do we get out of it? Consumers worry the new data centers will raise their power bills. Such buildings generally struggle to run on renewable energy. And they don’t tend to create all that many jobs. But hey, maybe these massive, windowless buildings could at least give a moody, sci-fi vibe to your community. —James O’Donnell

The lofty promises of AI are levitating the economy. AI companies are raising eye-popping sums of money and watching their valuations soar into the stratosphere. They’re pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into chips and data centers, financed increasingly by debt and eyebrow-raising circular deals. Meanwhile, the companies leading the gold rush, like OpenAI and Anthropic, might not turn a profit for years, if ever. Investors are betting big that AI will usher in a new era of riches, yet no one knows how transformative the technology will actually be.

Most organizations using AI aren’t yet seeing the payoff, and AI work slop is everywhere. There’s scientific uncertainty about whether scaling LLMs will deliver superintelligence or whether new breakthroughs need to pave the way. But unlike their predecessors in the dot-com bubble, AI companies are showing strong revenue growth, and some are even deep-pocketed tech titans like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Will the manic dream ever burst? —Michelle Kim

This year, AI agents were everywhere. Every new feature announcement, model drop, or security report throughout 2025 was peppered with mentions of them, even though plenty of AI companies and experts disagree on exactly what counts as being truly “agentic,” a vague term if ever there was one. No matter that it’s virtually impossible to guarantee that an AI acting on your behalf out in the wide web will always do exactly what it’s supposed to do—it seems as though agentic AI is here to stay for the foreseeable. Want to sell something? Call it agentic! —Rhiannon Williams

Early this year, DeepSeek unveiled its new model DeepSeek R1, an open-source reasoning model that matches top Western models but costs a fraction of the price. Its launch freaked Silicon Valley out, as many suddenly realized for the first time that huge scale and resources were not necessarily the key to high-level AI models. Nvidia stock plunged by 17% the day after R1 was released.

The key to R1’s success was distillation, a technique that makes AI models more efficient. It works by getting a bigger model to tutor a smaller model: You run the teacher model on a lot of examples and record the answers, and reward the student model as it copies those responses as closely as possible, so that it gains a compressed version of the teacher’s knowledge.  —Caiwei Chen

As people across the world spend increasing amounts of time interacting with chatbots like ChatGPT, chatbot makers are struggling to work out the kind of tone and “personality” the models should adopt. Back in April, OpenAI admitted it’d struck the wrong balance between helpful and sniveling, saying a new update had rendered GPT-4o too sycophantic. Having it suck up to you isn’t just irritating—it can mislead users by reinforcing their incorrect beliefs and spreading misinformation. So consider this your reminder to take everything—yes, everything—LLMs produce with a pinch of salt. —Rhiannon Williams

If there is one AI-related term that has fully escaped the nerd enclosures and entered public consciousness, it’s “slop.” The word itself is old (think pig feed), but “slop” is now commonly used to refer to low-effort, mass-produced content generated by AI, often optimized for online traffic. A lot of people even use it as a shorthand for any AI-generated content. It has felt inescapable in the past year: We have been marinated in it, from fake biographies to shrimp Jesus images to surreal human-animal hybrid videos.

But people are also having fun with it. The term’s sardonic flexibility has made it easy for internet users to slap it on all kinds of words as a suffix to describe anything that lacks substance and is absurdly mediocre: think “work slop” or “friend slop.” As the hype cycle resets, “slop” marks a cultural reckoning about what we trust, what we value as creative labor, and what it means to be surrounded by stuff that was made for engagement rather than expression. —Caiwei Chen

Did you come across the hypnotizing video from earlier this year of a humanoid robot putting away dishes in a bleak, gray-scale kitchen? That pretty much embodies the idea of physical intelligence: the idea that advancements in AI can help robots better move around the physical world.

It’s true that robots have been able to learn new tasks faster than ever before, everywhere from operating rooms to warehouses. Self-driving-car companies have seen improvements in how they simulate the roads, too. That said, it’s still wise to be skeptical that AI has revolutionized the field. Consider, for example, that many robots advertised as butlers in your home are doing the majority of their tasks thanks to remote operators in the Philippines.

The road ahead for physical intelligence is also sure to be weird. Large language models train on text, which is abundant on the internet, but robots learn more from videos of people doing things. That’s why the robot company Figure suggested in September that it would pay people to film themselves in their apartments doing chores. Would you sign up? —James O&#39;Donnell

AI models are trained by devouring millions of words and images across the internet, including copyrighted work by artists and writers. AI companies argue this is “fair use”—a legal doctrine that lets you use copyrighted material without permission if you transform it into something new that doesn’t compete with the original. Courts are starting to weigh in. In June, Anthropic’s training of its AI model Claude on a library of books was ruled fair use because the technology was “exceedingly transformative.”

That same month, Meta scored a similar win, but only because the authors couldn’t show that the company’s literary buffet cut into their paychecks. As copyright battles brew, some creators are cashing in on the feast. In December, Disney signed a splashy deal with OpenAI to let users of Sora, the AI video platform, generate videos featuring more than 200 characters from Disney&#39;s franchises. Meanwhile, governments around the world are rewriting copyright rules for the content-guzzling machines. Is training AI on copyrighted work fair use? As with any billion-dollar legal question, it depends. —Michelle Kim

Just a few short years ago, an entire industry was built around helping websites rank highly in search results (okay, just in Google). Now search engine optimization (SEO), is giving way to GEO—generative engine optimization—as the AI boom forces brands and businesses to scramble to maximize their visibility in AI, whether that’s in AI-enhanced search results like Google’s AI Overviews or within responses from LLMs. It’s no wonder they’re freaked out. We already know that news companies have experienced a colossal drop in search-driven web traffic, and AI companies are working on ways to cut out the middleman and allow their users to visit sites from directly within their platforms. It’s time to adapt or die. —Rhiannon Williams

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/24/1129294/ronald-deibert-citizen-lab-digital-threats-spies-cybersecurity/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he took a taxi to a mall and headed directly to the Apple Store to purchase a new laptop and iPhone. He’d wanted to keep the risk of having his personal devices confiscated to a minimum, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, the lab operates independently of governments or corporate interests, relying instead on research grants and private philanthropy for financial support. It’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing, he says: “The pillars of democracy are under assault in the United States. For many decades, in spite of its flaws, it has upheld norms about what constitutional democracy looks like or should aspire to. [That] is now at risk.”

Even as some of his fellow Canadians avoided US travel after Donald Trump’s second election, Deibert relished the opportunity to visit. Alongside his meetings with human rights defenders, he also documented active surveillance at Columbia University during the height of its student protests. Deibert snapped photos of drones above campus and noted the exceptionally strict security protocols. “It was unorthodox to go to the United States,” he says. “But I really gravitate toward problems in the world.”

Deibert, 61, grew up in East Vancouver, British Columbia, a gritty area with a boisterous countercultural presence. In the ’70s, Vancouver brimmed with draft dodgers and hippies, but Deibert points to American investigative journalism—exposing the COINTELPRO surveillance program, the Pentagon Papers, Watergate—as the seed of his respect for antiestablishment sentiment. He didn’t imagine that this fascination would translate into a career, however.

“My horizons were pretty low because I came from a working-class family, and there weren’t many people in my family—in fact, none—who went on to university,” he says.

Deibert eventually entered a graduate program in international relations at the University of British Columbia. His doctoral research brought him to a field of inquiry that would soon explode: the geopolitical implications of the nascent internet.

“In my field, there were a handful of people beginning to talk about the internet, but it was very shallow, and that frustrated me,” he says. “And meanwhile, computer science was very technical, but not political—[politics] was almost like a dirty word.”

Deibert continued to explore these topics at the University of Toronto when he was appointed to a tenure-track professorship, but it wasn’t until after he founded the Citizen Lab in 2001 that his work rose to global prominence.

What put the lab on the map, Deibert says, was its 2009 report “Tracking GhostNet,” which uncovered a digital espionage network in China that had breached offices of foreign embassies and diplomats in more than 100 countries, including the office of the Dalai Lama. The report and its follow-up in 2010 were among the first to publicly expose cybersurveillance in real time. In the years since, the lab has published over 180 such analyses, garnering praise from human rights advocates ranging from Margaret Atwood to Edward Snowden.

The lab has rigorously investigated authoritarian regimes around the world (Deibert says both Russia and China have his name on a “list” barring his entry). The group was the first to uncover the use of commercial spyware to surveil people close to the Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi prior to his assassination, and its research has directly informed G7 and UN resolutions on digital repression and led to sanctions on spyware vendors. Even so, in 2025 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement reactivated a $2 million contract with the spyware vendor Paragon. The contract, which the Biden administration had previously placed under a stop-work order, resembles steps taken by governments in Europe and Israel that have also deployed domestic spyware to address security concerns.

“It saves lives, quite literally,” Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says of the lab’s work. “The Citizen Lab [researchers] were the first to really focus on technical attacks on human rights activists and democracy activists all around the world. And they’re still the best at it.”

When recruiting new Citizen Lab employees (or “Labbers,” as they refer to one another), Deibert forgoes stuffy, pencil-pushing academics in favor of brilliant, colorful personalities, many of whom personally experienced repression from some of the same regimes the lab now investigates.

Noura Aljizawi, a researcher on digital repression who survived torture at the hands of the al-Assad regime in Syria, researches the distinct threat that digital technologies pose to women and queer people, particularly when deployed against exiled nationals. She helped create Security Planner, a tool that gives personalized, expert-reviewed guidance to people looking to improve their digital hygiene, for which the University of Toronto awarded her an Excellence Through Innovation Award.

Work for the lab is not without risk. Citizen Lab fellow Elies Campo, for example, was followed and photographed after the lab published a 2022 report that exposed the digital surveillance of dozens of Catalonian citizens and members of parliament, including four Catalonian presidents who were targeted during or after their terms.

Still, the lab’s reputation and mission make recruitment fairly easy, Deibert says. “This good work attracts a certain type of person,” he says. “But they’re usually also drawn to the sleuthing. It’s detective work, and that can be highly intoxicating—even addictive.”

Deibert frequently deflects the spotlight to his fellow Labbers. He rarely discusses the group’s accomplishments without referencing two senior researchers, Bill Marczak and John Scott-Railton, alongside other staffers. And on the occasion that someone decides to leave the Citizen Lab to pursue another position, this appreciation remains.

“We have a saying: Once a Labber, always a Labber,” Deibert says.

While in the US, Deibert taught a seminar on the Citizen Lab’s work to Northwestern University undergraduates and delivered talks on digital authoritarianism at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Universities in the US had been subjected to funding cuts and heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, and Deibert wanted to be “in the mix” at such institutions to respond to what he sees as encroaching authoritarian practices by the US government.

Since Deibert’s return to Canada, the lab has continued its work unearthing digital threats to civil society worldwide, but now Deibert must also contend with the US—a country that was once his benchmark for democracy but has become another subject of his scrutiny. “I do not believe that an institution like the Citizen Lab could exist right now in the United States,” he says. “The type of research that we pioneered is under threat like never before.”

He is particularly alarmed by the increasing pressures facing federal oversight bodies and academic institutions in the US. In September, for example, the Trump administration defunded the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, a government organization dedicated to preventing waste, fraud, and abuse within federal agencies, citing partisanship concerns. The White House has also threatened to freeze federal funding to universities that do not comply with administration directives related to gender, DEI, and campus speech. These sorts of actions, Deibert says, undermine the independence of watchdogs and research groups like the Citizen Lab.

Cohn, the director of the EFF, says the lab’s location in Canada allows it to avoid many of these attacks on institutions that provide accountability. “Having the Citizen Lab based in Toronto and able to continue to do its work largely free of the things we’re seeing in the US,” she says, “could end up being tremendously important if we’re going to return to a place of the rule of law and protection of human rights and liberties.”

            <h2>Four bright spots in climate news in 2025</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-24</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/24/1130191/good-climate-news-2025/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Climate news hasn’t been great in 2025. Global greenhouse-gas emissions hit record highs (again). This year is set to be either the second or third warmest on record. Climate-fueled disasters like wildfires in California and flooding in Indonesia and Pakistan devastated communities and caused billions in damage.

In addition to these worrying indicators of our continued contributions to climate change and their obvious effects, the world’s largest economy has made a sharp U-turn on climate policy this year. The US under the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement, cut funds for climate research, and scrapped billions of dollars in funding for climate tech projects.

We’re in a severe situation with climate change. But for those looking for bright spots, there was some good news in 2025. Here are a few of the positive stories our climate reporters noticed this year.

One of the most notable and encouraging signs of progress this year occurred in China. The world’s second-biggest economy and biggest climate polluter has managed to keep carbon dioxide emissions flat for the last year and a half, according to an analysis in Carbon Brief.

That’s happened before, but only when the nation’s economy was retracting, including in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic. But emissions are now falling even as China’s economy is on track to grow about 5% this year, and electricity demands continue to rise.

So what’s changed? China has now installed so much solar and wind, and put so many EVs on the road, that its economy can continue to expand without increasing the amount of carbon dioxide it’s pumping into the atmosphere, decoupling the traditional link between emissions and growth.

Specifically, China added an astounding 240 gigawatts of solar power capacity and 61 gigawatts of wind power in the first nine months of the year, the Carbon Brief analysis noted. That’s nearly as much solar power as the US has installed in total, in just the first three quarters of this year.

It’s too early to say China’s emissions have peaked, but the country has said it will officially reach that benchmark before 2030.

To be clear, China still isn’t moving fast enough to keep the world on track for meeting relatively safe temperature targets. (Indeed, very few countries are.) But it’s now both producing most of the world’s clean energy technologies and curbing its emissions growth, providing a model for cleaning up industrial economies without sacrificing economic prosperity—and setting the stage for faster climate progress in the coming years.

It’s hard to articulate just how quickly batteries for grid storage are coming online. These massive arrays of cells can soak up electricity when sources like solar are available and prices are low, and then discharge power back to the grid when it’s needed most.

Back in 2015, the battery storage industry had installed only a fraction of a gigawatt of battery storage capacity across the US. That year, it set a seemingly bold target of adding 35 gigawatts by 2035. The sector passed that goal a decade early this year and then hit 40 gigawatts a couple of months later.

Costs are still falling, which could help maintain the momentum for the technology’s deployment. This year, battery prices for EVs and stationary storage fell yet again, reaching a record low, according to data from BloombergNEF. Battery packs specifically used for grid storage saw prices fall even faster than the average; they cost 45% less than last year.

We’re starting to see what happens on grids with lots of battery capacity, too: in California and Texas, batteries are already helping meet demand in the evenings, reducing the need to run natural-gas plants. The result: a cleaner, more stable grid.

The AI boom is complicated for our energy system, as we covered at length this year. Electricity demand is ticking up: the amount of power utilities supplied to US data centers jumped 22% this year and will more than double by 2030.

But at least one positive shift is coming out of AI’s influence on energy: It’s driving renewed interest and investment in next-generation energy technologies.

In the near term, much of the energy needed for data centers, including those that power AI, will likely come from fossil fuels, especially new natural-gas power plants. But tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Meta all have goals on the books to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions, so they’re looking for alternatives.

Meta signed a deal with XGS Energy in June to purchase up to 150 megawatts of electricity from a geothermal plant. In October, Google signed an agreement that will help reopen Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa, a previously shuttered nuclear power plant.

Geothermal and nuclear could be key pieces of the grid of the future, as they can provide constant power in a way that wind and solar don’t. There’s a long way to go for many of the new versions of the tech, but more money and interest from big, powerful players can’t hurt.

Perhaps the strongest evidence of collective climate progress so far: We’ve already avoided the gravest dangers that scientists feared just a decade ago.

The world is on track for about 2.6 °C of warming over preindustrial conditions by 2100, according to Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific effort to track the policy progress that nations have made toward their goals under the Paris climate agreement.That’s a lot warmer than we want the planet to ever get. But it’s also a whole degree better than the 3.6 °C path that we were on a decade ago, just before nearly 200 countries signed the Paris deal.

That progress occurred because more and more nations passed emissions mandates, funded subsidies, and invested in research and development—and private industry got busy cranking out vast amounts of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and EVs.

The bad news is that progress has stalled. Climate Action Tracker notes that its warming projections have remained stubbornly fixed for the last four years, as nations have largely failed to take the additional action needed to bend that curve closer to the 2 °C goal set out in the international agreement.

But having shaved off a degree of danger is still demonstrable proof that we can pull together in the face of a global threat and address a very, very hard problem. And it means we’ve done the difficult work of laying down the technical foundation for a society that can largely run without spewing ever more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.

Hopefully, as cleantech continues to improve and climate change steadily worsens, the world will find the collective will to pick up the pace again soon.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

Omar Yaghi thinks crystals with gaps that capture moisture could bring technology from “Dune” to the arid parts of Earth.

            <h2>Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/23/1130415/organoid-uterus-microfluidic-chip-embryo/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses gently into the receptive lining of the uterus and then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear.

This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three papers published this week by Cell Press, scientists are reporting what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus.

The reports—two from China and a third involving a collaboration among researchers in the United Kingdom, Spain, and the US—show how scientists are using engineered tissues to better understand early pregnancy and potentially improve IVF outcomes.

“You have an embryo and the endometrial organoid together,” says Jun Wu, a biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, in Dallas, who contributed to both Chinese reports. “That’s the overarching message of all three papers.”

According to the papers, these 3D combinations are the most complete re-creations yet of the first days of pregnancy and should be useful for studying why IVF treatments often fail.

In each case, the experiments were stopped when the embryos were two weeks old, if not sooner. That is due to legal and ethical rules that typically restrict scientists from going any further than 14 days.

In your basic IVF procedure, an egg is fertilized in the lab and allowed to develop into a spherical embryo called a blastocyst—a process that takes a few days. That blastocyst then gets put into a patient’s uterus in the hope it will establish itself there and ultimately become a baby.

But that’s a common failure point. Many patients will learn that their IVF procedure didn’t work because an embryo never attached.

In the new reports, it’s that initial bond between mother and embryo that is being reproduced in the lab. “IVF means in vitro fertilization, but now this is the stage of in vitro implantation,” says Matteo Molè, a biologist at Stanford University whose results with collaborators in Europe are among those published today. “Considering that implantation is a barrier [to pregnancy], we have the potential to increase the success rate if we can model it in the laboratory.”

Normally implantation is entirely hidden from view because it occurs in someone’s uterus, says Hongmei Wang, a developmental biologist at the Beijing Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, who co-led the effort there. Wang often studies monkeys because she can interrupt their pregnancies to collect the tissues she needs to see. “We’ve always hoped to understand human embryo implantation, but we have lacked a way to do so,” she says. “It’s all happening in the uterus.”

In the Beijing study, researchers tested about 50 donated IVF embryos, but they also ran a thousand more experiments using so-called blastoids. The latter are mimics of early-stage human embryos manufactured from stem cells. Blastoids are easy to make in large numbers and, since they aren’t true embryos, don’t have as many ethical rules on their use.

“The question was, if we have these blastoids, what can we use them for?” says Leqian Yu, the senior author of the report from the Beijing Institute. “The obvious next step was implantation. So how do you do that?”

For the Beijing team, the answer was to build a soft silicone chamber with tiny channels to add nutrients and a space to grow the uterine organoid. After that, blastoids—or real embryos—could be introduced through a window in the device, so the “pregnancy” could start.

“The key question we want to try to answer is what is the first cross-talk between embryo and mother,” says Yu. “I think this is maybe the first time we can see the entire process.”

This isn’t the first time researchers have tried using organoids for this kind of research. At least two startup companies have raised funds to commercialize similar systems—in some cases presenting the organoids as a tool to predict IVF success. In addition to Dawn Bio, a startup based in Vienna, there is Simbryo Technologies, in Houston, which last month said it would begin offering “personalized” predictions for IVF patients using blastoids and endometrial organoids.

To do that test, doctors will take a biopsy of a patient’s uterine lining and grow organoids from it. After that, blastoids will be added to the organoids to gauge whether a woman is likely to be able to support a pregnancy or not. If the blastoids don’t start to implant, it could mean the patient’s uterus isn’t receptive and is the reason IVF isn’t working.

The Beijing team thinks the pregnancy organoids could also be used to identify drugs that might help those patients. In their paper, they describe how they made organoids out of tissue taken from women who’ve had repeated IVF failures. Then they tested 1,119 approved drugs on those samples to see if anything improved.

Several seemed to have helpful effects. One chemical, avobenzone, an ingredient in some types of sunblock, increased the chance that a blastoid would start implanting from just 5% of the time to around 25% of the time. Yu says his center hopes to eventually start a clinical trial if they can find the right drug to try.

The Beijing group is working on ways to improve the organoid system so that it’s even more realistic. Right now, it lacks important cell types, including immune cells and a blood supply. Yu says a next step he’s working on is to add blood vessels and tiny pumps to his chip device, so that he can give the organoids a kind of rudimentary circulation.

This means that in the near future, blastoids or embryos could likely be grown longer, raising questions about how far scientists will be able to take pregnancy in the lab. “I think this technology does raise the possibility of growing things longer,” says Wu, who says some view the research as an initial step toward creating babies entirely outside the body.

However, Wu says incubating a human to term in the laboratory remains impossible, for the time being. “This technology is certainly related to ectogenesis, or development outside the body,” he says. “But I don’t think it’s anywhere near an artificial womb. That’s still science fiction.”

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <h2>Engineering’s AI reality check</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.

            <div id="article-text">This article was published on September 29, 2025

A few decades ago, when I was raising funding for a startup, I made a lasting impression on an investor by not only talking about how successful we would be, but also highlighting what would happen if we weren’t. Later, in an informal setting, I asked him what had persuaded him to invest in us. He told me that during the pitch, I had said, “And if all our predictions and expectations are wrong, we will use the last of our funding for a magnificent farewell dinner for all our investors. You’ll have lost your money, but at least you’ll get a great evening for it in return.”

I don’t recall this being part of the original pitch or my strategy. I probably just blurted it out to break the ice, but it impressed the investor. He told me it was refreshing to speak to an entrepreneur who was not blinded by his own pitch. The fact that I had a scenario ready for both success and failure told him that I was honest and realistic.

Now, the startup was not successful, but we still had a nice, opulent dinner with the investors at the end — and we did them one better. As soon as we realised that our predictions and expectations were wrong, we made our investors an offer: we could struggle and pivot and hope for a miracle, or we could return what was left of our funding to our investors. We preferred option two, and so did they, so everybody got some money back (about 40% of what they had invested), as well as a lovely evening with excellent food and drinks. When we raised money for another startup a few years later, almost all of them signed up in our first round.

Obviously, I would have preferred to have made this startup a success instead, but I still regard it as a successful endeavour. I gave it a try and had a plan ready for when my experiment didn’t work out, and in the process, I built relationships that outlasted that one startup.

As you may have read, The Next Web, the company I founded in 2006, is nearing the end of its lifecycle. The events and media business is being wound down, and only TNW Spaces will live on. TNW Programs was sold off a while ago and will continue as well. There won’t be another TNW Conference, and soon there won’t be new articles on the site; people are losing their jobs, including me. It’s a painful process, but I guess I’m taking it well because it also feels natural and logical. When we sold TNW to the FT in 2019, we were very ambitious and optimistic, and surely I would’ve liked for the company and brand to outlive me. However, when the business struggled, I also felt very comfortable with the company ending graciously.

When you’re reading a good book, there’s a moment near the end when you’ll start reading slower because you don’t want it to end. I love those moments, because I’ll know it’s been a good experience. But then you also know that good stories need good endings. So, this is the ending of a great story that I’ve enjoyed participating in.

I’ll keep writing, but this will be my last official TNW story. I’d love it if you would subscribe to my writing over at Substack. It will be less tech-focused, more unpredictable, but just as insightful as before.
