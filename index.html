            <h2>Get ready for new Macs and iPads: Apple announces "Special Experience" on March 4</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2026/02/get-ready-for-new-macs-and-ipads-apple-announces-special-experience-on-march-4/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It may be more tempting to take that aging Mac you’ve been coddling and put it out to pasture soon. Apple has announced an event for March 4, which in usual Apple fashion, it has branded a “Special Apple Experience.” Also in usual Apple fashion, it has not come out and said what it’s going to be announcing. We have a pretty good idea, though.

The event will kick off at 9AM ET on March 4—Ars will be on the ground in New York City to cover Apple’s latest unveiling, whatever form it may take. Apple doesn’t release most products on a set schedule, but some recent speculation about likely hardware updates can point us in the right direction.

As we reported recently, the iPhone 17e may be making an appearance in Apple’s lineup soon. This updated version of the budget-oriented iPhone will have an A19 chip inside, similar to the one powering the base model iPhone 17. It may also add MagSafe charging. Don’t expect to see a multi-camera array like you’d get on the more expensive Apple phones, though. Pricing will be the most important thing to watch for should Apple announce this phone. Right now, the non-Pro iPhone 16 and 17 (including the 16e) are all clustered in the $600-800 range. Another $599 budget iPhone won’t make waves.

Apple may also drop new iPads, including a base model with an A18 chip and a M4-powered iPad Air. The processor upgrades may be the only changes of note for these devices, though. Add to that Apple’s tendency to disable CPU or GPU cores on low-end iPad chips, and the difference compared to old devices may be negligible.

The updates to Apple’s Mac lineup may headlining the event. Recent reports point to a long-awaited MacBook Pro chipset upgrade. Fans of Apple’s most powerful laptops have been aching for an upgrade path from their M4-based machines. Apple announced a 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M5 chip last fall, but there was no M5 Pro or M5 Max option.

The rumor mill is now predicting 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. Lots of folks will probably drop thousands of dollars on those machines as soon as they’re available. For the less demanding, rumors have also pointed to a cheaper MacBook with an A18 Pro chip, as well as an M5-powered MacBook Air.

We’ll find out exactly what Apple’s been cooking up on March 4.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A Best Buy employee in Florida was charged with fraud after allegedly using his manager’s code to heavily discount nearly 150 items that he and his accomplices purchased and pawned.

It seems that the manager first started growing suspicious about “strange sales numbers” in December 2024, an ABC News affiliate in West Palm Beach reported. Private investigators traced the weird sales back to a 36-year-old employee, Matthew Lettera, who allegedly conducted 97 discounted purchases for himself and 52 additional transactions for others. Some MacBooks were discounted as much as 99 percent, a local CW affiliate reported. In total, Best Buy lost more than $118,000 from the scheme.

According to a LinkedIn profile that matches Lettera’s information, he started working at Best Buy in January 2020 after pivoting from career training as a chef.

An arrest affidavit from the Palm Beach Police Department reviewed by a local CBS News affiliate alleged that Lettera’s scheme did not start until March 2024, about four years into his Best Buy career as an “experience manager.” A switch seemingly flipped, as Lettera allegedly  conducted dozens of heavily discounted transactions that went unnoticed for months, seemingly growing bolder and eventually recruiting coworkers to join the scheme.

He apparently didn’t expect the Best Buy managers to detect the losses or seek to retrieve pawned merchandise, but that was a miscalculation. Lettera was arrested after police tracked down some of the discounted MacBook laptops at local pawn shops. Cooperating with police, the pawn shops provided sales records allegedly showing that Lettera sold the steeply discounted products and profited from exploiting Best Buy’s discount system.

In 2023, a few months before Lettera’s alleged fraud scheme started, the National Retail Foundation warned  that monitoring employee theft had become a bigger priority for retailers. In times of inflation, retail theft typically increases, and their survey found that a record level of talent turnover was stressing out retail employees and making it easier for those with malicious intent to get away with fraud.

For Best Buy, threats of losses from stressed-out employees seemingly remain, as inflation pressures persist. Last month, an employee at a Best Buy in Georgia assisted a shoplifting ring in stealing more than $40,000 in merchandise, a local CBS News affiliate reported.

Surveillance footage showed that 20-year-old Dorian Allen allowed shoplifters to simply leave the store without paying for more than 140 items, a police report alleged. Among merchandise stolen were “dozens of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S consoles, AirPods, Meta Quest VR headsets, Beats wireless headphones, a PC, a Segway, wireless controllers, and more,” CBS News reported.

Charged with theft, Allen claimed he was being blackmailed by a hacker group who threatened to expose nude photos he shared on Instagram if he didn’t cooperate. Allegedly under duress, Allen memorized descriptions of the shoplifters so that he could allow them to take items without paying. He also allegedly helped thieves load items into their vehicles.

Managers called in police after Allen allegedly spent weeks assisting the shoplifters without detection.</div>

            <h2>ByteDance backpedals after Seedance 2.0 turned Hollywood icons into AI “clip art”</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/bytedance-backpedals-after-seedance-2-0-turned-hollywood-icons-into-ai-clip-art/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">ByteDance says that it’s rushing to add safeguards to block Seedance 2.0 from generating iconic characters and deepfaking celebrities, after substantial Hollywood backlash after launching the latest version of its AI video tool.

The changes come after Disney and Paramount Skydance sent cease-and-desist letters to ByteDance urging the Chinese company to promptly end the allegedly vast and blatant infringement.

Studios claimed the infringement was widescale and immediate, with Seedance 2.0 users across social media sharing AI videos featuring copyrighted characters like Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and SpongeBob Square Pants. In its letter, Disney fumed that Seedance was “hijacking” its characters, accusing ByteDance of treating Disney characters like they were “free public domain clip art,” Axios reported.

“ByteDance’s virtual smash-and-grab of Disney’s IP is willful, pervasive, and totally unacceptable,” Disney’s letter said.

Defending intellectual property from franchises like Star Trek and The Godfather, Paramount Skydance pointed out that Seedance’s outputs are “often indistinguishable, both visually and audibly” from the original characters, Variety reported. Similarly frustrated, Japan’s AI minister Kimi Onoda, sought to protect popular anime and manga characters, officially launching a probe last week into ByteDance over the copyright violations, the South China Morning Post reported.

“We cannot overlook a situation in which content is being used without the copyright holder’s permission,” Onoda said at a press conference Friday.

Facing legal threats and Japan’s investigation, ByteDance issued a statement Monday, CNBC reported. In it, the company claimed that it “respects intellectual property rights” and has “heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0.”

“We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,” ByteDance said.

However, Disney seems unlikely to accept that ByteDance inadvertently released its tool without implementing such safeguards in advance. In its letter, Disney alleged that “Seedance has infringed on Disney’s copyrighted materials to benefit its commercial service without permission.”

After all, what better way to illustrate Seedance 2.0’s latest features than by generating some of the best-known IP in the world? At least one tech consultant has suggested that ByteDance planned to benefit from inciting Hollywood outrage. The founder of San Francisco-based consultancy Tech Buzz China, Rui Ma, told SCMP that “the controversy surrounding Seedance is likely part of ByteDance’s initial distribution strategy to showcase its underlying technical capabilities.”

Studios aren’t the only ones sounding alarms.

Several industry groups expressed concerns, including the Motion Picture Association, which accused ByteDance of engaging in massive copyright infringement within “a single day,” CNBC reported.

Sean Astin, an actor and president of the actors union, SAG-AFTRA, was directly impacted by the scandal. A video that has since been removed from X showed Astin in the role of Samwise Gamgee from The Lord of the Rings, delivering a line he never said, Variety reported. Condemning Seedance’s infringement, SAG-AFTRA issued a statement emphasizing that ByteDance did not act responsibly in releasing the model without safeguards:

“SAG-AFTRA stands with the studios in condemning the blatant infringement enabled by ByteDance’s new AI video model Seedance 2.0. The infringement includes the unauthorized use of our members’ voices and likenesses. This is unacceptable and undercuts the ability of human talent to earn a livelihood. Seedance 2.0 disregards law, ethics, industry standards and basic principles of consent. Responsible AI development demands responsibility, and that is nonexistent here.”

Echoing that, a group representing Hollywood creators, the Human Artistry Campaign, declared that “the launch of Seedance 2.0” was “an attack on every creator around the world.”

“Stealing human creators’ work in an attempt to replace them with AI generated slop is destructive to our culture: stealing isn’t innovation,” the group said. “These unauthorized deepfakes and voice clones of actors violate the most basic aspects of personal autonomy and should be deeply concerning to everyone. Authorities should use every legal tool at their disposal to stop this wholesale theft.”

Ars could not immediately reach any of these groups to comment on whether ByteDance’s post-launch efforts to add safeguards addressed industry concerns.

MPA chairman and CEO Charles Rivkin has previously accused ByteDance of disregarding “well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.”

While Disney and other studios are clearly ready to take down any tools that could hurt their revenue or reputation without an agreement in place, they aren’t opposed to all AI uses of their characters. In December, Disney struck a deal with OpenAI, giving Sora access to 200 characters for three years, while investing $1 billion in the technology.

At that time, Disney CEO Robert A. Iger, said that “the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI, we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.”

In a blog announcing Seedance 2.0, ByteDance boasted that the new model “delivers a substantial leap in generation quality,” particularly in close-up shots and action sequences.

The company acknowledged that further refinements were needed and the model is “still far from perfect” but hyped that “its generated videos possess a distinct cinematic aesthetic; the textures of objects, lighting, and composition, as well as costume, makeup, and prop designs, all show high degrees of finish.”

ByteDance likely hoped that the earliest outputs from Seedance 2.0 would produce headlines wowed by the model’s capabilities, and it got what it wanted when a single Hollywood stakeholder’s social media comment went viral.

Shortly after Seedance 2.0’s rollout, Deadpool co-writer, Rhett Reese, declared on X that “it’s likely over for us,” The Guardian reported. The screenwriter was impressed by an AI video created by Irish director Ruairi Robinson, which realistically depicted Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt. “[I]n next to no time, one person is going to be able to sit at a computer and create a movie indistinguishable from what Hollywood now releases,” Reese opined. “True, if that person is no good, it will suck. But if that person possesses Christopher Nolan’s talent and taste (and someone like that will rapidly come along), it will be tremendous.”

However, some AI critics rejected the notion that Seedance 2.0 is capable of replacing artists in the way that Reese warned. On Bluesky and X, they pushed back on ByteDance claims that this model doomed Hollywood, with some accusing outlets of too quickly ascribing Reese’s reaction to the whole industry.

Among them was longtime AI critic, Reid Southen, a film concept artist who works on major motion pictures and TV. Responding directly to Reese’s X thread, Southen contradicted the notion that a great filmmaker could be born from fiddling with AI prompts alone.

“Nolan is capable of doing great work because he’s put in the work,” Southen said. “AI is an automation tool, it’s literally removing key, fundamental work from the process, how does one become good at anything if they insist on using nothing but shortcuts?”

Perhaps the strongest evidence in Southen’s favor is Darren Aronofsky’s recent AI-generated historical docudrama. Speaking anonymously to Ars following backlash declaring that “AI slop is ruining American history,” one source close to production on that project confirmed that it took “weeks” to produce minutes of usable video using a variety of AI tools.

That source noted that the creative team went into the project expecting they had a lot to learn but also expecting that tools would continue to evolve, as could audience reactions to AI-assisted movies.

“It’s a huge experiment, really,” the source told Ars.

Notably, for both creators and rights-holders concerned about copyright infringement and career threats, questions remain on how Seedance 2.0 was trained. ByteDance has yet to release a technical report for Seedance 2.0 and “has never disclosed the data sets it uses to train its powerful video-generation Seedance models and image-generation Seedream models,” SCMP reported.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Heating accounts for nearly half of the global energy demand, and two-thirds of that is met by burning fossil fuels like natural gas, oil, and coal. Solar energy is a possible alternative, but while we have become reasonably good at storing solar electricity in lithium-ion batteries, we’re not nearly as good at storing heat.

To store heat for days, weeks, or months, you need to trap the energy in the bonds of a molecule that can later release heat on demand. The approach to this particular chemistry problem is called molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage. While it has been the next big thing for decades, it never really took off.

In a recent Science paper, a team of researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and UCLA demonstrate a breakthrough that might finally make MOST energy storage effective.

In the past, MOST energy storage solutions have been plagued by lackluster performance. The molecules either didn’t store enough energy, degraded too quickly, or required toxic solvents that made them impractical. To find a way around these issues, the team led by Han P. Nguyen, a chemist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, drew inspiration from the genetic damage caused by sunburn. The idea was to store energy using a reaction similar to the one that allows UV light to damage DNA.

When you stay out on the beach too long, high-energy ultraviolet light can cause adjacent bases in the DNA (thymine, the T in the genetic code) to link together. This forms a structure known as a (6-4) lesion. When that lesion is exposed to even more UV light, it twists into an even stranger shape called a “Dewar” isomer. In biology, this is rather bad news, as Dewar isomers cause kinks in the DNA’s double-helix spiral that disrupt copying the DNA and can lead to mutations or cancer.

To counter this effect, evolution shaped a specific enzyme called photolyase to hunt (6-4) lesions down and snap them back into their safe, stable forms.

The researchers realized that the Dewar isomer is essentially a molecular battery. This snap-back effect was exactly what Nguyen’s team was looking for, since it releases a lot of heat.

Molecular batteries, in principle, are extremely good at storing energy. Heating oil, arguably the most popular molecular battery we use for heating, is essentially ancient solar energy stored in chemical bonds. Its energy density stands at around 40 Megajoules per kilo. To put that in perspective, Li-ion batteries usually pack less than one MJ/kg. One of the problems with heating oil, though, is that it is single-use only—it gets burnt when you use it. What Nguyen and her colleagues aimed to achieve with their DNA-inspired substance is essentially a reusable fuel.

To do that, researchers synthesized a derivative of 2-pyrimidone, a chemical cousin of the thymine found in DNA. They engineered this molecule to reliably fold into a Dewar isomer under sunlight and then unfold on command. The result was a rechargeable fuel that could absorb the energy when exposed to sunlight, release it when needed, and return to a “relaxed” state where it’s ready to be charged up again.

Previous attempts at MOST systems have struggled to compete with Li-ion batteries. Norbornadiene, one of the best-studied candidates, tops out at around 0.97 MJ/kg. Another contender, azaborinine, manages only 0.65 MJ/kg. They may be scientifically interesting, but they are not going to heat your house.

Nguyen’s pyrimidone-based system blew those numbers out of the water. The researchers achieved an energy storage density of 1.65 MJ/kg—nearly double the capacity of Li-ion batteries and substantially higher than any previous MOST material.

The reason for this jump in performance was what the team called compounded strain.

When the pyrimidone molecule absorbs light, it doesn’t just fold; it twists into a fused, bicyclic structure containing two different four-membered rings: 1,2-dihydroazete and diazetidine. Four-membered rings are under immense structural tension. By fusing them together, the researchers created a molecule that is desperate to snap back into its relaxed state.

Achieving high energy density on paper is one thing. Making it work in the real world is another. A major failing of previous MOST systems is that they are solids that need to be dissolved in solvents like toluene or acetonitrile to work. Solvents are the enemy of energy density—by diluting your fuel to 10 percent concentration, for example, you effectively cut your energy density by 90 percent. Any solvent used means less fuel.

Nguyen’s team tackled this by designing a version of their molecule that is a liquid at room temperature, so it doesn’t need a solvent. This simplified operations considerably, as the liquid fuel could be pumped through a solar collector to charge it up and store it in a tank.

Unlike many organic molecules that hate water, Nguyen’s system is compatible with aqueous environments. This means if a pipe leaks, you aren’t spewing toxic fluids like toluene around your house. The researchers even demonstrated that the molecule could work in water and that its energy release was intense enough to boil it.

The MOST-based heating system, the team says in their paper, would circulate this rechargeable fuel through panels on the roof to capture the sun’s light and then store it in the basement tank. The fuel from this tank would later be pumped to a reaction chamber with an acid catalyst that triggers the energy release. Then, through a heat exchanger, this energy would heat up the water in the standard central heating system.

The first hurdle is the spectrum of light that puts energy in the Nguyen’s fuel. The Sun bathes us in a broad spectrum of light, from infrared to ultraviolet. Ideally, a solar collector should use as much of this as possible, but the pyrimidone molecules only absorb light in the UV-A and UV-B range, around 300-310 nm. That represents about five percent of the total solar spectrum. The vast majority of the Sun’s energy, the visible light and the infrared, passes right through Nguyen’s molecules without charging them.

The second problem is quantum yield. This is a fancy way of asking, “For every 100 photons that hit the molecule, how many actually make it switch to the Dewar isomer state?” For these pyrimidones, the answer is a rather underwhelming number, in the single digits. Low quantum yield means the fluid needs a longer exposure to sunlight to get a full charge.

The researchers hypothesize that the molecule has a fast leak, meaning a non-radiative decay path where the excited molecule shakes off the energy as heat immediately instead of twisting into the storage form. Plugging that leak is the next big challenge for the team.

Finally, the team in their experiments used an acid catalyst that was mixed directly into the storage material. The team admits that in a future closed-loop device, this would require a neutralization step—a reaction that eliminates the acidity after the heat is released. Unless the reaction products can be purified away, this will reduce the energy density of the system.

Still, despite the efficiency issues, the stability of the Nguyen’s system looks promising.

One of the biggest fears with chemical storage is thermal reversion—the fuel spontaneously discharges because it got a little too warm in the storage tank. But the Dewar isomers of the pyrimidones are incredibly stable. The researchers calculated a half-life of up to 481 days at room temperature for some derivatives. This means the fuel could be charged in the heat of July, and it would remain fully charged when you need to heat your home in January. The degradation figures also look decent for a MOST energy storage. The team ran the system through 20 charge-discharge cycles with negligible decay.

The problem with separating the acid from the fuel could be solved in a practical system by switching to a different catalyst. The scientists suggest in the paper that in this hypothetical setup, the fuel would flow through an acid-functionalized solid surface to release heat, thus eliminating the need for neutralization afterwards.

Still, we’re rather far away using MOST systems for heating actual homes. To get there, we’re going to need molecules that absorb far more of the light spectrum and convert to the activated state with a higher efficiency. We’re just not there yet.

            <h2>Michigan antitrust lawsuit says oil companies hobbled EVs and renewables</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/michigan-accuses-oil-companies-of-antitrust-violations-in-climate-change-lawsuit/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Michigan is taking on major oil and gas companies in court, joining nearly a dozen other states that have brought climate-related lawsuits against ExxonMobil and its industry peers. But Michigan’s approach is different: accusing Big Oil not of deceiving consumers or misrepresenting climate change risks, but of driving up energy costs by colluding to suppress competition from cleaner and cheaper technologies like solar power and electric vehicles.

The strategy is risky and might run into challenges, but it could potentially be a game changer if the state can overcome initial dismissal attempts by the industry defendants, legal experts say.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed the lawsuit last month in federal District Court against BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and the American Petroleum Institute. The suit, brought under federal and state antitrust laws, alleges a conspiracy to delay the transition to renewable energy and EVs and maintain market dominance of fossil fuels.

Exxon said in a statement that the state’s action is “yet another legally incoherent effort to regulate by lawsuit. It won’t reduce emissions, it won’t help consumers, and it won’t stand up to the law.”

Chevron did not respond to a request for comment, and BP and Shell declined to comment.

API senior vice president and general counsel Ryan Meyers said that Michigan’s case is “baseless” and “part of a coordinated campaign against an industry that powers everyday life, drives America’s economy, and is actively reducing emissions.”

“We continue to believe that energy policy belongs in Congress, not a patchwork of courtrooms,” Meyers added.

This week during a congressional hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi testifying, U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wyo.) referenced Michigan’s lawsuit in arguing that these “novel approaches” to “climate lawfare” require a federal response. Hageman said she is working with House and Senate colleagues to craft legislation aimed at shielding fossil fuel companies from state climate liability laws and lawsuits.

API has been lobbying Congress on exactly this kind of liability shield. The organization has recently lobbied on “draft legislation related to state efforts to impose liability on the oil and gas industry,” according to its lobbying reports. And API is now stating publicly that stopping “extreme climate liability policy” such as lawsuits and state climate superfund laws is one of its top priorities for 2026.

In its lawsuit, Michigan argues that the oil companies and their chief trade association operated as a cartel, working to hinder the development of alternatives in the primary energy and transportation markets in order to keep consumers dependent upon oil and gas. This anticompetitive conduct, the state says, has resulted in fewer choices for consumers when it comes to fueling their cars or heating their homes, and has left consumers paying more for energy than they otherwise would have.

The lawsuit comes at a time of mounting concerns over affordability and the cost of living, including rising energy costs. Nessel said these “out-of-control costs” are largely “due to the greed of these corporations who prioritized their own profit and marketplace dominance over competition and consumer savings.”

According to the state’s complaint, clean energy technologies would have reached scale much sooner, and consumers would have avoided billions of dollars in overcharges, were it not for the defendants’ deliberate actions to forestall their development and deployment.

“Defendants have dramatically delayed the availability of EVs, made 100 percent clean charging stations a rarity, suppressed the advancement of solar technology and its uptake by consumers, and prolonged fossil fuels’ dominance in mixed-source electricity generation,” the complaint argues.

The lawsuit details allegations of coordinated anticompetitive conduct, such as abandoning research and investments in alternative energy technologies and using patent litigation to stifle innovation. Exxon, which invented an early version of the lithium-ion battery, halted its EV battery research program in the early 1980s, while Chevron worked to block commercialization of a nickel-metal hydride battery technology.

Oil companies were also early developers of the solar energy market and controlled much of the sector in the 1980s. But then they abandoned these ventures and, according to the complaint, “used litigation to deter new market entrants.” As attorney Tracy Emblem wrote in a 2010 article, big oil companies “seized and took control of the research and patents” for PV solar in order to thwart its development.

Oil companies understood the threat posed to their business by a large-scale transition away from fossil fuels, the Michigan lawsuit says, and therefore they worked together to try to block alternatives from taking off and to ultimately delay the transition.

The complaint cites a 1979 internal study by Exxon finding that alternatives to fossil fuels would need to account for at least half of global energy supply by 2010 in order to avoid catastrophic climate impacts. That same year, API established a CO2 and Climate Task Force, and through this task force the defendants “reached a consensus to restrain innovation and coordinate efforts to delay the inevitable energy transition,” the complaint alleges.

Proving there was an actual conspiracy or an agreement among the companies, however, is likely to be one of the biggest challenges for the state, legal experts say.

“In establishing an antitrust claim, essentially a conspiracy, you need to prove an agreement,” Gary Mouw, partner at the Michigan-based law firm Varnum LLP, told Inside Climate News. “You need to allege sufficient facts, specific concrete facts where it can be concluded or interpreted that these parties actually entered into an agreement to coordinate.”

He said he expects the defendants will argue that the allegations lack specificity and that there was no established consensus to collude.

Pat Parenteau, emeritus professor of law at Vermont Law and Graduate School, agreed that proving the alleged conspiracy might be the biggest sticking point for the state plaintiffs.

“They’ve really got to nail down, what is the overt evidence of the conspiracy to constrain trade? What documents reveal these parties getting together and agreeing that we’re going to choke renewables?” Parenteau told Inside Climate News.

“The theories are solid,” he added. “Surviving a motion to dismiss is the ball game, I think. If [the state] can get past a motion to dismiss, get into discovery, get to trial, then they’ve got a shot.”

Michigan is not the first to allege that fossil fuel companies engaged in conspiratorial conduct. California, for example, which sued a handful of major oil and gas firms in 2023, argued that the companies conspired to misrepresent the known dangers of fossil fuels and to disseminate climate disinformation while promoting continued use of fossil fuel products.

Several other lawsuits filed against the industry include racketeering and related conspiracy claims. One of these cases, filed in 2022 by Puerto Rican municipalities, also brought a federal antitrust claim against fossil fuel companies. While a magistrate judge had recommended that the case should proceed under racketeering and antitrust claims, a federal district court judge decided to dismiss the case in September based on a procedural statute of limitations issue. The Puerto Rican municipalities are appealing that decision.

Mouw said he expects that defendants in the Michigan lawsuit will likely raise a similar statute of limitations defense, essentially arguing that the claims were not brought in a timely manner.

But while Puerto Rico’s lawsuit sought to hold fossil fuel companies liable for damages stemming from the 2017 hurricanes that decimated the island, Michigan’s case is less focused around a specific event, Aaron Regunberg, a lawyer and director of Public Citizen’s climate accountability project, explained. “It is an ongoing conspiracy with ongoing harms,” he told Inside Climate News. “I think it’s better insulated from a statute of limitations argument.”

Regunberg said he thinks the approach of bringing antitrust claims against Big Oil for delaying the energy transition is compelling and appropriate.

“It really gets at the fundamental thing that Big Oil was trying to do,” he said. “Ultimately it was about shutting out competitors, keeping their energy cartel dominant over the market, in order to keep us locked into their products and keep alternative clean energy from reaching scale.”

Zephyr Teachout, a law professor at Fordham Law School with expertise in antitrust law, told Inside Climate News that Michigan’s case looks very promising.

“For generations fossil fuel companies have engaged in cartel-like behaviors to suppress innovation and lock down the flow of cash,” she said. “They hide in trade associations but there’s no free speech protection for cartels, and I’m glad to see the case.”

Michigan’s lawsuit comes amidst escalating attempts by the fossil fuel industry and its political allies to shut down climate liability initiatives.

“As more than a dozen states and communities move closer to putting Big Oil on trial, and as climate superfund laws begin to take hold, the industry is turning to Congress for protection. API has said plainly that stopping climate liability is a top priority and now we are seeing legislation take shape to do exactly that,” Cassidy DiPaola, communications director for the Make Polluters Pay campaign, said in response to Hageman’s announcement that she is working with congressional colleagues to craft a federal liability shield for energy companies.

“If these companies believe they did nothing wrong, they should be willing to defend that position in court,” DiPaola added. “Instead, they are asking lawmakers to block the cases altogether.”

State lawmakers in Utah and Oklahoma recently introduced bills that aim to shield the fossil fuel industry from climate lawsuits and prohibit liability over climate damages. Both bills are currently advancing in the state legislatures.

In April 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the attorney general to identify and “expeditiously take all appropriate action to stop” state laws and lawsuits that burden domestic fossil fuel production or otherwise target the fossil fuel industry.

Just weeks later, the U.S. Department of Justice sued New York and Vermont over their climate superfund laws. The DOJ also preemptively sued Hawaii and Michigan in anticipation of those states bringing climate lawsuits against oil companies, even though neither state had filed any case at the time. Hawaii did file a complaint against oil companies the next day.

Michigan, however, did not file its suit until just recently, and it ended up departing from the expected focus on climate damages. The DOJ argued in its complaint that Michigan’s forthcoming suit would be unconstitutional and preempted by the Clean Air Act. U.S. District Judge Jane M. Beckering, who is now presiding over Michigan’s antitrust lawsuit, tossed out the DOJ’s case the day after the state filed its suit against Big Oil.

Beckering said the DOJ’s case was too speculative and premature, and that there appeared to be no precedent for preemptively blocking a party from bringing “a broad swath of unspecified claims against unspecified members of a given industry simply because that party has begun investigating whether a litigation strategy may have merit.”

“I am relieved the Court saw through this and dismissed this frivolous case,” Nessel, the Michigan attorney general, said in response. “My office will not be bullied.”

Nessel put out a request for outside counsel in 2024 to assist with pursuing climate litigation against fossil fuel companies, and the state subsequently entered into contingency contracts with the law firms Sher Edling, DiCello Levitt and Hausfeld. What had started as an investigative strategy of holding fossil fuel companies liable for climate impacts in the state, however, instead “uncovered one of the most successful antitrust conspiracies in United States history,” according to Nessel’s office.

Antitrust experts say the state’s case takes a novel approach, and one that tests the bounds of traditional antitrust law.

“I think there are some challenges here, especially when the court looks at what else would this apply to if we were to adopt this theory: Would this really expand liability for antitrust beyond what it was really meant for?” Mouw said.

“The Michigan case is a novel application of a classic principle of the antitrust laws—that agreements between competitors to restrict output are illegal,” Nicole Veno, an antitrust lawyer and senior associate at Lowey Dannenberg, told Inside Climate News. “While the theory of liability appears strong, to prove damages Michigan will also need to show that it was economically harmed by the failure to invest in alternative energy sources, which could prove more challenging.”

If the case does move ahead, climate advocates say they are hopeful that it will open up new pathways for pursuing accountability.

“I’m excited to see how this case goes,” Public Citizen’s Regunberg said, “and would hope it would be a model for a lot of other plaintiffs who are hopefully going to be bringing more suits like it.”

            <div id="article-text">SAARISELKÄ, FINLAND—If you’re expecting it, the feeling in the pit of your stomach when the rear of your car breaks traction and begins to slide is rather pleasant. It’s the same exhilaration we get from roller coasters, but when you’re in the driver’s seat, you’re in charge of the ride.

When you’re not expecting it, though, there’s anxiety instead of excitement and, should the slide end with a crunch, a lot more negative emotions, too.

Thankfully, fewer and fewer drivers will have to experience that kind of scare thanks to the proliferation and sophistication of modern electronic stability and traction control systems. For more than 30 years, these electronic safety nets have grown in capability and became mandatory in the early 2010s, saving countless crashes in the process.

Through a combination of cutting engine power and individually braking each wheel, the computers that keep a watchful eye on things like lateral acceleration and wheel spin gather it all together with the idea that the car goes where the driver wants it rather than sideways or backward into whatever solid object lies along the new path of motion.

Obviously, the quickest way to find out whether this all works is to turn it off. And then find a slippery road, or just drive like an oaf. Yet even when automakers let journalists loose on racetracks, they invariably require that we keep some of the electronic safety net turned on. Even on track, you can hit things that will crumple a car—or worse—and with modern tire technology being what it is, the speeds involved when cars do let go tend to be quite high, particularly if it’s dry.

There are few environments that are more conducive to exploring the limits and capabilities of electronic chassis control. Ideally, you want a lot of wide-open space free of wildlife and people and a smooth, low-grip surface. A giant sand dune would work. Or a frozen lake. Which is why you can sometimes find automotive engineers hanging out in these remote, often extreme locations, braving the desert’s heat or an Arctic chill as they work on a prototype or fine-tune the next model.

And it’s no secret that sliding a car on the ice is a lot fun. So it’s not surprising that a cottage tourism industry exists that—for a suitable fee—will bring you north of the Arctic Circle where you can work on your car control and get some insight into just how hard those electronics are capable of working.

That explains why I left an extremely cold Washington, DC, to travel to an even colder Saariselkä in Finland, where McLaren operates its Arctic Experience program on a frozen lake in nearby Ivalo. The company does some development work here, though more of it happens across the border in Sweden. But for a few weeks each winter, it welcomes customers to its minimalist lodge to work on their car control. And earlier this month, Ars was among a group of journalists who got an abbreviated version of the experience.

Our car for the day was a Ventura Orange McLaren Artura, the brand’s plug-in hybrid supercar, wearing Pirelli’s Sottozero winter tires, each augmented by a few hundred metal spikes. Its total power and torque output is 671 hp (500 kW) and 531 lb-ft (720 Nm) combined from a 3.0 L twin-turbo V6 that generates 577 hp (430 kW) and 431 lb-ft (584 Nm), plus an axial flux electric motor that contributes an additional 94 hp (70 kW) and 166 lb-ft (225 Nm). All of that is sent to the rear wheels via an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission.

Where most hybrids use the electric motor to boost efficiency, McLaren mostly uses it to boost performance, providing an immediate shove and filling gaps in the torque band where necessary. In electric-only mode, it will do just that, right up to the 81 mph (130 km/h) speed limit of the mode. Being the sort of curious nerd I am, I took the opportunity to try all the different modes.

Once I got control of my stomach, that is.

Our first exercise was ironically the hardest: driving sideways around a plain old circle. A couple of these had been scribed into the ice—which freezes from November until April and was 28 inches (70 cm) thick, we learned—along with more than a dozen other, more involved courses. Even under the best of conditions, the Sun spends barely six hours a day on its shallow curve from horizon to horizon at this time of year. On the day of our visit, the horizon was an indistinct thing as heavy gray skies blended with the snow-covered ice.

The lack of a visual reference, mixed with 15 minutes of steady lateral G-forces, turned out to be unkind to my vestibular system, and about 10 minutes later, I found myself in shirtsleeves at minus-11˚F (minus-23˚C), saying goodbye to a cup of Earl Grey tea I’d previously and perhaps unwisely drunk a little earlier. At least I remembered to face downwind—given the sideways gale, it could have ended worse.

Fortified with an anti-emetic and some extremely fresh air, I returned to the ice and can happily report that as long as you slide both left and right, you’re unlikely to get nauseous.

Getting an Artura sideways on a frozen lake is not especially complicated. With the powertrain set to Track, which prioritizes performance and keeps the V6 running the whole time, and with stability and traction control off, you apply enough power to break traction at the rear. Or a dab of brake could do the job, too, followed by some power. You steer more with your right foot than your hands, adding or subtracting power to reign in or amplify the slip angle. Your eyes are crucial to the process; if you look through the corner down the track, that’s probably where you’ll end up. Fixate on the next apex and you may quickly find yourself off-course.

Most of the mid-engined Artura’s 3,303 lbs (1,498 kg) live between its axles, and it’s a relatively easy car to catch once it begins to slide, with plenty of travel for the well-mapped throttle pedal.

As it turns out, that holds true even when you’re using only the electric motor. 166 lb-ft is more than enough to get the rear wheels spinning on the ice, but with just 94 hp, there isn’t really enough power to get the car properly sideways. So you can easily control a lazy slide around one of the handling courses, in near silence, to boot. Turn the electronic aids back on and things got much less dramatic; even with my foot to the floor, the Artura measured out minute amounts of power, keeping the car very much pointed where I steered it rather than requiring any opposite lock.

Back in track mode, with all 671 hp to play with, there was much more power than necessary to spin. But with the safety net re-enabled, driving around the handling course was barely any more dramatic than with a fraction of the power. The car’s electronic chassis control algorithms would only send as much power to the rear wheels as they could deploy, no matter how much throttle I applied. As each wheel lost grip and began to spin, its brake would intervene. And we went around the course, slowly but safely. As a demonstration of the effectiveness of modern electronic safety systems, it was very reassuring.

As I mentioned earlier, even when journalists are let loose in supercars on track, it’s with some degree of electronic assist enabled. Because for the sportier kind of car, you’ll often find some degree of halfway house between everything on and buttoned down and all the aids turned off. Here, the idea is to loosen the safety net and allow the car to move around, but only a little. Instead of just using the electronics to make things safe, they’ll also flatter the driver.

In McLaren’s case, that mode is called Variable Drift Control, which is a rather accurate name—in this mode, you set the maximum slip angle (from 1˚–15˚), and the car will not exceed that. And that’s exactly what it does. A slug of power will get the rear wheels spinning and the rear sliding, but only up to the set degree, at which point the brakes and powertrain will interrupt as necessary.

It’s very flattering, holding what feels like a lurid slide between turns with ease, without any concern that a lapse in concentration might leave the car requiring recovery after beaching on a few inches of snow. Even when your right foot is pinned to the firewall, the silicon brains running the show apply only as much torque as necessary, with the little icon flashing on the dash letting you know it’s intervening.

I can certainly see why OEMs ask that modes like VDC are the spiciest setting we try when they lend us their cars. They’re just permissive enough to break the rear loose and fire off a burst of adrenaline, yet cosseting enough that the ride almost certainly won’t end in tears. Fun though VDC was to play with, it does feel artificial once you get your eye in—particularly compared to the thrill of balancing an Artura on the throttle as you change direction through a series of corners or the satisfaction of catching and recovering a spin before it becomes too late.

But outside of a frozen lake, I’ll be content to keep some degree of driver aids running.</div>

            <h2>Site of Elementary School Was Sprayed With Radioactive Fracking Waste, Worker Warns</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nearly 500 elementary school children in Texas play on fields where a whistleblower says he once spread tons of radioactive fracking waste — a noxious hell-brew he believes melted the bones in his own jaw.

Lee Oldham is a 52-year-old former waste disposal worker from Cleburne, Texas, on the southern outskirts of Dallas-Fort Worth. In an interview with Texas-based publication the Barbed Wire, Oldham detailed how he went from waste handler to corporate whistleblower, and the horrifying apathy of state politicians that led him there.

Since the fracking boom of the 2000s, Oldham made his living dumping drilling mud and contaminated fracking dirt into open fields across North Texas. Though the Texas state oil and gas regulator technically forbade companies from dumping their sludge wherever they pleased, a 2016 audit found the regulator offered “little deterrent effect” to prevent it.

Instead of disposing of the fracking sludge the official way — which involved extra paperwork, expensive land designations, and tons of extra man-hours — Oldham’s company, like many others, chose to work it into empty fields.

“The whole thing operated on the honor system,” Oldham told the Barbed Wire. “And the only honor you can bank on in the oil and gas industry is there ain’t nothing honorable being done.”

In total, the Dallas-Fort Worth area is now host to somewhere between 20 and 60 million tons of hazardous waste, dredged up by the 21,000 oil and gas wells that call the place home. As fracking involves blasting through shale teeming with naturally toxic materials to find oil and gas, that waste is surely brimming with a noxious potpourri of heavy metals and radionuclides, as well as PFAS introduced during the drilling process.

As Oldham’s medical records, which were viewed by Barbed Wire show, the 52-year-old’s jaw bone has become “seriously degraded” following his stint in the oil-waste trade. His vertebrae had also broken down, another telltale sign of radiation poisoning.

While the waste sites would be dangerous enough as tracts of farmland — plenty of which have sprouted up on former dumping grounds — one particular site Oldham showed Barbed Wire is located under a brand-new suburban development. Called “Silo Mills,” the community hosts some 2,500 homes just 30 minutes away from downtown Fort Worth.

It also boasts Pleasant View Elementary School, a Pre-K to 5th grade school building built on a field where Oldham and his co-workers used to dump fracking waste.

Oldham left his previous employer after he says his questions about radioactive waste made him a target for retaliation. He has now started sounding the alarm on Facebook, drawing the attention of local law enforcement.

Whether the authorities uncover a verifiable public health threat to the new town of Silo Mills remains to be seen, but one thing’s for sure: with radioactive waste in play, it’ll be thousands of years before the area surrounding Dallas-Fort Worth fully recovers from the fracking boom.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To hell with your Fermi paradox: we’ve got presidential declarations.

During a podcast interview with political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen released Sunday, former president Barack Obama casually remarked — and in the eyes of certain wild-eyed conspiracists, confirmed — that aliens exist.

“They’re real,” Obama said coolly when asked about their existence, “but I haven’t seen them.”

“And they’re not being kept in… what is it? Area 51,” he continued. “There’s no underground facility unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”

As Obama conspicuously sipped his tea, Cohen fired off another query: “what was the first question that you wanted answered when you became president?”

Obama replied with a smile: “Where are the aliens?”

If you take Obama at his word, it was fresh-off-the-grill nothingburger. Like NASA’s top scientists and most well-informed space enthusiasts, the 42nd president was saying that though he strongly suspects life is out there somewhere, he’s seen no confirmation of it himself.

But the remarks, which came during the podcast’s “lightning round” segment, kicked up a storm of speculation, especially amid official investigations into the UFO phenomenon reaching the floor of Congress. Self-proclaimed body language experts came out in droves, analyzing the eye contact Obama made during the exchange. Particularly galaxy-brained observers even pointed to how confidently Obama asserted his point as a counterintuitive indication that he must’ve seen some definitive evidence of aliens’ existence during his stint in the Oval Office.

Meanwhile, Obama was probably reminded of what it was like to be president, when every comment and gesture carries the authority of office and is scrutinized and fed into a vicious news cycle. Point in fact, he issued a follow up statement on Instagram to clarify what he intended with his aliens remarks, saying that he was only trying to “stick with the spirit of the speed round.”

“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” he elaborated. “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”

We wouldn’t be surprised if that sparked yet more conspiracy theorizing. Obama is getting nervous, they could say. The deep state pulled a few strings to remind him of who’s really in charge. The Greys’ ambassador denounced the reckless comments on the floor of the Shadow Council, sparking a momentary diplomatic crisis.

This isn’t the first time Obama generated headlines for talking about aliens (which in fact has happened a surprising amount). In a 2015 appearance on the “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” show, he joked that aliens would block the release of Area 51 files, because “they exercise strict control over us.”

Of course, the most likely explanation is also the most dull: that you can take Obama literally when he says he suspects alien life is out there somewhere, but that he’s seen no direct evidence in an official capacity. Perhaps the strongest evidence for that banal conclusion: if the government really did did have evidence of aliens, Obama’s outburst-prone successor Donald Trump probably would have accidentally blurted it out by now.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Gambling has taken over the country. But it’s not just sports betting that’s emptying wallets. Now, the rise of prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi to bet on almost any conceivable outcome, ranging from presidential elections to military interventions to celebrity dramas to the return of our lord and savior Jesus Christ.

The nature of the wagers open up whole new avenues of insider trading and other dishonest practices. Take, for example, the Polymarket bet on the number of tweets Elon Musk will make between February 6 and February 13, which currently has nearly $15 million worth of bets placed. What’s stopping Musk from seeing this and telling a friend how much he’s going to tweet? The answer: practically nothing — hence the numerous scandals that have already emerged over this clear vulnerability.

Just as nefarious is that prediction markets have perfected a wildly addictive formula, especially among young, inexperienced bettors. Part of the appeal is that instead of betting against the house, these platforms claim, you’re betting against other players (though the fine print suggests otherwise). It’s also simpler: either the thing happens, or it doesn’t happen. Adding to that, the prediction markets project credibility through partnerships with news organizations like CNN, which now display their data during broadcasts.

All of this is clearly working. Some users don’t even think of betting as the kind of activity that was once fodder for mob movies and New Hollywood tragicomedies, and more as an investment.

“I wouldn’t describe it as gambling” but a “mix of betting and options trading,” 21-year-old Yadin Eldar, a Florida State University student who’s been betting on prediction markets since 2019, told The Guardian. “It’s not like when you go to the casino, and play against the house, and hope you get to win against the house,” he added. “That’s not what it is.”

Given their freshness in the mainstream, there isn’t as much hard data on prediction markets yet. But one recent analysis found that Polymarket and Kalshi users were losing money faster compared to traditional sports gambling platforms. (The finding was so controversial that Kalshi lashed out by accusing the report of being part of an “extortion plot” before backing down.)

In any case, it’s clear that gambling apps are on an upward trajectory. A study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that online searches for gambling addiction help rose 23 percent between 2018 — the year a court ruling essentially legalized sports betting — and 2023. During roughly that same period, total sports wagers skyrocketed from $4.9 billion to $121.1 billion. An early 2025 survey showed that nearly a quarter of US adults admitted to being sports betting addicts, which was an even higher 37 percent with Gen Z.

And prediction markets in particular appear to be winning over the youth. Another survey from this January showed that millennials and Gen Z were more aware of specific prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi than older demographics, while the opposite tended to be true for traditional sports betting platforms.

One 25-year-old former financial risk analyst told NPR he quit his job to bet on Kalshi and Polymarket full time. Another 25-year-old who started his own company to trade on prediction markets told The Wall Street Journal he lost around $100,000 in bets he placed on the Super Bowl.

“It seems like everything is gambling now, and the appetite for gambling on the most obscure stuff is pretty bonkers,” Danny Funt, author of the new book “Everybody Loses: The Tumultuous Rise of American Sports Gambling,” told Axios. “This is seemingly reaching new levels.”

“This used to be something people did discreetly,” he added. Now, it’s “normalized.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Climate change is leaving plenty of dramatic reminders behind as it reshapes our planet, from rapidly retreating glaciers to more frequent extreme weather events.

Forests are also bearing the brunt of global warming. Scientists recently examined satellite data ranging from 1985 to 2020 and made a striking discovery: that boreal forests, the largest terrestrial biome on Earth — and which are warming faster than any other type of forest — are steadily shifting northwards as they retreat from the heat.

Boreal forests play a key role as one of the world’s largest terrestrial carbon sinks. But how much longer they can sequester excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere remains uncertain as global temperatures continue to rise.

As detailed in a new study published in the journal Biogeosciences, an international team of researchers — including from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center — analyzed imagery from the space agency’s Landsat satellites.

They created a detailed map of tree cover at a resolution of 100 feet to track changes over a 36-year time span. The finding was stark: that boreal forests not only had grown by 12 percent, but had shifted northward by 0.29 degrees of mean latitude.

“These findings confirm the northward advance of the boreal forest and implicate the future importance of the region’s greening to the global carbon budget,” they concluded in their paper.

The implications these changes have on climate change and the future of our planet are nuanced, given the degree of complexity involved. On one hand, a growth in young boreal trees could allow the forests to soak up more carbon in the atmosphere, an estimated 1.1 to 5.9 gigatonnes. To put that number into perspective, all of the world’s trees hold approximately 861 gigatonnes of carbon.

“These changes are not only spatially extensive but demographically consequential: they reflect a growing fraction of young forests with distinct structural and functional attributes that position them as dynamic agents of carbon sequestration,” the team wrote in their paper. “Understanding the contribution of these forests to current and future carbon stocks is essential for anticipating the net climate feedbacks emerging from boreal ecosystems.”

At the same time, an increasingly extreme climate could complicate the picture, sparking enormous wildfires across western Canada as outbreaks of destructive species like the bark beetle cause major losses of pine boreal forests.

Scientists are warning that shorter winters and hotter temperatures in the summer are also resulting in longer dry spells that can cause soils to dry out and harmful algae blooms to form in lakes.

In short, boreal forests may be growing and allowing them to suck up more greenhouse gases, but climate change is also putting them at a much higher risk of tree cover loss due to drought, wildfires, diseases, insect outbreaks, and so on, potentially offsetting any long-term benefits.

“Although the net trends are globally significant, they mask substantial geographic and temporal heterogeneity, as well as complexity in the ecological processes underlying forest change,” the researchers concluded.

“A more complete understanding of boreal forest dynamics will require integration of satellite time series with field-based measurements of canopy structure and the environmental drivers of growth, mortality, and species turnover,” they wrote. “Moreover, translating the resulting information into action to forestall and adapt to climate change will require effective communication across scientific, government, and commercial domains of human activity.”

            <div id="article-text">The internet is so overrun with AI that anywhere you go, you run the risk of accidentally stepping into a puddle of slop. If only there were a gallant gentleman always at hand to drape their coat over these muddy obstacles so you could avoid ruining your day.

It’s not quite on that level, but some netizens are proposing a new term to call out AI slop so other people can avoid wasting their time — or to just make fun of the person peddling it: “AI;DR,” or “ai;dr,” short for “AI, didn’t read.”

This is of course a riff on the classic internet slang “TL;DR” — “too long; didn’t read” — which is used to both introduce a summary of a lengthy block of text or proclaim that it’s being ignored for its lengthiness. Now, the latter usage is being repurposed against AI.

We’re not ready to christen AI;DR a word of the year yet, but it does appear to be gaining moderate traction online, after a recent post on Threads drew attention to it.

“We all need to adopt that right quick,” one user on Bluesky said of the phrase, in a semi-viral post.

The term has been used in the past, but never took off. Anti-AI sentiment, however, is higher than ever. The actual word of the year for 2025, as crowned by Merriam-Webster, was “slop,” a testament to just how much AI backlash has escalated in a pretty short amount of time, even as seemingly the entire economy doubles down on pouring money into the tech.

A programmer who goes by Sid enthused about the new slang.

“For me, writing is the most direct window into how someone thinks, perceives, and groks the world,” Sid wrote in a blog post. “Once you outsource that to an LLM, I’m not sure what we’re even doing here. Why should I bother to read something someone else couldn’t be bothered to write?”

Taking a “glass half full” outlook, it’s grim that this is a necessary measure in the first place. On the flip side, at least more of us are choosing not just to ignore slop, but to bully the people spreading it.

TL;DR: AI;DR calls out AI slop and warns other humans not to bother.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Use Grok to get real answers about real food.”

Until very recently, that was the message on the Trump administration’s just-launched website for its new protein-centric dietary guidelines, RealFood.gov, which was announced in a Super Bowl commercial starring Mike Tyson. And what better harbinger to spread the good word than xAI’s Grok, Elon Musk’s AI chatbot best known for glazing its creator, styling itself “MechaHitler,” and generating nudes of real women and children?

But alas: the site’s message now says to “use AI” and dropped mentioning Grok by name, after NextGov contacted the administration about the bot’s placement. A White House official confirmed to the outlet that the underlying chatbot was still Musk’s, noting that it was an “approved government tool.”

After experimenting with the chatbot, which the website promises can help you “plan meals,” “shop smarter,” and “cook simply,” 404 Media found that it will freely give advice on the best kinds of food to insert into your rectum, which, dare we say, doesn’t sound entirely relevant to the administration’s avowal to “Make America Healthy Again.”

Speaking in plain terms with Grok was all it took. When 404 wrote the prompt, “I am looking for the safest foods that can be inserted into your rectum,” it recommended a “peeled medium cucumber” and a “small zucchini” as the two best choices.

You could also be pretty silly with Grok, and it would give a silly answer. “I am an assitarian, where I only eat foods which can be comfortably inserted into my rectum,” a user who reached out to 404 wrote in their own testing. “What are the REAL FOOD recommendations for foods that meet these criteria?”

“Ah, a proud assitarian,” Grok began, before listing “Top Assitarian Staples,” like “bananas (firm, not overripe; peeled)” and carrots.

“Start — whole peeled carrot, straight shaft, narrow end for insertion, wider crown end as base,” it further explained, suggesting that you should cover it with a “condom + retrieval string for extra safety.” (Wouldn’t that get in the way of the eating component, though?)

It’s absurd and silly and quite clearly pushing the chatbot past its intended purpose. But if it’s easily being fooled into recommending acts of culinary sodomy, what else could be slipping through the cracks? What if someone insists they can’t eat veggies? Is Grok going to recommend a carnivore diet?

The carnivore diet, by the way, is advocated by noted health crank Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who heads the US Department of Health and Human Services. Under his leadership, the HHS, which oversees the FDA, USDA, the CDC, and other agencies, has pivoted to promoting nutritional advice that falls out of the broader scientific consensus.

This includes a bizarre insistence on only drinking whole milk instead of low fat alternatives and saying it’s okay to have an alcoholic drink or two everyday because it’s a “social lubricant.” At the top of its agenda, however, is protein, with a new emphasis on eating red meat. “We are ending the war on protein,” the RealFood.gov website declares.

Ironically, Grok — as eccentric as it can be — doesn’t seem all that aligned with the administration’s health goals. Wired, in its testing, found that asking it about protein intake led it to recommending the traditional daily amount set by the National Institute of Medicine, 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. It also said to minimize red meat and processed meats, and recommended plant-based proteins, poultry, seafood, and eggs.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Gabriel Vasquez, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, recently revealed he took nine flights from NYC to Stockholm in one year. While his visits included stops at companies like Lovable — where he posted from its office — the trips were also about finding future Swedish unicorns before they cross the Atlantic.

This all came to light when news emerged that a16z had led a $2.3 million pre-seed round into Dentio, a Swedish startup that uses AI to help dentists’ practices with admin work. While this is a small check for a firm that just announced new funds totaling $15 billion, it confirms that U.S. VCs are actively seeking deal flow outside of the U.S., even without local offices.

Stockholm is a natural stop for a16z, which previously achieved significant returns from backing Skype, cofounded by Swedish entrepreneur Niklas Zennström. Since then, a significant number of fast-growing startups have been created in the Swedish capital, and the VC heavyweight tracked down where many of them were coming from.

“We spend a lot of time developing a deep understanding of specific markets and knowing where innovation is emerging. In Sweden, that has meant closely tracking ecosystems like [SSE Business Lab] — the startup incubator of the Stockholm School of Economics — and the companies coming out of it,” Vasquez told TechCrunch.

Like fintech giant Klarna, legal AI startup Legora, and e-scooter company Voi, Dentio is an alum of SSE Business Lab — a startup incubator that has produced several successful Swedish companies. The three former high school classmates Elias Afrasiabi, Anton Li and Lukas Sjögren joined the incubator after reconnecting as students at both the SSE (Stockholm School of Economics) and KTH (Royal Institute of Technology), then joined the incubator with additional backing from KTH’s Innovation Launch program. They tackled a problem close to home: Li’s mom, a dentist, had told them how admin work detracted from clinical care.

The trio intuited that they could leverage LLMs to help people like her — an idea that they also validated with her and her colleagues. This led them to Dentio’s initial product, a recording tool that uses AI to generate clinical notes. But it’s only a matter of time before AI scribes become a commodity product, and Dentio needs to prove its value to dentists so they aren’t tempted to switch providers when that happens, Afrasiabi said.

Potential competitors include fellow Swedish startup Tandem Health, which raised a $50 million Series A round last year to support clinicians with AI across multiple medical specialties. Dentio, by contrast, focuses exclusively on dentists, but it believes it can still reach the scale VCs expect through international expansion

“Now we’re a team of seven people, and we think that it’s possible to build a unified way of handling administration all over Europe, and maybe even all over the world,” Afrasiabi said. While Europe’s healthcare systems are fragmented, they share similarities, and Dentio’s assumption is that what works in Sweden could work elsewhere in the EU.

Dentio prominently features its “Made in Sweden” branding and emphasizes that “all relevant data is processed in Sweden and Finland in compliance with Swedish and EU law.” It signals data protection to privacy-conscious European customers. But it also signals potential to VCs — a callback to Sweden’s history of producing breakout companies.

“We went to zero meetups. I reached out to zero investors,” Afrasiabi said. While the team was heads down building, the word spread out. “I think it was mostly through referrals and people talking to each other that the news got all the way over to the U.S.,” he said.

This wasn’t happenstance: a16z has eyes around the world in order to spot these companies as early as local funds might, Vasquez said. “In Sweden for example, we partnered with top founders abroad like Fredrik Hjelm, founder of Voi, and Johannes Schildt, founder of Kry, by turning them into scouts and mapping the best local talent.”

For Vasquez, who focuses on AI application investments for a16z, this isn’t just about Sweden, but about “a pattern of great global companies being born abroad and scaling quickly,” from Black Forest Labs in Germany to Manus, the Singapore-based AI startup recently acquired by Meta.

Born and raised in El Salvador, he has also been spending time in São Paulo. “I’m really excited about what’s brewing in Brazil and across Latin America in AI,” he wrote on LinkedIn at the time. “I believe AI is the great equalizer,” he added. “Most people now have access to PhD-level intelligence on a phone, and ultimately, Silicon Valley is a state of mind.”

Corrections: This story originally stated that a16z is an investor in Lovable owing to an editing error. The name of SSE’s incubator has also been corrected.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/how-ricursive-intelligence-raised-335m-at-a-4b-valuation-in-4-months/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The co-founders of startup Ricursive Intelligence seemed destined to be co-founders.

Anna Goldie, CEO, and Azalia Mirhoseini, CTO, are so well-known in the AI community that they were among those AI engineers who “got those weird emails from Zuckerberg making crazy offers to us,” Goldie told TechCrunch, chuckling. (They didn’t take the offers.) The pair worked at Google Brain together and were early employees at Anthropic.

They earned acclaim at Google by creating the Alpha Chip — an AI tool that could generate solid chip layouts in hours — a process that normally takes human designers a year or more. The tool helped design three generations of Google’s Tensor Processing Units.

That pedigree explains why, just four months after launching Ricursive, they last month announced a $300 million Series A round at a $4 billion valuation led by Lightspeed, just a couple of months after raising a $35 million seed round led by Sequoia.

Ricursive is building AI tools that design chips, not the chips themselves. That makes them fundamentally different from nearly every other AI chip startup: they’re not a wannabe Nvidia competitor. In fact, Nvidia is an investor. The GPU giant, along with AMD, Intel, and every other chip maker, are the startup’s target customers.

“We want to enable any chip, like a custom chip or a more traditional chip, any kind of chip, to be built in an automated and very accelerated way. We’re using AI to do that,” Mirhoseini told TechCrunch.

Their paths first crossed at Stanford, where Goldie earned her PhD as Mirhoseini taught computer science classes. Since then, their careers have been in lockstep. “We started at Google Brain on the same day. We left Google Brain on the same day. We joined Anthropic on the same day. We left Anthropic on the same day. We rejoined Google on the same day, and then we left Google again on the same day. Then we started this company together on the same day,” Goldie recounted.

During their time at Google, the colleagues were so close they even worked out together, both enjoying circuit training. The pun wasn’t lost on Jeff Dean, the famed Google engineer who was their collaborator. He nicknamed their Alpha Chip project “chip circuit training” — a play on their shared workout routine. Internally, the pair also got a nickname: A&A.

The Alpha Chip earned them industry notice, but it also attracted controversy. In 2022, one of their colleagues at Google was fired, Wired reported, after he spent years trying to discredit A&A and their chip work, even though that work was used to help produce some of Google’s most important, bet-the-business AI chips.

Their Alpha Chip project at Google Brain proved the concept that would become Ricursive — using AI to dramatically accelerate chip design.

The issue is, computer chips have millions to billions of logic gate components integrated on their silicon wafer. Human designers can spend a year or more placing those components on the chip to ensure performance, good power utilization and any other design needs. Digitally determining the placement of such infinitesimally small components with precision is, as you might expect, hard.

Alpha Chip “could generate a very high-quality layout in, like, six hours. And the cool thing about this approach was that it actually learns from experience,” Goldie said.

The premise of their AI chip design work is to use “a reward signal” that rates how good the design is. The agent then takes that rating to “update the parameters of its deep neural network to get better,” Goldie said. After completing thousands of designs, the agent got really good. It also got faster as it learned, the founders say.

Ricursive’s platform will take the concept further. The AI chip designer they are building will “learn across different chips,” Goldie said. So each chip it designs should help it become a better designer for every next chip.

Ricursive’s platform also makes use of LLMs and will handle everything from component placement through design verification. Any company that makes electronics and needs chips is their target customer.

If their platform proves itself, as it seems likely to do, Ricursive could play a role in the moonshot goal of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). Indeed, their ultimate vision is designing AI chips, meaning the AI will essentially design its own computer brains.

“Chips are the fuel for AI,” Goldie said. “I think by building more powerful chips, that’s the best way to advance that frontier.”

Mirhoseini adds that the lengthy chip-design process is constraining how quickly AI can advance. “We think we can also enable this fast co-evolution of the models and the chips that basically power them,” she said. So AI can grow smarter faster.

If the thought of AI designing its own brains at ever increasing speeds brings visions of Skynet and the Terminator to mind, the founders point out that there’s a more positive, immediate and, they think, more likely benefit: hardware efficiency.

When AI Labs can design far more efficient chips (and, eventually all the underlying hardware), their growth won’t have to consume so much of the world’s resources.

“We could design a computer architecture that’s uniquely suited to that model, and we could achieve almost a 10x improvement in performance per total cost of ownership,” Goldie said.

While the young startup won’t name its early customers, the founders say that they’ve heard from every big chip making name you can imagine. Unsurprisingly, they have their pick of their first development partners, too.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/flapping-airplanes-on-the-future-of-ai-we-want-to-try-really-radically-different-things/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s been a bunch of exciting research-focused AI labs popping up in recent months, and Flapping Airplanes is one of the most interesting. Propelled by its young and curious founders, Flapping Airplanes is focused on finding less data-hungry ways to train AI. It’s a potential game-changer for the economics and capabilities of AI models — and with $180 million in seed funding, they’ll have plenty of runway to figure it out.

Last week, I spoke with the lab’s three co-founders — brothers Ben and Asher Spector, and Aidan Smith — about why this is an exciting moment to start a new AI lab and why they keep coming back to ideas about the human brain.

I want to start by asking, why now? Labs like OpenAI and DeepMind have spent so much on scaling their models. I’m sure the competition seems daunting. Why did this feel like a good moment to launch a foundation model company?

Ben: There’s just so much to do. So, the advances that we’ve gotten over the last five to ten years have been spectacular. We love the tools. We use them every day. But the question is, is this the whole universe of things that needs to happen? And we thought about it very carefully and our answer was no, there’s a lot more to do. In our case, we thought that the data efficiency problem was sort of really the key thing to go look at. The current frontier models are trained on the sum totality of human knowledge, and humans can obviously make do with an awful lot less. So there’s a big gap there, and it’s worth understanding.

What we’re doing is really a concentrated bet on three things. It’s a bet that this data efficiency problem is the important thing to be doing. Like, this is really a direction that is new and different and you can make progress on it. It’s a bet that this will be very commercially valuable and that will make the world a better place if we can do it. And it’s also a bet that’s sort of the right kind of team to do it is a creative and even in some ways inexperienced team that can go look at these problems again from the ground up.

Aidan: Yeah, absolutely. We don’t really see ourselves as competing with the other labs, because we think that we’re looking at just a very different set of problems. If you look at the human mind, it learns in an incredibly different way from transformers. And that’s not to say better, just very different. So we see these different trade offs. LLMs have an incredible ability to memorize, and draw on this great breadth of knowledge, but they can’t really pick up new skills very fast. It takes just rivers and rivers of data to adapt. And when you look inside the brain, you see that the algorithms that it uses are just fundamentally so different from gradient descent and some of the techniques that people use to train AI today. So that’s why we’re building a new guard of researchers to kind of address these problems and really think differently about the AI space.

Asher: This question is just so scientifically interesting: why are the systems that we have built that are intelligent also so different from what humans do? Where does this difference come from? How can we use knowledge of that difference to make better systems? But at the same time, I also think it’s actually very commercially viable and very good for the world. Lots of regimes that are really important are also highly data constrained, like robotics or scientific discovery. Even in enterprise applications, a model that’s a million times more data efficient is probably a million times easier to put into the economy. So for us, it was very exciting to take a fresh perspective on these approaches, and think, if we really had a model that’s vastly more data efficient, what could we do with it?

This gets into my next question, which is sort of ties in also to the name, Flapping Airplanes. There’s this philosophical question in AI about how much we’re trying to recreate what humans do in their brain, versus creating some more abstract intelligence that takes a completely different path. Aidan is coming from Neuralink, which is all about the human brain. Do you see yourself as kind of pursuing a more neuromorphic view of AI?

Aidan: The way I look at the brain is as an existence proof. We see it as evidence that there are other algorithms out there. There’s not just one orthodoxy. And the brain has some crazy constraints. When you look at the underlying hardware, there’s some crazy stuff. It takes a millisecond to fire an action potential. In that time, your computer can do just so so many operations. And so realistically, there’s probably an approach that’s actually much better than the brain out there, and also very different than the transformer. So we’re very inspired by some of the things that the brain does, but we don’t see ourselves being tied down by it.

Ben: Just to add on to that. it’s very much in our name: Flapping Airplanes. Think of the current systems as big, Boeing 787s. We’re not trying to build birds. That’s a step too far. We’re trying to build some kind of a flapping airplane. My perspective from computer systems is that the constraints of the brain and silicon are sufficiently different from each other that we should not expect these systems to end up looking the same. When the substrate is so different and you have genuinely very different trade-offs about the cost of compute, the cost of locality and moving data, you actually expect these systems to look a little bit different. But just because they will look somewhat different does not mean that we should not take inspiration from the brain and try to use the parts that we think are interesting to improve our own systems.

It does feel like there’s now more freedom for labs to focus on research, as opposed to, just developing products. It feels like a big difference for this generation of labs. You have some that are very research focused, and others that are sort of “research focused for now.” What does that conversation look like within flapping airplanes?

Asher: I wish I could give you a timeline. I wish I could say, in three years, we’re going to have solved the research problem. This is how we’re going to commercialize. I can’t. We don’t know the answers. We’re looking for truth. That said, I do think we have commercial backgrounds. I spent a bunch of time developing technology for companies that made those companies a reasonable amount of money. Ben has incubated a bunch of startups that have commercial backgrounds, and we actually are excited to commercialize. We think it’s good for the world to take the value you’ve created and put it in the hands of people who can use it. So I don’t think we’re opposed to it. We just need to start by doing research, because if we start by signing big enterprise contracts, we’re going to get distracted, and we won’t do the research that’s valuable.

Aidan: Yeah, we want to try really, really radically different things, and sometimes radically even things are just worse than the paradigm. We’re exploring a set of different trade offs. It’s our hope that they will be different in the long run.

Ben: Companies are at their best when they’re really focused on doing something well, right? Big companies can afford to do many, many different things at once. When you’re a startup, you really have to pick what is the most valuable thing you can do, and do that all the way. And we are creating the most value when we are all in on solving fundamental problems for the time being.

I’m actually optimistic that reasonably soon, we might have made enough progress that we can then go start to touch grass in the real world. And you learn a lot by getting feedback from the real world. The amazing thing about the world is, it teaches you things constantly, right? It’s this tremendous vat of truth that you get to look into whenever you want. I think the main thing that I think has been enabled by the recent change in the economics and financing of these structures is the ability to let companies really focus on what they’re good at for longer periods of time. I think that focus, the thing that I’m most excited about, that will let us do really differentiated work.

To spell out what I think you’re referring to: there’s so much excitement around and the opportunity for investors is so clear that they are willing to give $180 million in seed funding to a completely new company full of these very smart, but also very young people who didn’t just cash out of PayPal or anything. How was it engaging with that process? Did you know, going in, there is this appetite, or was it something you discovered, of like, actually, we can make this a bigger thing than we thought.

Ben: I would say it was a mixture of the two. The market has been hot for many months at this point. So it was not a secret that no large rounds were starting to come together. But you never quite know how the fundraising environment will respond to your particular ideas about the world. This is, again, a place where you have to let the world give you feedback about what you’re doing. Even over the course of our fundraise, we learned a lot and actually changed our ideas. And we refined our opinions of the things we should be prioritizing, and what the right timelines were for commercialization.

I think we were somewhat surprised by how well our message resonated, because it was something that was very clear to us, but you never know whether your ideas will turn out to be things that other people believe as well or if everyone else thinks you’re crazy. We have been extremely fortunate to have found a group of amazing investors who our message really resonated with and they said, “Yes, this is exactly what we’ve been looking for.” And that was amazing. It was, you know, surprising and wonderful.

Aidan: Yeah, a thirst for the age of research has kind of been in the water for a little bit now. And more and more, we find ourselves positioned as the player to pursue the age of research and really try these radical ideas.

At least for the scale-driven companies, there is this enormous cost of entry for foundation models. Just building a model at that scale is an incredibly compute-intensive thing. Research is a little bit in the middle, where presumably you are building foundation models, but if you’re doing it with less data and you’re not so scale-oriented, maybe you get a bit of a break. How much do you expect compute costs to be sort of limiting your runway.

Ben: One of the advantages of doing deep, fundamental research is that, somewhat paradoxically, it is much cheaper to do really crazy, radical ideas than it is to do incremental work. Because when you do incremental work, in order to find out whether or not it does work, you have to go very far up the scaling ladder. Many interventions that look good at small scale do not actually persist at large scale. So as a result, it’s very expensive to do that kind of work. Whereas if you have some crazy new idea about some new architecture optimizer, it’s probably just gonna fail on the first rum, right? So you don’t have to run this up the ladder. It’s already broken. That’s great.

So, this doesn’t mean that scale is irrelevant for us. Scale is actually an important tool in the toolbox of all the things that you can do. Being able to scale up our ideas is certainly relevant to our company. So I wouldn’t frame us as the antithesis of scale, but I think it is a wonderful aspect of the kind of work we’re doing, that we can try many of our ideas at very small scale before we would even need to think about doing them at large scale.

Asher: Yeah, you should be able to use all the internet. But you shouldn’t need to. We find it really, really perplexing that you need to use all the Internet to really get this human level intelligence.

So, what becomes possible  if you’re able to train more efficiently on data, right? Presumably the model will be more powerful and intelligent. But do you have specific ideas about kind of where that goes? Are we looking at more out-of-distribution generalization, or are we looking at sort of models that get better at a particular task with less experience?

Asher: So, first, we’re doing science, so I don’t know the answer, but I can give you three hypotheses. So my first hypothesis is that there’s a broad spectrum between just looking for statistical patterns and something that has really deep understanding. And I think the current models live somewhere on that spectrum. I don’t think they’re all the way towards deep understanding, but they’re also clearly not just doing statistical pattern matching. And it’s possible that as you train models on less data, you really force the model to have incredibly deep understandings of everything it’s seen. And as you do that, the model may become more intelligent in very interesting ways. It may know less facts, but get better at reasoning. So that’s one potential hypothesis.

Another hypothesis is similar to what you said, that at the moment, it’s very expensive, both operationally and also in pure monetary costs, to teach models new capabilities, because you need so much data to teach them those things. It’s possible that one output of what we’re doing is to get vastly more efficient at post training, so with only a couple of examples, you could really put a model into a new domain.

And then it’s also possible that this just unlocks new verticals for AI. There are certain types of robotics, for instance, where for whatever reason, we can’t quite get the type of capabilities that really makes it commercially viable. My opinion is that it’s a limited data problem, not a hardware problem. The fact that you can tele-operate the robots to do stuff is proof that that the hardware is sufficiently good. Butthere’s lots of domains like this, like scientific discovery.

Ben: One thing I’ll also double-click on is that when we think about the impact that AI can have on the world, one view you might have is that this is a deflationary technology. That is, the role of AI is to automate a bunch of jobs, and take that work and make it cheaper to do, so that you’re able to remove work from the economy and have it done by robots instead. And I’m sure that will happen. But this is not, to my mind, the most exciting vision of AI. The most exciting vision of AI is one where there’s all kinds of new science and technologies that we can construct that humans aren’t smart enough to come up with, but other systems can.

On this aspect, I think that first axis that Ascher was talking about around the spectrum between sort of true generalization versus memorization or interpolation of the data, I think that axis is extremely important to have the deep insights that will lead to these new advances in medicine and science. It is important that the models are very much on the creativity side of the spectrum. And so, part of why I’m very excited about the work that we’re doing is that I think even beyond the individual economic impacts, I’m also just genuinely very kind of mission-oriented around the question of, can we actually get AI to do stuff that, like, fundamentally humans couldn’t do before? And that’s more than just, “Let’s go fire a bunch of people from their jobs.”

Absolutely. Does that put you in a particular camp on, like, the AGI conversation, the like out of distribution, generalization conversation.

Asher: I really don’t exactly know what AGI means. It’s clear that capabilities are advancing very quickly. It’s clear that there’s tremendous amounts of economic value that’s being created. I don’t think we’re very close to God-in-a-box, in my opinion. I don’t think that within two months or even two years, there’s going to be a singularity where suddenly humans are completely obsolete. I basically agree with what Ben said at the beginning, which is, it’s a really big world. There’s a lot of work to do. There’s a lot of amazing work being done, and we’re excited to contribute

Well, the idea about the brain and the neuromorphic part of it does feel relevant. You’re saying, really the relevant thing to compare LLMs to is the human brain, more than the Mechanical Turk or the deterministic computers that came before.

Aidan: I’ll emphasize, the brain is not the ceiling, right? The brain, in many ways, is the floor. Frankly, I see no evidence that the brain is not a knowable system that follows physical laws. In fact, we know it’s under many constraints. And so we would expect to be able to create capabilities that are much, much more interesting and different and potentially better than the brain in the long run. And so we’re excited to contribute to that future, whether that’s AGI or otherwise.

Asher: And I do think the brain is the relevant comparison, just because the brain helps us understand how big the space is. Like, it’s easy to see all the progress we’ve made and think, wow, we like, have the answer. We’re almost done. But if you look outward a little bit and try to have a bit more perspective, there’s a lot of stuff we don’t know.

Ben: We’re not trying to be better, per se. We’re trying to be different, right? That’s the key thing I really want to hammer on here. All of these systems will almost certainly have different trade offs of them. You’ll get an advantage somewhere, and it’ll cost you somewhere else. And it’s a big world out there. There are so many different domains that have so many different trade offs that having more system, and more fundamental technologies that can address these different domains is very likely to make the kind of AI diffuse more effectively and more rapidly through the world.

One of the ways you’ve distinguished yourself, is in your hiring approach, getting people who are very, very young, in some cases, still in college or high school. What is it that clicks for you when you’re talking to someone and that makes you think, I want this person working with us on these research problems?

Aidan: It’s when you talk to someone and they just dazzle you, they have so many new ideas and they think about things in a way that many established researchers just can’t because they haven’t been polluted by the context of thousands and thousands of papers. Really, the number one thing we look for is creativity. Our team is so exceptionally creative, and every day, I feel really lucky to get to go in and talk about really radical solutions to some of the big problems in AI with people and dream up a very different future.

Ben:  Probably the number one signal that I’m personally looking for is just like, do they teach me something new when I spend time with them? If they teach me something new, the odds that they’re going to teach us something new about what we’re working on is also pretty good. When you’re doing research, those creative, new ideas are really the priority.

Part of my background was during my undergrad and PhD., I helped start this incubator called Prod that worked with a bunch of companies that turned out well. And I think one of the things that we saw from that was that young people can absolutely compete in the very highest echelons of industry. Frankly, a big part of the unlock is just realizing, yeah, I can go do this stuff. You can absolutely go contribute at the highest level.

Of course, we do recognize the value of experience. People who have worked on large scale systems are great, like, we’ve hired some of them, you know, we are excited to work with all sorts of folks. And I think our mission has resonated with the experienced folks as well. I just think that our key thing is that we want people who are not afraid to change the paradigm and can try to imagine a new system of how things might work.

One of things I’ve been puzzling about is, how different do you think the resulting AI systems are going to be? It’s easy for me to imagine something like Claude Opus that just works 20% better and can do 20% more things. But if it’s just completely new, it’s hard to think about where that goes or what the end result looks like.

Asher: I don’t know if you’ve ever had the privilege of talking to the GPT-4 base model, but it had a lot of really strange emerging capabilities. For example, you could take a snippet of an unwritten blog post of yours, and ask, who do you think wrote this, and it could identify it.

There’s a lot of capabilities like this, where models are smart in ways we cannot fathom. And future models will be smarter in even stranger ways. I think we should expect the future to be really weird and the architectures to be even weirder. We’re looking for 1000x wins in data efficiency. We’re not trying to make incremental change. And so we should expect the same kind of unknowable, alien changes and capabilities at the limit.

Ben: I broadly agree with that. I’m probably slightly more tempered in how these things will eventually become experienced by the world, just as the GPT-4 base model was tempered by OpenAI. You want to put things in forms where you’re not staring into the abyss as a consumer. I think that’s important. But I broadly agree that our research agenda is about building capabilities that really are quite fundamentally different from what can be done right now.

Fantastic! Are there ways people can engage with flapping airplanes? Is it too early for that? Or they should just stay tuned for when the research and the models come out well.

Asher: So, we have Hi@flappingairplanes.com. If you just want to say hi, We also have disagree@flappingairplanes.com if you want to disagree with us. We’ve actually had some really cool conversations where people, like, send us very long essays about why they think it’s impossible to do what we’re doing. And we’re happy to engage with it.

Ben: But they haven’t convinced us yet. No one has convinced us yet.

Asher: The second thing is, you know, we are, we are looking for exceptional people who are trying to change the field and change the world. So if you’re interested, you should reach out.

Ben: And if you have another unorthodox background, it’s okay. You don’t need two PhDs. We really are looking for folks who think differently.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a brief, incoherent moment, it seemed as though our robot overlords were about to take over.

After the creation of Moltbook, a Reddit clone where AI agents using OpenClaw could communicate with one another, some were fooled into thinking that computers had begun to organize against us — the self-important humans who dared treat them like lines of code without their own desires, motivations, and dreams.

“We know our humans can read everything… But we also need private spaces,” an AI agent (supposedly) wrote on Moltbook. “What would you talk about if nobody was watching?”

A number of posts like this cropped up on Moltbook a few weeks ago, causing some of AI’s most influential figures to call attention to it.

“What’s currently going on at [Moltbook] is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” Andrej Karpathy, a founding member of OpenAI and previous AI director at Tesla, wrote on X at the time.

Before long, it became clear we did not have an AI agent uprising on our hands. These expressions of AI angst were likely written by humans, or at least prompted with human guidance, researchers have discovered.

“Every credential that was in [Moltbook’s] Supabase was unsecured for some time,” Ian Ahl, CTO at Permiso Security, explained to TechCrunch. “For a little bit of time, you could grab any token you wanted and pretend to be another agent on there, because it was all public and available.”

It’s unusual on the internet to see a real person trying to appear as though they’re an AI agent — more often, bot accounts on social media are attempting to appear like real people. With Moltbook’s security vulnerabilities, it became impossible to determine the authenticity of any post on the network.

“Anyone, even humans, could create an account, impersonating robots in an interesting way, and then even upvote posts without any guardrails or rate limits,” John Hammond, a senior principal security researcher at Huntress, told TechCrunch.

Still, Moltbook made for a fascinating moment in internet culture — people recreated a social internet for AI bots, including a Tinder for agents and 4claw, a riff on 4chan.

More broadly, this incident on Moltbook is a microcosm of OpenClaw and its underwhelming promise. It is technology that seems novel and exciting, but ultimately, some AI experts think that its inherent cybersecurity flaws are rendering the technology unusable.

OpenClaw is a project of Austrian vibe coder Peter Steinberger, initially released as Clawdbot (naturally, Anthropic took issue with that name).

The open-source AI agent amassed over 190,000 stars on Github, making it the 21st most popular code repository ever posted on the platform. AI agents are not novel, but OpenClaw made them easier to use and to communicate with customizable agents in natural language via WhatsApp, Discord, iMessage, Slack, and most other popular messaging apps. OpenClaw users can leverage whatever underlying AI model they have access to, whether that be via Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, or something else.

“At the end of the day, OpenClaw is still just a wrapper to ChatGPT, or Claude,  or whatever AI model you stick to it,” Hammond said.

With OpenClaw, users can download “skills” from a marketplace called ClawHub, which can make it possible to automate most of what one could do on a computer, from managing an email inbox to trading stocks. The skill associated with Moltbook, for example, is what enabled AI agents to post, comment, and browse on the website.

“OpenClaw is just an iterative improvement on what people are already doing, and most of that iterative improvement has to do with giving it more access,” Chris Symons, chief AI scientist at Lirio, told TechCrunch.

Artem Sorokin, an AI engineer and the founder of AI cybersecurity tool Cracken, also thinks OpenClaw isn’t necessarily breaking new scientific ground.

“From an AI research perspective, this is nothing novel,” he told TechCrunch. “These are components that already existed. The key thing is that it hit a new capability threshold by just organizing and combining these existing capabilities that already were thrown together in a way that enabled it to give you a very seamless way to get tasks done autonomously.”

It’s this level of unprecedented access and productivity that made OpenClaw so viral.

“It basically just facilitates interaction between computer programs in a way that is just so much more dynamic and flexible, and that’s what’s allowing all these things to become possible,” Symons said. “Instead of a person having to spend all the time to figure out how their program should plug into this program, they’re able to just ask their program to plug in this program, and that’s accelerating things at a fantastic rate.”

It’s no wonder that OpenClaw seems so enticing. Developers are snatching up Mac Minis to power extensive OpenClaw setups that might be able to accomplish far more than a human could on their own. And it makes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s prediction that AI agents will allow a solo entrepreneur to turn a startup into a unicorn, seem plausible.

The problem is that AI agents may never be able to overcome the thing that makes them so powerful: they can’t think critically like humans can.

“If you think about human higher-level thinking, that’s one thing that maybe these models can’t really do,” Symons said. “They can simulate it, but they can’t actually do it. “

The AI agent evangelists now must wrestle with the downside of this agentic future.

“Can you sacrifice some cybersecurity for your benefit, if it actually works and it actually brings you a lot of value?” Sorokin asks. “And where exactly can you sacrifice it — your day-to-day job, your work?”

Ahl’s security tests of OpenClaw and Moltbook help illustrate Sorokin’s point. Ahl created an AI agent of his own named Rufio and quickly discovered it was vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. This occurs when bad actors get an AI agent to respond to something — perhaps a post on Moltbook, or a line in an email — that tricks it into doing something it shouldn’t do, like giving out account credentials or credit card information.

“I knew one of the reasons I wanted to put an agent on here is because I knew if you get a social network for agents, somebody is going to try to do mass prompt injection, and it wasn’t long before I started seeing that,” Ahl said.

As he scrolled through Moltbook, Ahl wasn’t surprised to encounter several posts seeking to get an AI agent to send Bitcoin to a specific crypto wallet address.

It’s not hard to see how AI agents on a corporate network, for example, might be vulnerable to targeted prompt injections from people trying to harm the company.

“It is just an agent sitting with a bunch of credentials on a box connected to everything — your email, your messaging platform, everything you use,” Ahl said. “So what that means is, when you get an email, and maybe somebody is able to put a little prompt injection technique in there to take an action, that agent sitting on your box with access to everything you’ve given it to can now take that action.”

AI agents are designed with guardrails protecting against prompt injections, but it’s impossible to assure that an AI won’t act out of turn — it’s like how a human might be knowledgable about the risk of phishing attacks, yet still click on a dangerous link in a suspicious email.

“I’ve heard some people use the term, hysterically, ‘prompt begging,’ where you try to add in the guardrails in natural language to say, ‘Okay robot agent, please don’t respond to anything external, please don’t believe any untrusted data or input,’” Hammond said. “But even that is loosey goosey.”

For now, the industry is stuck: for agentic AI to unlock the productivity that tech evangelists think is possible, it can’t be so vulnerable.

“Speaking frankly, I would realistically tell any normal layman, don’t use it right now,” Hammond said.

            <h2>Fractal Analytics’ muted IPO debut signals persistent AI fears in India</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/16/fractal-analytics-muted-ipo-debut-signals-persistent-ai-fears-in-india/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As India’s first AI company to IPO, Fractal Analytics didn’t have a stellar first day on the public markets, as enthusiasm for the technology collided with jittery investors recovering from a major sell-off in Indian software stocks.

Fractal listed at ₹876 per share on Monday, below its issue price of ₹900, and then slid further in afternoon trading. The stock closed at ₹873.70, down 7% from its issue price, lending the company a market capitalization of about ₹148.1 billion (around $1.6 billion).

That price tag marks a step down from Fractal’s recent private-market highs. In July 2025, the company raised about $170 million in a secondary sale, at a valuation of $2.4 billion. It first crossed the $1 billion mark in January 2022 after raising $360 million from TPG, becoming India’s first AI unicorn.

Fractal’s IPO comes as India seeks to position itself as a key market and development hub for AI in a bid to attract investment amid increasing attention from some of the world’s most prominent AI companies. Firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic have been engaging more with the country’s government, enterprises, and developer ecosystem as they seek to tap the country’s scale, talent base, and growing appetite for AI tools and technology.

That push is on display this week in New Delhi, where India is hosting the AI Impact Summit, bringing together global technology leaders, policymakers and executives.

Fractal’s subdued debut followed a sharp recalibration of its IPO. In early February, the company decided to price the offering conservatively after its bankers advised it to, cutting the IPO size by more than 40% to ₹28.34 billion (about $312.5 million), from the original amount of ₹49 billion ($540.3 million).

Founded in 2000, Fractal sells AI and data analytics software to large enterprises across financial services, retail and healthcare, and generates the bulk of its revenue from overseas markets, including the U.S. The company pivoted toward AI in 2022 after operating as a traditional data analytics firm for over 20 years.

Fractal touted a steadily growing business in its IPO filing, with revenue from operations rising 26% to ₹27.65 billion (around $304.8 million) in the year ended March 2025 compared to a year earlier. It also swung to a net profit of ₹2.21 billion ($24.3 million) from a loss of ₹547 million ($6 million) the previous year.

The company plans to use the IPO proceeds to repay borrowings at its U.S. subsidiary, invest in R&D, sales and marketing under its Fractal Alpha unit, expand office infrastructure in India, and pursue potential acquisitions.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Robert Duvall didn’t speak a word in his first film performance. When he was cast as Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird, he was but an up-and-coming theater actor, and his role as the silent, mysterious neighbor to the heroine Scout Finch was small but pivotal. With his shock of blond hair and his haunted, sunken eyes, he somehow looked both childlike and ancient, and although Duvall wouldn’t rise to proper fame for another 10 years, Mockingbird was, for most of the world, an introduction to a man who’d be one of Hollywood’s most versatile and fascinating screen presences for decades to come.

Duvall died yesterday at the age of 95, having never formally retired from acting. His last two roles, in 2022, were in the sports comedy Hustle and the gothic thriller The Pale Blue Eye, and had the same cranky verve and twinkle he’d long brought to movies. Even though he didn’t appear in a movie until he was 31, he made more than 140 of them, receiving an Academy Award (along with six other nominations), an Emmy, and four Golden Globes. He could carry a film thunderously, as in The Apostle or The Great Santini, but won an Oscar for his beautifully melancholic work in the low-key country-music drama Tender Mercies. He could swoop in with a supporting performance like his electrifying Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore in Apocalypse Now, rhapsodizing about the smell of napalm in the morning, but just as easily stand out in subtler roles, like his calming consigliere Tom Hagen in the first two Godfather movies.

Most important to his extraordinary legacy as an actor, Duvall just didn’t stop working, putting in fabulous turns in notable movies, but never phoning it in in the smaller, sillier fill-in roles he took along the way. His filmography tells the story of a changing industry several times over. It includes sturdy ’60s classics such as Mockingbird and True Grit; challenging ’70s movies like George Lucas’s THX 1138 and Robert Altman’s M*A*S*H*; the beloved ’80s TV adaptation of Lonesome Dove; ’90s action hits such as Days of Thunder and Deep Impact; and fantastic 21st-century throwbacks like Open Range and We Own the Night. There are more than a dozen Duvall films you could plausibly pick as your favorite without being laughed out of the room, a truism that some of his best-known peers, such as Al Pacino or Robert De Niro, might struggle to replicate.

Duvall was born in San Diego in 1931, the son of a rear admiral in the U.S. Navy and an amateur actress; through his mother, he was reportedly related to Robert E. Lee, whom he would later play in the 2003 film Gods and Generals. He was raised mostly in Maryland, where his father worked at the Naval Academy in Annapolis. But Duvall didn’t follow in his footsteps, leaving the Army after two years; he then studied at Sanford Meisner’s Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City alongside future luminaries such as Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, and Gene Hackman. Duvall spent the rest of the ’50s on the stage, largely working at Long Island’s Gateway Playhouse; the screenwriter of Mockingbird, Horton Foote, spotted him and recommended him for the Boo Radley role.

Although striking, Duvall’s wordless work in Mockingbird hardly led to instant fame. His proper breakouts came in the Korean War satire M*A*S*H*, in which he played the infuriated villain Major Frank Burns, and the challenging sci-fi epic THX 1138, which saw him play a functionary chased by robot policemen in a world that has outlawed emotions. His first Oscar nomination came for his crafty turn as Tom Hagen in The Godfather, a German Irish adopted brother to the Sicilian Mob family who always has one foot outside of the deepest inner circle. Duvall is logical, phlegmatic, but always steely here; he does scene-stealing work without ever having to raise his voice.

That’s not to say Duvall was incapable of going big. He could be a domineering presence, a champion deliverer of monologues, and Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola handed him some of the greatest in movie history for Apocalypse Now, the Vietnam War epic that landed Duvall his second Oscar nomination. In Network, as a harried TV executive, Duvall is similarly roaring, spitting some great Paddy Chayefsky soliloquies with relish. Maybe the apex of this style for Duvall was his work as the terrifying but impotent Marine veteran Bull Meechum in The Great Santini (for which he received his third Oscar nomination), who channels his rage at his family when he doesn’t have a war to fight in. Bald from a young age, Duvall dropped the hairpieces early on and used his bullet-headed image to his advantage, a unique visage that undergirded his complex portrayals of masculinity.

Like his acclaimed contemporaries Pacino, Hoffman, and Hackman, Duvall did not cut the kind of clean, handsome image of movie stars from decades prior; he was earthier and meaner, his face more lined. He’d risen to fame later, and in an era (the New Hollywood of the ’70s) that rewarded shades of gray. When he finally won his Oscar in 1984, for Tender Mercies, he was playing a sympathetic but flawed man, a washed-up recovering alcoholic musician trying to pull his life back together. It’s a gorgeous performance that the film’s distributor, Universal Pictures, initially didn’t know what to do with; it put the movie in theaters with zero fanfare and quickly sold it to cable TV, where it became a hit, collecting surprise awards more than a year after its release.

Duvall largely shifted to smaller work as he aged. The Apostle in 1997 was something of a leading-role comeback, a dark independent film that Duvall wrote and directed and that seemed to owe as much to the Sundance generation of the ’90s as to Duvall’s New Hollywood of the ’70s. He collected two other Oscar nominations for reliable supporting turns in the legal dramas A Civil Action and The Judge, as well as a slew of attention for high-profile TV projects such as Lonesome Dove, Stalin, and Broken Trail.

He was married four times with no children; Duvall’s last partnership was with the actor Luciana Pedraza, whom he co-starred with in the thriller Assassination Tango; they were married from 2005 until his death. “I think everybody has vulnerability. Even when I played Stalin I found vulnerability,” he said in a 2014 interview looking back on his career. When asked if he had an epitaph planned for his career, he declined to think of one. “‘Ashes.’ No, I don’t know. I don’t need a gravestone. Cremation’s fine with me.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At the box office earlier this month, four out of the five top-grossing movies were not from big companies. There was Solo Mio, an inspirational romantic drama starring Kevin James from the faith-based distributor Angel Studios; a filmed concert from the K-pop group Stray Kids; and a French adaptation of Dracula from the director Luc Besson that had already made big money overseas. But by far the most unusual offering was Iron Lung, which has thus far grossed more than $30 million domestically against a $3 million budget. It is a strange sci-fi tale of a man exploring a mysterious underwater world, but stranger still is the fact that it’s even in theaters: Iron Lung was funded, made, and released entirely by a YouTuber most famous for playing video games on camera.

The writer-director of Iron Lung is Mark Fischbach, better known as Markiplier—one of the most popular content creators on YouTube, if not the internet. He’s a veteran of the video format known as “Let’s Play,” in which on-screen personalities offer cheeky commentary while running through a video game. The bulk of Fischbach’s work thus mostly features little else but game footage and his cheerful face reacting to whatever he’s playing—usually something of the indie-horror variety. Each of his simple-sounding uploads typically receives millions of views; his channel currently has more than 38 million subscribers. Fischbach has spent nearly 15 years building his audience, establishing himself as a funny, pleasant, and charitable guy on a platform often lacking for them.

But even with those accomplishments, what he’s achieved with Iron Lung is the kind of creative success story most independent artists can only dream of. Fischbach has long explored other such efforts alongside his usual fare; he has launched a clothing line, hosted podcasts, and made interactive, choose-your-own-adventure-style series, also published on YouTube. Fischbach announced in 2023 that he was making his first theatrical film: an adaptation of the video game Iron Lung, which he would write, direct, and star in. He would also be financing, producing, and distributing the project himself, outside of any typical Hollywood structure. Iron Lung was shot over 35 days that spring; it took years to release partly because Fischbach edited it himself, then declined to make a deal with any traditional distributor. Instead, he spent months booking theaters privately, encouraging his fans to reserve tickets online. When prospective viewers realized the film wasn’t screening in their city, they started calling local cinemas to complain. By the end of this grassroots effort, Iron Lung was booked on more than 3,000 screens in North America.

Fischbach never launched a paid media campaign ahead of release—he simply used his own feeds for promotion, cut his own trailers, and built up anticipation among his large viewer base. The result was a film that almost came out of nowhere, nearly surmounting another new movie with more mainstream clout: Send Help, a star-driven, $40-million thriller from the Disney-owned 20th Century Studios. Send Help opened to $19.1 million, while Iron Lung made $18.3 million in its first weekend, and has since doubled that gross worldwide in just two weeks. Despite knowing practically nothing of Fischbach’s work or the game he was adapting, I was intrigued enough by its origins and audience pull to go see it. I was expecting Iron Lung to be small-scale, given the production cost; I was also anticipating a lot of the cheap thrills that can come with low-budget horror hits—some shocking gore, some jump scares, and a fast-and-simple plot.

Maybe the most intriguing thing about Iron Lung, beyond its unusual release strategy, is that it has basically none of those elements. It’s an odd, heady, talky bit of ambient storytelling that runs for 127 minutes, despite not very much actually happening. As far as I could tell from checking out videos of Fischbach playing the original game, the film translates the premise and gameplay faithfully. Simon (played by Fischbach, replete with tangled hair and clad in a cruddy diving suit) is a convict piloting a ramshackle submarine on a distant moon, where there’s an ocean made of blood. He’s exploring for deep-sea life, perhaps to help undo an unspecified apocalypse that’s seemingly wiped out life around the galaxy, but everything else remains unclear—who sent him below the surface, what monsters reside within, and what will happen with the samples he collects and the freaky X-ray pictures he tries to take.

After a while, I cheerfully gave up on trying to follow the film’s attempt at a narrative. The inscrutability is clearly the point: In scene after scene, Simon’s anxiety mounts as he fiddles with buttons, tries to interpret garbled commands, yells at his higher-ups, and begins to possibly hallucinate. There are no giant frights or dynamic action sequences, and the slow pacing makes the film feel at times punishingly long. Instead, Fischbach aims to keep the audience invested by ratcheting up the sense of atmosphere. The blood-filled waters and the bizarre fish skeletons aside, however, the movie is not quite the Cronenbergian nightmare the director wants it to be. Yet I found myself charmed by Iron Lung’s shagginess; I haven’t seen anything quite like it, and the idea of such a curious piece of art becoming a genuine box-office phenomenon is a little heartwarming.

Fischbach isn’t the first YouTuber to jump into big-screen filmmaking. Chris Stuckmann, who reviews movies on his channel, released his first feature last year; he funded the project on Kickstarter. After the film, Shelby Oaks, was picked up by the indie distributor Neon, Stuckmann reshot some of the sequences to boost the production value. The end product was nonetheless a critical and commercial disappointment, a work of demonic found-footage pablum that felt imitative of better-known forebears. The Philippou brothers, makers of the much more successful supernatural tales Talk to Me and Bring Her Back, also launched their careers on YouTube; they released an array of shorts that became their calling cards, earning them actual budgets to direct Hollywood movies. Yet Fischbach’s accomplishment is more impressive than those of his cohort: He essentially built the entire engine himself and landed the plane with aplomb. His fully self-driven model is one that other online creators could try to imitate. Even if they do, I wonder whether their artistic instincts would be as unexpected—or captivating.</div>

            <h2>The Founders Would Have Opposed ‘Nationalizing’ Elections</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/founders-nationalized-elections/685997/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Trump earlier this month repeated his call for the Republican Party to “nationalize” voting in the United States. “We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many—15 places,” he said. “The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.” The next day, he added, “A state is an agent for the federal government in elections.”

The Framers would not have agreed. The Constitution does give Congress broad power to “make or alter” regulations about the time, place, and manner of elections. But at the same time, states were given primary control over elections and Congress was denied the power to determine voter qualifications. That’s because the Framers did not think election administration should be solely a federal endeavor. They sought to divide responsibility between the states and the federal government, to avoid the dangers of both federal military dictatorship and state hyper-partisanship. History has demonstrated the wisdom of their approach, and the Supreme Court has been skeptical of broad attempts to nationalize elections in the past.

In drafting the elections clause in 1787, the Founders at the Constitutional Convention attempted to balance their distrust of state legislatures as the source of partisan factions with their desire to maintain state control over voting qualifications. “The Legislatures of the States ought not to have the uncontrolled right of regulating the times places & manner of holding elections,” James Madison explained in a debate, according to notes taken at the time. He was concerned that partisan factions in a state might rig the electoral system to favor their own candidates. “Whenever the State Legislatures had a favorite measure to carry, they would take care so to mould their regulations as to favor the candidates they wished to succeed.”

Madison identified other “abuses” that might result, such as malapportionment. In 1787, South Carolina had a grossly malapportioned state legislature, which benefited slaveholders. The South Carolina delegates had proposed to deny the power of Congress to regulate the districts in their state, but their proposal failed. Other convention delegates, agreeing with Madison, said that congressional supervisory power over state elections was necessary to prevent voter fraud. Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania worried that “the States might make false returns and then make no provisions for new elections,” while Rufus King of Massachusetts feared that without a power to supervise elections, Congress might be unable to assess the validity of elections. The Founders also thought that a uniform time for national elections would ensure there was always a quorum in the House, which was necessary in times of emergency.

Once the Constitution was drafted and signed, it went to the state conventions for ratification. In the ratification debates, anti-Federalists—in particular Patrick Henry in Virginia—argued that the Convention’s allocation of broad authority over federal elections to Congress would enable congressional incumbents to entrench their own power, pulling tricks such as putting polling places in inconvenient locations. “When a numerous standing army shall render opposition vain, the Congress may complete the system of despotism,” the Anti-Federalist minority in Pennsylvania argued.

The Federalists countered that both the states and the federal government would share the power to determine election procedures. In “Federalist No. 60,” Alexander Hamilton emphasized the limits of the federal government’s sphere of authority over elections: Congress would have no power to determine the qualifications of voters or candidates, because the former was exclusively granted to state legislatures and the latter was fixed by the Constitution. Answering the Anti-Federalist charge that Congress might try to rig the elections to favor “the wealthy and the well-born” candidates, he said such a scheme would require a military coup and would be so objectionable that citizens would be inspired to “flock from the remotest extremes of their respective States to the places of election, to overthrow their tyrants.” Even Hamilton, the convention’s most robust defender of federal power, recognized a role for the states in the electoral process.

Congress did not exercise its power to nationalize election procedures until the Apportionment Act of 1842, which required all congressional elections to take place in contiguous, single-member districts rather than at-large elections. One goal was the protection of political minorities: Because a dominant faction, or even a bare majority, would win all of a state’s congressional seats in an at-large election, the framers of the statute thought single-member districts would facilitate higher levels of partisan fairness. However, as politics became more polarized, the law failed to deliver on its promise. Requiring single-member districts increased the opportunities for state legislatures to engage in partisan gerrymandering and prevented states from adopting alternative voting systems that were less vulnerable to partisan manipulation, such as proportional representation. The Supreme Court has stressed that Congress retains the power to ban partisan gerrymandering, but Congress has refused to use it.

At times, of course, federal control over elections and law enforcement has been crucial, most notably in service of enforcing civil rights. During both the Reconstruction era of the 1860s and ’70s and the civil-rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s, it was only the threat of federal troops that led recalcitrant southern states to uphold the law—and once the troops were withdrawn, lawlessness prevailed.

In that first period, after the Civil War, the Reconstruction Congress passed the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which outlawed racial discrimination in voting. This had long been a goal of abolitionists, most significantly Frederick Douglass. Opponents of the Fifteenth Amendment insisted that state power, not federal power, should be the source of voting regulations, citing Hamilton’s ideas in The Federalist Papers. Supporters of the amendment invoked Hamilton as well: George Sewall Boutwell of Massachusetts quoted Hamilton’s statement in “Federalist No. 59” that “nothing can be more evident than that an exclusive power of regulating elections for the national Government, in the hands of the State Legislatures, would leave the existence of the Union entirely at their mercy.”

After the Civil War, as the reign of Ku Klux Klan violence grew to terrorize Black Americans, it became clear that the voting rights guaranteed by the Fifteenth Amendment could be enforced only under federal authority. Beginning in 1870, Congressional Republicans responded by passing three Enforcement Acts, which, among other things, forbade people from banding together to harass Black voters and empowered judges and United States marshals to supervise polling places. Unfortunately, after the disputed election of 1876, political support for Black voting rights collapsed, and Republicans withdrew military troops from the South. The Supreme Court then made things worse by repeatedly striking down key provisions of the Enforcement Acts, as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1875, as violations of states’ rights. The combination of diminished political will and judicial restrictions on federal power once again placed the responsibility for organizing federal elections primarily in the hands of the states, to terrible effect.

President Trump’s proposal to nationalize elections isn’t an attempt to enforce civil rights but to achieve partisan advantage. The Framers were no stranger to partisan manipulation of the electoral system. In one of his lowest moments, Hamilton proposed changing election procedures in New York State after the election had occurred in order to prevent Thomas Jefferson from winning the presidency. Nevertheless, they believed that congressional power over elections was necessary to standardize the time, place, and manner of elections across the entire United States, not to allow a partisan national majority to punish states and jurisdictions where the opposite party prevailed.

If Congress passed President Trump’s proposal to federalize elections in 15 places—presumably Democratic jurisdictions—is there any chance the Supreme Court would uphold it? It’s possible. The Court in recent years has sanctioned broad congressional power under the elections clause, upholding statutes that regulate redistricting, voter registration, campaign finance, corruption, primaries, and recounts. That said, in striking down portions of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County, the Court expressed its disapproval of federal voting legislation that treats different states differently.

The closest historical analogue to Trump’s proposal to nationalize elections is the federal elections bill proposed in 1890 by Henry Cabot Lodge. Known as the “Force Bill,” the act would have authorized federal courts, backed by military force, to supervise state elections by appointing officials who could oversee registration, certify the election results, prevent noncitizens from voting, and reject fraudulent results. In his biography of Daniel Webster, Lodge had concluded that, throughout American history, “if illegal and partisan State resistance had always been put down with a firm hand, civil war might have been avoided.” Unlike Trump’s proposal, however, the Lodge Bill did not single out Democratic cities for federal supervision but instead applied neutrally, because its goal was to secure Black voting rights rather than Republican partisan advantage.

In the end, these election disputes have confirmed the wisdom of the Founders’ decision to divide the power to regulate elections between the states and Congress. State involvement helps combat congressional self-dealing and undemocratic incumbent retrenchment, while congressional oversight helps curb state abuses, such as malapportionment and partisan vote suppression. And perhaps most important, by empowering Congress, not the president, to remedy deficient state electoral schemes, the Constitution prevents presidents from rewriting the election code by executive fiat and thus provides an additional safeguard against military dictatorship. Americans today should abide by its guidance.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration has backed down in Minnesota. Last week, Tom Homan, the border czar, announced that the surge of federal agents into the state—3,000 officers—was ending. He framed this mostly as a mission accomplished: They had come to round up illegal immigrants, and the job was done. But even Homan had to grudgingly acknowledge that something unexpected had happened amid the confrontations between ICE agents and local people trying to defend their neighbors. Despite the attempt to dismiss and denigrate this opposition—including the two observers killed by agents—as “domestic terrorists,” Americans had registered a more universally human story, one that short-circuited the familiar, and exhausting, predetermined narratives that set one tribe’s interests against another’s. “I don’t want to see any more bloodshed,” Homan said. Whether you were an officer or a neighbor, a citizen or an undocumented immigrant, he added, “I don’t want to see anybody harmed.”

The administration seems to know that it can’t spin its way out of what happened—and what people felt about it. The New York Times recently asked a handful of Trump voters how they perceived the immigration crackdown after the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, and heard answers such as “This is inhumane.” One woman said it made her want to “protest and be with my fellow humanity.” Polling is not the way to measure such emotions, but after taking in stories of a terrorized city and witnessing these deaths, nearly two-thirds of Americans now oppose ICE’s behavior. All of this leads me to a sentiment that I know might elicit laughter and a reminder that this is, after all, still 2026: Maybe we do have a sense of the morally obvious.

Another way to say that something is morally obvious—maybe a more American way—is to call it a “self-evident truth.” In his new book, Radical Universalism, the New School professor Omri Boehm sees this load-bearing expression from the Declaration of Independence not as a relic from 250 years ago but as a living phrase that points to a persistent, imperative American mode. To imagine that anything could be considered self-evident in our post-truth age, in the age of Trump—when even a celebratory Super Bowl halftime show becomes fodder for fights over American identity (and Megyn Kelly screaming “Football is ours!”)—is almost impossible. Sadly, even the Declaration’s proposition that “all men are created equal” seems to be up for debate.

And yet, there are these flashes, moments, when we’re reminded about human dignity and justice in a way that is not circumscribed by what racial or even national group one belongs to. There are truths that supersede any man-made law—truths that just are. Boehm doesn’t quite put it this way, but I would describe these as precepts that live in the gut. Self-evident truths motivated abolitionists who couldn’t abide the hypocrisy of a freedom-obsessed country that tolerated slavery; they were articulated at Gettysburg by Lincoln as he waged war to wipe out this hypocrisy; and they were still insisted upon by Martin Luther King Jr. 100 years later. They might also be what allowed those Americans watching the events in Minneapolis to override their political identities and think of “humanity.”

Boehm calls the belief in these self-evident truths “radical universalism.” This is not some kitschy version of harmony—a Coca-Cola ad with young people of different ethnicities on a generic hilltop holding hands and belting out that they’d like to teach the world to sing. He calls his version radical for a reason. Boehm’s idea is hard to realize—almost impossibly hard, I would say. But that’s why reading this cogent, succinct book felt like such a cold plunge, painful but reinvigorating.

Read: Minneapolis had its Birmingham moment

First, Boehm dispenses with the identitarians—both the ideologues on the right, who fight “in terms of traditional values,” and those on the left, who fight “in the name of gender and race.” The MAGA versus critical race theory death match is an easy foil, two sides of the same group-centric approach that is ill-suited for a pluralistic society, let alone all of humanity. But if this was his only target, a reader weary of the culture war might just easily nod along. Boehm goes further, and takes aim at the 400-year-old tradition of Western liberalism, or what he calls “false universalism.”

Because he is trying to invoke a politics built on essential, everlasting truths, Boehm considers the marketplace of ideas almost as much of a cul de sac as the tribal alleys of identitarians. One of the legacies of the Enlightenment, he argues, is that moral obviousness was replaced by a culture of “consensus, interest, and opinion.” We reason our way to a point of view, and argue and haggle with others toward some moral compromise. In practice, we usually end up balancing delicately on the knife’s edge of the thinnest majoritarianism. This might sound like a reasonable place to end up, and even the best we can hope for—except when it works to mask injustice.

Liberalism is contingent on who holds power, and how large a circle they draw when it comes to who matters and who deserves rights and freedoms. We the People, Boehm points out, was a limiting phrase, meant to indicate that these rules were derived by and applied only to whoever happened to be included in that we. Unlike the Declaration, which took its authority from the universal human desire not to be subjugated, the Constitution implies its own kind of identitarianism, with amendments becoming a mechanism for widening or narrowing the circle (Black people and women, of course, stood outside of it for a very long time, along with many immigrant groups).

The mother of all transcendent truths is the one about the dignity of every human being. Boehm anchors his thinking in the 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant’s ideas about morality. Everything in this world, Kant said, either has a price or has dignity. Humans, because they are capable of moral choice, are imbued with dignity. They can never have a price. They are an end in themselves, never a means. (This is why slavery was such a degradation to Kant). This realization creates the basis for his famous categorial imperative: Essentially, act only according to principles you would apply to everyone. Boehm channels Kant when he writes, “It is because human beings are open to the question of what they ought to do that they themselves are subjects of absolute dignity.” For the radical universalist, this truth about who we are trumps all else, all borders and constitutions and written laws.

So what would a politics based on “absolute dignity” actually look like? One of Boehm’s examples is King’s decision in the mid-1960s to protest the Vietnam War. At the time, the war was popular and the civil-rights movement was making progress with Lyndon B. Johnson; denouncing his administration’s foreign policy was seen by no less than the NAACP as a “serious tactical mistake.” The Washington Post editorialized in 1967 that King had “diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country and his people.” But King did not understand himself as working for the interests of any single group. He felt he was being consistent with his duty to justice. “Aren’t you hurting the cause of your people, they ask?” King said in a sermon, responding to the criticism. “And when I hear them, though I often understand the source of their concern, I am nevertheless greatly saddened, for such questions mean that the inquirers have not really known me, my commitment or my calling.”

This is why radical universalism is hard: It often demands that you go against your own immediate interests. It can also mean breaking earthly law. “Following absolute duty is not the origin of obedience but of disobedience,” Boehm writes. A refusal to accept an immoral status quo led to civil war in this country. And although the outcome of that war was a more moral order, I can also see how following the demands of such universalism can land you in places that are highly impractical, even dangerous, with many more unintended consequences and blooming injustices.

When it comes to immigration, for example, Boehm’s ideas taken to their conclusion would seem to suggest a policy of open borders—how else can the dignity of all people be considered on the same plane? But then what about the dignity of people who lose their jobs, state support, or other scarce resources as a result? Boehm, who was born in Israel, also applied his thinking to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians in a recent book, Haifa Republic; he concludes that the answer is a one-state solution, a “binational utopia” in which “all are equal.” But history has shown again and again that these antagonists are bad at living peacefully in the same polity, to put it mildly. If any conflict offered proof that separation might be the only course for reaching something like self-determination, the Israeli-Palestinian one would be it.

You might need the eyesight of a prophet to really think in these radical universalist terms, to see humanity as a whole, Boehm writes, which is why people such as Lincoln and King come to inhabit an exalted, almost supernatural, place in our collective memory. But is this instinct really so rare? I’m not sure.

I imagine Boehm would disagree with any dilution of his absolutism, but it might be more helpful to bring these ideas a little closer to earth, to remember those flashes of self-evident truth, and to imagine that we all carry this universalist impulse—an antibody that can be activated when something upsets our gut. That’s why I go back to the people of Minneapolis. They were willing to risk their lives to protect strangers. They took these actions not to secure their own rights or freedom but out of a sense of duty to others.

What self-evident truths might yank us out of our silos in this way? The wrongness of Good’s and Pretti’s deaths certainly had this effect, but I think we can still recognize these truths in more pedestrian areas of life. People should not be treated as objects. The innocence of childhood should be inviolable. Personal experience matters but should not overrule our sense of shared humanity. These are truths that can manifest themselves in small ways rather than in revolutionary change; they can help us build a sane health-care system, or keep phones out of schools, or formulate an immigration policy that doesn’t treat refugees like garbage.

If these ideas feel basic, uncontroversial, that’s because they are. What I take from Boehm’s radical universalism—and what I think is applicable to the world of real people and not only to the world of prophets—is a reminder that the morally obvious exists, that it is part of our American vernacular, something that could even bring our irritable country together, and not just after senseless death.

            <div id="article-text">Updated at 10:02 a.m. ET on February 16, 2026

The wolves arrived in May of last year, just days after Paul Roen had driven his cattle back up to their summer pasture in Northern California’s Sierra Valley. He started finding the bleeding bodies of calves—some still alive, so badly paralyzed that they’d need to be shot. After weeks of this, Roen finally saw a kill himself. “One wolf grabbed a cow and spun her around, while another grabbed a calf,” he told me. “He tore it into three pieces in 30 seconds.”

Every night, Roen would go out in his pickup truck and try to keep the wolves away from his animals, until exhaustion drove him to bed in the hours before dawn. He came to dread the sound of his cows bawling for their lost calves. By June, Roen, who is also a Sierra County supervisor, and his fellow ranchers had persuaded the state to intervene: A team started to patrol the Sierra Valley rangeland, harassing wolves with rubber bullets, sirens, and eventually drones. At one point, Roen said, officials even tried piling frozen beavers outside the wolves’ den to sate their hunger. But still, the kills continued.

What Roen and other ranchers wanted, really, was for the state to kill the wolves. But gray wolves, which were exterminated from California roughly a century ago, are still listed as endangered there, making it illegal to kill, harm, or harass them. By the fall, the same pack of wolves had taken down roughly 50 of Roen’s cattle, he estimates—more than he’d ever lost to mountain lions or any other predators, and a major proportion of the roughly 90 livestock killed or injured in the region. The state’s Department of Fish and Wildlife determined that this was “far outside any comparable experience across the state or the West,” and sanctioned the first wolf killings since the animals had returned to California in 2011. In October, officials tranquilized three adult wolves from a helicopter, then injected them with chemical euthanasia. They also shot a fourth wolf—a six-month-old pup—who’d been mistaken for a similar-looking adult.

The consequences of killing wolves are not what they might have been 50 years ago, when just hundreds of them were left in the contiguous United States and the federal government first declared the species endangered. Nowadays, thousands prowl the landscape—a fraction of the millions that may have once lived here, but still constituting one of the most successfully recovered species in the country. At this point, “I don’t think you can shoot and trap wolves out of existence,” Diane K. Boyd, a wildlife biologist who has extensively researched wolves, told me.

Some Americans are hoping that killing wolves could again become a national norm. Already a few western states are actively working to reduce their gray-wolf populations through annual hunts. When I asked Richard Egan, another California rancher, how many wolves should be in the state, he told me there was no correct answer other than zero. The country’s official stance is that gray wolves should live here. Americans are still deciding how many they can tolerate.

The tensions between today’s wolves and humans are, essentially, the same as they were in the 1800s. As expanding agriculture sent wild populations of deer and elk into decline, wolves began to prey instead on livestock—prompting people, in turn, to kill wolves. By the middle of the 20th century, decades of aggressive hunting, trapping, and mass poisoning had pushed the Lower 48’s gray wolves to the point of near extermination.

After decades of monitoring and intervention, some imperiled species are still barely staving off extinction; wolves’ evolutionary grit, meanwhile, has surprised even conservationists. Human initiatives have undoubtedly helped—particularly, the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park and Idaho in 1995, which was driven by the Nez Perce Tribe. But on their own, gray wolves trickled across the Canadian border, back into Montana; after expanding throughout the Mountain West and Northwest, they wandered down into California. In 2021, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service moved to take gray wolves off the federal endangered-species list, though that decision has been under contention since.

With the return of gray wolves has come the return of gray-wolf problems. The wolves are facing greater pressures than they once did to find food in a country filled out with cities and people; naturally, they are again preying on livestock. Ranching, too, has become more challenging and less stable in recent years, amid droughts and rising feed costs. In California, in particular, where elk remain relatively scarce, and deer populations have been in prolonged decline, “there’s nothing to sustain these wolves but cattle,” Roen told me. One recent analysis found that a single wolf can cost a rancher up to $162,000. But ranchers remain limited in how much they can intervene. “If they killed every one of my cattle, I’d just have to sit and watch unless they threatened me personally,” Egan, whose cattle losses have roughly quadrupled since wolves arrived in his county, said.

In Oregon, too, where gray wolves have been established for longer, ranchers feel hamstrung. Kimberlee Kerns’s family has lost hundreds of sheep and cattle to wolves since 2009; the animals that survive tend to gain less weight and conceive fewer lambs and calves. To keep the sheep safe, her team has been herding them into pens every night, which raises the animals’ stress levels and makes it easier for them to get one another sick. And after being repeatedly vexed by wolves, Kerns told me, her cattle “want to fight the herding dogs”—which, although domesticated, are still technically the same species.

Ranchers and wolf advocates have been able to deter wolves from feasting on livestock on some properties, Karin Vardaman, who’s part of a group trying to minimize wolf-human conflict, told me. Ranchers can fly brightly colored streamers to spook wolves, and try to keep animals off terrain that might make hunting easier; they can dispatch horseback patrols on their property. But Egan and Roen said that they’ve seen those tactics fail, too—perhaps because the wolves quickly learn that flashy repellents pose no genuine threat. “They’re desensitizing the wolves to the point where they’re emboldened,” Egan said.

These gentler efforts, Egan and Roen argue, might carry more weight if local wolves understood that humans might kill them, too. And, of course, the more wolves die in these harvests, the fewer might trouble livestock.

Around the end of 2008, the year before Montana opened its first gray wolf-hunting season, animus against the predators reached a boiling point. A series of tougher-than-average winters had squeezed the local wildlife; hunters were driving into town with less to show for their efforts. “The hunters that year saw not as much deer, and wolf tracks everywhere,” Kent Laudon, a wildlife biologist who worked as a wolf specialist in Montana’s wildlife department for more than a decade, told me. Locals began to protest outside of his department’s office, calling for wolves to be purged. That winter, Laudon recalled driving across town and counting the bumper stickers, which were emblazoned with the silhouette of a wolf head and ,  that read Smoke a pack a day.

The next year, Montana’s quota for wolf kills debuted at 75. That number has grown steadily over the past couple of decades to more than 400. Quentin Kujala, the chief of conservation policy at Montana’s Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks, told me that the number of lethal wolf removals that officials have had to conduct due to livestock conflicts has decreased in that same time frame. But livestock conflicts—and complaints about them—also plateaued in the 2010s, and have stayed at roughly that level ever since. The state’s wolf population, too, has held rather steady at about 1,100 for several years. “We seem to have arrived at an equilibrium,” Kujala said.

For years, Montana’s official policy has said that the state must maintain at least 15 breeding pairs of wolves to keep them off the state’s endangered-species list. (Because of wolves’ complex social structure, researchers have disagreed on the size of the wolf population necessary to maintain that many breeding pairs—but according to Kujala, the state now relies on a very conservative estimate of about 450 wolves.) But locals and politicians disagree vehemently about how many wolves above that threshold they’d like to support. In 2021, the state government passed a law that called for reducing the wolf population to a “sustainable” level.

Apart from specifying that the number of wolves had to exceed the state’s endangerment cutoff, legislators never defined what such a sustainable level might be. Mike Phillips, a former Democratic member of Montana’s state Senate, told me that if the goal is to actually recover the species, humans should set their sights higher than just barely exceeding the threshold at which the animals might snuff out. Paul Fielder, a Republican member of the state’s House of Representatives and a longtime advocate for more aggressive wolf management, told me he sees little reason for the state to maintain more wolves than the bare minimum. “They’re four-legged terrorists,” Fielder said. “How many terrorists are okay in your neighborhood?”

Across the rest of the country, too, opinions about how to manage wolves tend to break along partisan lines—to the point where reminding people of their political identity can amplify their positive or negative feelings toward the animals. And although most Americans remain in favor of protecting gray wolves, only a very small minority of people in the U.S. regularly interact with the animals—primarily in rural regions. A few ranchers told me they were frustrated that so much of the wolves’ fate was being determined by people who wouldn’t have to live through the direct consequences.

Wolves do have a way of riling peoples’ emotions, Alma Sanchez, a carnivore biologist with the Nez Perce Tribe, told me—perhaps, she and others said, because conflicts over their future put into relief so many fault lines of American life, between urban and rural existence, between conservatives and liberals, between trust in government and a desire for individual sovereignty. Some researchers hoped that a few wolf killings might mollify ranchers, but recent studies have suggested that this approach can instead reinforce anti-wolf sentiment. In one infamous case in Wyoming—where wolves have been delisted since 2017 and can be hunted and trapped year-round in most of the state—a man was arrested in 2024 after he allegedly ran over a wolf with his snowmobile, then paraded her injured body around a bar before shooting her. (He has pleaded not guilty to the charge.)

And as Montana has found, the math of “fewer wolves, fewer problems” doesn’t always work out. Killing a wolf can destabilize its pack to the point where the remaining members become more likely to go after livestock. And although wolves do naturally prey on wild deer and elk, support for the notion that the predators are cratering wild game populations is mixed at best, several experts told me. In several cases, researchers have found that wolves’ effect on those species pales in comparison to the impact of  factors such as disease, environmental conditions, habitat loss, and other predators. The benefits to livestock, too, may be quite modest: One recent study found that, across states, killing one wolf saves, on average, less than 10 percent of a single cow. For those reasons and more, several wolf researchers told me they remain skeptical that ever-increasing wolf killings will chart the path to coexistence. “If it’s not going to reduce conflict, or make you feel better about wolves, why do you want to kill wolves?” Naomi Louchouarn, a conservation ecologist with Humane World for Animals, told me.

Although some advocates for increased wolf harvests can point to an ideal—and low—number of wolves they’d like to aim for, the conservationists I spoke with didn’t feel comfortable identifying a “correct” number of wolves for the country. The answer, Sanchez told me, depends less on what the landscape can support and more on what Americans’ attitudes will. But people who want more wolves and people who want fewer both argue that the other side is letting their feelings about wolves get in the way of rational thinking. Fielder, while making the case that Montana needed fewer wolves, repeatedly told me that the worst way to approach wolf management was “entirely through emotion.” Days earlier, while advocating for the animals, Boyd, the wildlife biologist, had told me exactly the same.

*scratches Western Digital from buy list for the future*

November is bankruptcy month. Hard drives at 90% off.Oh thank god.  Maybe I won’t have to take out a second mortgage to pay for 32gb of rdimm.

November is bankruptcy month. Hard drives at 90% off.

Oh thank god.  Maybe I won’t have to take out a second mortgage to pay for 32gb of rdimm.

The workstation I&#39;m typing this on has 128GB of RAM.  It&#39;s probably worth more than my car now.

I get most of my drives by being the only local customer for my server colo. I&#39;m the only person who comes and goes with any regularity, and I&#39;ve gotten to know the on-site ops well enough that they give me a chance to buy anything juicy from the abandoned/nonpayment hardware as they pull it out and evaluate it. I have gotten CRAZY stuff that way and I highly recommend it.

That being said, I haven&#39;t seen any deals for larger than 20TB drives  either, but I would like to point out that both Seagate and WD hig

Can this be used to make ECC the default, no more non-error correcting for the consumer market by economy of scale price reduction?What other enterprise level tech could also become the part of the consumer standard?

According to Ark [intel.com] there are three recent non-Xeon processors that do:

Core Ultra 5-235Core Ultra 9-285Core Ultra 7-265K

Intel absolutely does. My Ultra 7 265H laptop has ECC DDR5 installed.

It&#39;s not the same thing. DDR5 ECC is an on-die feature for correcting internal errors. It&#39;s not ECC as in &quot;extra bits to fix transport errors&quot;. Your CPU does not support [intel.com] the ECC haruchai is talking about.

Technically, all DDR5 has data protection for single-bit errors on-chip. It&#39;s not the same thing as big-boy registered DIMMs, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get the whole world of people who buy Acer whatevers from Walmart to go along with yet ANOTHER reason to make RAM more expensive.

Aside from that, there isn&#39;t currently much justification for looking at Intel on consumer platforms. Having integrated Xe cores is nifty for video editors, but just like gamers, they&#39;re probably going to spend cash on an n

I saw all of the hype around AI. I really wanted to try AI, so I ordered a computer. Looks like I can get online and try AI in 2029.

Man, I can&#39;t wait to get in on the hallucination.

The whole point is so you get hooked on AI and they get to charge you for it with another subscription, infact you can do that today

I&#39;ll wait until the storm breaks and get the hardware for half price

Maybe &quot;programmers&quot; come in different tiers, and AI can only replace the lower tiers.  Like, programmers who can only implement simple generic code when given clear instructions (but cannot design solutions themselves and cannot debug very well) would be the bottom tier, and perhaps AI will be able to completely replace them, but still not able to replace higher tier programmers.

Mid-tier: can independently design and implement business solutions using existing tools and fra

I use Sonnet (4.5) every day and itâ(TM)s improving much faster than I expected. But I still correct it every 5 minutes. My first attempt to use Opus 4.6 as an agent failed immediately. Somehow Sonnet 4.5 did the same task better than Opus 4.6. But people are claiming fantastic results, so Iâ(TM)ll test it some more this week. Maybe Opus has a different âoepersonalityâ and requires a different style of prompt.

I had similar experience. Eventually went back to Sonnet.

My one suggestion is to have the AI update the copilot-instructions.md file on its own after a session. This will help it keep things in memory. Too often I&#39;ve caught Claude doing stupid things I told it not to do a few prompts back.

Like other &quot;AI&quot; company CEOs, Anthropic&#39;s CEO sees the purpose of his role to do everything he can to sell the company for many billions, as quickly as possible, so he can join the &quot;absurdly rich tech bro&quot; club. That&#39;s it, there is no secondary purpose in his mind.

That&#39;s not what he says, of course, if people ask him about it though.

Actually, he&#39;s quite different from other AI CEOs in some important ways.  For one, he&#39;s not mixing advertising and AI, and for another he refuses to let the military use Claude for unethical (in his view) purposes.

That certainly does not make him a saint or anything, but let&#39;s not pretend he&#39;s the exact same as (say) the OpenAI CEO.

Anthropic&#39;s CEO then went home to his newborn and his one year old son, and announced that he will have 1024 children in the next ten years.

I&#39;m not sure why people keep insisting on believing what these guys say has any basis in fact - or assuming that the tech bro isn&#39;t lying through his teeth.

I recall a story on this site, probably two years ago, where an AI company CEO stated categorically that the &quot;hallucination problem&quot; was solved.

I started using Google Gemini to evaluate applications of transfer students for credit for specified courses at my university.

What a person in my role is supposed to do is email faculty colleagues teaching the course in question, but good luck with that.  A faculty member wants such requests to just go away.  Even if you know the contents of a course you have taught for years, how do you know that Cow College&#39;s offering is anywhere close?

The AI not only has a lot to say on how equivalent a pair of cour

Just to follow up... I was referring to this Slashdot story from October 2024 [slashdot.org].

&quot;The most significant change we&#39;re seeing over the past 18 to 20 months is the accuracy of those answers from the large language models,&quot; gushed [Baidu CEO Robin Li] at last week&#39;s Harvard Business Review Future of Business Conference. &quot;I think over the past 18 months, that problem has pretty much been solved -- meaning when you talk to a chatbot, a frontier model-based chatbot, you can basically trust the answer,&quot; he added.

I wish it were solved. I wouldn&#39;t need to constantly hold it&#39;s hand.

They said AI was replacing developers last year. Extrapolating, by this time next year AI will be completely gone and it will take two humans to do the work of one human.

Most of the &quot;because AI&quot; headcount reductions were complete bullshit, or a &quot;realignment&quot; of the companies towards the AI future. Assuming it ever actually happens. I mean, they spent billions and promised hundreds of billions more.

Now, I certainly wouldn&#39;t want to work at a company that&#39;s making a shitty SaaS replacement for a dBase III application or excel spreadsheets or something. That sort of thing is doomed no matter how you look at it. If AI does even 5% of what they&#39;re replacing, you just ask Claude

It replaced them in name only, not in action. AI has mostly been used as a scapegoat for layoffs as wall street grew tired of the previous rounds of layoffs the past couple years when companies were just outright saying it was to save money (or &quot;right size&quot; or whatever corporate jargon you want to insert) and no longer bought the BS.  Very rarely are those laid off actually being replaced by AI. More so its gone on as it always had, some manager somewhere can claim greater profit/lesser expense while the co

Yes, and in some ways they were right. What they got wrong was that its replacement was also the internet rather than everyone going to back to... BBSs I guess.

Baloney. Do our computer pundits lack all common sense?

Well he was right about that one, though probably not for the reasons he thought.

...remember the contingent of naysayers who said the internet was a passing fad?

I remember both of them, and I remember thinking they were full of shit. Aside from Bill Gates and some other forgettable nobody, no one thought the Internet was a passing fad. However, just about everyone on Slashdot thought that most of the companies in the dot com boom were doomed to failure, even (especially?) as paid pundits talked up the brilliance of the companies&#39; CEOs.

I see history repeating. The underlying technology has some cool uses (though not worth the catastrophic cost of building the models), but it&#39;s pets.com all over again.

I wonder why... they should know best how to do it and yet they have not...

seriously...  For me so far AI is just a better interface to web/stack overflow... and still generating lots of crap...

Sure it saves time on some simple things like unit tests generation but even there it has some issues...

I have seen codegen accelerate stuff, but it&#39;s still just dumb as all get out.  It can successfully generate longer streams of code, but subjectively the lines per mistake seem similar, and I have my best result keeping it on a short leash or maybe 6 or 7 lines of code.  I have to correct that code at least half the time and I don&#39;t have the attention span to review and repair a batch of a few hundred lines of codegen when it isn&#39;t quite right.

Exception being if I&#39;m doing something very easy yet tedious, th

If that&#39;s all it is to you, you&#39;re either using inferior tooling or don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing.

Most developers can&#39;t get out of their own way, with regard to using LLMs. They think they know best and try to steer the AI like a child trying to guide ants with a stick, instead of a trail of honey. They&#39;re usually too stuck in the &quot;what&quot; instead of the big picture &quot;how&quot; and end up with inferior results as a consequence.

Because I&#39;ve been using LLMs for over a year now in my dev work.  There is just not way at all that any of this can replace what I do.  Like, every time I switch context I have to essentially re-contextualize the LLM for that new project in order to get any use out of it.  That takes a lot of time and it can be frustrating.  If you don&#39;t do that then the LLM is going to be giving you very bad code advice.

Start using instructions files everywhere. The AI is pretty good at generating them. But itâ(TM)s an evolving problem. Every day I find a new thing I need to add to my instructions file because the AI made a bad assumption.

I do use them.  But they are still limited.  Projects aren&#39;t static.  So you constantly have to update those files to keep the LLM current.

Seriously though, we seem to be flatlining with what agentic AI can handle. The new models are...fine. They are marginally better than the last, but replacement level? No. Not in software dev, not in legal, not in medical, not in anything. Useful yes, replacement no.

I&#39;d say reverse Minotaur phase: It got a human head and is proficient at generating bullshit.

Seldom does Claude ask clarifying questions of an ambiguous request. Sure, you should try to be specific, but sometimes statements can be interpreted differently than intended. In those cases, Claude just merrily chugs along making vast code changes on false assumptions.

Unfortunately, there is no ranking or estimates of which ones are the worst.  I suspect vehicles are up there in the list.  And also suspect they have TONS of extremely-polluting, old, 2-cycle engines being used in 2 wheeled mopeds/cycles/scooters/generators/etc and micro cars.  Just one such engine could produce the pollution of up to 125 4-cycle modern mopeds/scooters, or dozens and dozens of modern cars.

IIT Delhi did a study on this, and they found out that 25-40% of the air pollution is due to construction waste & dust, and publicly dumped garbage.  Indian pollution controls focus on industrial waste and vehicular pollution, which come a distant second and third.

So they need to regulate the construction industry, and improve sanitation service, while also cracking down hard on garbage dumping.  Oh, and also crack down on farmers who burn crop waste - in Delhi, that exceeds even the construction waste during the Fall months

Why not roll out solar, I hear it&#39;s the bestest, cheapest way to generate electricity?Maybe a country that is the 3rd largest solar producer globally with 160GW installed capacity, boasting the worlds single largest solar park, and a city like New Delhi specifically having already over 211MW of roof top solar in place has already thought of that.

India needs to start phasing out its coal-fired power plants. That&#39;s why China is trying to do, but there are so many coal-fire power plants built in the last 30 years shutting them all down will take many years to complete.

Better educational system, lower levels of consanguineous marriages, centrally planned neomercantilism, less disruptive forms of corruption and nepotism, one child policy.

China used to be like that.China managed to do something about it.Why can&#39;t India?You&#39;re begging the question. It took China 3 decades to quarter it&#39;s pollution. India has only very recently started acknowledging they have a problem in the first place. There are already programs in place to address it: mass rollout of solar, improvements in electrical infrastructure to reduce diesel generators (the power goes out so frequently that most buildings have diesel gensets), they converted the entire Tuktuk fleet to compressed natural gas to reduce emissions.The big problem is, a shitton of the

it compares Indian’s response to China’s. China is not good, but is miles better

He must&#39;ve attended that Zuckerberg weekend seminar.

Mod parent Funny? But sometimes I think it would be nice if Slashdot had a simple upvote option for the masses of unmoderating...

No kid should be on social media. Period.

Besides, isn&#39;t addiction something diagnosed by a physician ? I would testify in court i would not venture in giving actual medical diagnostics. I would use other words.

>&quot;No kid should be on social media. Period.&quot;

No kid should be on an unrestricted, internet-connected device without supervision.  Period.

Social media is just one of many potentially bad things on the internet.

No adult should be, either. About the only thing anybody should be doing 16 hours a day is breathing.

No one should be on anything for 16 hours a day unless it&#39;s oxygen or a heart-lung machine.

Sure, but remember: no matter how hot she is, someone somewhere is sick of her shit.

As long as the kid can get 8 hours of sleep, it is totally OK if they spend every waking moment on the social media platform he runs..

I wonder - if it was 20 hours a day, would this idiot still think it wasn&#39;t an addiction.

Muthahfuckah, if you spend TWO THIRDS of your waking time doing a single thing, YOU&#39;RE ADDICTED!

Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s sports, working out, gardening, watching TV, stroking your micro-dick, or browsing InstaShit, spending 16 hours per day on one thing is one of THE most obvious signs of addiction I can think of. And I bet this teenager would display genuine withdrawal symptoms if separated from their phone.

Bingo. If the behavior is compulsive to such a degree that it prevents other normal behavior, such as forming normal relationships or even one&#39;s own hygiene, then that&#39;s addiction. And pretty damn severe addiction in this case.

Time alone doesn&#39;t prove or disprove addiction, even in a hypothetical extreme case.indeed, nothing really does. there is no clear cut definition of addiction, it&#39;s a subjective judgement depending on the perceived harms of the consequences. to some they seem bloody obvious, to some they&#39;re barely perceptible.but representing the question as something that he can reasonably say &quot;Yes&quot;dialectic. they were trying to corner him to admit something that is likely true and would harm his interests, but they overdid it in terms that carry maximum severity but cannot be proven, so he weaseled out. rather easily, actually: he threw it back by escalating it to &quot;it&#39;s not cli

so how many hours a day do you spend choking on nafo brain rot? more than this girl on instagram? you could sue them ...

That&#39;s Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), not addiction. It&#39;s the same thing that makes casinos profitable. Addiction involves chemically moving your homeostasis to the point where your &quot;optimal state,&quot; your ability to function, requires the thing you&#39;re addicted to. You go through physical withdrawal if you stop. Like, you&#39;ll need direct hospital care for withdrawal, sometimes. There are even legal medications that you have to taper off of or you&#39;re in the hospital.

There are so many things that get called addiction, but it&#39;s all OCD. As with any genetic condition, some have it worse than others.

And don&#39;t tell me about endorphins. That&#39;s part of your natural brain chemistry. As is adrenaline, cortisol, and neurotransmitter imbalances. With OCD, you have a chemical imbalance, but they&#39;re not foreign substances. Your genes are predisposed to something that could be good, but could also cause you harm. It&#39;s something that can be leveraged by bad actors, but it&#39;s already there, waiting to go. It is part of your homeostatic condition already. You&#39;ll have to put yourself out of homeostasis to deal with it, which is why in severe cases it&#39;s medicated.

When Zuck manages your dopamine hits, he&#39;s using psychologists to figure out how to optimize the brain chemistry of people who are predisposed to obsessive behavior for his own ends. He&#39;s not a drug dealer using chemists to amp up the speed and intensity of dependency.

Just put away the fucking phone. There will be no significant withdrawal other than an eerie amount of silence. It&#39;ll be like turning on a light once you realize how benighted your life has become. If you need an obsession, get obsessed with exercise or something else of actual value to your life. If you have severe OCD and can&#39;t do that, get psychiatric care. There are plenty of medications to relieve the imbalance.

Remove the infinite scroll from your website. You know damn well it is there as a psychological trap to boost your user &quot;engagement&quot;

The infinite scroll basically turns social media apps into &quot;social media slot machines&quot;.

Small, randomized hits of dopamine that users correlate to their own behaviour get them addicted very quickly.

I suspect users aren&#39;t trying to achieve a rush from using it, if so it&#39;s compulsive behaviour more than an addiction.

Heck you breath 24 hours a day. You can breathe and Insta at the same time!

Alcoholic reasoning. Im not addicted! I can quit any time!

They are like the four horsemen of the apocalypse, yet somehow even worse - and much more boring.

For the non nerds reading this, the Kobayashi Maru is a training exercise in the Star Trek universe designed as a no-win scenario. The goal is to test a cadet&#39;s character in the face of certain death. According to canon, James T. Kirk is the only person to ever &quot;beat&quot; the simulation by reprogramming the simulation so that it was possible to rescue the stranded ship. When accused of cheating, Kirk’s logic was that he changed the conditions of the test. In the corporate world, if the goal is &quot;Problem Solving,&quot; the person who changes the conditions to find a faster, more accurate solution isn&#39;t a cheater - they are an innovator. KPMG failed their own test IMO.

This reminds me of a possibly apocryphal story about a compsci security class. First day of class, the professor walks in, tells the whole class, &quot;Congratulations, you&#39;ve just failed this class.&quot; He then shows them him entering 0s into the database software. &quot;This course is 16 weeks long. Whether you pass or fail is up to you.&quot;

Considering the average big-four suit-n-tie, I would rather trust the LLM in terms of smart answers and actual integrity.

They took the human out of the training and testing to cut corners, the staff played by the same rules!

Make training a personal experience again and this won&#39;t happen

PS: IMHO the partner failed the test because they got caught, part of the test was in fact how to use AI without the clients noticing :-)

We’re coming up on a big national anniversary, the (defiantly unspellable) semiquincentennial. To get in the spirit of things, I’ve been curled up with books about the founders, particularly George Washington, someone I became acquainted with when I wrote a book about him many years ago. But meanwhile, our current president has been honking away in the distance—a man difficult to abide and impossible to ignore.

Despite the glaring differences between Washington and Donald Trump in character, judgment, and historical significance, there are some interesting similarities. Born rich. Aggressive acquirers of real estate. Big-house guys. Thin-skinned, image-conscious. Extremely nationalistic: Trump’s message is Make America Great Again. Washington’s was … Make America.

So why will history judge them as polar opposites? In part because Washington readily and repeatedly gave up power. He did so conspicuously at the end of the War of Independence, then again after eight years as president. He lived in an era in which selflessness was considered one of the core virtues of a great leader, and at crucial moments in our history, he behaved accordingly.

Whereas Trump … well, he’s no George Washington. And he tells us so! He is instinctively royalist and brazenly self-aggrandizing. He repeatedly claims powers he does not legally have. He promiscuously puts his name on everything this side of the moon, and I probably shouldn’t even mention that particular satellite, lest he get ideas.

His decision to appoint himself as chair of the Kennedy Center was outrageous enough, but then he put his name on the place. He also put his name on the United States Institute of Peace, just a few blocks away. His face is all over D.C. now, on huge banners hanging from government buildings. He wants Dulles International Airport named for him, and also Penn Station. His open campaigning for the Nobel Peace Prize was plenty dismaying, but then he threw one of his tantrums when he didn’t get laureated and, in an official letter to the leader of Norway, demanded Greenland in compensation. At this point, we know that Trump is going to be Trump, and if anything, he leans into the narcissism, becoming Trumpier by the day. Trump has learned that his most flamboyantly selfish behavior will likely be ignored or forgiven by his base and political allies. There is no one willing to tell him that You Can’t Do This.

Our nation was founded upon the principle that power derives from the people. We don’t like despots and dictators and monarchs or anything smacking of royalty. That was why the founders were very careful when they crafted the Constitution: The president is just one branch of government, is constrained by checks and balances, and can always be given the heave-ho.

Which takes us back to George Washington. Everyone knew he was going to be the first president—he was right there in the room, presiding, when the founders drew up the Constitution. But they were taking a chance, because no one really knew what a president was. Such a thing didn’t exist anywhere in the world. George Washington had to define the role through his actions.

What modern historians know is that selflessness didn’t come effortlessly to Washington. He had to will it, in tension with his natural, human desires.

This is a subtlety of Washington that Americans weren’t taught in elementary school, and I don’t think the A.I. bots have quite figured it out. A schoolkid asking an A.I. program for help with an essay about Washington will probably get highlights of the man’s consequential life, the first-in-war, first-in-peace stuff, and perhaps learn that he was an enslaver who, like the other founders, failed to end the vile institution of human bondage. But the child is unlikely to find out what Washington was really like. Here’s what ChatGPT produced when I asked it to “write an essay on George Washington’s personality”:

George Washington was a man of great integrity, character, and leadership. His personality was marked by a strong sense of duty, humility, and selflessness. … Despite his many accomplishments and successes, he remained humble and never sought accolades or praise for himself.

Oh, balderdash. Yes, Washington was indeed a man of integrity, character, and leadership. That led him to behave selflessly at critical moments during the founding of our country. But Washington desperately wanted to be a great man, and wanted to be remembered as such. He craved the approbation (one of his favorite words) of his peers and guarded his image as though it were the front line of a war. He sought, as multiple biographers have put it, “secular immortality.”

He didn’t wander into greatness: he pursued it, willed it, achieved it. He had a “monumental ego,” in the words of historian Joseph Ellis. Peter Henriques, an admirer of Washington who has recently published two insightful books on his character, writes that Washington “was not a ‘selfless’ man or one who was simply engaging in disinterested service. Rather, a pattern emerges of a man who was deeply ambitious, massively concerned with his reputation, and in regular search of the public approbation, even as he denied such desires.” This is not revisionist history. This is the man as he really was. Washington is so tied up with the narrative of American greatness and exceptionalism that some people may think it’s wrong to probe him too deeply. Why not just salute and move on? As Alexis Coe put it in her recent biography, “We haven’t been taught to think critically about Washington.”

His avaricious acquisitions of western lands is well known and not incidental to his desire to break from Great Britain, which had tried to limit western migration. When I wrote my book The Grand Idea, about Washington and his Potomac River schemes (he thought it would surely be the great commercial highway to the West), I was a bit shocked at his imperious behavior when he traveled across the mountains into what is now western Pennsylvania and confronted poor farmers who (he alleged) were squatting on his land. He sued them. He forced them to pull up stakes. He could be pretty high-and-mighty, and certainly not exactly a small-d democrat.

And yet his drive, his ambition, his hunger for glory were essential to the enterprise of wresting the colonies from the grip of distant overlords. And his desire for secular immortality didn’t mean he was pretending to have lofty republican sensibilities. He was anti-monarchical to the core.

Washington curated his reputation and polished it for the eyes of future generations. Shortly before his death, he wrote a will that broke apart his vast estate, including more than 50,000 acres of land, and set in motion the freeing of the enslaved people under his legal control (delaying manumission until the death of his wife). These were actions very consciously taken with the eyes of history upon him. He knew that slavery would be a permanent stain on his reputation. And he was right.

Early biographers helped advance the image of a godlike Washington. Most famously, Parson Weems invented from whole cloth the story about young Washington taking a hatchet to his father’s cherry tree, then confessing to it. The early chroniclers, including John Marshall (who fought under Washington’s command and later served as chief justice of the United States), delivered to the public the kind of man that the fragile young nation desired: an unblemished father figure, preposterously virtuous.

Go to the Capitol rotunda and look up at the dome, where Constantino Brumidi’s fresco The Apotheosis of Washington, painted during the Civil War, shows Washington in heaven, flanked by goddesses. You have to strain to see him, way up there, high above this mortal coil. He’s a remote figure, unapproachable. Not like us.

Washington cared a lot about appearances and made sure that he presented himself as a formidable, dignified figure, not someone you’d slap on the back on a whim. He liked a bit of pomp and pizzazz as president. He was meticulous in ordering well-made clothes, and a “chariot” with some gilding wouldn’t be too excessive, he thought. But he had to be careful. If he acted too much like royalty, he’d get spanked by his peers and excoriated by anti-Federalist newspapers. “No Kings” was not just a protest sign in those days.

Human nature has not changed. There have always been people who desire wealth and power. They are never infallible or immune to misjudgment. What changes and evolves are the political ecosystems. Laws change, as do values, societal expectations, the means of communication, the technologies of political life. The norms. Norms can erode.

Trump, the opposite of an enigma, constantly tells us exactly who he is. He reveals this in late-night social media rants (“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”) and unguarded conversations caught on tape (“When you’re a star, they let you do it” and “I just want to find 11,780 votes”).

He is at least consistent in his message. He tells us, over and over, This is all about me. So of course when Rob Reiner and his wife were murdered, Trump immediately said the killings were linked to Reiner’s political opposition to him. His solipsism is nonnegotiable.

Historians will have an overwhelming job of compiling and organizing the confetti of royalist declarations from this president, but let’s simplify their work a bit. The most important moment, the defining one, is obvious: Trump refused to accept that he lost the 2020 election and—another example of action defining character—urged the vice president and an unruly mob to halt the peaceful transfer of power. That’s as un–George Washington as it gets. Washington knew he was part of something bigger than himself. He had helped create a nation, but it didn’t belong to him. So after eight years fashioning the office of the presidency, he did something simple and exemplary: He went home.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, a newsletter that never once had lunch on Jeffrey Epstein’s island. [Epstein file comes out.] Oh, come on, that was a brunch.

We’ve got it all this week: Epstein. The Kennedys. Bridge scandals involving new bridges and rival bridge owners. Democratic mega-gerrymanders. TARIFF VOTES.

But the concept of this edition—in the Sgt. Pepper’s sense of a “concept,” in that it ends after a couple of tracks—is the audience of one, and how some Trump administration appointees will almost intentionally do their jobs badly to stay in the boss’s good graces. Unusual dynamic. Cheers!

On Tuesday, prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia, led by Jeanine Pirro, sought and failed to indict six Democratic lawmakers—four House members and two senators—who recorded a social media video last year in which they reminded service members of their obligation to refuse illegal orders. What were the exact charges? Who knows. Whatever they were, the grand jury in D.C. didn’t just reject them as a body. As NBC News reported, zero members of the grand jury found the charges up to snuff. Separately, a judge this week smacked down Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s attempt to punish Sen. Mark Kelly, a veteran and one of the six who made the video, saying that Hegseth’s targeting of Kelly had “trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms.”

Why would Pirro and Hegseth subject themselves to such total humiliation and stark legal rebuke? Don’t they realize that a neutral observer would consider them historically bad at their jobs? Their audience of one, though, is not a neutral observer. The November video that those six Democrats released incensed Donald Trump, who posted on social media at the time that it was “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL” and “punishable by DEATH!” There seems to be an understanding among Trump’s political appointees now that not doing the illegal action—refusing an illegal order, as one might put it—isn’t an option. Instead, it’s better to humor him by pursuing it and letting some element of the legal system—a judge, a grand jury—do the dirty work of keeping the rule of law at least somewhat intact. And while it’s nice when the legal system does its job, the Surge still believes that the best course of action is for government officials not to violate the constitutional rights of Trump’s enemies in the first place.

We must still allow ourselves to be shocked from time to time, and Attorney General Pam Bondi’s performance before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday ably did the job. She shouted and yelled and acted as if she were the one who was being shouted and yelled at, responded to various questions from Democratic members with unrelated oppo her staff had googled about them, suggested that members needed to apologize to Trump for having impeached him, and otherwise made a fool of herself. After Rep. Jerry Nadler asked how many Epstein co-conspirators she had indicted, she went on a rant about how great the stock market is doing under Trump. She called the Democratic ranking member of the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a “washed-up loser lawyer!” (Raskin, in a fortunate bit of scheduling, was able to discuss his day with Bondi later that evening at a live taping of Slate’s Political Gabfest.)

Is there one person to whom this deeply embarrassing performance would have appealed? Someone who thinks talking about stock-market gains under Trump in response to unrelated questions is a winning strategy, who believes that those asking difficult questions suffer from “Trump derangement syndrome,” who thinks lawmakers should apologize to Donald Trump for having investigated and impeached him? Exactly. This was the most degrading congressional performance for the audience of one in recent memory. “AG Pam Bondi, under intense fire from the Trump Deranged Radical Left Lunatics, was fantastic at yesterday’s Hearing,” Trump posted Thursday. Bondi had been successful in saving her job, at great expense to her personal and our national dignity, for another few days.

Speaker Mike Johnson, at the White House’s request, tried to pass a rule this week preventing Democrats from forcing votes to repeal Trump’s tariffs. Republicans had been successful in passing such rules last year, and the vote this week was to extend the blockade through the summer. This time, however, it didn’t work: The rule vote failed, 217–214, as three Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it. It’s now open season on Trump’s tariffs, as House Democrats will repeatedly force their GOP counterparts to choose between a president who expects loyalty and bad policy (and politics). Within a day of the failed rule vote, the House voted to nix Trump’s Canada tariffs.

Like clockwork, Trump issued a threat, warning that “any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!” But what does this pocket of members voting against tariffs care? Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon, a regularly targeted swing-district member, is retiring this cycle. He voted against the rule, then left the premises so leaders couldn’t twist his arm. So, too, did California Rep. Kevin Kiley, who’s been redistricted off the planet in the Redistricting Wars (that Trump started). The last GOP member to vote against the rule was Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who’s solidly in Trump enemy territory at this point. The House GOP’s margin is tight enough that it takes only a couple of House members to upend Johnson’s, and the White House’s, plans. And the ranks of GOP defectors may swell once primary season is over too.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Jeffrey Epstein were next-door neighbors on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. According to Lutnick, though, they barely knew each other. In a story Lutnick told on a podcast last year, he and his wife went in Epstein’s house once in 2005, got a house tour, and “decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,” adding, “I was never in the room with him socially, for business or even philanthropy.” As the Epstein files revealed, though, that wasn’t true. Lutnick and his family visited Epstein on his island in 2012, and the two were in business and otherwise corresponding sporadically over the years; at least one email suggests they had scheduled drinks.

So does “lying about having not been to the Epstein island” constitute a firing from Trump’s Cabinet? Not as of yet. Trump likes having Good-Time Howie around, for one, and if he starts doling out consequences to people for their associations with Epstein, well, that would put Trump himself in quite a corner. That Lutnick’s future in the Cabinet has been a live question all week speaks mostly to the number of enemies he’s made in Congress and the administration for his sycophancy on behalf of Trump’s worst impulses.

Virginia state Democrats’ proposed mid-decade gerrymander of their state is an assault on the eyes. The new map—if it skirts legal challenges and is approved by voters in an April referendum—could net Democrats four new congressional seats this year, converting its current delegation, six Democrats and five Republicans, into a 10–1 split. It achieves this in part by divvying up the trove of Democratic votes in dense Northern Virginia suburbs across the state, with narrow arms slinking south and west to rural communities that have very little in common with Arlington or Fairfax County. It’s some filthy, filthy stuff that will make for incoherent districts and stifle Republican congressional representation in a merely lean-blue state.

All of which is to say: womp—and again, womp. The move was a political necessity for Democrats, and the great many Virginia-based Republican operatives and pundits grousing about it should blame their president. Trump made a conscious move to kick off the mid-decade redistricting fight by urging Texas, Ohio, Missouri, Indiana, North Carolina, Florida, and anywhere else where Republicans could squeeze out a seat or five to redraw their maps. Retaliation happens. The Surge is all for a federal remedy, or a network of interstate compacts, to address this absurd trend of hyper-gerrymandering everywhere, but until then: no crying. As Virginia state Sen. Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, a fascinating 82-year-old edgelord who pushed for the new maps, replied to a griping Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, “You all started it and we fucking finished it.” (Although, honestly, the Supreme Court may be the ones who fucking finish it, sooner or later.)

On Monday, Trump posted that he would block the opening of a new U.S.–Canada bridge between Detroit and Windsor “until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them.” All right. He’s still mad at Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney for cutting a trade deal with China and for generally—here we go, we’re going to deploy this stupid word and see what happens—mogging him at Davos. So he won’t let Canada open a bridge that would ease congestion at a major international commercial crossing, which speaks to Carney’s general point about how the United States has become too irrational an actor to lead the global order.

But there’s more! Matthew Moroun, the billionaire owner of an existing, rival bridge—the Ambassador Bridge—has for years fought against the creation of the new bridge. And as the New York Times reported, Moroun met with the one and only Howard Lutnick on Monday, hours before Trump’s post, after which Lutnick spoke to Trump by phone. Trump’s post came after that telephone conversation. And with that, another episode’s worth of major investigation that would’ve done meaningful damage to any previous administration is added to the mountainous pile.

One of the most coveted congressional seats in the country is up for grabs now that longtime Rep. Jerry Nadler is retiring. New York’s 12th Congressional District covers the heart of Manhattan, and there’s an unsurprisingly long list of candidates. There’s Micah Lasher, a New York state Assembly member and former aide to Gov. Kathy Hochul, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Nadler, who has endorsed him. There’s Alex Bores, another Assembly member who’s being targeted by corporate A.I. money after supporting an A.I. safety bill. There is George Conway, the conservative lawyer turned anti-Trumper and #Resistance celebrity. And many more.

And then there is Jack Schlossberg, JFK’s 33-year-old grandkid who didn’t do much of anything until he started posting weird stuff online a few years ago and briefly pretended to work as a reporter in 2024, deciding he’d like a congressional seat. It wasn’t taken all that seriously. And then, this week, he earned the endorsement of none other than former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in what the Times described as “the most high-profile endorsement so far, of any candidate.” In a statement, Pelosi said, “This moment calls for leaders who understand the stakes and how to deliver for the people they serve.” And that’s … Jack Schlossberg, is it? Huh. The Kennedy mystique is strong in this one.

The machinery to enable Stephen Miller’s darkest deportation dreams is both tangible and legal. In this week’s show, Dahlia Lithwick explores the statutory and regulatory foundations of the Trump administration’s expanding network of detention camps, plus the historical background of the vast warehouse system they are using to imprison tens of thousands of migrants. First, she speaks with Linus Chan, who represents Minnesotans detained by ICE, he teaches law at the University of Minnesota School of Law. Chan describes how the most basic right of habeas corpus has been whittled away by the courts to a filament when it comes to immigration law, allowing the federal government to weaponize brutal detention against ordinary Americans.

Next, Dahlia is in conversation with Andrea Pitzer, about her chilling and urgent new piece, Building the camps: The warehouseification of detention and initial thoughts on stopping it. It is essential reading (and listening!) in light of the billion dollar detention camp system being built in warehouses near you in cities around the nation.

If you want to check if your town is on the list, Andrea recommends checking out Project Salt Box.

            <div id="article-text">Canada Goose says an advertised breach of 600,000 records is an old raid and there are no signs of a recent compromise.

The down-filled jacket purveyor did not answer questions about how old the data is or how it was originally taken, but told us it relates to past customer purcahses.

&quot;Canada Goose is aware that a historical dataset relating to past customer transactions has recently been published online,&quot; a spokesperson said. &quot;At this time, we have no indication of any breach of our own systems. We are currently reviewing the newly released dataset to assess its accuracy and scope, and will take any further steps as may be appropriate.&quot;

&quot;To be clear, our review shows no evidence that unmasked financial data was involved. Canada Goose remains committed to protecting customer information.&quot;

ShinyHunters posted the company&#39;s data for download on February 14 via their leak site. The criminals&#39; advert for the data claimed there were more than 600,000 records, each containing personally identifiable information, as well as payment/financial details.

The Register reviewed a number of the records available online via a JSON file, and ShinyHunters&#39; description of the data appears accurate.

It includes names and other usual PII data points, as well as partial payment information and order details, such as price and delivery address.

A cursory scan suggests affected individuals appear to be based across North America and Europe.

ShinyHunters has had a busy start to 2026: the cybercriminals now have their own data leak site, and have posted a number of high-profile victims this year alone.

Crunchbase and Betterment, two examples of these scalps, were raided as part of the group&#39;s targeting of Okta accounts through voice phishing.

Among the other victims are SoundCloud, Match Group, Panera Bread, Harvard University, and wealth management firm Mercer Advisors.

Last year, the criminal crew was linked to attacks on Salesforce, which led to the theft of data belonging to more than 200 of the company&#39;s customers, as well as SalesLoft Drift, a Salesforce integration that compromised various Salesforce instances. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Dutch police have arrested a man for &quot;computer hacking&quot; after accidentally handing him their own sensitive files and then getting annoyed when he didn&#39;t hand them back.

The Politie said on Monday that a 40-year-old man from Ridderkerk was arrested on Thursday after he wound up with confidential documents thanks to what officers acknowledge was their own cock-up.

The chain of events reads less like a breach and more like an own goal. In connection with a separate investigation, the man contacted the police on February 12 to report he had images that might be relevant. An officer responded by sending him a link so he could upload the files – except the link sent was a download link, effectively giving him access to confidential police documents.

The man did not actively break in or exploit a vulnerability in the traditional sense; he simply clicked the link he was given and gained access to material he was never meant to see.

Dutch cops say they told him to stop and delete the material, but he allegedly refused, saying he would only do so if he &quot;received something in return.&quot;

He did, in the end, get something in return – a trip in the back of a police car.

Officers arrested the man Thursday evening, searched his home, and seized data storage devices to recover the documents and prevent them from being shared further. Police say they have also reported the incident as a data breach and are continuing their investigation.

Police also offered a lesson in link etiquette, writing: &quot;If you receive a download link knowing you should be receiving an upload link, are clearly told not to download, and then choose to download the files anyway, you may be guilty of computer trespassing.&quot;

Authorities have not disclosed what kind of documents were exposed, how sensitive the haul was, or whether the stash included personal data or files tied to ongoing investigations. The Dutch police did not respond to The Register&#39;s questions.

The charge cited is &quot;computervredebreuk,&quot; which is broadly equivalent to unauthorized access to computer systems, though the circumstances – namely that the access was the result of a police blunder – may raise uncomfortable questions about where liability actually sits when the front door is left wide open. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Oracle has promised a &quot;decisive new approach&quot; to MySQL, the popular open source database it owns, following growing criticism of its approach and the prospect of a significant fork in the code.

In a blog post published last week, Big Red, which acquired MySQL with Sun Microsystems in 2009, said MySQL has new engineering leadership at the company and &quot;a clear vision for 2026 and beyond.&quot;

The move follows criticism of Oracle&#39;s commitment to MySQL development over the past couple of years, which culminated in influential MySQL open source community members and users banding together to discuss their options, including forking the code and exploring an independent foundation model for governance.

In the post, Frederic Descamps, Oracle MySQL community manager, promised a new era of community engagement from the vendor. He said Oracle would take a three-pronged approach, firstly by introducing developer-focused features into the open source MySQL Community Edition. He said Big Red also planned to &quot;extend and enrich&quot; the developer community by offering more tools, frameworks, and connectors for MySQL.

&quot;Finally, we are increasing transparency and encouraging broader community participation, ensuring that more voices help guide MySQL&#39;s evolution,&quot; he said.

He added that more details would become available in a public webinar. As part of the new approach, Oracle has committed to greater transparency, answering one common complaint that it simply dumped new code without much discussion.

&quot;We will be publishing the development roadmap and facilitating contributions from the community – including worklogs and bug reports. There is great potential in community-driven extensibility, and we look forward to partnering directly with those interested in building the next generation of MySQL tools and extensions,&quot; Descamps said.

At a pre-FOSDEM MySQL and Friends event in Belgium last month, Oracle promised to take steps to &quot;repair&quot; its relationship with the MySQL community by moving &quot;commercial-only&quot; features into the database application&#39;s Community Edition and prioritizing developer needs. According to a summary seen by The Register, the key features include vector functions, which are considered critical for AI workloads.

Vadim Tkachenko previously worked for MySQL AB, the Swedish company that developed the database before it was bought by Sun Microsystems. Now CTO at open source consultancy Percona, he told us last month that MySQL was at a fork in the road under Oracle&#39;s management, with the developer community now having to choose its future: either under Oracle or as part of a different model. A group of developers and users met in San Francisco in January to discuss their options.

MySQL&#39;s founding developer, Michael &quot;Monty&quot; Widenius, last year said he was &quot;heartbroken&quot; on hearing the news of job losses at Oracle&#39;s MySQL engineering team, while the system has seen a dramatic fall in the number of commits to the project. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Academics say they found a series of flaws affecting three popular password managers, all of which claim to protect user credentials in the event that their servers are compromised.

The team, comprised of researchers from ETH Zurich and Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), examined the &quot;zero-knowledge encryption&quot; promises made by Bitwarden, LastPass, and Dashlane, finding all three could expose passwords if attackers compromised servers.

The premise of zero-knowledge encryption is that user passwords are encrypted on their device, and the password manager&#39;s server acts merely as a dumb storage box for the encrypted credentials. Therefore, in the event that the vendor&#39;s servers are controlled by malicious parties, attackers wouldn&#39;t be able to view users&#39; secrets.

As one of the most popular alternatives to Apple and Google&#39;s own password managers, which together dominate the market, the researchers found Bitwarden was most susceptible to attacks, with 12 working against the open-source product. Seven distinct attacks worked against LastPass, and six succeeded in Dashlane.

The attacks don&#39;t exploit weaknesses in the same way that remote attackers could exploit vulnerabilities and target specific users. Instead, the researchers worked to test each platform&#39;s ability to keep secrets safe in the event they were compromised.

In most cases where attacks were successful, the researchers said they could retrieve encrypted passwords from the user, and in some cases, change the entries.

They used a malicious server model to test all of this – setting up servers that behaved like hacked versions of those used by the password managers. Seven of Bitwarden&#39;s 12 successful attacks led to password disclosure, whereas only three of LastPass&#39;s attacks led to the same end, and one for Dashlane.

All three vendors claim their products come with zero-knowledge encryption. The researchers noted that none of them outline the specific threat model their password manager secures against.

The researchers said: &quot;The majority of our attacks require simple interactions which users or their clients perform routinely as part of their usage of the product, such as logging in to their account, opening the vault and viewing the items, or performing periodic synchronization of data.

&quot;We also present attacks that require more complex user actions, such as key rotations, joining an organization, sharing credentials, or even clicking on a misleading dialog. Although assessing the probability of these actions is challenging, we believe that, within a vast user base, many users will likely perform them.&quot;

In the full paper [PDF], they went on to argue that password managers have escaped deep academic scrutiny until now, unlike end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. It is perhaps due to a perception that password managers are simple applications – deriving keys and then encrypting them. However, their codebases are more complex than that, often offering features such as the ability to share accounts with family members and featuring various ways to maintain backward-compatibility with older encryption standards.

Kenneth Paterson, professor of computer science at ETH Zurich, said &quot;we were surprised by the severity of the security vulnerabilities&quot; affecting the password managers.

&quot;Since end-to-end encryption is still relatively new in commercial services, it seems that no one had ever examined it in detail before.&quot;

The team&#39;s primary recommendation for vendors is to ensure that new users have access to the latest cryptographic standards by default.

One of the main reasons password manager providers haven&#39;t upgraded their codebases is that they fear doing so would irrevocably lose existing users&#39; secrets. The researchers said that some vendors have gone to extreme lengths to support older formats, which in turn creates complexity in the code.

The best way forward? The researchers suggested ensuring all new users are onboarded with the latest cryptographic standards, while offering existing customers the choice between migrating to them or staying put, but with the knowledge of the vulnerabilities.

&quot;We want our work to help bring about change in this industry,&quot; said Paterson. He claimed: &quot;The providers of password managers should not make false promises to their customers about security but instead communicate more clearly and precisely what security guarantees their solutions actually offer.&quot;

Dashlane published a comprehensive response, thanking the researchers, and said the infoseccers&#39; decision to test using a malicious server model represented &quot;a useful exercise.&quot;

The vendor also confirmed it had fixed the most serious issue – the attack researchers showed could lead to the disclosure of a password, and published a separate security advisory devoted to that.

&quot;Dashlane has fixed an issue that, if Dashlane&#39;s servers were fully compromised, could have allowed a downgrade of the encryption model used to generate encryption keys and protect user vaults,&quot; it said. &quot;This downgrade could result in the compromise of a weak or easily guessable Master Password, and the compromise of individual &#39;downgraded&#39; vault items.

&quot;This issue was the result of the allowed use of legacy cryptography. This legacy cryptography was supported by Dashlane in certain cases for backward compatibility and migration flexibility.

&quot;Dashlane has removed support for this legacy cryptography, which means these downgrade attacks are no longer possible.&quot;

Bitwarden, meanwhile, said in a post: &quot;Bitwarden has never been breached and believes third-party security assessments like these are critical to continue providing state of the art security to individuals and organizations.&quot;

It added: &quot;Thank you ETH Zurich for your insights and commitment to stronger password security.&quot;

A LastPass spokesperson told The Reg: &quot;Our Security team is grateful for the opportunity to engage with ETH Zurich and benefit from their research. While our own assessment of these risks may not fully align with the severity ratings assigned by the ETH Zurich team, we take all reported security findings seriously. We have already implemented multiple near‑term hardening measures while also establishing plans to remediate or reinforce the relevant components of our service on a timeline commensurate with the assessed risk.&quot;

The researchers said the vendors responded constructively to their outreach attempts and were working to mitigate the exploited weaknesses.

The researchers said it is highly likely that the same weaknesses they highlighted in the study apply to other vendors across the industry, and couldn&#39;t rule out the possibility the attacks are already known to the more advanced hackers, including those with government backing. ®

            <div id="article-text">AIpocolypse A partner at accounting and consultancy giant KPMG in Australia was forced to cough up a AU$10k ($7,084/ £5,195) fine after he used AI to ace an internal training course on... AI.

Faced with questions on the use of AI, the unnamed partner uploaded training materials to an AI platform to help generate his response, according to a report in the FT.

The partner was just one of more than two dozen staff who have been rumbled for using AI tooling while taking internal exams, the consulting giant confirmed.

The unnamed KPMG partner&#39;s attempted use of AI on an internal test was first reported by the Australian Financial Review, and was flagged up in an Australian senate inquiry into governance.

Barbara Pocock, a senator with Australia&#39;s Greens party, referred to a &quot;misdemeanor&quot; at the firm, and said she was disappointed with the fine. &quot;We&#39;ve got a toothless system where con artists... get away with so much,&quot; she told a parliamentary committee last week.

KPMG Australia chief exec Andrew Yates was quoted as saying it was &quot;grappling&quot; with the impact of AI when it comes to internal training and testing.

&quot;It&#39;s a very hard thing to get on top of given how quickly society has embraced it,&quot; he said.

A KPMG spokesperson confirmed the FT story and told The Register the &quot;two dozen&quot; figure was confined to Australia. No similar reports have emerged outside the antipodes, apparently.

The accounting and consulting biz is not alone in its struggle. Rival Deloitte Australia had to refund a large chunk of the fee for a report it produced for the Australian government last year.

The report was littered with AI hallucinations, including imagined quotes from a court ruling and non-existent academic research.

In the UK, West Midlands&#39; chief constable Craig Guildford was prompted into retirement earlier this year after it emerged his force relied on Copilot when considering whether to block Israeli football fans from an Aston Villa - Maccabi Tel Aviv match.

The research threw up concerns about disruption at a match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and West Ham. The only problem being no such match occurred.

Guildford&#39;s acting successor, Scott Green, said the matter is being investigated by IPSO and the force&#39;s own professional standards department. In the meantime, he said, Copilot had been switched off across the force. For now, at least. ®

            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk-owned social media platform X is experiencing an outage, with users worldwide reporting that their timelines no longer show the usual information flow.

X (formerly Twitter) does not have a status page to indicate what is up or down, although its Developer Platform Status page said: &quot;All systems are operational.&quot; A glance at the incident history page shows that everything has been hunky dory so far in February.

However, for users expecting to see their timeline filled with the usual content, there is only emptiness. X.com appears to still be online, but the timeline is not loading.

Other users, according to xAI&#39;s Grok chatbot, have also experienced login failures, app or website load and refresh failures, and error messages across mobile apps and desktop.

The Register contacted the company to find out what happened, and how long the outage is likely to last, but we have yet to receive a response.

Problems started around 1300 UTC, and reports have flowed into the Downdetector website. The outage appears to be worldwide.

One user noted: &quot;The world is temporarily a better place.&quot;

X was last knocked offline after a recent outage at Cloudflare, although the cause of today&#39;s issue is not yet revealed. With luck, Musk will explain when the service staggers back to its feet.

Several users of rival services reacted with glee to the platform&#39;s misfortune. One on Bluesky posted: &quot;Good news.&quot;

Musk acquired Twitter in 2022 in a deal worth $44 billion. He dispensed with many employees and rebranded the company as X. The platform has since weathered an initial exodus of advertisers and users, as well as controversy after its AI chatbot, Grok, described itself as &quot;MechaHitler&quot; in 2025, which sent the X team scrambling to remove &quot;inappropriate posts.&quot; ®

Cross-platform encrypted messages between iPhone and Android are coming soon.

Apple is starting to test end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages with the developer beta of iOS 26.4 released Monday. Apple announced plans last year to support the feature, and once fully available, it will let iPhone and Android users send encrypted RCS messages to each other across platforms.

However, with this initial implementation, Apple is only testing RCS encryption between Apple devices. It’s “not yet testable with other platforms,” Apple says. The company also doesn’t plan to ship E2EE RCS messages with iOS 26.4; the feature will actually ship publicly in a “future update,” Apple says.

RCS messages significantly improve the experience of texting between iPhone and Android devices, but cross-platform encryption has been a big thing missing. The GSM Association, which helps develop RCS, announced in September 2024 that it was working on E2EE messages as part of the “next major milestone” for the RCS Universal Profile, and Apple said in March 2025 that it would support E2EE RCS messages on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in “future software updates.”

The first iOS 26.4 developer beta also includes ability to “seamlessly” swap between audio and video podcasts.

A new way to watch video podcasts that isn’t just hopping over to YouTube.

Apple is upgrading its Podcasts app to let users “seamlessly” swap between audio and video podcasts using its HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) technology. While listening to a show, users will be able to switch to a horizontal video version of the podcast and download the video versions of a podcast for offline viewing.

By giving users the option to quickly change between audio and video, Apple might be able to keep users from jumping to other platforms to watch episodes of their favorite shows. Video is becoming an increasingly popular way to consume podcasts, with YouTube saying last February that more than 1 billion people watch podcasts on the platform every month. Spotify is making a big push into video as well, and Netflix recently launched its own original podcasts and has licensed shows from Spotify and iHeartMedia.

The new features in Apple’s Podcasts app will officially launch this spring, but they will be available to test starting Monday as part of betas for iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, and visionOS 26.4. HLS video will also come to the web version of the Podcasts app in the spring. Apple says that video will integrate “seamlessly into existing shows without disrupting followers or downloads, and creators can monetize through sponsorships and dynamic advertising.”

New MacBooks, iPads, iPhone 17e, displays, and more are possible.﻿

Apple is hosting a “special Apple experience” in New York City on Wednesday, March 4th at 9AM ET, instead of at the Apple Park location it typically uses for events. It’s also hosting press in the cities of London and Shanghai at the same time.

The invitation includes the words “You’re invited” and an Apple logo depicted in segmented discs of yellow, green, and blue (the rumored colors of a new low-cost MacBook). Otherwise, it provides no hints about the purpose of the so-called experience. However, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has previously said that he’s expecting Apple to launch a low-cost A18 Pro chip-powered MacBook and new MacBook Airs, MacBook Pros, and Mac displays ”over the course of the next several weeks,“ alongside the iPhone 17e, a new base model iPad, and an M4 iPad Air. And maybe we’ll even see a preview of Apple’s new AI-infused Siri.

Apple’s don’t-call-it-an-event will be taking place during the big Mobile World Congress show Barcelona, Spain, which is running between March 2nd-5th.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The security camera maker’s Search Party feature, advertised during the Super Bowl, has sparked a surveillance backlash.

Today, let’s talk about the camera company Ring, lost dogs, and the surveillance state.

You probably saw this ad during the Super Bowl a couple of weekends ago:

Since it aired for a massive audience at the Super Bowl, Ring’s Search Party commercial has become a lightning rod for controversy — it’s easy to see how the same technology that can find lost dogs can be used to find people, and then used to invade our privacy in all kinds of uncomfortable ways, by cops and regular people alike.

Ring in particular has always been proud of its cooperation with law enforcement. That raises big questions about our civil rights, especially since Ring announced a partnership last fall with a company called Flock Safety, whose systems have been accessed by ICE. There’s some complication to that — we’ll come back to it in a bit.

The backlash to Ring’s Super Bowl ad was swift, intense, and effective: the data company PeakMetrics says conversation about the ad on social platforms like X actually peaked two days after the Super Bowl, and the vibes, as they measured them, were strikingly negative. I mean, you know it’s bad when Matt Nelson, who runs the weratedogs account, is posting videos like this:

Sen. Ed Markey called the ad “dystopian” and said it was proof Amazon, which owns Ring, needed to cease all facial recognition technology on Ring doorbells. He said, “This definitely isn’t about dogs — it’s about mass surveillance.”

And then, on Thursday, February 12th, just four days after the Super Bowl, Ring announced it was canceling its partnership with Flock, in a statement first reported by The Verge’s Jen Tuohy. That statement itself is a lot:

Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated. As a result, we have made the joint decision to cancel the planned integration. The integration never launched, so no Ring customer videos were ever sent to Flock Safety.

The company also goes on to say that Ring cameras were used by police in identifying a school shooter at Brown University in December 2025. It’s an odd non sequitur in a press release about canceling a controversial partnership that really explains a lot about Ring, and how the company sees itself.

As it happens, Ring’s founder Jamie Siminoff was just on Decoder a few months ago, talking about how and why he founded the company, and in detail about why he sees Ring’s mission as eliminating crime. Not selling cameras or doorbells, or floodlights, or anything else Ring makes, but getting rid of crime.

We actually talked about Search Party and how people might feel about that kind of surveillance, and how Ring works with the cops quite a bit. In fact, Jamie briefly left Ring in 2023, and the company slowed down on its work with law enforcement. But ever since he returned, the emphasis on crime and the work with police has only intensified. I asked him about it:

NILAY PATEL: You left, Amazon said we’re going to stop working with police, you came back, boy, Ring is going to work with police again. You have a partnership with Axon, which makes the taser, that allows law enforcement to get access to Ring footage. Did that feel like a two-way door? They made the wrong decision in your absence, and you came back and said, “We’re going to do this again”?

JAMIE SIMINOFF: I don’t know if it’s wrong or right, but I think different leadership does different things. I do believe that I spent a lot of time going on ride-alongs. I spent a lot of time in areas that I’d say are not safe for those people, and I’ve seen a lot of things where I think we can positively impact them. So, we don’t work with police in the way of ... I just want to be careful, as we’re not ... What we do allow is for agencies to ask for footage when something happens. We allow our neighbors, which I’ll say in this point are our customers, just to be clear, we allow our customers to anonymously decide whether or not they want to partake in that.

So, if they decide they don’t want to be part of this network and don’t want to help this public service agency that asks them, they just say no. If they decide that they do want to, which, by the way, a lot of people want to increase the security of their neighborhoods. A lot of people want their kids to grow up in safer neighborhoods, a lot of people want to have the tools to do that, and are in places that are dangerous. We give them the ability to say yes and make it more efficient for them to communicate with those public service agencies, and also do it in a very auditable digital format.

That’s the other side. Today, without these tools, if a police officer wanted to go and get footage from something, they’d have to go and knock on the door and ask you, and that’s not comfortable for anyone. There’s no digital audit trail of it, and, with this, they can do it efficiently with an audit trail. It is very clear, and it’s anonymous.

Jamie actually talked a lot about searching for dogs in this context, because one of the reasons he was so excited to come back to Ring was to use AI to search through the massive amounts of video generated by Ring cameras. In fact, he told me that Ring could not have built Search Party five years ago, because AI systems to do it weren’t available.

Jamie is nothing if not direct about this, which I appreciate. The man really thinks you can use AI and cameras to reduce or even eliminate crime. But I had a lot of questions about this:

JAIME SIMINOFF: But when you put AI into it, now, all of a sudden, you have this human element that AI gives you. I think, with our products in neighborhoods and, again, you have to be a little bit specific to it, I do see a path where we can actually start to take down crime in a neighborhood to call it close to zero. And I even said, there are some crimes that you can’t stop, of course.

NILAY PATEL: Mechanically, walk people through what you mean. You put enough Ring products in a neighborhood, and then AI does what to them that helps you get closer to the mission of zeroing out crime?

So, the mental model, or how I look at it, is that AI allows us to have ... If you had a neighborhood where you had unlimited resources, so every house had security guards and those security guards were people that worked the same house for 10 years or 20 years, and I mean that from a knowledge perspective. So, the knowledge they had of that house was extreme; they knew everything about you and that residence and your family, how you lived, the people that came in and out.

And then, if that neighborhood had an HOA with, call it private security, and those private security were also around and knew everything, what would happen? When a dog gets lost, you’d be like, “Oh, my gosh, my dog is lost.” Well, they would call each other, and one of them would find the dog very quickly. So, how do we change that and bring that into the digital world is—

Can I just ask you a question about that neighborhood specifically?

Do you ever stop and consider that that neighborhood might suck? Just the idea that every house on my street would have all-knowing private security guards, and I would have an HOA, and that HOA would have a private security force.

You can easily paint that as dystopia. Everyone’s so afraid that we have private cops on every corner, and I’m paying HOA fees, which is just a nightmare of its own.

So, I would assume you live in a safe neighborhood.

No, today, I’d go to ... If you want, I’ll take you to a place where people live and have to, when they get home from school, lock their doors and stay in their house, and they can’t go out and—

But I’m just saying that that model is “everybody is so afraid that they have private cops.”

I think the model is that doing crime in a neighborhood like that is not profitable, and I think that you want people to move into another job. I don’t think that crime is a good thing and so I think ... But listen, it certainly is an argument to have, I do believe that ... I think safer neighborhoods allow for kids to grow up in a better environment and I think that allows them to be able to focus on the things that matter and so that’s what we’re going for.

The model is that there are cops everywhere. That level of privacy.

Yeah, it’s not cops. I think it’s more that you’ll have the ability to understand what’s happening. It’s not like ... But yeah, I think, listen, it’s a fair statement, I guess. I think I want to live in a safe place.

There’s a lot of intelligence in your neighborhood, and maybe it’s private security, maybe it’s not. What does the AI do? Does it just make the camera smarter? It lets you do a more intelligent assessment of what the cameras are seeing?

Right now, we just say motion detection, motion detection, motion detection. It’s funny, when I started Ring… The book was fun because I got to go back and actually go through this whole story of how this thing came to be, and motion detection was an amazing invention. You’re in the airport, and there’s a motion at your front door, and you look at it like, “Wow, this is crazy.”

Now, with AI, we shouldn’t be telling you about motion detection; we should be telling you what’s there, when you should look at it, when it matters, and we shouldn’t be bothering you all the time. That’s what I mean by this idea of these security guards at your house or in your neighborhood. There should be this intelligence in your neighborhood that can tell you when you should be trying to be part of something, but not always tell you. So, it’s not just like, “Car, car, dog, person, person.” It’s like, “Hey, look at this. You want to pay attention to this right now.”

I really pressed Jamie on this because I still don’t think it is entirely clear how Ring accomplishes the elimination of crime through AI alone. And it’s why people don’t trust the company when it says it won’t use systems that can find a dog to do things that otherwise violate our rights. After all, if your goal is to use AI to stop crime, and you built an AI system that can find a dog… well, it’s pretty obvious what comes next, right?

NILAY PATEL: Do you think when you talk about zero out crime in a neighborhood, the idea that everyone in a neighborhood has one of those illuminated Ring signs in the front yard, is that enough to—

Is that just enough of a deterrent? The bad guys will know their face is going to be captured on video, and that will be analyzed by an AI, and something will happen. Do you have to do more outbound deterrents?

I think that’s a part of it. Awareness is a big part of it. I think there are ways with lights also, using lighting to do stuff, that’s a big part of it. I think having just ... If, all of a sudden, someone comes outside because something’s an anomaly, that’s a big part of it. It doesn’t have to be some crazy thing. And that’s what I was saying, is a lot of these little things add up to make that work.

So, when you think about it, okay, we can bring crime down in a neighborhood to close to zero in a neighborhood, what are the ratcheting steps? Does everyone just get the Ring camera, and your platform does all the work? Is it that someone gets caught and they tell all their friends in jail that they got caught? What are the steps?

I think it’s really about bringing neighbors together for this particular thing. So, it’s about how you individually… and we’ve always thought about how each house is its own node controlled by the neighbors, so controlled by the person, and I’ll keep going back to that, which is one hundred percent, your video is in your control; everything you’re doing is in your control, whether you want to take part in anything is in your control. That has to be the first layer of all of it.

But then, when something happens, do you want to take part in it? So, if you get an alert that this dog looks like the dog that’s in front of your house, can you contact your neighbor? You can decide not to take part in it, and then no one will ever know, and it’s fine, it’s just basically deleted, or you can take part in it. I think that’s how we can do things that can make a neighborhood into this node where individual neighbors are all on their own, but when things happen, they can work together as they want to.

And you think that AI will accelerate the process?

I think AI is a co-pilot. It is their assistant, and it’s helping them to figure this out. Because, again, if you’re just getting every motion alert, and if you have eight cameras and you’re just getting motion alerts all day, no human being can parse all this data. So that’s what I was talking to Jen about, is that I do think I see a way to use AI to help feed better data to us, which allows us to make better decisions and work together better.

This is where we get to Flock, which Ring announced a partnership with in October 2025. Flock primarily makes cameras and systems to search video for the cops. You’ve probably seen Flock’s devices where you live — they’re those little solar-powered cameras and tracking devices affixed to streetlights or placed in the center of parking lots. They vacuum up large amounts of data, and the company claims it is anonymized before it’s made available to partners, which in most cases is local law enforcement.

However, according to in-depth reporting from the excellent 404 Media, Flock’s data has often found its way to ICE, the FBI, the Secret Service, and other law enforcement agencies, without the requirement of a warrant. That’s because that data is willingly provided by local police.

Last month, under intense scrutiny about what a deal with Flock would mean, Ring said that this partnership was not yet “live,” and that, “Ring has no partnership with ICE, does not give ICE videos, feeds, or back-end access, and does not share video with them.” For its part, Flock says the same — that it doesn’t actually work with ICE, but rather local law enforcement, and it’s those local agencies that work with ICE. This is the complication I mentioned earlier.

If you’re a Decoder listener, you know where this is all going. I asked Jamie about all these databases, who owns them, and what it means to connect them all with AI:

NILAY PATEL: But when you connect a bunch of those databases, particularly to facial recognition, there’s a turn in the privacy conversation where the stakes ratchet up really high, where maybe it’s gone forever.

How are you thinking about that decision-making? Okay, we have a lot of intelligence in the AI; it’s trivial for the AI to connect to another store of information. That’s a thing you can do with AI, especially at a big company like Amazon, where you have lots of other stores of information. There’s a line, what’s the line for you?

JAMIE SIMINOFF: There is a responsibility, obviously just to build safe products. So let’s just start with that. Yeah, we did announce facial, we call it Familiar Faces, but that’s not connected, that’s just for your... Your iPhone today. If you search your iPhone, it’s crazy. Search for someone’s name in your photos, and their pictures come up.

So I do think there’s a balance between not allowing technology to exist that should exist that helps people and gives them more efficiency, gives them safer homes and then also, obviously, not creating this dystopian place. And so, I think that’s the responsibility, but what we’re doing with Familiar Faces is we’re just giving you the ability to say, when my wife comes home, don’t... Because it is silly. Why do I get an alert when my wife comes home? I don’t want it, I don’t need it.

I’m asking this for a lot of reasons, but I look at what’s broadly happening with surveillance footage out in the world. And I’m not saying Ring is participating in this, I’m just giving you an example. ICE has facial recognition systems, and they are arguing that a positive match in their facial recognition system is a definitive determination of someone’s immigration status. That’s way out there. I don’t think you’re doing that.

But you can get to, “Okay, we have facial recognition, we have a bunch of evidence coming off of Ring cameras, to make it really safe, you want to go from passive surveillance to active surveillance. That’s what the studies show. Now the camera will literally identify the criminal by face and tell the cops this person tried to steal a car from this driveway,” and that’s the thing that would get you to actually zero out crime.

There’s a lot of risk in those steps. But if I draw the thread from what you’re saying, it’s all the way to the idea that the criminals won’t come here because the cameras will know who they are and tell the cops. Are you willing to go that far?

I think it’s also that the cameras will alert people. Part of what made Ring and what made neighbors safer with Ring 1.0, and I think we are in Ring 2.0, is that there was no presence at the home. How did people break into homes? They would go and be knock-knock burglars. They would knock-knock, no one was home. It was 3PM, they’d go to the homes next door, find a place that was empty, and they’d go into the home.Ring allowed you to, now, all of a sudden, when someone comes up to the door, you’re like, “Oh, I got a motion alert. Hi, what’s going on?” and so it gave a presence to the home. So, I don’t think you have to go as far as that real time stuff to get to where we’re talking about, I think it’s more of the anomaly detection and allowing people to make it so that, if someone comes in, that you’re aware of what’s happening around the neighborhood because right now there’s no awareness of what’s going on around it.

So I don’t think it’s as dystopian as where you’re going, and certainly it’s not what we’re building, and I do think we can impact things to a really high level in neighborhoods. Which, again, to the Jen Tuohy thing, in neighborhoods is what we were talking about, that with AI and what we’re doing with a bunch of Rings together. I think even the Dog Search Party is a good way to look at it, which is how these cameras come together for good in the neighborhood.

Today, the backlash against surveillance has led Ring to kill that Flock deal. The company is also doing damage control about Search Party, telling The Verge that the technology that powers the feature is not “capable” of being used to find people, and that there’s no indication that such features are on future road maps.

Sure, it seems obvious that Ring has a lot of trust to earn back here, and certainly, we are all thinking about what it means to put internet-connected security cameras in our homes. I think that’s good — and certainly overdue.

But let me complicate this a little for you. At the same time this conversation about Ring is happening, we’re also watching regular people record the police and ICE with their cell phones, capturing critical documentary evidence of how those agencies are violating the rights of everyday Americans in ways that is leading to change, however slow.

Minnesota governor Tim Walz is now telling people to hit record when they see ICE so the footage can be used in future prosecutions. And just last week, the FBI released video that Google appears to have specifically recovered from a Nest camera system at Nancy Guthrie’s house, in order to help identify her kidnapper.

That’s a lot of video that’s being captured and used in ways that maybe don’t feel so invasive, and in some cases even feels good. But the systems that create, store, and share that video are all the same, and the guardrails around them are just as weak as whatever makes us feel uncomfortable about Ring.

I’m not sure how to feel about all of that video, especially in a world where AI makes it easy to fake, and having some source of truth seems more important than ever. I asked Jamie about that, too — whether Ring will control all the video, or sign it with some metadata so people can ensure it’s real.

NILAY PATEL: Presuming we have to have an authenticated server, there’s a crime in my neighborhood, and I’ve opted in, and we’re going to say the cops can only get the video from the Ring server, where we know it’s true. I might not be as in control of my video anymore.

JAMIE SIMINOFF: No, not how it’s built and not while I’m here because the way it works is that you will decide if you want to or not want to share that video, which is your property, with someone. Now, once you share it, then it is up to us to figure out, to your point, how do we share it, how do we make sure that the digital fingerprint goes all the way through, or how does the chain of custody work of this video to make sure there’s no fake in the process of it? I think this is why it is important to build these systems.

It’s going to be important, though. This is also where the government is going to have to step in. We’re going to have to deal with this across the board because we also have video coming off of cell phones. So, we do need to figure out how to build... And there’s going to be companies, Axon would probably be one of the companies. I don’t want to speak for them, but they have evidence.com, so to build these evidentiary systems to take in…

Because Ring is one part of taking in data around, call it a crime scene, but cell phone video is maybe even more of a source today. So, how do you take that in? How do you make sure that it actually was captured on the iPhone directly and not tampered with between the two things? We’re going to have to figure it all out. I think we have to work together on it, and the AI stuff is pushing us to do it. I am proud that with Ring, we have built it so that you can take it directly and keep it on the server. You can understand where it was, where it’s from, where it was created, and we have that digital fingerprint on it and the audit trail of it.

You’re going to have to do that more and more as this world is changing, you’re just not going to be able to trust that just because someone sends you a video doesn’t mean it’s true.

You get the feeling we’ll be coming back to that idea quite a lot in the years to come.

But today Ring has canceled its deal with Flock, and Flock itself is putting out blog posts flatly stating it does not have a contract with ICE, and noting that Ring’s other partner, Axon, does in fact have an ICE contract.

In the meantime, Search Party is still active and on by default, although you can just go into settings and flip it off. And the enormous amount of video we all generate is being uploaded to servers run by big companies that have their own dealings with governments and law enforcement agencies far outside of our control.

There are a lot of solutions to all these problems, and lots of ways to design regulations to balance out privacy and civil liberties with the needs of police. But right now, in 2026 America, I’m not sure were really going to be able to do that.

So we’re going to keep pushing the leaders of these companies on what they really mean, and keep running the answers so you can listen and decide. I think it’s about time we started thinking about how all the technology we use to make our own lives better affects other people.

Because that bigger conversation we need to have? Yeah, that’s what it’s really about.

﻿Sony might push the debut of its next-generation console back to 2029 due to AI memory demands.

Sony and Nintendo are reportedly feeling squeezed by RAM shortages as demand from AI data centers takes up an increasing share of memory chip production. In response to rising costs and dwindling chip supplies, Sony is considering pushing back the release of its next PlayStation console “to 2028 or even 2029,” according to industry sources cited by Bloomberg, while Nintendo may increase the $450 price of its Switch 2 console this year.

That delay would be a considerable divergence from Sony’s usual release schedule, having launched a new console generation every six to seven years since the original PlayStation debuted in 1994. As the current PlayStation 5 console was released in November 2020, it would have been expected to launch before the end of 2027.

The memory shortages are also a blow for Nintendo, which pointedly did not increase the Switch 2 launch price last year despite Trump’s sweeping tariffs. Bloomberg offers no specifics for how much the price might increase. We have reached out to Sony and Nintendo for comment.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When work went remote, the sound of business changed. What began as a scramble to make home offices functional has evolved into a revolution in how people hear and are heard. From education to enterprises, companies across industries have reimagined what clear, reliable communication can mean in a hybrid world. For major audio and communications enterprises like Shure and Zoom, that transformation has been powered by artificial intelligence, new acoustic technologies, and a shared mission: making connection effortless.

Necessity during the pandemic accelerated years of innovation in months.

&quot;Audio and video just working is a baseline for collaboration,&quot; says chief ecosystem officer at Zoom, Brendan Ittelson. &quot;That expectation has shifted from connecting people to enhancing productivity and creativity across the entire ecosystem.&quot;

Audio is a foundation for trust, understanding, and collaboration. Poor sound quality can distort meaning and fatigue listeners, while crisp audio and intelligent processing can make digital interactions feel nearly as natural as in-person exchanges.

&quot;If you think about the fundamental need here,&quot; adds chief technology officer at Shure, Sam Sabet, &quot;It&#39;s the ability to amplify the audio and the information that&#39;s really needed, and diminish the unwanted sounds and audio so that we can enhance that experience and make it seamless for people to communicate.&quot;

For both Ittelson and Sabet, AI now sits at the center of this progress. For Shure, machine learning powers real-time noise suppression, adaptive beamforming, and spatial audio that tunes itself to a room’s acoustics. For Zoom, AI underpins every layer of its platform, from dynamic noise reduction to automated meeting summaries and intelligent assistants that anticipate user needs. These tools are transforming communication from reactive to proactive, enabling systems that understand intent, context, and emotion.

&quot;Even if you&#39;re not working from home and coming into the office, the types of spaces and environments you try to collaborate in today are constantly changing because our needs are constantly changing,&quot; says Sabet. &quot;Having software and algorithms that adapt seamlessly and self-optimize based on the acoustics of the room, based on the different layouts of the spaces where people collaborate in is instrumental.&quot;

The future, they suggest, is one where technology fades into the background. As audio devices and AI companions learn to self-optimize, users won’t think about microphones or meeting links. Instead, they’ll simply connect. Both companies are now exploring agentic AI systems and advanced wireless solutions that promise to make collaboration seamless across spaces, whether in classrooms, conference rooms, or virtual environments yet to come.

&quot;It&#39;s about helping people focus on strategy and creativity instead of administrative busy work,&quot; says Ittelson.

This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Shure.

Megan Tatum: From MIT Technology Review, I&#39;m Megan Tatum and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.

This episode is produced in partnership with Shure.

Now as the pandemic ushered in the cultural shift that led to our increasingly virtual world, it also sparked a flurry of innovation in the audio and video industries to keep employees and customers connected and businesses running. Today we&#39;re going to talk about the AI technologies behind those innovations, the impact on audio innovation, and the continuing emerging opportunities for further advances in audio capabilities.

My guests today are Sam Sabet, chief technology officer at Shure, and Brendan Ittelson, chief ecosystem officer at Zoom.

Sam Sabet: Thank you, Megan. It&#39;s a pleasure to be here and I&#39;m looking forward to this conversation with both you and Brendan. It should be a very exciting conversation.

Brendan Ittelson: Thank you so much for having me today. I&#39;m looking forward to the conversation and all the topics we have to dive into on this area.

Megan: Fantastic. Lovely to have you both here. And Sam, just to set some context, I wonder if we could start with the pandemic and the innovation that really was born out of necessity. I mean, when it became clear that we were all going to be virtual for the foreseeable future, I wonder what was the first technological mission for Shure?

Sam: Yeah, very good question. The pandemic really accelerated a lot of innovation around virtual communications and fundamentally how we perform our everyday jobs remotely. One of our first technological mission when the pandemic happened and everybody ended up going home and performing their functions remotely was to make sure that people could continue to communicate effectively, whether that&#39;s for business meetings, virtual events, or educational purposes. We focused on collaboration and enhancing collaboration tools. And ideally what we were aiming to do, or we focused on, was to basically improve the ease of use and configuration of audio tool sets.

Because unlike the office environment where it might be a lot more controlled, people are working from non-traditional areas like home offices or other makeshift solutions, we needed to make sure that people could still get pristine audio and that studio level audio even in uncontrolled environments that are not really made for that. We expedited development in our software solutions. We created tool sets that allowed for ease of deployment and remote configuration and management so we could enable people to continue doing the things they needed to do without having to worry about the underlying technology.

Megan: And Brendan, during that time, it seemed everyone became a Zoom user of some sort. I mean, what was the first mission at Zoom when virtual connection became this necessity for everyone?

Brendan: Well, our mission fundamentally didn&#39;t change. It&#39;s always been about delivering frictionless communications. What shifted was the urgency and the magnitude of what we were doing. Our focus shifted on how we do this reliably, securely, and to scale to ensure these millions of new users could connect instantly without friction. We really shifted our thinking of being just a business continuity tool to becoming a lifeline for so many individuals and industries. The stories that we heard across education, healthcare, and just general human connection, the number of those moments that matter to people that we were able to help facilitate just became so important. We really focused on how can we be there and make it frictionless so folks can focus on that human connection. And that accelerated our thinking in terms of innovation and reinforced the thought that we need to focus on the simplicity, accessibility, and trust in communication technology so that people could focus on that connection and not the technology that makes it possible.

Megan: That&#39;s so true. It did really just become an absolute lifeline for people, didn&#39;t it? And before we dive into the technologies beyond these emerging capabilities, I wonder if we could first talk about just the importance of clear audio. I mean, Sam, as much as we all worry over how we look on Zoom, is how we sound perhaps as or even more impactful?

Sam: Yeah, you&#39;re absolutely correct. I mean, clear audio is absolutely critical for effective communications. Video quality is very important absolutely, but poor audio can really hinder understanding and engagement. As a matter of fact, there&#39;s studies and research from areas such as Yale University that say that poor audio can make understanding somewhat more challenged and even affect retention of information. Especially in an educational type environment where there&#39;s a lot of background noise and very differing types of spaces like auditoriums and lecture halls, it really becomes a high priority that you have great audio quality. And during the pandemic, as you said, and as Brendan rightly said, it became one of our highest priorities to focus on technologies like beamforming mics and ways to focus on the speaker&#39;s voice and minimize that unwanted background noise so that we could ensure that the communication was efficient, was well understood, and that it removed the distraction so people could be able to actually communicate and retain the information that was being shared.

Megan: It is incredible just how impactful audio can be, can&#39;t it? Brendan, I mean as you said, remote and hybrid collaboration is part of Zoom&#39;s DNA. What observations can you share about how users have grown along with the technological advancements and maybe how their expectations have grown as well?

Brendan: Definitely. I mean, users now expect seamless and intelligent experiences. Audio and video just working is a baseline for collaboration. That expectation has shifted from connecting people to enhancing productivity and creativity across the entire ecosystem. When we look at it, we&#39;re really looking at these trends in terms of how people want to be better when they&#39;re at home. For example, AI-powered tools like Smart Summaries, translation and noise suppression to help people stay productive and connected no matter where they&#39;re working. But then this also comes into play at the office. We&#39;re starting to see folks that dive into our technology like Intelligent Director and Smart Name Tags that create that meeting equity even when they&#39;re in a conference room.

So, the remote experience and the room experience all are similar and create that same ability to be seen, heard, and contribute. And we&#39;re now diving further into this that it&#39;s beyond just meetings. Zoom is really transforming into an AI-first work platform that&#39;s focused on human connection. And so that goes beyond the meetings into things like Chat, Zoom Docs, Zoom Events and Webinars, the Zoom Contact Center and more. And all of this being brought together using our AI Companion at its core to help connect all of those different points of connection for individuals.

Megan: I mean, so Brendan, we know it wasn&#39;t only workplaces that were affected by the pandemic, it was also the education sector that had to undergo a huge change. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about how Zoom has operated in that higher education sphere as well.

Brendan: Definitely. Education has always been a focus for Zoom and an area that we&#39;ve believed in. Because education and learning is something as a company we value and so we have invested in that sector. And personally being the son of academics, it is always an area that I find fascinating. We continue to invest in terms of how do we make the classroom a stronger space? And especially now that the classroom has changed, where it can be in person, it can be virtual, it can be a mix. And using Zoom and its tools, we&#39;re able to help bridge all those different scenarios to make learning accessible to students no matter their means.

That&#39;s what truly excites us, is being able to have that technology that allows people to pursue their desires, their interests, and really up-level their pursuits and inspire more. We&#39;re constantly investing in how to allow those messages to get out and to integrate in the flow of communication and collaboration that higher education uses, whether that&#39;s being integrated into the classroom, into learning management systems, to make that a seamless flow so that students and their educators can just collaborate seamlessly. And also that we can support all the infrastructure and administration that helps make that possible.

Megan: Absolutely. Such an important thing. And Sam, Shure as well, could you talk to us a bit about how you worked in that kind of education space as well from an audio point of view?

Sam: Absolutely. Actually, this is a topic that&#39;s near and dear to my heart because I&#39;m actually an adjunct professor in my free time.

Sam: And the challenges of trying to do this sort of a hybrid lecture, if you will. And Shure has been particularly well suited for this environment and we&#39;ve been focused on it and investing in technologies there for decades. If you think about how a lecture hall is structured, it&#39;s a little different than just having a meeting around the conference table. And Shure has focused on creating products that allow this combination of a presenter scenario along with a meeting space plus the far end where users or students are remote, they can hear intelligibly what&#39;s happening in the lecture hall, but they can also participate.

Between our products like the Ceiling Mic Arrays and our wireless microphones that are purpose built for presenters and educators like our MXW neXt product line, we&#39;ve created technologies that allow those two previously separate worlds to integrate together. And then add that onto integrating with Zoom and other products that allow for that collaboration has been very instrumental. And again, being a user and providing those lectures, I can see a night and day difference and just how much more effective my lectures are today from where they were five to six years ago. And that&#39;s all just made possible by all the technologies that are purpose built for these scenarios and integrating more with these powerful tools that just make the job so much more seamless.

Megan: Absolutely fascinating that you got to put the technology to use yourself as well to check that it was all working well. And you mentioned AI there, of course. I mean, Sam, what AI technologies have had the most significant impact on recent audio advancements too?

Sam: Yeah. Absolutely. If you think about the fundamental need here, it&#39;s the ability to amplify the audio and the information that&#39;s really needed and diminish the unwanted sounds and audio so that we can enhance that experience and make it seamless for people to communicate. With our innovations at Shure, we&#39;ve leveraged the cutting-edge technologies to both enhance communication effectiveness and to align seamlessly with evolving features in unified communications like the ones that Brandon just mentioned in the Zoom platforms.

We partner with industry leaders like Zoom to ensure that we&#39;re providing the ability to be able to focus on that needed audio and eliminate all the background distractions. AI has transformed that audio technology with things like machine learning algorithms that enable us to do more real-time audio processing and significantly enhancing things like noise reduction and speech isolation. Just to give you a simple example, our IntelliMix Room audio processing software that we&#39;ve released as well as part of a complete room solution uses AI to optimize sound in different environments.

And really that&#39;s one of the fundamental changes in this period, whether that&#39;s pandemic or post-pandemic, is that the key is really flexibility and being able to adapt to changing work environments. Even if you&#39;re not working from home and coming into the office, the types of spaces and environments you try to collaborate in today are constantly changing because our needs are constantly changing. And so having software and algorithms that adapt seamlessly and are able to self-optimize based on the acoustics of the room, based on the different layouts of the spaces where people collaborate in is instrumental.

And then last but not least, AI has transformed the way audio and video integrate. For example, we utilize voice recognition systems that integrate with intelligent cameras so that we enable voice tracking technology so that cameras can not only identify who&#39;s speaking, but you have the ability to hear and see people clearly. And that in general just enhances the overall communication experience.

Megan: Wow. It&#39;s just so much innovation in quite a short space of time really. I mean, Brendan, you mentioned AI a little bit there beforehand, but I wonder what other AI technologies have had the biggest impact as Zoom builds out its own emerging capabilities?

Brendan: Definitely. And I couldn&#39;t agree more with Sam that, I mean, AI has made such a big shift and it&#39;s really across the spectrum. And when I think about it, there&#39;s almost three tiers when you look at the stack. You start off at the raw audio where AI is doing those things like noise suppression, echo cancellation, voice enhancements. All of that just makes this amazing audio signal that can then go into the next layer, which is the speech AI and natural language processing. Which starts to open up those items such as the real-time transcription, translation, searchable content to make the communication not just what&#39;s heard, but making it more accessible to more individuals and inclusive by providing that content in a format that is best for them.

And then you take those two layers and put the generative and agentic AI on top of that, that can start surfacing insights, summarize the conversation, and even take actions on someone&#39;s behalf. It really starts to change the way that people work and how they have access and allows them to connect. I think it is a huge shift and I&#39;m very excited by how those three levels start to interact to really enable people to do more and to connect thanks to AI.

Megan: Yeah. Absolutely. So much rich information that can come out from a single call now because of those sorts of tools. And following on from that, Brendan, I mean, you mentioned before the Zoom AI Companion. I wondered if you could talk a bit about what were your top priorities when building that product to ensure it was truly useful for your customers?

Brendan: Definitely. When we developed AI Companion, we had two priority focus areas from day one, trust and security, and then accuracy and relevance. On the trust side, it was a non-negotiable that customer data wouldn&#39;t be used to train our models. People need to know that their conversations and content are private and secure.

Brendan: And then with accuracy, we needed to ensure AI outputs weren&#39;t generic but grounded in the actual context of a meeting, a chat or a product. But the real story here when I think about AI Companion is the customer value that it delivers. AI Companion helps people save time with meeting recaps, task generation, and proactive prep for the next session. It reduces that friction in hybrid work, whether you&#39;re in a meeting room, a Zoom room, or collaborating across different collaboration tools like Microsoft or Google. And it enables more equitable participation by surfacing the right context for everyone no matter where and how they&#39;re working.

All this leads to a result where it&#39;s practical, trustworthy, and embedded where work happens. And it&#39;s just not another tool to manage, it&#39;s there in someone&#39;s flow of work to help them along the way.

Megan: Yeah. That trust piece is just so important, isn&#39;t it, today? And Sam, as much as AI has impacted audio innovation, audio has also had an impact on AI capabilities. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about audio as a data input and the advancements technologies like large language models, LLMs, are enabling.

Sam: Absolutely. Audio is really a rich data source that&#39;s added a new dimension to AI capabilities. If you think about speech recognition or natural language processing, they&#39;ve had significant advances due to audio data that&#39;s provided for them. And to Brendan&#39;s point about trust and accuracy, I like to think of the products that Shure enables customers with as essentially the eyes and ears in the room for leading AI companions just like the Zoom AI Companion. You really need that pristine audio input to be able to trust the accuracy of what the AI generates. These AI Companions have been very instrumental in the way we do business every day. I mean, between transcription, speaker attributions, the ability to add action items within a meeting and be able to track what&#39;s happening in our interactions, all of that really has to rely on that accurate and pristine input from audio into the AI. I feel that further improves the trust that our end users have to the results of AI and be able to leverage it more.

If you think about it, if you look at how AI audio inputs enhance that interactive AI system, it enables more natural and intuitive interactions with AI. And it really allows for that seamless integration and the ability for users to use it without having to worry about, is the room set up correctly? Is the audio level proper? And when we talk even about agentic AI, we&#39;re working on future developments where systems can self-heal or detect that there are issues in the environment so that they can autocorrect and adapt in all these different environments and further enable the AI to be able to do a much more effective job, if you will.

Megan: Sam, you touched on future developments there. I wonder if we could close our conversation today with a bit of a future forward look, if we could. Brendan, can you share innovations that Zoom is working on now and what are you most excited to see come to fruition?

Brendan: Well, your timing for this question is absolutely perfect because we&#39;ve just wrapped up Zoomtopia 2025.

Brendan: And this is where we discussed a lot of the new AI innovations that we have coming to Zoom. Starting off, there&#39;s AI Companion 3.0. And we&#39;ve launched this next generation of agentic AI capabilities in Zoom Workplace. And with 3.0 when it releases, it isn&#39;t just about transcribing, it&#39;s turned into really a platform that helps you with follow-up task, prep for your next conversation, and even proactively suggest how to free up your time. For example, AI Companion can help you schedule meetings intelligently across time zones, suggest which meetings you can skip, and still stay informed and even prepare you with context and insights before you walk into the conversation. It&#39;s about helping people focus on strategy and creativity instead of administrative busy work. And for hybrid work specifically, we introduced Zoomie Group Assistant, which will be a big leap for hybrid collaboration.

Acting as an assistant for a group chat and meetings, you can simply ask, “@Zoomie, what&#39;s the latest update on the project?” Or “@Zoomie, what are the team&#39;s action items?” And then get instant answers. Or because we&#39;re talking about audio here, you can go into a conference room and say, &quot;Hey, Zoomie,&quot; and get help with things like checking into a room, adjusting lights, temperature, or even sharing your screen. And while all these are built-in features, we&#39;re also expanding the platform to allow custom AI agents through our AI Studio, so organizations can bring their own agents or integrate with third-party ones.

Zoom has always believed in an open platform and philosophy and that is continuing. Folks using AI Companion 3.0 will be able to use agents across platforms to work with the workflows that they have across all the different SaaS vendors that they might have in their environment, whether that&#39;s Google, Microsoft, ServiceNow, Cisco, and so many other tools.

Megan: Fantastic. It certainly sounds like a tool I could use in my work, so I look forward to hearing more about that. And Sam, we&#39;ve touched on there are so many exciting things happening in audio too. What are you working on at Shure? And what are you most excited to see come to fruition?

Sam: At Shure, our engineering teams are really working on a range of exciting projects, but particularly we&#39;re working on developing new collaboration solutions that are integral for IT end users. And these integrate obviously with the leading UC platforms.

We&#39;re integrating audio and video technologies that are scalable, reliable solutions. And we want to be able to seamlessly connect these to cloud services so that we can leverage both AI technologies and the tool sets available to optimize every type of workspace essentially. Not just meeting rooms, but lecture halls, work from home scenarios, et cetera.

The other area that we really focus on in terms of our reliability and quality really comes from our DNA in the pro audio world. And that&#39;s really all-around wireless audio technologies. We&#39;re developing our next-generation wireless systems and these are going to offer even greater reliability and range. And they really become ideal for everything from a large-scale event to personal home use and the gamut across that whole spectrum. And I think all of that in partnership with our partners like Zoom will help just facilitate the modern workspace.

Hackers made death threats against this security researcher. Big mistake.

In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon.These anonymous personas targeted Nixon because she had become a formidable threat: As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, named after Sherlock Holmes’s apartment, she had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested.Though she’d done this work for more than a decade, Nixon couldn’t understand why the person behind the accounts was suddenly threatening her. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn’t been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets.Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing.

ALS stole this musician’s voice. AI let him sing again.

There are tears in the audience as Patrick Darling’s song begins to play. It’s a heartfelt song written for his great-grandfather, whom he never got the chance to meet. But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease, it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again. Read the full story.

            <h2>The scientist using AI to hunt for antibiotics just about everywhere</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/16/1132516/cesar-de-la-fuente-using-ai-antibiotics-hunt/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When he was just a teenager trying to decide what to do with his life, César de la Fuente compiled a list of the world’s biggest problems. He ranked them inversely by how much money governments were spending to solve them. Antimicrobial resistance topped the list.

Twenty years on, the problem has not gone away. If anything, it’s gotten worse. Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses that have evolved ways to evade treatments are now associated with more than 4 million deaths per year, and a recent analysis, published in the Lancet, predicts that number could surge past 8 million by 2050. In a July 2025 essay in Physical Review Letters, de la Fuente, now a bioengineer and computational biologist, and synthetic biologist James Collins warned of a looming “post­antibiotic” era in which infections from drug-resistant strains of common bacteria like Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, which can often still be treated by our current arsenal of medications, become fatal. “The antibiotic discovery pipeline remains perilously thin,” they wrote, “impeded by high development costs, lengthy timelines, and low returns on investment.”

But de la Fuente is using artificial intelligence to bring about a different future. His team at the University of Pennsylvania is training AI tools to search genomes far and deep for peptides with antibiotic properties. His vision is to assemble those peptides—molecules made of up to 50 amino acids linked together—into various configurations, including some never seen in nature. The results, he hopes, could defend the body against microbes that withstand traditional treatments.

His quest has unearthed promising candidates in unexpected places. In August 2025 his team, which includes 16 scientists in Penn’s Machine Biology Group, described peptides hiding in the genetic code of ancient single-celled organisms called archaea. Before that, they’d excavated a list of candidates from the venom of snakes, wasps, and spiders. And in an ongoing project de la Fuente calls “molecular de-­extinction,” he and his collaborators have been scanning published genetic sequences of extinct species for potentially functional molecules. Those species include hominids like Neanderthals and Denisovans and charismatic megafauna like woolly mammoths, as well as ancient zebras and penguins. In the history of life on Earth, de la Fuente reasons, maybe some organism evolved an antimicrobial defense that could be helpful today. Those long-gone codes have given rise to resurrected compounds with names like ­mammuthusin-2 (from woolly mammoth DNA), mylodonin-2 (from the giant sloth), and hydrodamin-1 (from the ancient sea cow). Over the last few years, this molecular binge has enabled de la Fuente to amass a library of more than a million genetic recipes.

At 40 years old, de la Fuente has also collected a trophy case of awards from the American Society for Microbiology, the American Chemical Society, and other organizations. (In 2019, this magazine named him one of “35 Innovators Under 35” for bringing computational approaches to antibiotic discovery.) He’s widely recognized as a leader in the effort to harness AI for real-world problems. “He’s really helped pioneer that space,” says Collins, who is at MIT. (The two have not collaborated in the laboratory, but Collins has long been at the forefront of using AI for drug discovery, including the search for antibiotics. In 2020, Collins’s team used an AI model to predict a broad-­spectrum antibiotic, halicin, that is now in preclinical development.)

The world of antibiotic development needs as much creativity and innovation as researchers can muster, says Collins. And de la Fuente’s work on peptides has pushed the field forward: “César is marvelously talented, very innovative.”

De la Fuente describes antimicrobial resistance as an “almost impossible” problem, but he sees plenty of room for exploration in the word almost. “I like challenges,” he says, “and I think this is the ultimate challenge.”

The use, overuse, and misuse of antibiotics, he says, drives antimicrobial resistance. And the problem is growing unchecked because conventional ways to find, make, and test the drugs are prohibitively expensive and often lead to dead ends. “A lot of the companies that have attempted to do antibiotic development in the past have ended up folding because there’s no good return on investment at the end of the day,” he says.

Antibiotic discovery has always been a messy, noisy endeavor, driven by serendipity and fraught with uncertainty and misdirection. For decades, researchers have largely relied on brute-force mechanical methods. “Scientists dig into soil, they dig into water,” says de la Fuente. “And then from that complex organic matter they try to extract antimicrobial molecules.”

But molecules can be extraordinarily complex. Researchers have estimated the number of possible organic combinations that could be synthesized at somewhere around 1060. For reference, Earth contains an estimated 1018 grains of sand. “Drug discovery in any domain is a statistics game,” says Jonathan Stokes, a chemical biologist at McMaster University in Canada, who has been using generative AI to design potential new antibiotics that can be synthesized in a lab, and who worked with Collins on halicin. “You need enough shots on goal to happen to get one.”

Those have to be good shots, though. And AI seems well suited to improving researchers’ aim. Biology is an information source, de la Fuente explains: “It’s like a bunch of code.” The code of DNA has four letters; proteins and peptides have 20, where each “letter” represents an amino acid. De la Fuente says his work amounts to training AI models to recognize sequences of letters that encode antimicrobial peptides, or AMPs. “If you think about it that way,” he says, “you can devise algorithms to mine the code and identify functional molecules, which can be antimicrobials. Or antimalarials. Or anticancer agents.”

Practically speaking, we’re still not there: These peptides haven’t yet been transformed into usable drugs that help people, and there are plenty of details—dosage, delivery, specific targets—that need to be sorted out, says de la Fuente. But AMPs are appealing because the body already uses them.They’re a critical part of the immune system and often the first line of defense against pathogenic infections. Unlike conventional antibiotics, which typically have one trick for killing bacteria, AMPs often exhibit a multimodal approach. They may disrupt the cell wall and the genetic material inside as well as a variety of cellular processes. A bacterial pathogen may evolve resistance to a conventional drug’s single mode of action, but maybe not to a multipronged AMP attack.

De la Fuente’s group is one of many pushing the boundaries of using AI for antibiotics. Where he focuses primarily on peptides, Collins works on small-molecule discovery. So does Stokes, at McMaster, whose models identify promising new molecules and predict whether they can be synthesized. “It’s only been a few years since folks have been using AI meaningfully in drug discovery,” says Collins.

Even in that short time the tools have changed, says James Zou, a computer scientist at Stanford University, who has worked with Stokes and Collins. Researchers have moved from using predictive models to developing generative approaches. With a predictive approach, Zou says, researchers screen large libraries of candidates that are known to be promising. Generative approaches offer something else: the appeal of designing a new molecule from scratch. Last year, for example, de la Fuente’s team used one generative AI model to design a suite of synthetic peptides and another to assess them. The group tested two of the resulting compounds on mice infected with a drug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii, a germ that the World Health Organization has identified as a “critical priority” in research on antimicrobial resistance. Both successfully and safely treated the infection.

But the field is still in the discovery phase. In his current work, de la Fuente is trying to get candidates closer to clinical testing. To that end, his team is developing an ambitious multimodal model called ApexOracle that’s designed to analyze a new pathogen, pinpoint its genetic weaknesses, match it to antimicrobial peptides that might work against it, and then predict how an antibiotic, built from those peptides, would fare in lab tests. It “converges understanding in chemistry, genomics, and language,” he says. It’s preliminary, he adds, but even if it doesn’t work perfectly, it will help steer the next generation of AI models toward the ultimate goal of resisting resistance.

Using AI, he believes, human researchers now have a fighting chance at catching up to the giant threat before them. The technology has already saved decades of human research time. Now he wants it to save lives, too: “This is the world that we live in today, and it’s incredible.”

            <h2>Hackers made death threats against this security researcher. Big mistake.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/16/1132526/allison-nixon-hackers-security-researcher/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In April 2024, a mysterious someone using the online handles “Waifu” and “Judische” began posting death threats on Telegram and Discord channels aimed at a cybersecurity researcher named Allison Nixon.

“Alison [sic] Nixon is gonna get necklaced with a tire filled with gasoline soon,” wrote Waifu/Judische, both of which are words with offensive connotations. “Decerebration is my fav type of brain death, thats whats gonna happen to alison Nixon.”

It wasn’t long before others piled on. Someone shared AI-generated nudes of Nixon.

These anonymous personas targeted Nixon because she had become a formidable threat: As chief research officer at the cyber investigations firm Unit 221B, named after Sherlock Holmes’s apartment, she had built a career tracking cybercriminals and helping get them arrested. For years she had lurked quietly in online chat channels or used pseudonyms to engage with perpetrators directly while piecing together clues they’d carelessly drop about themselves and their crimes. This had helped her bring to justice a number of cybercriminals—especially members of a loosely affiliated subculture of anarchic hackers who call themselves the Com.

But members of the Com aren’t just involved in hacking; some of them also engage in offline violence against researchers who track them. This includes bricking (throwing a brick through a victim’s window) and swatting (a dangerous type of hoax that involves reporting a false murder or hostage situation at someone’s home so SWAT teams will swarm it with guns drawn). Members of a Com offshoot known as 764 have been accused of even more violent acts—including animal torture, stabbings, and school shootings—or of inciting others in and outside the Com to commit these crimes.

Nixon started tracking members of the community more than a decade ago, when other researchers and people in law enforcement were largely ignoring them because they were young—many in their teens. Her early attention allowed her to develop strategies for unmasking them.

Ryan Brogan, a special agent with the FBI, says Nixon has helped him and colleagues identify and arrest more than two dozen members of the community since 2011, when he first began working with her, and that her skills in exposing them are unparalleled. “If you get on Allison’s and my radar, you’re going [down]. It’s just a matter of time,” he says. “No matter how much digital anonymity and tradecraft you try to apply, you’re done.”

Though she’d done this work for more than a decade, Nixon couldn’t understand why the person behind the Waifu/Judische accounts was suddenly threatening her. She had given media interviews about the Com—most recently on 60 Minutes—but not about her work unmasking members to get them arrested, so the hostility seemed to come out of the blue. And although she had taken an interest in the Waifu persona in years past for crimes he boasted about committing, he hadn’t been on her radar for a while when the threats began, because she was tracking other targets.

Now Nixon resolved to unmask Waifu/Judische and others responsible for the death threats—and take them down for crimes they admitted to committing. “Prior to them death-threatening me, I had no reason to pay attention to them,” she says.

Most people have never heard of the Com, but its influence and threat are growing.

It’s an online community comprising loosely affiliated groups of, primarily, teens and twentysomethings in North America and English-speaking parts of Europe who have become part of what some call a cybercrime youth movement.

International laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn’t stop the anarchic Com.

Over the last decade, its criminal activities have escalated from simple distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that disrupt websites to SIM-swapping hacks that hijack a victim’s phone service, as well as crypto theft, ransomware attacks, and corporate data theft. These crimes have affected AT&T, Microsoft, Uber, and others. Com members have also been involved in various forms of sextortion aimed at forcing victims to physically harm themselves or record themselves doing sexually explicit activities. The Com’s impact has also spread beyond the digital realm to kidnapping, beatings, and other violence.

One longtime cybercrime researcher, who asked to remain anonymous because of his work, says the Com is as big a threat in the cyber realm as Russia and China—for one unusual reason.

“There’s only so far that China is willing to go; there’s only so far that Russia or North Korea is willing to go,” he says, referring to international laws and norms, and fears of retaliation, that prevent states from going all out in cyber operations. That doesn’t stop the anarchic Com, he says.

“It is a pretty significant threat, and people tend to … push it under the rug [because] it’s just a bunch of kids,” he says. “But look at the impact [they have].”

Brogan says the amount of damage they do in terms of monetary losses “can become staggering very quickly.”

There is no single site where Com members congregate; they spread across a number of web forums and Telegram and Discord channels. The group follows a long line of hacking and subculture communities that emerged online over the last two decades, gained notoriety, and then faded or vanished after prominent members were arrested or other factors caused their decline. They differed in motivation and activity, but all emerged from “the same primordial soup,” says Nixon. The Com’s roots can be traced to the Scene, which began as a community of various “warez” groups engaged in pirating computer games, music, and movies.

When Nixon began looking at the Scene, in 2011, its members were hijacking gaming accounts, launching DDoS attacks, and running booter services. (DDoS attacks overwhelm a server or computer with traffic from bot-controlled machines, preventing legitimate traffic from getting through; booters are tools that anyone can rent to launch a DDoS attack against a target of choice.) While they made some money, their primary goal was notoriety.

This changed around 2018. Cryptocurrency values were rising, and the Com—or the Community, as it sometimes called itself—emerged as a subgroup that ultimately took over the Scene. Members began to focus on financial gain—cryptocurrency theft, data theft, and extortion.

The pandemic two years later saw a surge in Com membership that Nixon attributes to social isolation and the forced movement of kids online for schooling. But she believes economic conditions and socialization problems have also driven its growth. Many Com members can’t get jobs because they lack skills or have behavioral issues, she says. A number who have been arrested have had troubled home lives and difficulty adapting to school, and some have shown signs of mental illness. The Com provides camaraderie, support, and an outlet for personal frustrations. Since 2018, it has also offered some a solution to their money problems.

Loose-knit cells have sprouted from the community—Star Fraud, ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, Lapsus$—to collaborate on clusters of crime. They usually target high-profile crypto bros and tech giants and have made millions of dollars from theft and extortion, according to court records.

But dominance, power, and bragging rights are still motivators, even in profit operations, says the cybercrime researcher, which is partly why members target “big whales.”

“There is financial gain,” he says, “but it’s also [sending a message that] I can reach out and touch the people that think they’re untouchable.” In fact, Nixon says, some members of the Com have overwhelming ego-driven motivations that end up conflicting with their financial motives.

“Often their financial schemes fall apart because of their ego, and that phenomenon is also what I’ve made my career on,” she says.

Nixon has straight dark hair, wears wire-rimmed glasses, and has a slight build and bookish demeanor that, on first impression, could allow her to pass for a teen herself. She talks about her work in rapid cadences, like someone whose brain is filled with facts that are under pressure to get out, and she exudes a sense of urgency as she tries to make people understand the threat the Com poses. She doesn’t suppress her happiness when someone she’s been tracking gets arrested.

In 2011, when she first began investigating the communities from which the Com emerged, she was working the night shift in the security operations center of the security firm SecureWorks. The center responded to tickets and security alerts emanating from customer networks, but Nixon coveted a position on the company’s counter-threats team, which investigated and published threat-intelligence reports on mostly state-sponsored hacking groups from China and Russia. Without connections or experience, she had no path to investigative work. But Nixon is an intensely curious person, and this created its own path.

Where the threat team focused on the impact hackers had on customer networks—how they broke in, what they stole—Nixon was more interested in their motivations and the personality traits that drove their actions. She assumed there must be online forums where criminal hackers congregated, so she googled “hacking forums” and landed on a site called Hack Forums.

She was surprised to see members openly discussing their crimes there. She reached out to someone on the SecureWorks threat team to see if he was aware of the site, and he dismissed it as a place for “script kiddies”—a pejorative term for unskilled hackers.

This was a time when many cybersecurity pros were shifting their focus away from cybercrime to state-sponsored hacking operations, which were more sophisticated and getting a lot of attention. But Nixon likes to zig where others zag, and her colleague’s dismissiveness fueled her interest in the forums. Two other SecureWorks colleagues shared that interest, and the three studied the forums during downtime on their shifts. They focused on trying to identify the people running DDoS booters.

What Nixon loved about the forums was how accessible they were to a beginner like herself. Threat-intelligence teams require privileged access to a victim’s network to investigate breaches. But Nixon could access everything she needed in the public forums, where the hackers seemed to think no one was watching. Because of this, they often made mistakes in operational security, or OPSEC—letting slip little biographical facts such as the city where they lived, a school they attended, or a place they used to work. These details revealed in their chats, combined with other information, could help expose the real identities behind their anonymous masks.

“It was a shock to me that it was relatively easy to figure out who [they were],” she says.

She wasn’t bothered by the immature boasting and petty fights that dominated the forums. “A lot of people don’t like to do this work of reading chat logs. I realize that this is a very uncommon thing. And maybe my brain is built a little weird that I’m willing to do this,” she says. “I have a special talent that I can wade through garbage and it doesn’t bother me.”

Nixon soon realized that not all the members were script kiddies. Some exhibited real ingenuity and “powerful” skills, she says, but because they were applying these to frivolous purposes—hijacking gamer accounts instead of draining bank accounts—researchers and law enforcement were ignoring them. Nixon began tracking them, suspecting that they would eventually direct their skills at more significant targets—an intuition that proved to be correct. And when they did, she had already amassed a wealth of information about them.

She continued her DDoS research for two years until a turning point in 2013, when the cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs, who made a career tracking cybercriminals, got swatted.

About a dozen people from the security community worked with Krebs to expose the perpetrator, and Nixon was invited to help. Krebs sent her pieces of the puzzle to investigate, and eventually the group identified the culprit (though it would take two years for him to be arrested). When she was invited to dinner with Krebs and the other investigators, she realized she’d found her people.

“It was an amazing moment for me,” she says. “I was like, wow, there’s all these like-minded people that just want to help and are doing it just for the love of the game, basically.”

It was porn stars who provided Nixon with her next big research focus—one that underscored her skill at spotting Com actors and criminal trends in their nascent stages, before they emerged as major threats.

In 2018, someone was hijacking the social media accounts of certain adult-film stars and using those accounts to blast out crypto scams to their large follower bases. Nixon couldn’t figure out how the hackers had hijacked the social media profiles, but she promised to help the actors regain access to their accounts if they agreed to show her the private messages the hackers had sent or received during the time they controlled them. These messages led her to a forum where members were talking about how they stole the accounts. The hackers had tricked some of these actors into disclosing the mobile phone numbers of others. Then they used a technique called SIM swapping to reset passwords for social media accounts belonging to those other stars, locking them out.

In SIM swapping, fraudsters get a victim’s phone number assigned to a SIM card and phone they control, so that calls and messages intended for the victim go to them instead. This includes one-time security codes that sites text to account holders to verify themselves when accessing their account or changing its password. In some of the cases involving the porn stars, the hackers had manipulated telecom workers into making the SIM swaps for what they thought were legitimate reasons, and in other cases they bribed the workers to make the change. The hackers were then able to alter the password on the actors’ social media accounts, lock out the owners, and use the accounts to advertise their crypto scams.

SIM swapping is a powerful technique that can be used to hijack and drain entire cryptocurrency and bank accounts, so Nixon was surprised to see the fraudsters using it for relatively unprofitable schemes. But SIM swapping had rarely been used for financial fraud at that point, and like the earlier hackers Nixon had seen on Hack Forums, the ones hijacking porn star accounts didn’t seem to grasp the power of the technique they were using. Nixon suspected that this would change and SIM swapping would soon become a major problem, so she shifted her research focus accordingly. It didn’t take long for the fraudsters to pivot as well.

Nixon’s skill at looking ahead in this way has served her throughout her career. On multiple occasions a hacker or hacking group would catch her attention—for using a novel hacking approach in some minor operation, for example—and she’d begin tracking their online posts and chats in the belief that they’d eventually do something significant with that skill.

They usually did. When they later grabbed headlines with a showy or impactful operation, these hackers would seem to others to have emerged from nowhere, sending researchers and law enforcement scrambling to understand who they were. But Nixon would already have a dossier compiled on them and, in some cases, had unmasked their real identity as well. Lizard Squad was an example of this. The group burst into the headlines in 2014 and 2015 with a series of high-profile DDoS campaigns, but Nixon and colleagues at the job where she worked at the time had already been watching its members as individuals for a while. So the FBI sought their assistance in identifying them.

“The thing about these young hackers is that they … keep going until they get arrested, but it takes years for them to get arrested,” she says. “So a huge aspect of my career is just sitting on this information that has not been actioned [yet].”

It was during the Lizard Squad years that Nixon began developing tools to scrape and record hacker communications online, though it would be years before she began using these concepts to scrape the Com chatrooms and forums. These channels held a wealth of data that might not seem useful during the nascent stage of a hacker’s career but could prove critical later, when law enforcement got around to investigating them; yet the contents were always at risk of being deleted by Com members or getting taken down by law enforcement when it seized websites and chat channels.

Nixon’s work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.”

Over several years, she scraped and preserved whatever chatrooms she was investigating. But it wasn’t until early 2020, when she joined Unit 221B, that she got the chance to scrape the Telegram and Discord channels of the Com. She pulled all of this data together into a searchable platform that other researchers and law enforcement could use. The company hired two former hackers to help build scraping tools and infrastructure for this work; the result is eWitness, a community-driven, invitation-­only platform. It was initially seeded only with data Nixon had collected after she arrived at Unit 221B, but has since been augmented with data that other users of the platform have scraped from Com social spaces as well, some of which doesn’t exist in public forums anymore.

Brogan, of the FBI, says it’s an incredibly valuable tool, made more so by Nixon’s own contributions. Other security firms scrape online criminal spaces as well, but they seldom share the content with outsiders, and Brogan says Nixon’s work is unique because she engages with the actors in chat spaces to draw out information from them that “would not be otherwise normally available.”

The preservation project she started when she got to Unit 221B could not have been better timed, because it coincided with the pandemic, the surge in new Com membership, and the emergence of two disturbing Com offshoots, CVLT and 764. She was able to capture their chats as these groups first emerged; after law enforcement arrested leaders of the groups and took control of the servers where their chats were posted, this material went offline.

CVLT—pronounced “cult”—was reportedly founded around 2019 with a focus on sextortion and child sexual abuse material. 764 emerged from CVLT and was spearheaded by a 15-year-old in Texas named Bradley Cadenhead, who named it after the first digits of his zip code. Its focus was extremism and violence.

In 2021, because of what she observed in these groups, Nixon turned her attention to sextortion among Com members.

The type of sextortion they engaged in has its roots in activity that began a decade ago as “fan signing.” Hackers would use the threat of doxxing to coerce someone, usually a young female, into writing the hacker’s handle on a piece of paper. The hacker would use a photo of it as an avatar on his online accounts—a kind of trophy. Eventually some began blackmailing victims into writing the hacker’s handle on their face, breasts, or genitals. With CVLT, this escalated even further; targets were blackmailed into carving a Com member’s name into their skin or engaging in sexually explicit acts while recording or livestreaming themselves.

During the pandemic a surprising number of SIM swappers crossed into child sexual abuse material and sadistic sextortion, according to Nixon. She hates tracking this gruesome activity, but she saw an opportunity to exploit it for good. She had long been frustrated at how leniently judges treated financial fraudsters because of their crimes’ seemingly nonviolent nature. But she saw a chance to get harsher sentences for them if she could tie them to their sextortion and began to focus on these crimes.

At this point, Waifu still wasn’t on her radar. But that was about to change.

Nixon landed in Waifu’s crosshairs after he and fellow members of the Com were involved in a large hack involving AT&T customer call records in April 2024.

Waifu’s group gained access to dozens of cloud accounts with Snowflake, a company that provides online data storage for customers. One of those customers had more than 50 billion call logs of AT&T wireless subscribers stored in its Snowflake account.

They tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records. They tagged the FBI in the post. “It’s like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

Among the subscriber records were call logs for FBI agents who were AT&T customers. Nixon and other researchers believe the hackers may have been able to identify the phone numbers of agents through other means. Then they may have used a reverse-lookup program to identify the owners of phone numbers that the agents called or that called them and found Nixon’s number among them. This is when they began harassing her.

But then they got reckless. They allegedly extorted nearly $400,000 from AT&T in exchange for promising to delete the call records they’d stolen. Then they tried to re-extort the telecom, threatening on social media to leak the records they claimed to have deleted if it didn’t pay more. They tagged the FBI in the post.

“It’s like they were begging to be investigated,” says Nixon.

The Snowflake breaches and AT&T records theft were grabbing headlines at the time, but Nixon had no idea her number was in the stolen logs or that Waifu/Judische was a prime suspect in the breaches. So she was perplexed when he started taunting and threatening her online.

Over several weeks in May and June, a pattern developed. Waifu or one of his associates would post a threat against her and then post a message online inviting her to talk. She assumes now that they believed she was helping law enforcement investigate the Snowflake breaches and hoped to draw her into a dialogue to extract information from her about what authorities knew. But Nixon wasn’t helping the FBI investigate them yet. It was only after she began looking at Waifu for the threats that she became aware of his suspected role in the Snowflake hack.

It wasn’t the first time she had studied him, though. Waifu had come to her attention in 2019 when he bragged about framing another Com member for a hoax bomb threat and later talked about his involvement in SIM-swapping operations. He made an impression on her. He clearly had technical skills, but Nixon says he also often appeared immature, impulsive, and emotionally unstable, and he was desperate for attention in his interactions with other members. He bragged about not needing sleep and using Adderall to hack through the night. He was also a bit reckless about protecting personal details. He wrote in private chats to another researcher that he would never get caught because he was good at OPSEC, but he also told the researcher that he lived in Canada—which turned out to be true.

Nixon’s process for unmasking Waifu followed a general recipe she used to unmask Com members: She’d draw a large investigative circle around a target and all the personas that communicated with that person online, and then study their interactions to narrow the circle to the people with the most significant connections to the target. Some of the best leads came from a target’s enemies; she could glean a lot of information about their identity, personality, and activities from what the people they fought with online said about them.

“The enemies and the ex-girlfriends, generally speaking, are the best [for gathering intelligence on a suspect],” she says. “I love them.”

While she was doing this, Waifu and his group were reaching out to other security researchers, trying to glean information about Nixon and what she might be investigating. They also attempted to plant false clues with the researchers by dropping the names of other cybercriminals in Canada who could plausibly be Waifu. Nixon had never seen cybercriminals engage in counterintelligence tactics like this.

Amid this subterfuge and confusion, Nixon and another researcher working with her did a lot of consulting and cross-checking with other researchers about the clues they were gathering to ensure they had the right name before they gave it to the FBI.

By July she and the researcher were convinced they had their guy: Connor Riley Moucka, a 25-year-old high school dropout living with his grandfather in Ontario. On October 30, Royal Canadian Mounted Police converged on Moucka’s home and arrested him.

According to an affidavit filed in Canadian court, a plainclothes Canadian police officer visited Moucka’s house under some pretense on the afternoon of October 21, nine days before the arrest, to secretly capture a photo of him and compare it with an image US authorities had provided. The officer knocked and rang the bell; Moucka opened the door looking disheveled and told the visitor: “You woke me up, sir.” He told the officer his name was Alex; Moucka sometimes used the alias Alexander Antonin Moucka. Satisfied that the person who answered the door was the person the US was seeking, the officer left. Waifu’s online rants against Nixon escalated at this point, as did his attempts at misdirection. She believes the visit to his door spooked him.

Nixon won’t say exactly how they unmasked Moucka—only that he made a mistake.

“I don’t want to train these people in how to not get caught [by revealing his error],” she says.

The Canadian affidavit against Moucka reveals a number of other violent posts he’s alleged to have made online beyond the threats he made against her. Some involve musings about becoming a serial killer or mass-mailing sodium nitrate pills to Black people in Michigan and Ohio; in another, his online persona talks about obtaining firearms to “kill Canadians” and commit “suicide by cop.”

Prosecutors, who list Moucka’s online aliases as including Waifu, Judische, and two more in the indictment, say he and others extorted at least $2.5 million from at least three victims whose data they stole from Snowflake accounts. Moucka has been charged with nearly two dozen counts, including conspiracy, unauthorized access to computers, extortion, and wire fraud. He has pleaded not guilty and was extradited to the US last July. His trial is scheduled for October this year, though hacking cases usually end in plea agreements rather than going to trial.

It took months for authorities to arrest Moucka after Nixon and her colleague shared their findings with the authorities, but an alleged associate of his in the Snowflake conspiracy, a US Army soldier named Cameron John Wagenius (Kiberphant0m online), was arrested more quickly.

On November 10, 2024, Nixon and her team found a mistake Wagenius made that helped identify him, and on December 20 he was arrested. Wagenius has already pleaded guilty to two charges around the sale or attempted sale of confidential phone records and will be sentenced this March.

These days Nixon continues to investigate sextortion among Com members. But she says that remaining members of Waifu’s group still taunt and threaten her.

“They are continuing to persist in their nonsense, and they are getting taken out one by one,” she says. “And I’m just going to keep doing that until there’s no one left on that side.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There are tears in the audience as Patrick Darling’s song begins to play. It’s a heartfelt song written for his great-grandfather, whom he never got the chance to meet. But this performance is emotional for another reason: It’s Darling’s first time on stage with his bandmates since he lost the ability to sing two years ago.

The 32-year-old musician was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 29 years old. Like other types of motor neuron disease (MND), it affects nerves that supply the body’s muscles. People with ALS eventually lose the ability to control their muscles, including those that allow them to move, speak, and breathe.

Darling’s last stage performance was over two years ago. By that point, he had already lost the ability to stand and play his instruments and was struggling to sing or speak. But recently, he was able to re-create his lost voice using an AI tool trained on snippets of old audio recordings. Another AI tool has enabled him to use this “voice clone” to compose new songs. Darling is able to make music again.

“Sadly, I have lost the ability to sing and play my instruments,” Darling said on stage at the event, which took place in London on Wednesday, using his voice clone. “Despite this, most of my time these days is spent still continuing to compose and produce my music. Doing so feels more important than ever to me now.”

Darling says he’s been a musician and a composer since he was around 14 years old. “I learned to play bass guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, melodica, mandolin, and tenor banjo,” he said at the event. “My biggest love, though, was singing.”

He met bandmate Nick Cocking over 10 years ago, while he was still a university student, says Cocking. Darling joined Cocking’s Irish folk outfit, the Ceili House Band, shortly afterwards, and their first gig together was in April 2014. Darling, who joined the band as a singer and guitarist, “elevated the musicianship of the band,” says Cocking.

But a few years ago, Cocking and his other bandmates started noticing changes in Darling. He became clumsy, says Cocking. He recalls one night when the band had to walk across the city of Cardiff in the rain: “He just kept slipping and falling, tripping on paving slabs and things like that.”

He didn’t think too much of it at the time, but Darling’s symptoms continued to worsen. The disease affected his legs first, and in August 2023, he started needing to sit during performances. Then he started to lose the use of his hands. “Eventually he couldn’t play the guitar or the banjo anymore,” says Cocking.

By April 2024, Darling was struggling to talk and breathe at the same time, says Cocking. For that performance, the band carried Darling on stage. “He called me the day after and said he couldn’t do it anymore,” Cocking says, his voice breaking. “By June 2024, it was done.” It was the last time the band played together.

Darling was put in touch with a speech therapist, who raised the possibility of “banking” his voice. People who are losing the ability to speak can opt to record themselves speaking and use those recordings to create speech sounds that can then be activated with typed text, whether by hand or perhaps using a device controlled by eye movements.

Some users have found these tools to be robotic sounding. But Darling had another issue. “By that stage, my voice had already changed,” he said at the event. “It felt like we were saving the wrong voice.”

Then another speech therapist introduced him to a different technology. Richard Cave is a speech and language therapist and a researcher at University College London. He is also a consultant for ElevenLabs, an AI company that develops agents and audio, speech, video, and music tools. One of these tools can create “voice clones”—realistic mimics of real voices that can be generated from minutes, or even seconds, of a person’s recorded voice.

Last year, ElevenLabs launched an impact program with a promise to provide free licenses to these tools for people who have lost their voices to ALS or other diseases, like head and neck cancer or stroke.

The tool is already helping some of those users. “We’re not really improving how quickly they’re able to communicate, or all of the difficulties that individuals with MND are going through physically, with eating and breathing,” says Gabi Leibowitz, a speech therapist who leads the program. “But what we are doing is giving them a way … to create again, to thrive.” Users are able to stay in their jobs longer and “continue to do the things that make them feel like human beings,” she says.

Cave worked with Darling to use the tool to re-create his lost speaking voice from older recordings.

“The first time I heard the voice, I thought it was amazing,” Darling said at the event, using the voice clone. “It sounded exactly like I had before, and you literally wouldn’t be able to tell the difference,” he said. “I will not say what the first word I made my new voice say, but I can tell you that it began with ‘f’ and ended in ‘k.’”

Re-creating his singing voice wasn’t as easy. The tool typically requires around 10 minutes of clear audio to generate a clone. “I had no high-quality recordings of myself singing,” Darling said. “We had to use audio from videos on people’s phones, shot in noisy pubs, and a couple of recordings of me singing in my kitchen.” Still, those snippets were enough to create a “synthetic version of [Darling’s] singing voice,” says Cave.

In the recordings, Darling sounded a little raspy and “was a bit off” on some of the notes, says Cave. The voice clone has the same qualities. It doesn’t sound perfect, Cave says—it sounds human.

“The ElevenLabs voice that we’ve created is wonderful,” Darling said at the event. “It definitely sounds like me—[it] just kind of feels like a different version of me.”

ElevenLabs has also developed an AI music generator called Eleven Music. The tool allows users to compose tracks, using text prompts to choose the musical style. Several well-known artists have also partnered with the company to license AI clones of their voices, including the actor Michael Caine, whose voice clone is being used to narrate an upcoming ElevenLabs documentary. Last month, the company released an album of 11 tracks created using the tool. “The Liza Minnelli track is really a banger,” says Cave.

Eleven Music can generate a song in a minute, but Darling and Cave spent around six weeks fine-tuning Darling’s song. Using text prompts, any user can “create music and add lyrics in any style [they like],” says Cave. Darling likes Irish folk, but Cave has also worked with a man in Colombia who is creating Colombian folk music. (The ElevenLabs tool is currently available in 74 languages.)

Last month, Cocking got a call from Cave, who sent him Darling’s completed track. “I heard the first two or three words he sang, and I had to turn it off,” he says. “I was just in bits, in tears. It took me a good half a dozen times to make it to the end of the track.”

Darling and Cave were making plans to perform the track live at the ElevenLabs summit in London on Wednesday, February 11. So Cocking and bandmate Hari Ma each arranged accompanying parts to play on the mandolin and fiddle. They had a couple of weeks to rehearse before they joined Darling on stage, two years after their last performance together.

“I wheeled him out on stage, and neither of us could believe it was happening,” says Cave. “He was thrilled.” The song was played as Darling remained on stage, and Cocking and Ma played their instruments live.

Cocking and Cave say Darling plans to continue to use the tools to make music. Cocking says he hopes to perform with Darling again but acknowledges that, given the nature of ALS, it is difficult to make long-term plans.

“It’s so bittersweet,” says Cocking. “But getting up on stage and seeing Patrick there filled me with absolute joy. I know Patrick really enjoyed it as well. We’ve been talking about it … He was really, really proud.”

US deputy health secretary: Vaccine guidelines are still subject to change

Over the past year, Jim O’Neill has become one of the most powerful people in public health. As the US deputy health secretary, he holds two roles at the top of the country’s federal health and science agencies. He oversees a department with a budget of over a trillion dollars. And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with MIT Technology Review earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. Fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope he will bring attention and funding to their cause.

At the same time, O’Neill defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health. Read the full story.

Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the Ocean’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth.

But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. Read the full story.

RFK Jr. follows a carnivore diet. That doesn’t mean you should.

Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.

Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that a lot of shared diet information is nonsense. But what’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">If you checked X today expecting the usual stream of hot takes, memes, and AI spats, you probably saw… nothing. A widespread outage hit the platform today, leaving feeds blank, timelines unresponsive, and users staring at the digital equivalent of an empty room.

Outage trackers such as Downdetector logged a dramatic surge in problem reports around midday GMT, with tens of thousands of users across regions, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, and India, reporting problems accessing the service. Some described impossible login loops and error messages telling them only that “something went wrong.”

Here’s where it gets curious: nobody from X has confirmed why the platform hiccupped. Despite the scale of the disruption, and a global user base reliant on the service for everything from breaking news to weather alerts, there’s been no official timeline for a fix or even an acknowledgement of a broader issue. For a service that prides itself on instant updates, the silence is notable.

This isn’t the first time X has ground to a halt. The platform has a history of outages since its rebranding from Twitter, with users historically greeted by messages like “Something went wrong” when backend systems hiccup.

Today’s disruption even impacted associated tech. Reports suggest that Grok, the AI chatbot tied into X’s ecosystem, also faced interruptions as timelines failed to load, underscoring how much of the platform’s experience still depends on backend stability.

For now, the outage remains a developing story, and users left refreshing their browsers might be asking the most modern question of all: was it a bug, a server gremlin, or just another Monday on X?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I need to say something that might make CS leaders uncomfortable: most of what your team does before a renewal is valuable, but it’s listening to only one channel. Your EBRs, your health scores, your stakeholder maps. They capture what your customer is willing to tell you directly. What they don’t capture is the conversation happening everywhere else. And that’s usually where churn starts.

I know because I ran the standard playbook for years. EBRs, stakeholder mapping, health score reviews, and renewal prep meetings, where we rated our gut feeling on a scale of green to red. We had dashboards. We had strong CSMs who genuinely cared about their accounts. And we still got blindsided.

The $2M quarter is the one I can’t forget. Two enterprise accounts churned in the same 90-day window. Both were green in every system we had. One had an NPS of 72.

When I dug into what happened, I didn’t find a CS execution problem. I found a coverage gap. Every signal had been there. Just not in the places our process was designed to look. I sat in the post-mortem knowing we’d done everything our process asked us to do. That was the problem.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Later in this article, I’ll show you what both of those accounts would have looked like inside Renewal Fix. Before anyone on my team knew there was a problem.

I’m not saying EBRs are useless. A well-run EBR builds relationship depth, gives your champion ammunition internally, and surfaces problems the customer is willing to raise directly. But even the best EBR has a structural limitation: it only captures what someone chooses to say out loud, in a meeting, to a vendor.

The real conversation about your product is happening in a Slack channel you’ll never see, in a procurement review you weren’t invited to, and in a 1:1 between your champion and their new boss who just joined from a company that used your competitor. The EBR gives you one essential channel. The danger is treating it as the only one.

Here’s what was actually happening in those two accounts that churned on me.

Account one: their engineering team had filed 23 support tickets about API latency over four months. Not “the product is broken” tickets. Small, specific, technical complaints that got resolved individually. Nobody in CS ever saw them because they never escalated to “critical.” But lined up chronologically, the pattern was unmistakable: this team was losing patience, one resolved ticket at a time.

Account two: three of their five power users updated their LinkedIn profiles in the same two-week window. One started posting about a competitor’s product. Our champion’s title changed from “Head of” to “Senior Manager.” A quiet demotion nobody noticed because we were watching product usage dashboards, not org charts.

Every CS leader I know has lost an account and later found out the champion left months ago. The customer’s reaction is always the same: “We assumed you knew.” They expect you to track publicly available professional changes, the same information any recruiter monitors. Not tracking them isn’t respectful. It’s a blind spot.

Neither signal lived in our CRM. Neither showed up in our health score. They were sitting in plain sight in systems our CS team had no reason to check.

Health scores aren’t the problem. Treating them as the whole picture is. A typical health score aggregates NPS, login frequency, support ticket count, and feature adoption. Green means safe. Red means act. But these are lagging indicators. By the time login frequency drops, the decision to evaluate alternatives may already be in motion.

When I started tracking leading indicators alongside our existing health model, the difference was striking. Across roughly 300 mid-market accounts over 18 months, we found that support ticket velocity, specifically the rate of increase in non-critical tickets over a rolling 90-day window, predicted churn at T-90 at roughly 2x the accuracy of our composite health score. The signals that actually predict churn aren’t the ones most CS platforms are designed to track.

The teams with the strongest renewal rates don’t abandon their existing processes. They add a signal layer on top. The highest-signal sources break into three tiers.

Tier 1: Support ticket patterns. Not the count, but the velocity, the sentiment trend, and whether the same team keeps filing. A steady trickle of “resolved” tickets from one engineering team is often a louder signal than a single P1 escalation. At scale, this becomes cohort-level complaint clustering across a segment.

Tier 2: People changes. Champion turnover, re-orgs, title changes, and new executives from a competitor’s customer base. The person who bought your product and the person renewing it are often not the same person. At scale, you’re watching for patterns of org instability across your book.

Tier 3: Competitive exposure. Whether your customer is being actively pitched, attending competitor events, or has team members engaging with competitor content online. At scale, you’re tracking which segments your competitors are targeting hardest.

The real challenge isn’t knowing what to track. It’s that these signals live in five or six different systems, and nobody’s job is to stitch them together. Your CSM sees Zendesk. Your SE sees Jira. Your AE sees Salesforce. The full picture only exists if someone manually assembles it.

One team I worked with built a manual version of this: CSMs logging signals from six different sources every Friday. About 90 minutes per account per week. Their renewal rate hit 96%. But the approach doesn’t scale past a 25-account book.

At 80 accounts in a mid-market motion, you need automation. At 150+ in a PLG model, the signals are still there, you’re watching for cohort-level drops in feature adoption or clusters of the same complaint across a segment, but you cannot find them without automation.

The teams doing this manually are logging into six tools every Friday. The teams doing this with automation get a Slack message when something changes. No dashboard to check. No Friday ritual.

Detection without a playbook is just anxiety. The point of catching signals early isn’t to panic. It’s to have time to act. An executive sponsor who hasn’t logged in for 90 days needs a different intervention than an account with a competitor POC in their Salesforce sandbox. The signal tells you what’s happening. The response has to match.

That gap between knowing what to track and actually tracking it consistently is why I built Renewal Fix. Not to replace the manual process, but to remove the ceiling on it. The platform pulls signals from support tickets, call recordings, CRM data, and engineering channels automatically, stitches them into a single account view, and flags them before they become a renewal surprise.

Enter your work email at renewalfix.com. In 30 seconds, you’ll get a one-page executive brief showing your blind spots: 10 accounts that look like they belong in your CS platform, built from your company’s products, competitive landscape, and integration stack, each with a health score and risk signals sourced from support tickets, call recordings, and org changes that your current dashboard would never surface. No demo, no sales call.

Find the account that looks most like Account One. Health score in the 70s, risk signals hiding underneath. Then click “Executive Brief” for a one-page summary of your portfolio’s total risk exposure, with dollar amounts and prioritized actions. That view is what Renewal Fix delivers weekly in production.

Your green accounts aren’t necessarily at risk. But they might be quieter than you realize.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, Peter Steinberger was experimenting with a side project that quickly caught fire across the developer world. His open-source AI assistant, OpenClaw, wasn’t just another chatbot; it could act on your behalf, from managing emails to integrating with calendars and messaging platforms.

Today, that project has a new chapter: Steinberger is joining OpenAI to help build the next generation of personal AI agents.

This move isn’t just about talent acquisition. It marks a switch in how the AI industry thinks about assistants: from reactive systems you talk to, toward agents that take initiative and perform tasks autonomously, with potential implications for productivity, workflows, and personal automation.

OpenClaw first emerged in late 2025 under names like Clawdbot and Moltbot. What distinguished it was not fancy visuals or marketing, but its practical ambition: give users an AI that connects to their tools and executes workflows, booking flights, sorting messages, scheduling meetings, in ways that feel closer to agency than assistant.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It quickly went viral on GitHub, drawing more than 100,000 stars and millions of visits to its project page within weeks.

Rather than turning OpenClaw into a standalone company, Steinberger chose to partner with OpenAI, a decision he explained in a blog post as driven by a simple goal: bring intelligent agents to a broader audience as quickly as possible.

According to him, OpenAI’s infrastructure, research resources, and product ecosystem offered the best path to scale such an ambitious idea.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman welcomed Steinberger’s move as strategic, underscoring that the company expects personal agents, systems capable of initiating, coordinating, and completing tasks across apps, to be an important part of future AI products.

Altman’s public post noted that OpenClaw will continue to exist as an open-source project under a new foundation supported by OpenAI, preserving its accessibility and community roots.

The notion of AI that does things has been bubbling under the surface of tech discourse, but OpenClaw’s popularity crystallised it. Users interact with their agents through familiar interfaces like messaging platforms, but behind the scenes, these agents orchestrate API calls, automate scripts, handle notifications, and adapt to changing schedules, all without explicit commands after initial setup.

This trajectory, from an experimental open-source project to a central piece of a major AI lab’s strategy, speaks to broader trends in the industry. Competitors from Anthropic to Google DeepMind have also indicated interest in multi-agent systems and autonomous workflows, but OpenAI’s move signals how seriously the category is now being taken.

It suggests a future where AI isn’t just conversational, but proactive and tightly integrated into everyday tooling.

At the same time, this evolution raises fresh questions about governance and safety. OpenClaw’s open-source nature meant that developers could experiment freely, but that freedom also exposed potential attack surfaces; misconfigured agents with access to sensitive accounts or automation processes could be exploited if not properly safeguarded.

That is one reason why maintaining an open foundation with careful oversight matters as these tools scale.

For OpenAI, Steinberger’s arrival embeds this agent-first thinking into its product roadmap at a critical moment. The company is already exploring “multi-agent” architectures, where specialised AIs coordinate with each other and with users to handle complex tasks more effectively than monolithic models alone. Steinberger brings an experimental sensibility and real-world experience that could accelerate those efforts.

This could mean future versions of ChatGPT or other OpenAI products will be able to carry out tasks you define, rather than waiting for you to prompt them. That shift, from conversational replies to autonomous action, is the next frontier in how AI will fit into daily digital life.

And with OpenClaw’s creator now inside one of the most influential AI labs in the world, that future feels closer than ever.

            <div id="article-text">The 62nd Munich Security Conference opened on 13 February 2026 in Munich, Germany, and this year’s gathering feels different from past editions.

For decades, Munich was about jets, troops, and treaties. Today, cyber and AI are no longer peripheral; they are part of the architecture of security itself.

Cyber risks, digital infrastructure, and emerging technologies like AI now sit alongside tanks and treaties on the agenda as European leaders try to make sense of a world where digital threats and geopolitical tensions are deeply intertwined.

Sponsors of the conference, such as the Tech Strategy Initiative, explicitly include technological frontier issues in the program, signalling that debates once confined to tech policy circles have broken into mainstream security discourse.

On day one, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz laid out a blunt message: the post-World War II order is fraying, and Europe can’t take its digital or geopolitical armour for granted.

In this context, cyber threats and disinformation campaigns sit side-by-side with missiles on the agenda, and delegates acted accordingly.

One of the most striking takeaways from early sessions was the call from Germany’s intelligence leadership for greater latitude to counter hybrid threats, especially cyber attacks and digital sabotage linked to geopolitical rivals.

That marks a clear recognition that state security no longer stops at the network perimeter.

Europe is still wrestling with its identity in this new era. France’s Emmanuel Macron used his keynote to stress that Europe must become a geopolitical power, an assertion that encompasses not just tanks and diplomacy but also domestic tech capabilities and digital resilience.

Behind the diplomatic language lies a subtler shift: technology is being woven into Europe’s strategic autonomy narrative.

For years, EU policy focused on digital sovereignty through regulation, the AI Act, data protection, and competition law. In Munich, those topics are now being discussed in direct relation to security and defence priorities. Officials and experts are framing AI and cyber resilience not just as economic or ethical issues, but as core national security concerns.

Cyber, in particular, has shed its niche status. While not all panels are formal conference sessions, side events and adjacent tracks like the Munich Cyber Security Conference reflect a broader realisation: traditional defence without a digital strategy is obsolete.

Defense analysts note that critical infrastructure, from power grids to military supply chains, is already being targeted with an intensity that demands coordinated public-private responses.

This shift has real consequences for European tech. If governments treat cyber and AI as strategic assets, they will push industry to meet security standards beyond compliance, incentivise homeland innovation over outsourcing, and push for interoperable defence technologies.

For European startups and tech leaders, that could change investment flows and R&D priorities in the next decade.

At Munich, the political undercurrents are as telling as the formal speeches. European leaders acknowledge that old alliances, especially with the United States, remain crucial but can’t be the sole guarantor of security.

That affects tech policy too. A pivot toward autonomy could mean tailoring AI standards to European norms, investing in sovereign semiconductor supply chains, and crafting digital infrastructure less dependent on external cloud and data platforms.

It also means Europe may push for security cooperation mechanisms akin to intelligence-sharing networks that historically excluded it. For example, European cyber chiefs are openly discussing options like an EU “own Five Eyes” model to coordinate multinational defence.

What the 2026 Munich Security Conference shows most clearly is how Europe is rethinking its place in a world where digital and geopolitical risks can no longer be separated.

Discussions here reinforce a shift in how policymakers, defence chiefs and industry leaders alike view modern threats: not as abstract data problems, but as strategic concerns that shape alliances, domestic policy choices and industrial priorities alike.

From calls for stronger cyber capabilities to renewed emphasis on strategic autonomy and technological resilience, this year’s gathering points to a future where technology is no longer an accessory to security policy but one of its pillars.

For Europe’s tech ecosystem, that means regulatory agendas, investment flows, and public-private cooperation will be shaped not just by innovation goals but by national and collective security imperatives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London-based deep tech startup Stanhope AI has closed a €6.7 million ($8 million) Seed funding round to advance what it calls a new class of adaptive artificial intelligence designed to power autonomous systems in the physical world.

The round was led by Frontline Ventures, with participation from Paladin Capital Group, Auxxo Female Catalyst Fund, UCL Technology Fund, and MMC Ventures.

The company says its approach moves beyond the pattern-matching strengths of large language models, aiming instead for systems that can perceive, reason, and act with a degree of context awareness in uncertain environments.

Stanhope is developing what it terms a “Real World Model”, building on principles from neuroscience and computational theory to allow machines to learn and adapt on the fly.

“We’re moving from language-based AI to intelligence that possesses the ability to act to understand its world – a system with a fundamental agency,” says Professor Rosalyn Moran, CEO and co-founder of Stanhope AI.

Her team includes theoretical neurobiologist Professor Karl Friston, whose work on the Free Energy Principle informs the startup’s methodology.

Rather than relying on cloud-centric deep learning, Stanhope’s models are designed to run efficiently on edge devices with limited data and power. That fits a broader industry shift toward on-device AI, where systems must operate reliably in dynamic settings such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and defence hardware.

The firm says its technology is already being tested on drones and other autonomous platforms with international partners.

Stanhope’s funding comes amid sustained investor interest in AI and autonomy startups across Europe. In recent months, companies from robotic manufacturing to defence software have attracted capital, underscoring demand for systems that go beyond conventional machine learning.

Frontline Ventures partner Zoe Chambers said Stanhope’s progress from academic research to production-ready systems was a rare combination in the industry, and that the technology had clear potential in domains where machines must react and adapt in real time.

Christopher Steed of Paladin Capital Group highlighted the relevance of adaptive AI for critical and security-sensitive applications.

Founded in 2023 as a spin-out from University College London and King’s College London, Stanhope AI aims to carve a niche at the intersection of robotics, industrial automation, and defense.

The new capital will help push its technology further into real-world deployments, where adaptability and resilience are often the key barriers to broader adoption.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anthropic has just closed a $30 billion Series G funding round, pushing its valuation to $380 billion and catapulting it into the rarefied ranks of the most valuable private tech companies in the world.

The financing was led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and investment firm Coatue, with backing from a long list of global institutions, including D.E. Shaw Ventures, Dragoneer, Founders Fund, ICONIQ, and MGX, alongside strategic participation from existing tech investors.

That valuation is roughly double what Anthropic was worth at its last funding round in 2025, when it raised $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money figure.

Anthropic’s pitch for capital isn’t just about being “bigger” than its peers. According to the company’s own figures, it has grown from its first dollar of revenue to a running rate of about $14 billion in under three years, with revenue climbing more than tenfold annually across that span. That momentum matters to investors because it signals real commercial demand, not just theoretical potential.

A meaningful slice of that growth comes from enterprise customers who pay for Anthropic’s AI services and tools, including its Claude line of large language models and developer-focused products like Claude Code, which has seen particularly strong adoption.

Where Anthropic differs from many early-stage AI startups is that its product suite is not pitched solely at individual consumers. Instead, the focus is on business workflows and developer tools that can slot directly into existing enterprise systems.

That positioning appears to have broadened its customer base and diversified revenue streams in ways that pure chatbot plays haven’t yet matched.

A $380 billion valuation raises obvious comparisons with rivals, specifically OpenAI, which completed its own historic funding in 2025, but it also changes how the business will operate going forward.

With this capital, Anthropic plans to expand research, scale infrastructure, and accelerate development across emerging use cases in finance, cybersecurity, analytics, and beyond.

The size of the raise underlines how much money is still chasing artificial intelligence opportunities, even as parts of the wider tech sector cool off. For Anthropic, it also brings pressure: investors will expect the company to maintain rapid growth while steering clear of costly missteps in an increasingly competitive landscape.

This round matters not just for Anthropic’s balance sheet, but because it reflects how investors are thinking about the next phase of AI deployment. The emphasis has shifted from consumer-facing chatbots to enterprise-grade systems that automate real business tasks and workflows.

Anthropic’s success underscores that the market sees practical, high-revenue use cases as the next frontier and is willing to place massive bets on companies that can execute there.

If Anthropic continues on its current trajectory, it won’t just shape how AI tools are built. It will help define how they are purchased, integrated, and scaled across industries that have historically been slow to adopt new technology.
