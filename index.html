            <h2>“Ungentrified” Craigslist may be the last real place on the Internet</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2026/01/ungentrified-craigslist-may-be-the-last-real-place-on-the-internet/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The writer and comedian Megan Koester got her first writing job, reviewing Internet pornography, from a Craigslist ad she responded to more than 15 years ago. Several years after that, she used the listings website to find the rent-controlled apartment where she still lives today. When she wanted to buy property, she scrolled through Craigslist and found a parcel of land in the Mojave Desert. She built a dwelling on it (never mind that she’d later discover it was unpermitted) and furnished it entirely with finds from Craigslist’s free section, right down to the laminate flooring, which had previously been used by a production company.

“There’s so many elements of my life that are suffused with Craigslist,” says Koester, 42, whose Instagram account is dedicated, at least in part, to cataloging screenshots of what she has dubbed “harrowing images” from the site’s free section; on the day we speak, she’s wearing a cashmere sweater that cost her nothing, besides the faith it took to respond to an ad with no pictures. “I’m ride or die.”

Koester is one of untold numbers of Craigslist aficionados, many of them in their thirties and forties, who not only still use the old-school classifieds site but also consider it an essential, if anachronistic, part of their everyday lives. It’s a place where anonymity is still possible, where money doesn’t have to be exchanged, and where strangers can make meaningful connections—for romantic pursuits, straightforward transactions, and even to cast unusual creative projects, including experimental TV shows like The Rehearsal on HBO and Amazon Freevee’s Jury Duty. Unlike flashier online marketplaces such as DePop and its parent company, Etsy, or Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist doesn’t use algorithms to track users’ moves and predict what they want to see next. It doesn’t offer public profiles, rating systems, or “likes” and “shares” to dole out like social currency; as a result, Craigslist effectively disincentivizes clout-chasing and virality-seeking—behaviors that are often rewarded on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and X. It’s a utopian vision of a much earlier, far more earnest Internet.

“The real freaks come out on Craigslist,” says Koester. “There’s a purity to it.” Even still, the site is a little tamer than it used to be: Craigslist shut down its “casual encounters” ads and took its personals section offline in 2018, after Congress passed legislation that would’ve put the company on the hook for listings from potential sex traffickers. The “missed connections” section, however, remains active.

The site is what Jessa Lingel, an associate professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, has called the “ungentrified” Internet. If that’s the case, then online gentrification has only accelerated in recent years, thanks in part to the proliferation of AI. Even Wikipedia and Reddit, visually basic sites created in the early aughts and with an emphasis similar to Craigslist’s on fostering communities, have both incorporated their own versions of AI tools.

Some might argue that Craigslist, by contrast, is outdated; an article published in this magazine more than 15 years ago called it “underdeveloped” and “unpredictable.” But to the site’s most devoted adherents, that’s precisely its appeal.

“ I think Craigslist is having a revival,” says Kat Toledo, an actor and comedian who regularly uses the site to hire cohosts for her LA-based stand-up show, Besitos. “When something is structured so simply and really does serve the community, and it doesn’t ask for much? That’s what survives.”

Toledo started using Craigslist in the 2000s and never stopped. Over the years, she has turned to the site to find romance, housing, and even her current job as an assistant to a forensic psychologist. She’s worked there full-time for nearly two years, defying Craigslist’s reputation as a supplier of potentially sketchy one-off gigs. The stigma of the website, sometimes synonymous with scammers and, in more than one instance, murderers, can be hard to shake. “If I’m not doing a good job,” Toledo says she jokes to her employer, “just remember you found me on Craigslist.”

But for Toledo, the site’s “random factor”—the way it facilitates connection with all kinds of people she might not otherwise interact with—is also what makes it so exciting. Respondents to her ads seeking paid cohosts tend to be “people who almost have nothing to lose, but in a good way, and everything to gain,” she says. There was the born-again Christian who performed a reenactment of her religious awakening and the poet who insisted on doing Toledo’s makeup; others, like the commercial actor who started crying on the phone beforehand, never made it to the stage.

It’s difficult to quantify just how many people actively use Craigslist and how often they click through its listings. The for-profit company is privately owned and doesn’t share data about its users. (Craigslist also didn’t respond to a request for comment.) But according to the Internet data company similarweb, Craigslist draws more than 105 million monthly users, making it the 40th most popular website in the United States—not too shabby for a company that doesn’t spend any money on advertising or marketing. And though Craigslist’s revenue has reportedly plummeted over the past half-dozen years, based on an estimate from an industry analytics firm, it remains enormously profitable. (The company generates revenue by charging a modest fee to publish ads for gigs, certain types of goods, and in some cities, apartments.)

“It’s not a perfect platform by any means, but it does show that you can make a lot of money through an online endeavor that just treats users like they have some autonomy and grants everybody a degree of privacy,” says Lingel. A longtime Craigslist user, she began researching the site after wondering, “Why do all these web 2.0 companies insist that the only way for them to succeed and make money is off the back of user data? There must be other examples out there.”

In her book, Lingel traces the history of the site, which began in 1995 as an email list for a couple hundred San Francisco Bay Area locals to share events, tech news, and job openings. By the end of the decade, engineer Craig Newmark’s humble experiment had evolved into a full-fledged company with an office, a domain name, and a handful of hires. In true Craigslist fashion, Newmark even recruited the company’s CEO, Jim Buckmaster, from an ad he posted to the site, initially seeking a programmer.

The two have gone to great lengths to wrest the company away from corporate interests. When they suspected a looming takeover attempt from eBay, which had purchased a minority stake in Craigslist from a former employee in 2004, Newmark and Buckmaster spent roughly a decade battling the tech behemoth in court. The litigation ended in 2015, with Craigslist buying back its shares and regaining control.

“ They are in lockstep about their early ’90s Internet values,” says Lingel, who credits Newmark and Buckmaster with Craigslist’s long-held aesthetic and ethos: simplicity, privacy, and accessibility. “As long as they’re the major shareholders, that will stay that way.”

Craigslist’s refusal to “sell out,” as Koester puts it, is all the more reason to use it. “Not only is there a purity to the fan base or the user base, there’s a purity to the leadership that they’re uncorruptible basically,” says Koester. “I’m gonna keep looking at Craigslist until I die.” She pauses, then shudders: “Or, until Craig dies, I guess.”

            <h2>General Motors writes down $6 billion as domestic EV sales plans change</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/fewer-american-evs-costs-gm-6-billion-even-as-its-chinese-sales-boom/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">American automakers who got overenthusiastic about electric vehicles continue to pay the price—literally. Yesterday, General Motors told investors that building and selling fewer EVs will cost the company $6 billion. Still, things could be worse—last month, rival Ford said it would write down $19.5 billion as a result of its failed EV bet.

GM is not actually abandoning its EV portfolio, even as it reduces shifts at some plants and repurposes others—like the one in Orion, Michigan—into assembling combustion-powered pickups and SUVs instead of EVs. The electric crossovers, SUVs, and pickups from Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC will remain on sale, with the rebatteried Chevy Bolt joining their ranks this year.

But GM says it expects to sell many fewer EVs than once planned. For one thing, the US government abolished the clean vehicle tax credit, which cut the price of an American-made EV by up to $7,500. That government has also told automakers it no longer cares if they sell plenty of inefficient vehicles. Add to that the extreme hostility shown by car dealers toward having to sell EVs in the first place and one can see why GM has decided to retreat, even if we might not sympathize.

Back in October 2025 GM recorded a $1.6 billion charge due to the above and shut down BrightDrop, the brand that was building electric delivery vans for the likes of FedEx and Walmart. As for Q4 2025, GM says it must write down $6 billion, $4.2 billion of which will be payments and cancellation fees to suppliers for components the company no longer needs. The company even says it will feel the loss of emissions credits, which have previously helped cash flow.

Despite these costs, 2025 wasn’t a terrible year for the company. It managed to grow sales by 6 percent in the US, and in China more than half of the 1.9 million vehicles it sold were New Energy Vehicles, which grew by 22.6 percent. NEVs are EVs and plug-in hybrids—in GM’s case, mostly locally developed vehicles sold under the Buick and Electra brands, as well as joint ventures like Wuling, with some Cadillac Lyriqs, too.

Even though BrightDrop is no more, Chevrolet dealers are sitting on more than 2,500 unsold electric vans, slightly more than half of which are the shorter BrightDrop 400, which starts at under $47,000, according to Chevy’s website. The larger BrightDrop 600, with the same offers, is still less than $50,000.

And since these no longer seem to be in high demand by big box retailers and the package delivery companies, now’s the time for people to start picking them up and turning them into camper vans.

I have to believe the demand is out there; any time we’ve covered the BrightDrop, or any other electric van for that matter, most of the comments concern just this kind of conversion. It needn’t be insanely expensive, although depending on your budget you could easily spend twice as much (or more) as the BrightDrop cost on the uplift. But short of spending silly money to EV-restomod one of those six-wheel GMC Motorhomes from the 1970s, you’d definitely have the coolest electric camper out there.</div>

            <h2>NASA orders “controlled medical evacuation” from the International Space Station</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/in-a-first-nasa-orders-astronauts-home-after-unspecified-medical-issue/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA officials said Thursday they have decided to bring home four of the seven crew members on the International Space Station after one of them experienced a “medical situation” earlier this week.

The space agency has said little about the incident, and officials have not identified which crew member suffered the medical issue. James “JD” Polk, NASA’s chief health and medical officer, told reporters Thursday the crew member is “absolutely stable” but that the agency is “erring on the side of caution” with the decision to return the astronaut to Earth.

The ailing astronaut is part of the Crew-11 mission, which launched to the station August 1 and was slated to come back to Earth around February 20. Instead, the Crew-11 astronauts will depart the International Space Station (ISS) in the coming days and head for reentry and a parachute-assisted splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.

“After discussions with our chief health and medical officer, Dr. JD Polk, and leadership across the agency, I’ve come to the decision that it’s in the best interests of our astronauts to return Crew-11 ahead of their planned departure,” NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said Thursday.

The Crew-11 mission is led by commander Zena Cardman, 38, who is wrapping up her first mission to space. Second in command is pilot Mike Fincke, a 58-year-old astronaut on his fourth spaceflight. Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, 55, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, 39, round out the crew.

Isaacman said NASA will release more information about the schedule for Crew-11’s undocking and reentry within the next 48 hours. The crew will come home aboard the same SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft they launched in more than five months ago. The entire crew must return to Earth together because they rely on the same Dragon spacecraft as a lifeboat.

“For over 60 years, NASA has set the standard for safety and security in crewed spaceflight,” Isaacman said. “In these endeavors, including the 25 years of continuous human presence onboard the International Space Station, the health and well-being of our astronauts is always and will be our highest priority.”

Polk, a physician who has served as NASA’s chief medical officer since 2016, said the agency is not ready to release details about the medical issue, citing privacy concerns. “I’m not going to speak about any particular astronaut or any particular specific diagnosis,” Polk said. “I’d ask that we still respect the privacy of the astronaut.”

Two of the Crew-11 astronauts, Cardman and Fincke, were preparing to head outside the space station on a spacewalk early Thursday. Spacewalk preps at the space station include a period of time breathing high concentrations of oxygen to purge nitrogen from the astronauts’ bloodstreams, a mitigation to avoid decompression sickness when crew members are sealed inside their spacesuits’ pure oxygen atmosphere.

Polk said whatever happened Wednesday “had nothing to do” with preparing for the spacewalk. “This was totally unrelated to any operations onboard,” he said. “It’s mostly having a medical issue in the difficult areas of microgravity with the suite of hardware that we have at our avail to complete a diagnosis.”

Yui radioed mission controllers in Houston on Wednesday afternoon requesting a private medical conference with a flight surgeon, then asked ground teams to turn on camera views inside the station ahead of the session. Medical sessions are carried out on private radio channels and are not heard on the regular communication loops between the space station and mission control. Those open loops are streamed around the clock online, but NASA removed the audio feed from YouTube soon after the crew asked for the medical conference.

NASA publicly revealed a medical concern with one of the astronauts later Wednesday afternoon, then announced late Wednesday night that officials were considering bringing the crew home early.

“I won’t go into specific details about the medical incident itself,” Polk said. “But the crew is highly trained, and they came to the aid of their colleague right away, and that’s part of why we do that training.”

The space station is stocked with medical gear and medications to help astronauts respond to emergencies. Crew members are trained to perform ultrasounds, defibrillate patients, and start IVs, among other things. The medical treatment available on the ISS is akin to what an EMT might provide in transit to a hospital, former astronaut Tom Marshburn, himself a medical doctor, said in 2021.

“We have a very robust suite of medical hardware onboard the International Space Station, but we don’t have the complete amount of hardware that I would have in the emergency department, for example, to complete the workup of a patient,” Polk said.

Space station managers will take a few days to determine when the Dragon spacecraft will leave the station. SpaceX will dispatch a recovery ship from Southern California to sail for the splashdown zone in the Pacific, and officials will assess weather and sea conditions before selecting the best opportunity to depart the station. Like every crew return, the vessel will be staffed with medical personnel to examine the astronauts after exiting from the Dragon capsule.

“Because the astronaut is absolutely stable, this is not an emergent evacuation,” Polk said. “We’re not immediately disembarking and getting the astronaut down.”

But without a confirmed diagnosis of the astronaut’s medical issue, there’s some “lingering risk” for the astronaut’s health if they remained in orbit, Polk said. That’s why Isaacman and his deputies agreed to call an early end to the Crew-11 mission.

This was the most significant decision of Isaacman’s young tenure as NASA administrator. He was sworn in as NASA chief last month after clearing a confirmation vote in the Senate. Before taking the helm at NASA, Isaacman charted a career as an entrepreneur and private astronaut, flying to space twice on commercial missions with SpaceX.

After Crew-11’s departure, the space station will operate with a smaller crew of three until the arrival of SpaceX’s Crew-12 mission with a fresh team of astronauts next month. Isaacman said NASA and SpaceX are looking at options to move up the launch of Crew-12 from its current target date of February 15.

Until then, the station’s crew will consist of NASA astronaut Chris Williams and two Russian cosmonauts, who launched to the space station in November on a Russian Soyuz vehicle. Williams and his crewmates—Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergey Mikayev—have their own lifeboat in the Soyuz spacecraft, so they will still have a ride home in the event of a future emergency.

The space station regularly operated with just three crew members for the first decade of its existence. The complex has been permanently staffed since 2000, sometimes with as few as two astronauts or cosmonauts. The standard crew size was raised to six in 2009, then to seven in 2020.

Williams will be solely responsible for overseeing the lab’s US segment until Crew-12 arrives. He will be busy keeping up with maintenance tasks, so managers will likely defer some of the station’s scientific investigations until the complex is back to a full crew.

The early departure of Crew-11, leaving Williams as the only US astronaut aboard, also means NASA will be unable to perform spacewalks. This will mean a “slightly elevated risk” in NASA’s ability to respond to a major hardware failure that might require a spacewalk to fix, said Amit Kshatriya, the agency’s associate administrator.

NASA and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, inked an agreement in 2022 to fly multinational crews on Dragon and Soyuz missions to ensure an American and a Russian are always at the space station. The so-called “seat swap” deal is proving worthwhile with this week’s events.

NASA has never before cut short a human spaceflight mission for medical reasons. “It’s the first time we’ve done a controlled medical evacuation from the vehicle, so that is unusual,” Kshatriya said.

The Soviet Union called an early end for an expedition to the Salyut 7 space station in 1985 after the mission’s commander fell ill in orbit.

In a sense, it is surprising that it took this long. Polk said predictive models suggested the ISS would have a medical evacuation about once every three years. It ended up taking 25 years. In that time, NASA has improved astronauts’ abilities to treat aches and pains, minor injuries, and routine illnesses.

Crews in orbit can now self-treat ailments that might have prompted a crew to return to Earth in the past. One astronaut was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis, or a blood clot, in 2018 without requiring an early departure from the space station. Another astronaut suffered a pinched nerve in 2021 and remained in orbit for another seven months.

One of the more compelling reasons for the space station’s existence is its ability to act as a testbed for learning how to live and work off the planet. The station has served as a laboratory for studying how spaceflight affects the human body, and as a platform to test life support systems necessary for long-duration voyages to deep space.

“We are doing all this to continue to learn,” Isaacman said. “We will absolutely learn from this situation as well, to see if that informs our future on-orbit operations, whether that be on the space station or our future lunar base that we’re pursuing right now, and eventually for deep space missions to Mars.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2002, Bryan Fleming helped to create pcTattletale, software for monitoring phone and computer usage. Fleming’s tool would record everything done on the target device, and the videos would be uploaded to a server where they could be viewed by the pcTattletale subscriber.

This might sound creepy, but it can also be legal when used by a parent monitoring their child or an employee monitoring their workers. These are exactly the use cases that were once outlined on pcTattletale’s website, where the software was said to have “helped tens of thousands of parents stop their daughters from meeting up with pedophiles.” Businesses can “track productivity, theft, lost hours, and more.” Even “police departments use it for investigating.”

But this week, nearly 25 years after launching pcTattletale, Fleming pled guilty in federal court to having knowingly built and marketed software to spy on other adults without their consent. In other words, pcTattletale was often used to spy on romantic partners without their knowledge—and Fleming helped people do it.

It’s unclear when pcTattletale began marketing itself as a tool for catching cheaters, but Fleming’s original business partner left the company in 2011, and Fleming ran things himself from his home in a northern Detroit suburb.

In 2021, Vice reported that pcTattletale was leaking the sensitive data it collected. The story quoted marketing materials about using the tool to catch a “cheating spouse,” which required users to know their spouse’s “pass-code and have access to the phone for about 5 minutes. The best time to do this is when they are sleeping.” The company also provided instructions to hide icons that might reveal that pcTattletale was running on the victim’s phone.

A look through archived versions of the pcTattletale site on the Wayback Machine shows that by 2022, pcTattletale had added numerous “cheating” links to its footers and featured multiple blog posts on ways to “catch your boyfriend cheating.” These explicitly directed people to use the “unlock code to your boyfriend’s phone” to install “the pcTattletale spy app” in order to “watch everything he does on his phone.” One entry even noted that people being spied on in this way are unlikely to be happy about it, and users should “expect him to lash back at you over putting the spy app on his phone. It can really turn the tables.”

Around this same time, federal investigators in California had launched an investigation into “stalkerware,” and pcTattletale was among their targets. It also looked like a site where an arrest might not be too difficult, since Fleming operated out of the US and made no real attempts to hide his location. (Indeed, older versions of the pcTattletale website said explicitly that “Fleming Technologies” was based in Bruce Township, Michigan.) As a government investigator put it, “many of the other [stalkerware] websites under investigation involve targets who are believed to be overseas. For this reason, it is unrealistic to believe that the targets will soon be apprehended.”

But Fleming was easy enough to find, and investigators soon obtained copies of his email account. It contained plenty of support requests in this vein: “Also if there is a way to NOT let user know you are taking screen shot that would be helpful too. My husband knows when there is screen shot being taken as it beeps. He is now suspicious of something being on his phone.”

Despite being repeatedly told that people were using his product to spy on others without their consent, Fleming helped them with tech support.

A government investigator even opened up an affiliate marketing account for pcTattletale, and Fleming reached out to offer ready-made banner ads with text like “pcTattletale Cheating Husband? #1 catch a cheater spy tracker” and “pcTattletale Husband Cheating? Best Catch a Cheater Spy App.”

Fleming noted in an email that pcTattletale was more successful when marketed at women, because “There are a lot more women wanting to catch their man then [sic] the other way around.” Financial records showed that Fleming was selling around 1,200 pcTattletale subscriptions a year at anywhere from $99 to $300.

Based on all this, the government obtained a search warrant in late 2022 and raided the Bruce Township home where Fleming lived.

In 2024, TechCrunch reported that pcTattletale was hacked and much of its data was leaked. Apparently, hackers had gained access to the company’s private keys for the Amazon Web Services account where most of the video data created by the app was stored. Fleming claimed at the time that his company was “out of business and completely done” after the breach.

The feds eventually charged Fleming with selling a product while “knowing or having reason to know” that the software was “primarily useful for the purpose of the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications.” This week in California, Fleming pled guilty to a single count and was released on his own recognizance while awaiting sentencing.

One piece of stalkerware is off the market; unfortunately, many others remain, and their owners and operators are often harder to find.</div>

            <h2>Wi-Fi advocates get win from FCC with vote to allow higher-power devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/fcc-to-authorize-more-powerful-wireless-devices-in-6-ghz-wi-fi-band/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Federal Communications Commission plans to authorize a new category of wireless devices in the 6 GHz Wi-Fi band that will be permitted to operate at higher power levels than currently allowed. The FCC will also consider authorizing higher power levels for certain wireless devices that are only allowed to operate indoors.

The FCC said it scheduled a vote for its January 29 meeting on an order “to create a new category of unlicensed devices… that can operate outdoors and at higher power than previously authorized devices.” These so-called Geofenced variable power (GVP) devices operating on the 6 GHz band will “support high data rates suitable for AR/VR, short-range hotspots, automation, and indoor navigation,” and “overcome limitations of previous device classes by allowing higher power and outdoor mobility,” the FCC said. They will be required to work with geofencing systems to avoid interference with fixed microwave links and radio astronomy observatories.

FCC Chairman Brendan Carr attributed the FCC’s planned action to President Trump in a press release titled, “President Trump Unleashes American Innovation With 6 GHz Win.” That’s consistent with Carr’s relatively new stance that the FCC takes orders from the president, despite his insisting during the Biden era that the FCC must operate independently from the White House.

While many of Carr’s regulatory decisions have been criticized by consumer advocates, the 6 GHz action is an exception. Michael Calabrese, of New America’s Open Technology Institute, told Ars that “increasing the power levels for Wi-Fi connections to peripheral devices such as AR/VR is a big win for consumers” and a change that has been “long advocated by the Wi-Fi community.”

Carr said that the FCC “will vote on an order that expands unlicensed operations in the 6 GHz band so that consumers can benefit from better, faster Wi-Fi and an entirely new generation of wireless devices—from AR/VR and IoT to a range of innovative smart devices. [It] will do so through a set of forward-looking regulations that allow devices to operate at higher power while protecting incumbent users, including through geofencing systems.”

The FCC press release described the new class of devices as follows:

Geofenced variable power (GVP) devices promise to overcome technical and regulatory constraints of other low power devices such as low power indoor (LPI) and very low power (VLP) devices. GVP devices offer data rates suitable for reality/virtual reality, short-range hotspots, automation processes, and indoor location and navigation because they operate at significantly higher power than VLP devices. At the same time, GVP devices need not be restricted indoors, as is the case with LPI. These benefits will be made possible by restricting GVP devices from operating in exclusion zones on certain frequencies to protect incumbent licensed services from any significant risk of harmful interference.

GVP device power limits will be “up to 11 dBm/MHz PSD and 24 dBm EIRP,” the FCC said. The FCC will also evaluate ideas to boost the power of low-power indoor devices sometime in the future. The FCC said it “will seek comment on proposals that could provide more utility for unlicensed devices in the 6 GHz band,” including “a proposal to allow composite standard-power and LPI access points to operate with additional power under certain circumstances.”

A draft of the order said the planned “additional power will enable composite standard-power/LPI access points to increase indoor coverage and provide more versatility to American consumers.” The FCC will also seek comment on a proposal to authorize LPI access points on cruise ships.

Calabrese said that increasing power for indoor-only devices would be a big deal because “it’s long been recognized that the indoor-only power limits are overly restrictive.” The Open Technology Institute and over a dozen other advocacy groups urged the FCC to make this change in an August 2023 letter to then-Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel.

“We’ve pushed hard for that and were very disappointed that the Rosenworcel FCC failed to get it done,” Calabrese said.

Harold Feld of Public Knowledge, another group that signed the August 2023 letter, welcomed the FCC plan and said more actions are needed to promote use of unlicensed spectrum. While much of the public spectrum is licensed for the exclusive use of individual wireless carriers, Wi-Fi and similar services operate on unlicensed spectrum that is shared by many users.

“This is important for Wi-Fi 7 as well as Wi-Fi 6,” Feld wrote today in response to the Carr plan. “But we need a real pipeline for more unlicensed spectrum. Glad to see value of unlicensed acknowledged. Looking forward to more of it.”

Despite the positive response to Carr’s plan this week, there’s still a potential threat to Wi-Fi’s use of the 6 GHz band. The 1,200 MHz between 5.925 and 7.125 GHz was allocated to Wi-Fi in April 2020, but a plan to auction spectrum to wireless carriers could take some of those frequencies away from Wi-Fi.

A law approved by Congress and Trump in July 2025 requires the FCC to auction at least 800 MHz of spectrum, some of which could come from the 6 GHz band currently allocated to Wi-Fi or the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) in the 3550 MHz to 3700 MHz range. The FCC has some leeway to decide which frequencies to auction, and its pending decision in the matter will draw much interest from groups interested in preserving and expanding Wi-Fi and CBRS access.

Calabrese said in June 2025 that 6 GHz and CBRS “are the most vulnerable non-federal bands for reallocation and auction.” But now, after Trump administration statements claiming 6 GHz Wi-Fi as a key Trump accomplishment and support from congressional Republicans, Calabrese told Ars today that reallocation of Wi-Fi frequencies “seems far less likely.” Advocates are “far more worried about CBRS now than 6 GHz,” he said.

In addition to consumer advocacy groups, the cable industry has been lobbying for Wi-Fi and CBRS, putting it in opposition to the mobile industry that seeks more exclusive licenses to use airwaves. Cable industry lobby group NCTA said yesterday that it is “encouraged by the FCC’s action to enhance usage in the 6 GHz band. With Wi-Fi now carrying nearly 90 percent of mobile data, securing more unlicensed spectrum is essential to keep up with surging consumer demand, power emerging technologies, and ensure fast, reliable connections for homes, businesses, and communities nationwide.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Supply shortages and big price increases for RAM and storage have been a major drag for enthusiasts and PC builders in recent months. And while we haven’t yet seen large, widespread price increases for memory-dependent products like pre-built laptop PCs, smartphones, and graphics cards, most companies expect that to change this year if shortages continue.

In the meantime, memory manufacturers are riding high demand and high prices to record profits.

In revenue guidance released this week, Samsung Electronics predicts it will make between 19.9 and 20.1 trillion Korean won in operating profit (roughly $13.8 billion USD) in Q4 2025, compared to just 6.49 trillion won in Q4 of 2024.

Samsung is way more than just a memory business, of course, but its fortunes often rise and fall along with its memory division; Samsung’s profits were dropping dramatically in 2023 partly because of an oversupply of memory that made its memory division lose billions of dollars.

Less-diversified companies that primarily make memory are also raking in money lately. SK Hynix posted its “highest-ever quarterly performance” in Q3 of 2025 with 11.38 trillion Korean won (about $7.8 billion) in operating profit, up from 7.03 trillion in Q3 of 2024, and an operating margin that increased from 40 percent to 47 percent. SK Hynix credits “expanding investments in AI infrastructure” and “surging demand for AI servers” for its performance.

Micron—which recently decided to exit the consumer RAM and storage markets but is still selling its products to other businesses—also reported a big boost to net income year over year, from $1.87 billion in Q1 2025 to $5.24 billion in Q1 2026. This has generated the company’s “highest ever free cash flow.”

“Total company revenue, DRAM and NAND revenue, as well as HBM and data center revenue and revenue in each of our business units, also reached new records [in fiscal Q1],” wrote Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra.

Reading these upbeat earnings reports and forecasts will be cold comfort to people trying to build or upgrade a PC, who have seen the price of a 32GB kit of DDR5-6000 increase from $80 in August 2025 to $340 today. And if the current AI boom continues, it’s unlikely to improve in the near term.

This is a problem with many causes—including scalpers who are capitalizing on the shortages by buying up kits to resell them—but the two biggest ones can be attributed to generative AI companies, and each problem compounds the other.

The first is just that consumers and PC manufacturers get to compete with OpenAI and its ilk for the standard DRAM used for traditional servers and consumer devices. By some estimates, OpenAI’s “Stargate” could use as much as 40 percent of the world’s DRAM output all by itself (though that figure uses production numbers as of 2024 and 2025 and doesn’t take production increases into account).

The second is that the HBM (high-bandwidth memory) used for Nvidia’s AI data center GPUs uses about three times as much space on a silicon wafer as the same amount of standard DDR5. So when memory manufacturers shift their production capacity to HBM instead of DRAM, it disproportionately reduces the amount of DRAM that they can make.

Either of these problems would drive up the prices of RAM a bit, but dealing with increased demand and reduced supply at the same time is what has kicked memory prices into the stratosphere.

As things currently stand, the AI industry’s gargantuan demand for these chips will keep memory prices elevated, possibly for years. According to Bank of America analysts cited by SK Hynix, the average selling price for DRAM will increase by as much as 33 percent in 2026, and the market for just HBM in 2028 could be larger than the entire RAM market was in 2024. Micron’s CEO expects both increased demand and constrained supply “to persist beyond calendar 2026,” suggesting that we could be waiting years for the current crunch to end.

Of course, all of these companies’ forecasts rely on the continued demand for RAM in AI data centers. If there’s an AI bubble and it bursts or deflates, memory manufacturers could find themselves back where Samsung was in 2023—sitting on such big piles of unsold chips that they have to reduce prices to move all the inventory.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the first time ever, NASA has been forced to cut a mission to the International Space Station short due to a “serious medical condition” affecting a crew member.

The four Crew-11 astronauts, who arrived at the station in early August, will now be returning a month early on board a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. All four crew members must return together, since they all rely on the same spacecraft for transportation and a place to hide out in case of an emergency.

There’s a lot we still don’t know about what occurred. On Thursday, NASA held a news conference to discuss the situation, insisting that the crew member was “stable” and that “due to medical privacy,” it wouldn’t be “appropriate for NASA to share more details about the crew member.”

The agency, however, revealed that the unidentified crew member did not sustain an injury and was “totally unrelated” to any space operations, including a Wednesday spacewalk that was unexpectedly cancelled.

Recently sworn-in NASA administrator Jared Isaacman made the announcement that the Crew-11 mission would be cutting their time on board the aging orbital outpost short. It’s likely the biggest decision he’s had to make during his extremely short tenure as the agency’s head.

More information about a more detailed timeline will be released within the next 48 hours.

“After discussions with our chief health and medical officer, Dr. JD Polk, and leadership across the agency, I’ve come to the decision that it’s in the best interests of our astronauts to return Crew-11 ahead of their planned departure,” he said.

Polk also insisted that “because the astronaut is absolutely stable, this is not an emergency evacuation.”

“We’re not immediately disembarking and getting the astronaut down,” he added.

It’s a historic moment for the space station. Despite having been continuously inhabited since the year 2000, there has never been an early evacuation, as the BBC points out. According to Polk, early predictive models concluded a medical evacuation would happen once every three years — not 25.

“For over 60 years, NASA has set the standard for safety and security in crewed spaceflight,” Isaacman said during Thursday’s conference. “In these endeavors, including the 25 years of continuous human presence onboard the International Space Station, the health and well-being of our astronauts is always and will be our highest priority.”

Getting medical treatment in the cramped and microgravity environment of the ISS isn’t easy. Astronauts are highly trained for medical emergencies, but beyond being able to provide EMT-like treatment, options are limited, Ars Technica reports, options are limited.

“We have a very robust suite of medical hardware onboard the International Space Station, but we don’t have the complete amount of hardware that I would have in the emergency department, for example, to complete the workup of a patient,” Polk told reporters.

The ISS will have to continue operations with a much smaller crew of three after the departure of the Crew-11 crew. According to Isaacman, the subsequent Crew-12 mission may be moved up from its current February 15 date.

            <h2>NASA’s Library Shutdown Scandal Is Ballooning</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/space/nasa-library-shutdown-scandal">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">By March of this year, the Trump administration is hoping to shutter over a dozen buildings and more than 100 labs at NASA’s iconic Goddard Space Flight Center (GFSC) in Maryland, the space agency’s first and oldest space center and a keystone for space research since around the time NASA was established in the late 1950s.

As part of its plans to gut the center, it shut NASA’s largest library at the GFSC last month, threatening to trash important documents in the process.

The news was met with outrage by NASA insiders, who pointed out that many of these historical documents remain undigitized, a scandal that has metastasized into the first major PR challenge for recently sworn-in NASA administrator and billionaire space tourist Jared Isaacman.

While agency officials have maintained that the move was part of a 2022 master plan — a “consolidation, not a closure” per NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens — and that researchers would continue to have access to the library’s archives as NASA teams conduct a 60-day review of all materials, GFSC staffers were taken aback at the abrupt and careless nature of the Trump administration’s actions.

“I feel like crying,” planetary scientist David Williams, who has curated space mission data for NASA’s archives, told NPR this week. “I mean, it’s horrible. I’m so frustrated. I’m so mad, and I’m just so upset.”

According to staffers interviewed by the broadcaster, the closures of buildings at Goddard were “rushed and disorganized, with no clear blueprint to replace important spaces.”

The approach has been reminiscent of the Trump administration’s vindictive approach to slashing agency budgets, as exemplified by Elon Musk’s bull-in-a-china-shop approach with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency last year.

NASA’s budget, in particular, has become a major target of the administration, with a proposed 2026 fiscal budget potentially cutting the agency’s science directorate budget by more than half, an “extinction-level event,” as characterized by critics. (Congress has since rejected Trump’s proposed cuts outright as NASA’s budget continues to be hotly debated.)

“The way that they’ve gone about it has just been extraordinarily haphazard and chaotic, and really to the point of being cruel to the people who work in these buildings,” Goddard operations research analyst Monica Gorman told NPR.

The library’s closure is only the latest in a string of what appear to be tumultuously implemented consolidation efforts. Gorman recalls “chaotic disruptions” and lab equipment being “treated carelessly.”

The agency has since attempted to pour water on the flames, with Isaacman accusing the New York Times of sensationalizing its reporting and mischaracterizing NASA’s plans to throw out undesirable documents currently being stored at the GSFC library.

“The [NYT] story does not fully reflect the context NASA shared,” he tweeted on January 2. “At no point is NASA ‘tossing out’ important scientific or historical materials, and that framing has led to several other misleading headlines.”

But NASA veterans and advisors say the Trump administration’s approach lead lead to  important documents being lost.

“Libraries and archives around the world are being ‘consolidated’ out of existence,” spaceflight engineering expert Dennis Wingo, who has advised NASA as a subject matter expert for decades, wrote in a reply to Isaacman. “I can tell you for an absolute fact that many of the people making the determinations on what is historically valuable or not are not qualified to do so.”

Lawmakers are equally taken aback by the gutting of the GSFC.

“NASA Goddard really is the crown jewel of the NASA facilities when it comes to space science,” senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MA) told NPR. “This administration is essentially doing things without letting the team at NASA Goddard know what their intentions are.”

            <div id="article-text">Amid a riotous AI hype cycle, companies are promising that their agentic AIs will —eventually, at least — do everything from your grocery shopping to booking your travel plans.

And what’ll you do with all that extra leisure time? Kick back and play some video games? Or will you deploy yet another AI to play the games for you, while you passively watch like the slack-jawed humans in “WALL-E”?

It might sound like parody, but Japanese tech giant Sony is looking to do exactly that: let an AI navigate PlayStation games on the human player’s behalf. According to a patent filed in September 2024 and surfaced by Video Games Chronicle, the company has plans for a “Ghost Player” that takes over the player’s character to puppet out the solution if they get stuck.

According to the patent, gamers would choose between a “Guide Mode” that shows an AI presenting the proper way forward or a “Complete Mode” that would simply assume control over the player’s character and play the whole thing on their behalf.

It’s an eyebrow-raising example of how companies are looking to use AI to essentially remove human agency, under the guise of making our lives easier. Gamers have turned to walkthroughs and hints for years, but usually after banging their own heads against difficult challenges, and hence learning something in the process.

Technically, accessibility options in video games are nothing new. Many modern titles allow gamers to adjust difficulty on the fly or even skip certain sections if things get too tricky. Sony’s PlayStation 5 console also has a Game Help system, which provides players with easily-accessed guides and hints mid-game.

Adding AI to that paradigm is clearly of interest to the gaming industry. Last year, Microsoft already introduced an Xbox “AI-driven sidekick,” called Copilot for Gaming, that can coach gamers to improve their skills. However, the large language model-based feature is limited to voice and text prompts.

On a broader scale, the use of AI in the video game industry has proven incredibly controversial. Many gamers have reacted with disgust to game studios using AI for creative tasks, like coming up with promotional artwork or generating character voices.

Nonetheless, company leaders like Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney have vowed to use AI in “nearly all future production.”

Whether companies will go as far as to introduce AI agents that play video games on behalf of players remains to be seen — but considering Sony’s patent, they’re certainly already thinking about it.

Gamers aren’t exactly optimistic about AI encroaching on the experience, especially amid deep confusion over how exactly developers and studios are looking to leverage the tech. In a piece for The Gamer, journalist Mike Drucker predicted that 2026 will be the “year that AI in gaming gets super annoying.”

            <h2>Tesla Fan Profusely Praises FSD For Veering His Car off the Side of the Highway</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/advanced-transport/tesla-fan-praises-fsd-veering-car-highway">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After a Tesla in Full Self-Driving mode suddenly swerved off of a busy highway and almost straight into a ditch, the owner of the vehicle praised the driving technology to high heaven for supposedly saving his skin.

“Tesla FSD saved my life last night on Interstate 95 in South Carolina,” wrote the driver, who goes by the display name “The Electric Israeli.”

“Car in front braked hard suddenly. FSD veered to the left and got back safely on the road,” he explained. “Thank you @Tesla_AI.”

The user, who also calls himself “Dr. Moshe,” helpfully uploaded footage of the incident, and it paints FSD’s supposedly heroic intervention in a far more dubious light.

During a night commute, the video shows the Tesla tailing an SUV in front of it at a reasonable enough distance. But when the SUV brakes and slows down, neither FSD nor Moshe take notice. There’s ample time to react, but instead of gradually slowing down to respond to the SUV in front, the Tesla’s self-driving software brakes at the last second and veers off the road, nearly plunging into the depressed center of the grass median.

The dramatic intervention affords us a view of the road ahead: miles of bumper-to-bumper traffic, meaning that both driver and driving software had no excuse not to be ready for another stop.

Seemingly intended to exculpate FSD, Moshe wrote in a follow-up tweet: “We noticed at the same time.”

Why FSD swerved off the road is anyone’s guess. Hindsight is 20/20, and backseat driving is seldom F1-worthy, but it sure looks like that the Tesla wasn’t in danger of rear-ending the SUV, even though it braked late. The maneuver, we’d hazard, was totally pointless. And had the median been something other than a fairly level stretch of grass, it could’ve ended up a lot worse.

Such is the blind devotion of the Tesla fan. When one man’s Cybertruck running FSD wrapped itself around a pole last year, its owner also praised the automaker. “Thank you @Tesla for engineering the best passive safety in the world,” they wrote after the accident.

A Model Y owner was similarly thankful — or in the owner’s words, “insanely grateful” — after FSD obliterated a deer at full speed while making no attempt to slow down, footage showed, even after acknowledging that Tesla’s service was terrible.

A reminder that Full Self-Driving isn’t actually fully self-driving, and is not classified as autonomous driving software, but rather as a driving assistance feature. Of course, like many Elon Musk products, it commands cultish loyalty even as it’s being investigated by a federal regulator over frequent reports of it driving straight into the path of oncoming trains at railroad crossings. Life-saving tech indeed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in April, we came across a flashy and almost entirely CGI video of a bizarre concept for a rideable, four-legged robotic “horse.”

The video showed the mysterious concept, dubbed Corleo, roaming rocky terrain, leaping over icy crevasses, crossing snowy landscapes without losing its footing, and traversing a dark forest at night — all while carrying an adult rider on its back and being powered by a hydrogen power cell.

While the company behind the idea, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, showed off a full-scale model at an exposition at the time, promising a production-ready device by the far-off date of 2050, we had a lot of trouble believing Corleo was little more than pure vaporware.

But the company has now announced that it’s started to work on turning its ambitious vision into a reality, and decades ahead of schedule. As New Atlas reports, Kawasaki is setting up a dedicated “Safe Adventure Business Development Team,” with the aim of showing off a functioning prototype at the Expo 2030 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

The company is hoping to put the unusual motorcycle on legs on sale by 2035, a lofty plan that still keeps the delivery way well in the future to avoid near-term embarrassment — we’re looking at you, Elon Musk!

According to a press release, Kawasaki is also developing a “riding simulator that enables riding experience of the four-legged mobility vehicle.”

Beyond targeting thrill seekers, the company also suggests that Corleo could be used to “eliminate mountain accidents and make mountainous regions safe and enjoyable for everyone.”

Sure, it may sound like a promising start — but there are plenty of reasons to remain skeptical. For one, achieving the kind of agility the company showed off in its original marketing video will likely remain an enormous engineering challenge.

What exactly a production-ready prototype will be able to do at the Expo 2030 — a mere four years from now — remains unclear as well.

On the other hand, we’ve seen the field of robotics make major leaps and bounds, with an onslaught of humanoid robots that can dance, kickbox, and even cook up an elaborate breakfast. Four-legged robots have similarly learned to effortlessly navigate rugged landscapes and even herd sheep.

In short, for now we’ll reserve judgment — but we’re nonetheless excited about the prospect of a robotic horse that we can ride into the sunset, not unlike Aloy, the protagonist of the popular video game series “Horizon.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">What makes a conspiracy theorist? Is it poor education, an overactive imagination, a tinfoil hat? According to one recent study, it isn’t any of that stuff, but instead something psychologically revealing: a deep insecurity about the world they inhabit.

The study, published in the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology, examined 14 variables in demographics, ideology, and personality for links to conspiratorial thinking. Some 253 adults were recruited to participate in the study, primarily from the UK, US, Canada, and South Africa, with an average age of 49 years old.

Specifically, the researchers were interested in exploring factors that might influence whether a person has “beliefs about cover-ups.” This is the blanket idea that powerful organizations or collectives are concealing the truth from the entire world, which only the conspiracy-minded can see through.

“I have long been interested in conspiracy theories, having published around 20 papers on the topic over the past decade or so,” the study’s lead author and professor of psychology at the Norwegian Business School, Adrian Furnham, told PsyPost. “Few, if any, researchers have taken into account the ‘cover up’ perspective of conspiracy believers.”

To consistently measure conspiratorial thinking, the researchers created a 10-point scale, corresponding to responses to statements such as “politicians usually do not tell us the true motives for their decisions” and “government agencies closely monitor all citizens.” Participants also took a personality assessment called the High Potential Trait Indicator (HTPI), which measures six traits including competitiveness and tolerance of ambiguity.

When all was said and done, one of the main factors researchers found a strong correlation between endorsement of conspiracy theories and an intriguing characteristic: a low tolerance of ambiguity.

In other words, people who feel insecure or uncomfortable when they don’t know all the answers, or who can’t grasp that some situations are complex, multidimensional, and puzzling even to experts. Presented with a complicated set of issues or events, these folks were more likely to sign on to a hare-brained conspiracy theory that offered an easy answer, even if it was wrong, or an oversimplification.

There was also a significant correlation between those who believe that the world is fundamentally unfair — from a “human nature” point of view — and those who subscribe to far-fetched theories. Those who believe in an “unjust world,” the researchers found, were also more inclined to believe in shadowy groups pulling the strings.

Contrary to what many may think, the researchers found no correlation between a person’s level of education and their capacity to believe in absurd conspiracies. Basically, this suggests that intelligence isn’t a factor determining whether a person falls into a conspiracy rabbithole, which paints a far different picture of conspiracy theorists than the one we typically see.

Going forward, more research with a much larger sample size is needed to expand the findings. Still, it’s a fascinating glimpse at the factors that could shape conspiratorial thinking — concrete evidence that when faced with uncertainty, some of us really do prefer simple lies to complicated truths.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s AI company has restricted Grok’s controversial AI image-generation feature to only paying subscribers on X, after the tool invited heavy criticism from across the world for letting users generate sexualized and nude images of women and children.

In replies to users on Friday, Grok said only paying subscribers on X would be able to generate and edit images on the platform. Notably, these limits do not apply to the Grok app, which, at the time of publication, was letting anyone generate pictures without having to pay for a subscription.

Initially available to anyone with daily limits, Grok’s image generation feature allowed users to upload anyone’s picture and ask it to edit it or generate a sexualized or nude version. What ensued was a veritable flood of non-consensual sexualized images of children, actors, models and prominent figures, drawing the ire of multiple nations.

X and Musk have both publicly denounced the use of the tool to produce such images, writing that the company would stick to its policies against posting illegal content on the social media platform. “Anyone using grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk tweeted last week.

The U.K., the European Union and India have all publicly denounced X and Grok for allowing such use of its capabilities. The EU on Thursday asked xAI to retain all documentation relating to the chatbot, and India’s communications ministry last week ordered X to make immediate changes to stop the image generation features from being misused or risk its safe harbor protections in the country. The U.K.’s communications watchdog said it’s been in touch with xAI over the issue as well.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Andreessen Horowitz just announced the firm has just raised a little more than $15 billion in new funding. The haul represents over 18% of all venture capital dollars allocated in the United States in 2025, according to firm co-founder Ben Horowitz, but even more jaw-dropping is that it brings the organization to more than $90 billion in assets under management, putting it neck-and-neck with Sequoia Capital as among the largest venture firms in the world. Which is fitting, since a16z appears to be very friendly with actual sovereign wealth funds, including at least one from Saudi Arabia.

The firm, which employs approximately hundreds of people across five offices – three in California, plus New York and Washington D.C. – has become a globe-spanning operation with employees on six continents. In December, it opened its first Asia office in Seoul for its crypto practice.

That newly committed capital breaks down across five funds: $6.75 billion for growth investments, $1.7 billion each for apps and infrastructure, $1.176 billion for “American Dynamism” (more on that shortly), $700 million for biotech and healthcare, and another $3 billion for other venture strategies. It’s the kind of money that makes you wonder where it all comes from and, more importantly, where it all goes.

The “where it comes from” question is one the firm has historically declined to answer. When we asked a16z this week about its limited partners and its distributed-to-paid-in capital ratio – the DPI, or how much actual cash the firm has returned to investors over its 16-year history – the firm didn’t respond. What we do know is that CalPERS invested $400 million in 2023, marking the first time in a16z’s history it took money from a major California pension fund, probably because institutions with transparency requirements don’t really align with the firm’s preference for opacity. We also know that Sanabil Investments, the venture arm of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, lists Andreessen Horowitz among its portfolio holdings.

The Saudi connection isn’t subtle. Back in 2023, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz appeared onstage with WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann to discuss their $350 million investment in his then-new residential real estate venture, Flow. The venue was a conference backed by one of Saudi Arabia’s largest sovereign funds. Horowitz praised Saudi Arabia as a “startup country,” adding that “Saudi has a founder; you don’t call him a founder, you call him his royal highness.”

But Marc Andreessen has found another royal to admire. Since President Donald Trump’s November 2024 election victory, Andreessen has logged a lot of hours at Mar-a-Lago, by his own account, helping shape policy on tech, business, and economics. Early last year, he became an “unpaid intern” at Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, vetting candidates for the Trump administration – not just for tech roles but for positions in the Defense Department and intelligence agencies. Scott Kupor, a16z’s first employee back in 2009, was sworn in as Director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management this past summer.

This matters because a16z’s current strategy is heavily weighted toward what it calls “American Dynamism” – a practice that invests in defense, aerospace, public safety, housing, education, and manufacturing. The portfolio aligns remarkably well with Defense Department priorities: Anduril (autonomous defense systems), Shield AI (military drones), Saronic Technologies (autonomous naval vessels), and Castelion (hypersonic missiles). The bigger bet is that America needs to reindustrialize and reshore critical manufacturing, particularly since, as a16z itself notes, the U.S. would exhaust its entire missile inventory “in something like 8 days” in a conflict with China over Taiwan, then need three years to rebuild it.

Then there’s the AI bet, which might be the firm’s highest-risk, highest-reward play yet. A16z has positioned itself across every level of the AI stack: infrastructure (Databricks), foundation models (with stakes in Mistral AI, OpenAI and xAI), and applications (Character.AI, among many other portfolio companies).

The firm has wins to point to. Its $25 million investment in Coinbase turned into an $86 billion valuation at the 2021 IPO. There’s Airbnb (public at over $100 billion), Slack (acquired for $27.7 billion), and GitHub ($7.5 billion to Microsoft). Its portfolio includes 115 unicorns, 35 IPOs, and 241 acquisitions, according to the market intelligence firm Tracxn. The firm has also made and lost money by snapping up cryptocurrency tokens, though there’s less visibility into those numbers.

In a blog post published Friday morning, Ben Horowitz writes that “as the American leader in Venture Capital, the fate of new technology in the United States rests partly on our shoulders.” It’s the kind of statement certain to cause agita at rival firms, some of which have been around closer to 50 years, compared with the much younger a16z. Horowitz frames a16z’s mission as “ensuring that America wins the next 100 years of technology.”

Whether that happens remains to be seen. What’s certain is that Andreessen Horowitz has mastered the art of raising money – $15 billion this time — to fund a vision of American technological dominance that runs through Riyadh, Mar-a-Lago, and the Pentagon. That’s quite a pitch, and plainly, it works.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI research lab Anthropic continues to land sizable enterprise deals. Its latest entails bringing its large language models to a legacy German insurance giant.

Anthropic on Friday announced a deal with Munich, Germany-based global insurance conglomerate Allianz to bring “responsible AI” to the insurance industry. The parties declined to share financial terms of the deal.

The partnership is made up of three specific initiatives.

The first is making Claude Code, Anthropic’s AI-powered coding tool, available to all of Allianz’s employees. Anthropic and Allianz will also build custom AI agents for Allianz employees that can execute multi-step workflows with a human in the loop.

This partnership also includes an AI system that logs all AI interactions to keep the AI transparent and ensure that information is readily available for regulatory or other needs.

“With this partnership, Allianz is taking a decisive step to address critical AI challenges in insurance,” Oliver Bäte, CEO of Allianz SE, said in the company’s press release. “Anthropic’s focus on safety and transparency complements our strong dedication to customer excellence and stakeholder trust. Together, we are building solutions that prioritize what matters most to our customers while setting new standards for innovation and resilience.”

This is just the latest enterprise deal Anthropic has landed in recent months.

In December, the company inked a $200 million deal to bring its AI models to data cloud company Snowflake and its customers. Shortly after, it announced a multi-year partnership with the consulting firm Accenture.

In October, it signed a deal with consulting firm Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to the firm’s 500,000 employees. That same month, Anthropic signed a deal with IBM to bring its AI models into the latter’s products.

The race for AI enterprise dominance is clearly on, and Anthropic appears to be winning — so far at least.

Anthropic holds 40% of enterprise AI market share, according to a December survey from Anthropic investor Menlo Ventures, and 54% of the market share for AI coding. Anthropic market share increased throughout last year. When Menlo’s original survey came out in July, the company held a 32% market share for overall enterprise LLM use.

Google launched its dedicated enterprise AI product, Gemini Enterprise, in October. At the time, the company touted that the product suite already had customers including fintech Klarna, design software company Figma and cruise line operator Virgin Voyages, among others.

OpenAI launched its enterprise version of ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, in 2023. Recently, the company reportedly expressed deep concern in an internal memo that Google Gemini’s success was starting to encroach on its business. Shortly after, the company released a report that said enterprise use of ChatGPT had surged 8x in the past year.

A recent TechCrunch investor survey found that enterprise-focused VCs overwhelmingly think that 2026 will be the year that enterprises start to see a meaningful return on their investment into AI products.

While Anthropic seems to be a clear favorite at the moment, this year will likely be telling of what the enterprise AI market — and its competitive landscape — will look like in the future.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.

The Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our senior AI editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.

And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as senior reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.

AMD chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners, including OpenAI president Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Li, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.

Beyond the partner showcases, senior reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.

Let’s face it, by this point in the show the major announcements have been made, products have been showcased, and it’s time to eye some of the most brow-raising reveals from CES. We started our list of what stood out to us as odd and noteworthy, but we’re open to more suggestions!

CES isn’t all hardware showcases and show floor attractions — there are plenty of additional industry panels and speakers drawing eyeballs. We kept tabs on a few notable highlights, ranging from Palmer Luckey pushing retro aesthetics, to why the “learn once, work forever” era may be over, to previews of the new Silicon Valley-based series “The Audacity,” to the expansion of Roku’s $3 streaming service, to All-In host Jason Calacanis putting a $25,000 bounty on an authentic Theranos device.

Ford is launching its assistant in the company’s app before a targeted 2027 release in its vehicles, with hosting managed by Google Cloud and the assistant itself built using off-the-shelf LLMs. As we noted in our coverage of the news, however, few details were offered around what drivers should expect from their experience with the assistant.

As part of the ever-present push for AI’s impact on the physical world, Caterpillar and Nvidia announced a pilot program, “Cat AI Assistant,” which was demonstrated at CES Wednesday. This system, coming to one of Caterpillar’s excavator vehicles, is happening alongside another project to use Nvidia’s Omniverse simulation resources to help with construction project planning and execution.

One of the buzziest reveals of the show is the debut phone from Clicks Technology, the $499 Communicator, which brings back BlackBerry vibes with its physical keyboard, plus a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that can be used with other devices.

Check out our full rundown from the show floor here, but the Communicator makes a good first impression, per Consumer Editor Sarah Perez:

“In our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold — not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device’s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.

“The device’s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.”

This family planning tool caught our eyes on the show floor, not just for its calendar and planning capabilities, but for its AI capabilities that are able to sync calendars from different sources, create new to-dos based off of messages or photos, appointment reminders, and more. Check out our full impressions here.

Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they’re working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of the humanoid robot that was shown onstage. Transportation editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.

Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via their browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.

On the Ring front, consumer reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.

In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions to a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.

Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.

Lego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes bricks, tiles, and Minifigures that can all interact with each other and play sounds, with both the debut sets having a Star Wars theme. Senior writer Amanda Silberling has all the details here.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Data security startup Cyera continues on a growth tear. On Thursday, it announced a $400 million Series F funding round at a $9 billion valuation. The New York-based outfit has now raised over $1.7 billion. This funding comes just six months after the previous $540 million round at a $6 billion valuation.

The new round was led by funds managed by Blackstone with participation from existing investors including Accel, Coatue, Lightspeed, Redpoint, Sapphire, Sequoia, and others.

Cyera offers what it calls data security posture management, a service that helps companies map out where all their sensitive data lives across cloud systems and databases, track how employees and applications use it, and identify security vulnerabilities. The rise of AI — which has increased both the volume of data that companies handle and concerns about data leaks — has helped Cyera sign up one-fifth of the Fortune 500 companies as customers and more than triple revenue in its last year, the company says, causing investors to eagerly pile in.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/governments-grapple-with-the-flood-of-non-consensual-nudity-on-x/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past two weeks, X has been flooded with AI-manipulated nude images, created by the Grok AI chatbot. An alarming range of women have been affected by the non-consensual nudes, including prominent models and actresses, as well as news figures, crime victims, and even world leaders.

A December 31 research paper from Copyleaks estimated roughly one image was being posted each minute, but later tests found far more. A sample gathered from January 5-6 found 6,700 per hour over the 24-hour period.

But while public figures from around the world have decried the choice to release the model without safeguards, there are few clear mechanisms for regulators hoping to rein in Elon Musk’s new image-manipulating system. The result has become a painful lesson in the limits of tech regulation — and a forward-looking challenge for regulators hoping to make a mark.

Unsurprisingly, the most aggressive action has come from the European Commission, which on Thursday ordered xAI to retain all documents related to its Grok chatbot. The move doesn’t necessarily mean the commission has opened up a new investigation, but it’s a common precursor to such action. It’s particularly ominous given recent reporting from CNN that suggests Elon Musk may have personally intervened to prevent safeguards from being placed on what images could be generated by Grok.

It’s unclear whether X has made any technical changes to the Grok model, although the public media tab for Grok’s X account has been removed. In a statement, the company specifically denounced the use of AI tools to produce child sexual imagery. “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” the X Safety account posted on January 3, echoing a previous tweet by Elon Musk.

In the meantime, regulators around the world have issued stern warnings. The United Kingdom’s Ofcom issued a statement on Monday, saying it was in touch with xAI and “will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation.” In a radio interview on Thursday, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the phenomenon “disgraceful” and “disgusting,” saying “Ofcom has our full support to take action in relation to this.”

In a post on LinkedIn, Australian eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman-Grant said her office had received a doubling in complaints related to Grok since late 2025. But Inman-Grant stopped short of taking action against xAI, saying only, “We will use the range of regulatory tools at our disposal to investigate and take appropriate action.”

By far the largest market to threaten action is India, where Grok was the subject of a formal complaint from a member of Parliament. On January, India’s communications regulator MeitY ordered X to address the issue and submit an “action-taken” report within 72 hours — a deadline that was subsequently extended by 48 hours. While a report was submitted to the regulator on January 7, it’s unclear whether MeitY will be satisfied with the response. If not, X could lose its safe harbor status in India, a potentially serious limitation on its ability to operate within the country.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Every night before bedtime, my daughter tilts back her head so that a pair of metal plates inside her mouth can be cranked apart another quarter of a millimeter. We turn a jackscrew with a wire tip; it spreads the bones within her upper jaw. At times she groans or even cries: she says that she can feel the pressure up into her nose.

This is normal. My daughter is 9 years old. She has a palate expander.

So does her best friend, and, by her count, so does nearly one in four of the kids in her fourth-grade class. On Reddit’s r/braces forum, a practitioner based in Frisco, Texas, said he was surprised by “how many parents ask me, ‘Hey, does my child need an expander? Everyone else seems to have one.’” His colleagues seemed to notice something similar. “Everybody’s being told they have a narrow jaw, and everyone&#39;s being given an expander,” Neal Kravitz, the editor in chief of the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics, told me.

A generation ago, getting braces was a rite of passage into seventh grade. Today, the reshaping of a child’s smile may commence a few years earlier, at 7, 8, or 9 years old. At that point, the two sides of the upper jawbone haven’t yet joined together, a fact that is propitious for a different orthodontic process: instead of straightening, expansion. During this phase of life, when kids still have some baby teeth, a tiny dungeon rack may be wedged between a child’s upper teeth, then used to spread her upper jaw and—proponents say—introduce essential room for sprouting teeth.

The expander is an old device; debates about its use are hardly any younger. What seems to have been the first expander was described in 1860, in the journal The Dental Cosmos, by a San Francisco dentist named Emerson Angell. He wrote of “an apparatus, simple and efficient,” that he’d placed into the mouth of a young patient. Then he’d told her to expand it, day by day, by advancing a central screw—just as my daughter does today. But the journal’s editors were skeptical of Angell’s work. We “must beg leave to differ with the writer in the conclusion arrived at,” they announced in a prefatory note, foreshadowing a long disagreement within the field.

This concerned the merits of expansion versus those of extraction—whether a child’s jaw should be broadened to accommodate her teeth, or whether certain teeth should be pulled to accommodate her jaw. Around the turn of the 20th century, the influential orthodontist Edward Angle favored jaw broadening; he believed that all children should have their teeth intact, nestled in a capacious jaw, as exemplified by a human skull that had been ransacked from an Indian burial mound not far from where he practiced, which he called “Old Glory.” A few decades later, though, orthodontic research found that expanded jaws might still “relapse” into a narrow shape. By the 1970s, pulling teeth became the rule, Daniel Rinchuse, a Seton Hill University professor of orthodontics, told me.

This consensus was itself short-lived, he said—not because the field had come across some new and better mouth-expanding tech but because of fears about the supposed ill effects of doing too many extractions. Some dentists claimed that what was then the standard approach in orthodontics could even lead to painful disorders of the temporomandibular joint, or TMJ. In the face of these concerns, expanders made a comeback.

Eventually, some orthodontists started claiming that expanders had another major benefit—that prying open a child’s palate could improve her breathing and prevent sleep apnea. Some now recommend this airway-focused intervention not just for kids my daughter’s age but for toddlers too.

The basis for the trend was never really scientific, though. “Do expanders prevent obstructive sleep apnea? In capital letters: NO WAY,” Kravitz said. “There are endless research papers on this stuff.” The problem isn’t that expanders have no value, he continued; it’s that they’re clearly overused. According to Rinchuse, who co-edited the book Evidence-Based Clinical Orthodontics, the idea that extracting teeth will lead to joint disorders has never been proved. Indeed, no “high-quality evidence” supports expansion of the upper jaw for any reason, he said, except in cases where a child has been diagnosed with posterior “crossbite.” He said that, overall, orthodontic practice is less constrained by evidence than other fields of health care are, because the ill effects of bad decisions will be slight. As he put it, “In orthodontics, no one dies.”

Steven Siegel, the current president of the American Association of Orthodontists, acknowledged that some practitioners may be inclined to put a rack on every child’s palate: “There are some abuses,” he told me. But he also argued that the recent increase in expander use hasn’t really been dramatic, and that for the most part, the devices are used to positive effect. For people with a narrow jaw and crowded teeth, he said, expanders can prevent the need for extractions down the road; some kids, at least, could see improvements in their breathing. When I noted that I’d heard the opposite on both counts from Kravitz and Rinchuse, he responded that they simply disagreed. “I have great respect for both of them,” he said. “I would say that there is a controversy.”

For the record, my daughter is delighted by the treatment she’s received: In a recent family interview, conducted over breakfast, she described her course of orthodontics as “cool and fun.” Her orthodontist (who happens to be a former high-school classmate) has been thoughtful and communicative, and I’ve recommended her to several other families. Still, despite the fact that no one dies from orthodontics, one might also choose to avoid a treatment that costs several thousand dollars, has disputed benefits, and may cause modest pain—not to mention any moral injury that may accrue from tilting back your daughter’s head and cranking open metal plates to wrench her face apart.

And despite whatever caused expander mania, its existence can be jarring for a parent who grew up in the prior era of orthodontics. Indeed, the period during which this trend developed—from, say, the late 1980s until the early 2020s—happens to coincide with the stretch that intervened between my own entry into middle school and my daughter’s. For my fellow members of this cohort, expansion of the fourth-grade palate appears to be a strange and sudden social norm. During one visit to the orthodontist, my daughter and I found a handful of children about her age seated in a line of dental chairs, with technicians leaning over each of them to turn the screw of their expander. It was like we’d all gathered there for some initiation rite for children of the tribe that dwells on Cobble Hill in Brooklyn—a ritual of widening.

Not long after that, I called up Luke Glowacki, an anthropologist at Boston University who co-directs a research project in Ethiopia’s Omo Valley, where body modifications—and dental modifications in particular—are not uncommon. He told me about social groups there and elsewhere in which a child’s teeth might be filed down to points or a person’s lower lip stretched out with a plate.

Is orthodontics any different? It presents itself as curative and scientific, but many orthodontists’ websites are replete with beauty claims as well: An expander may “protect your child’s facial appearance” or provide “enhancement to the facial profile.” Siegel said that a broadened palate gives “a more aesthetic width of the smile.” Kravitz said that it could help shrink the unattractive gaps inside a person’s cheeks—“dark buccal corridors,” in the language of the field.

In East Africa, dental and other body modifications carry similar ambiguities of purpose. Filing down a person’s teeth, for instance, or removing them altogether “may also be done for ostensible health reasons,” Glowacki said. Some body-modification rituals could be understood to ward off harmful spirits, for example. In other words, they’re prophylactic. Glowacki also told me about a Nyangatom woman he knows who has scars carved into both her shoulder and forehead. The former are purely decorative, but she’d received the latter on account of being sick.

Glowacki is a parent, too, and I asked him whether his training as an anthropologist affected how he thought about expanders or other anatomical procedures, such as ear piercing, that are carried out on children in the United States at industrial scale. “You’re not gonna find any society in the world that doesn’t modify their body in some way in accordance with their ideas of beauty or of health,” he said. “We’re doing what societies all over the world do.” If now I’ve paid an orthodontist to reshape my daughter’s mouth, maybe that’s just human nature.</div>

            <h2>The Hole in Trump’s Rationale for Acquiring Greenland</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/pentagon-arctic-greenland-china-russia/685553/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump and members of his Cabinet have made a case for acquiring Greenland that’s so simple, even self-evident, it seems hard to refute: U.S. national-security interests in the Arctic are just too important to ignore. Not taking over the autonomous territory of Denmark would “give up the Arctic to China, to Russia, and to other regimes that don’t have the best interests of the American people at heart,” Vice President J. D. Vance declared last March during a visit to the Pituffik Space Base, on Greenland’s northwest coast.

Five years ago, Congress had a similar sense of alarm about Russia and China’s head start in exploring and potentially developing one of the world’s last great untapped regions, with its rich minerals, abundant (if icebound) seas, and strategic location almost connecting the continent of Europe with the northernmost reaches of the Americas.

The 2021 National Defense Authorization Act called for the creation of the Arctic and Global Resilience Policy Office at the Pentagon, which was set up in 2022. The office produced the Defense Department’s 2024 Arctic Strategy, dedicating Washington to increased Arctic defense capabilities, expanded collaboration with allies on Arctic security, and strengthened military readiness for Arctic operations.

The administration’s intense interest in acquiring Greenland, by force if necessary, might appear to be a natural outgrowth of the Pentagon’s work. Instead, it’s a clear repudiation of it. Not only has the demand for Greenland infuriated the same European allies on which the Arctic strategy depends, the Pentagon office itself has been quietly shuttered. In sum, even as the administration says it needs Greenland to advance U.S. security interests in the Arctic, it has closed the office set up to advance U.S. security interests in the Arctic.

The Arctic was a crucial strategic front in the Cold War, the shortest route for potential missile strikes and bomber flights. The United States and the Soviet Union maneuvered submarines in the region, competing for dominance at the top of the world.

A Cold War–era agreement allows Washington broad authority to conduct military operations on Greenland. The agreement, signed by Denmark and the United States in 1951, allows the U.S. to “construct, install, maintain, and operate” bases across the island, station personnel, and set the terms of “landings, takeoffs, anchorages, moorings, movements, and operation of ships, aircraft, and water-borne craft.” Pituffik is the only current U.S. base.

As warming seas open new shipping routes and enable access to natural resources, the United States and its adversaries are again scrambling for position in the Arctic. China released a white paper in 2018 that declared itself a “Near-Arctic State,” using this characterization to assert its interests in the region. In 2020, Russia set a 15-year time frame for a set of aspirations in the Arctic, including the establishment of sovereignty over its northern sea route, the revitalization of Soviet-era military bases, and the creation of new commercial-shipping infrastructure. Russia has grown its fleet of icebreakers and other vessels needed to navigate the Arctic’s challenging conditions, and the Russian navy has held joint drills in the region with China, an ominous development for the United States.

The Pentagon’s Arctic office, in its short life, brought together agency leaders on policy planning to ensure that the government had the communication, intelligence, and surveillance tools for effective deterrence alongside allies with regional know-how. When Trump returned to power early last year, his team discussed restructuring the office, but the plans never materialized. It took too long to get leadership into place, especially Elbridge Colby, who wasn’t confirmed as undersecretary of defense for policy until April.

The office began a slow-motion demise as it shed personnel who were never replaced, three former U.S. officials told us, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity. Around the time of the government shutdown last fall, the office effectively ceased to exist. The office’s website now leads to a 404 - Page not found! message. Some of the office’s functions have been moved to other parts of the government, but the number of people working on these issues at the Pentagon has been reduced by almost three-quarters, one of the former officials said. The office’s closure has not been previously reported.

One of the former officials we spoke with said the office was politically vulnerable because it was a creation of the Biden administration and focused in part on responding to climate change. The Pentagon has canceled climate-related programs and sought to weed out contracts and initiatives that even use the word climate. Last spring, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on social media that his department “does not do climate change crap.”

The policy office’s demise also reflects Trump’s interest in hemispheric dominance. Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson, in a statement, said that the office had not been shut down but rather “restructured to better align with the president’s priorities,” with work parceled out to the office of the assistant secretary responsible for homeland defense and the Americas. That puts strategy for U.S. interests around the North Pole together with Venezuela, the Panama Canal, and the Gulf of Mexico. The Pentagon last summer also shifted Greenland from U.S. European Command, responsible for Europe and Russia, to Northern Command, responsible for North America. An administration official told us the closure of the policy office was designed to achieve greater efficiency and noted that there is still an inter-agency team working on Arctic issues.

Meanwhile, Trump has yet to fill the role of ambassador-at-large for Arctic affairs, a position created in 2022 at the urging of Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who represents Alaska. Trump did, however, name Jeff Landry, a political ally and the governor of Louisiana, as special envoy to Greenland. Trump justified the appointment by recalling the Louisiana Purchase—the acquisition from the French of territory including land from 15 current states and two Canadian provinces, in 1803—and said Landry had approached him about the job. “He’s very proactive,” Trump told reporters. Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, told us Greenland would be “better served” if it were protected by the U.S.

In unveiling the Arctic strategy in 2024, senior Pentagon officials stressed international cooperation. Amanda Dory, at the time the acting undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that engagement with allies “underpins the whole document and is foundational to our approach to the Arctic.” She saluted “like-minded and highly capable allies” including Denmark, Norway, and two Arctic nations that were new NATO members, Finland and Sweden.

One former U.S. official based in an allied Arctic nation told us these partnerships were the best U.S. asset in the region. “We had great partnerships that were giving us everything we could ask for in the Arctic,” he said. “Going at it alone, we’re not the strongest power in the Arctic. So we gain less by behaving like a hegemonic power than we gained by working with the partners that were there.”

But recently, those alliances have been severely strained, if not broken. Trump’s repeated insistence on obtaining Greenland has prompted a furious reaction from European governments. In the long run, that may leave Washington less able to counter Russian and Chinese maneuvering in the Arctic—if that was indeed Trump’s aim in the first place. The president recently told The Atlantic that Greenland is “surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships” (a claim that former officials described as unsupported by evidence), but the administration’s National Security Strategy, issued at the end of last year, seemed to shy from competition with U.S. adversaries in favor of maximizing economic gains. The document envisioned “strategic stability with Russia” and called for a “genuinely mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing.” It made no mention of the Arctic.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The deer were out there. The crisp tracks in the snow made that clear. Three hours into our hunt through the frigid New Hampshire woods, Ryan Calsbeek, a rangy 51-year-old biology professor at Dartmouth, guessed that 200 animals were hiding in the trees around us. Calsbeek and I were 20 feet up a pignut hickory, crouching on a creaky platform. His friend Max Overstrom-Coleman, a stocky 46-year-old bar owner from Vermont, had climbed a distant tree and strung himself up by a harness, readying his crossbow and swaying in the wind. Shivering in camo jackets and neon-orange beanies, we peered into the darkening forest, daring it to move.

I had joined Calsbeek’s December hunt to try to get my hands on high-quality red meat. Calsbeek had yet to kill a deer that season, but in previous years, he told me, a single animal kept his family of four well fed through the winter. His young daughters especially liked to eat deer heart; apparently, it’s marvelously rich and tender. My mouth watered at the thought. The last time I’d tasted venison was more than a decade ago at a fancy restaurant in Toronto, where it was served as carpaccio, drizzled in oil and so fresh that it may as well have pranced out of the woods and onto my plate.

A bounty of such succulent, free-range meat is currently running through America’s backyards. The continental United States is home to some 30 million white-tailed deer, and in many areas, their numbers are growing too rapidly for comfort. Each year, a white-tailed doe can typically birth up to three fawns, which themselves can reproduce as soon as six months later.

Wherever deer are overabundant, they are at best a nuisance and at worst a plague. They trample gardens, destroy farmland, carry ticks that spread Lyme disease, and disrupt forest ecosystems, allowing invasive species to spread. They are involved in tens of thousands of car crashes each year in New York and New Jersey, where state wildlife departments have encouraged hunters to harvest more deer. In especially populated regions, wildlife agencies hire sharpshooters to cull the animals. Last year, New Hampshire legislators expanded the deer-hunting season in an attempt to keep the population under control. By the looks of the forest floor, which was pitted with hoof marks and scattered with marble-shaped droppings, that effort was falling short.

Over the past decade, some states have proposed a simple, if controversial, strategy for bringing deer under control: Couldn’t people like me—who don’t hunt but aren’t opposed to it—eat more venison?

Venison may not be a staple of American cuisine, but it has a place in many people’s diets. Health influencers laud it as a lean, low-calorie, nutrient-dense source of protein. Venison jerky sticks are sold at big-box stores and advertised as snacks for people on Whole30 and keto diets. Higher-end grocery stores, such as Wegmans and Whole Foods, sell ground venison for upwards of $12 a pound, roughly twice the cost of ground beef.

Part of the reason venison is so expensive is that most of it is not homegrown. It’s mostly imported from New Zealand, which has sent more than 5 million pounds of the stuff to the U.S. every year since 2020. Beef, the dominant red meat in the States, has historically been more affordable. But beef prices jumped nearly 15 percent in 2025, and the conventional kind sold in most supermarkets comes from cattle raised in abysmal conditions. If high-quality venison were cheaper and more widely available, it could be an appetizing alternative.

In recent years, a few deer-swamped states, including New Jersey and Maryland, have tried to legalize the sale of hunted venison, which would deliver two key benefits: more deer out of the ecosystem and more venison on people’s plates. Despite the sport’s association with trophies, many deer hunters are motivated by the prospect of obtaining meat, and they can only consume so much. “It’s for your own table,” Overstrom-Coleman said as he fixed climbing sticks onto a tree to form a makeshift ladder. He had already stocked his freezer full of venison this season (“That son of a bitch,” Calsbeek whispered, once we’d left our companion in his tree) and planned, as many hunters do, to donate any excess meat to a food bank.

Hunting is waning in popularity, in part because younger people are less keen on participating than older generations. Efforts to bring in more hunters, such as programs to train women and youth in outdoor skills, are under way in many states. Women are the fastest-growing demographic, and they participate largely to acquire food, Moira Tidball, the executive director at the Cornell Cooperative Extension who leads hunting classes for women, told me. Still, interest is not growing fast enough for the subsistence-and-donation system to keep deer numbers in check.

Read: America needs hunting more than it knows

It’s hard to imagine a better incentive for deer hunting than allowing hunters to sell their venison to stores and restaurants. But the idea is antithetical to a core tenet of American conservation. For more than 100 years, the country’s wild game has flourished under the protection of hunters and their allies, steadfast in their belief that the nation’s animals are not for sale.

The last time this many white-tailed deer roamed America’s woodlands, the country didn’t yet exist. To the English colonists who arrived in the New World, the deer bounding merrily through the forests may as well have been leaping bags of cash. Back home, deer belonged to the Crown, and as such, could be hunted only by the privileged few, Keith Tidball, a hunter and an environmental anthropologist at Cornell (and Moira’s spouse), told me. In the colonies, they were free for the taking.

Colonists founded a robust trans-Atlantic trade for deer hide, a particularly popular leather for making work boots and breeches, which drastically reduced the deer population. In Walden, Henry David Thoreau notes a man who preserved the horns “of the last deer that was killed in this vicinity.” The animals were already close to disappearing from many areas at the beginning of what ecologists have called the “exploitation era” of white-tailed deer, starting in the mid-19th century. Fifty years later, America was home to roughly half a million deer, down 99 percent from precolonial days.

The commerce-driven decimation of the nation’s wildlife—not just deer but birds, elk, bears, and many other animals—unsettled many Americans, especially hunters. In 1900, Representative John Lacey of Iowa, a hunter and close friend of Theodore Roosevelt’s, introduced a bill to ban the trafficking of America’s wildlife. (As Roosevelt, who notoriously hunted to collect trophies, wrote in 1913, “If there is to be any shooting there must be something to shoot.”) The Lacey Act remains one of the most binding federal conservation laws in existence today.

From the May 1906 issue: Camping with President Theodore Roosevelt

The law is partly contingent on state policies, which make exceptions for certain species. Hunters in most states, for example, can legally harvest and sell the pelts of fur-bearing species such as otters, raccoons, and coyotes. But attempts to carve out similar exceptions for hunted venison, including the bills in Maryland and New Jersey, have failed. In 2022, the Mississippi attorney general published a statement that opened up the possibility of legalizing the sale of hunted deer, provoking fierce opposition from hunters and conservationists; today, the option remains open but has not led to any policy changes. Last year, an Indiana state representative introduced a bill that would allow the sale of hunted venison, but so far it has gone nowhere.

The practical reason such proposals keep failing is that allowing the sale of hunted meat would require huge investments in infrastructure. Systems to process meat according to state and federal laws would have to be developed, as would rapid testing for chronic wasting disease, an illness akin to mad cow that could, theoretically, spread to humans who eat infected meat, though no cases have ever been reported. Such systems could, of course, be implemented. Hunted deer is sold in some common grocery stores in the United Kingdom, such as Waitrose and Aldi. (Notably, chronic wasting disease is not a concern there.)

Read: Deer are beta-testing a nightmare disease

Although the sheer abundance of deer makes them easy to imagine as steaks on legs, several experts cautioned that some people’s affection for the animals runs deep. Deer are cute; they’re docile; they’re Bambi. David Drake, a forestry and wildlife professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, likens them to America’s “sacred cow.” As Drake and a colleague have outlined in a paper proposing a model for commercialized venison hunting in the U.S., any modern system would be fundamentally different from the colonial-era approach because it would be regulated, mostly by state wildlife agencies. But powerful coalitions of hunters and conservationists remain both faithful to the notion that wild game shouldn’t be sold and fearful that history will repeat itself. As the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a national hunting association, puts it, “Any effort to recreate markets for game species represents a significant threat to the future of our nation’s sportsmen-led conservation efforts.” Some of the fiercest pushback to the New Jersey law, Drake told me, came from the state wildlife agency.

The only U.S. state with a deer-related exception to the Lacey Act is Vermont. During the open deer-hunting season (which spans roughly from fall to winter in the Northeast) and for 20 days afterward, Vermonters can legally sell any meat that they harvest. This policy was introduced in 1961, and yet, “I am not aware of anyone who actually takes advantage of it,” Nick Fortin, a wildlife biologist at Vermont’s Fish and Wildlife Department, told me. He added that the department, which manages the exasperated homeowners and destabilized forests that deer leave in their path, has been discussing how to raise awareness about the law.

Even after I explained the 1961 law to several Vermont hunters, they were hesitant to sell me any meat. Hunted meat is meant to be shared freely, or at most bartered for other items or goodwill, Greg Boglioli, a Vermont hunter and store owner, told me. I met Boglioli at the rural home of his friend Fred Waite, a lifelong hunter whose front room alone was decorated with 20 deer heads. I had hoped to buy venison from Waite, but he insisted on sharing it for free. After all, he had plenty. His pantry was crammed with mason jars of stewed venison in liver-colored brine. On a table in the living room was the scarlet torso of a deer that his son had accidentally hit with his truck the other day, half-thawed and waiting to be cooked.

During our hunt, I found Overstrom-Coleman to be more open to the idea of selling the venison he hunted. “I guess that would be a pretty excellent way to share it,” he said. Earlier in the season, he’d killed a deer in Vermont, and he was willing to sell me some of the meat the next day. At least, I thought as I stared into the motionless woods, I’d be going home with something.

From the July/August 2005 issue: Masters of the hunt

By the time the sun went down, the only deer I’d seen was a teetering doe in a video that Overstrom-Coleman had taken from his tree and sent to Calsbeek. “Too small to kill,” he texted; he’d meet us in the parking lot. The air was glacial as Calsbeek and I trudged empty-handed toward the trailhead, hoofprints glinting mockingly in the light of our headlamps. From the trunk of the car, we took a consolation swig of Wild Turkey from a frosted bottle, and Overstrom-Coleman reminded me to visit the next day.

I found his chest freezer stuffed with paper-wrapped packages stamped with Deer 2025. He handed me three and refused to let me pay. Back home a few days later, I used one to make meatballs. Their sheer depth of flavor—earthy and robust, with a hint of nuttiness—made me wonder why I bothered to eat farmed meat at all.</div>

The transformation of ICE into a type of national police force, backed, in some cases, by soldiers from the National Guard, has been covered as immigration story—but these forces are reshaping democracy for all of us. This shift was evident even before the shootings in Minneapolis and Portland this week. In this episode, George Retes, a U.S. citizen and an Army veteran, recounts how he was detained by ICE and held for three days without explanation. The Atlantic staff writer Anne Applebaum returns as host of Autocracy in America and talks with Margy O’Herron and Liza Goitein from the Liberty & National Security Program at NYU’s Brennan Center for Justice about the potential impact of these forces on elections in November.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Anne Applebaum: From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I’m Anne Applebaum.

Applebaum: In this new season, I am going to ask how the Trump White House is rewriting the rules of US politics, and introduce you to some of the Americans whose lives have been changed as a result. The president and his entourage are accumulating power in ways that seem familiar to me: this is exactly how elected leaders in other countries have distorted their democracies. I want to understand how these kinds of changes work here, and what they bode for the future.

George Retes: My name is George Retes Jr. I’m 25 years old. I was born and raised here in Ventura, California. I’m a father of two, and yeah, I’m a U.S. citizen. The day I was arrested by ICE agents was July 10.

Applebaum: This first episode will focus on an issue you’ve probably heard about: the transformation of America’s immigration and customs officers into a masked and heavily armed paramilitary, and the deployment of the National Guard to American cities, supposedly to defend them. Americans may think of this as a change that mostly affects illegal immigrants, but this new federal police force is also establishing standards of lawlessness, and they are operating with an assumption of impunity that is changing the lives of U.S. citizens as well.

George Retes has already felt the impact.

Retes: I was driving to my workplace, where I work as a contracted security guard. When I pulled up, there’s just cars on that entire road, bumper-to-bumper—people getting out, just cars driving around each other. And I was like, All right, well, I just need to make it to work. So I make my way through, and it’s just this roadblock of ICE agents just standing across the road.

Retes: There’s people banging on trash cans and just yelling and stuff. I got out and I stood right by my car. I’m basically yelling at them, like, I’m a U.S. citizen. I’m a veteran. I’m just trying to get to work. I’m not protesting. I’m just trying to get to work. I thought everything was gonna be okay, and they just were hostile from the get-go.

Like, You’re not going to work today. Get back in your car. Leave. So I end up getting back in my car, and they just all start walking in a line towards me, and they just surround my car. I have the agents on the side trying to pull on my door handles, trying to open my car door, yelling at me to get out, and the agents in the front of my car are telling me to reverse, contradicting what these other agents are telling me to do.

They end up throwing tear gas. And I’m in there choking, trying to plead with them, like, I can’t see; my car’s engulfed in smoke, and eventually they hit my window again, and it just shatters. Immediately, the moment it shatters, another agent sticks his arm through and sprays me in the face with pepper spray.

They just dragged me out of the car, threw me on the ground. They just immediately kneeled on my neck and back. There’s maybe four or five other agents just standing around us, just watching as they do this. And the entire time, they’re just questioning, like, Why was he arrested? basically. Like, they were confused themselves.

Eventually, they put me back in this unmarked SUV, and then they end up driving me to the detention facility in downtown L.A. They strip-search us, they do our fingerprints, take our pictures. My hands are burning. My face is burning from tear gas still, and the entire time I was in there, no phone call, no lawyer, no shower. No nothing.

I was detained for three nights and three days. That Saturday was my daughter’s third birthday party, and that was probably the worst feeling ever. She’s my princess. It was just terrible.

So Sunday, a guard ends up coming up and is just like, You’re off, like, He’s getting released, and that’s all he says. That was it. They’re like, You’re free to go. All the charges had been dropped; you’re free to go. And I just asked them, “So I basically was locked up and missed my daughter’s birthday for no fucking reason?” And they just were silent. They just stayed silent. I was given no explanation, no apology, just: That’s it.

Retes: When I was locked up, just that entire time, I knew If I get out of here, I’m definitely gonna take legal action. I was gonna make my voice heard because that’s the only way to hold them accountable for what they did. Someone has to be held accountable. Treating people a certain way without dignity or respect or humanity is so fucking wrong. To not have any fucking rights, especially here in America, when that’s what we’re supposed to be all about—it’s wrong. It goes against everything we stand for. And so I hope that the justice system, even though I don’t believe it works all the time, I hope that in this case it works.

Applebaum: By one count from ProPublica, over 170 American citizens, like George Retes, have already been detained by ICE.

The unnecessary deployment of armed agents onto peaceful streets has also led to tragedy.

This week a woman was shot dead in her car by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.

Last September a man was shot and killed by ICE outside Chicago.

And last November, an Afghan refugee shot two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., and has been charged with the murder one of them, a 20-year-old woman from West Virginia. She had been deployed, frankly, for symbolic reasons, to demonstrate Trump’s control over the military, and over the nation’s capital, and she was murdered, it seems, because she served as a symbol of that American military power. The assailant has pled not guilty.

ICE, and the use of the National Guard to protect ICE, has been covered as immigration story, but America’s immigration and customs agents aren’t only being used for that purpose.

The Trump administration is also using ICE and the National Guard to project power, to demonstrate that it can operate without restraint, and in defiance of the law.

How is the deployment of these agents and soldiers legal? Has anything like this ever happened before? It seems any American can now be detained or harassed, or even killed. The American National Guard can be used as puppets in a presidential game—is that legal too?

I asked two experts from the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU what we should be doing to secure our own safety, and to preserve our democracy. (We spoke before the killing in Minneapolis this week.)

Our first guest, Margy O’Herron, has documented the transformation of ICE. I started by asking her about the George Retes story and what ICE is supposed to do when it picks up a citizen. (And we should add here that ICE did not respond to questions from The Atlantic about the Retes case.)

Margy O’Herron: When ICE discovers that somebody is a citizen, they are supposed to release them right away. I think what you’re seeing, too, is just a bigger phenomenon of unchecked, chaotic deportation and arrest that is dangerous, and it risks all of our rights.

Applebaum: Okay, so citizens who are detained are supposed to have a certain set of rights, though even those now seem to be at risk. What about noncitizens?

O’Herron: There’s one key fact that I think is different, that I think is really important for folks to understand. And that is that the immigration system is considered a civil system. So this is not law enforcement in the sense of going after criminals. The great majority of immigrants in the system are actually only being charged with a civil offense, if anything, and that is: You are in the country without permission, and there is a civil process to remove you. Because of that, many of the rules that do apply in the criminal context, like right to counsel, do not apply in the civil context. But they’re operating much as if these folks are criminals. They’re arresting them. They’re detaining them. And the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment do still apply to immigrants. They apply to immigrants in the same way that they apply to citizens. There’s no distinction in the law. So without those things, ICE is arresting people and taking people out of the country without any kind of process, without alerting them that they’re going, without allowing them to talk to a lawyer—that is not lawful; it’s unconstitutional. Those rights exist, and they should be protected.

Applebaum: Trump’s big spending bill, which he called the One Big Beautiful [Bill] Act, will allocate over $170 billion to border and immigration enforcement, with a significant amount going to ICE. Can you give us some idea of the scale of the spending? What does it allow ICE to do that’s different from what Immigration [and Customs Enforcement] was allowed to do in the past?

O’Herron: Just to put it in context, it’s $170 billion over four years, but across the country, all states and local law enforcement, in a year, spent about $135 billion [in 2021]. And the money going to ICE is triple what they were authorized before. And what it means is that the types of raids that we’ve seen and the scale of detention that we’ve seen are just the tip of the iceberg. It’s going to increase significantly as they start spending all of those funds.

Applebaum:  Also, of course, all this funding is going to law enforcement, and very little is going to the judges or the immigration courts that for a long time have been the places where people targeted for deportation were allowed to state their case or make their arguments.

O’Herron:  Exactly right. So you see a 400 percent increase in detention and a 14 percent increase for the number of judges. We’ve also seen attacks on the immigration courts and immigration judges. The administration has fired more than 80 immigration judges, mostly for no cause. They’re claiming this is the right of the president to decide who’s an immigration judge. One assumes that they’re being fired because their positions or history or background is something that this current administration does not like. And they’re proposing now to replace those fired immigration judges with military lawyers. And although there are excellent lawyers in the military, they are not trained as immigration judges. And without that training, without that background, it suggests that there’s something else at work. And the fear will be that those judges are there to rubber-stamp the administration’s broader deportation agenda.

Applebaum:  As the money starts to get spent, what are some changes that all of us will see, that people not directly involved in immigration, immigration enforcement, or who aren’t immigrants themselves—what will we see? How will we be affected?

O’Herron: I think we’ll see increased raids and surveillance the way that we’ve seen things happening in Chicago and Los Angeles—roving patrols of ICE agents and also other law enforcement that’s been assigned to support ICE, right? So we now have: Customs and Border Protection, which is used to operating at the border, is supporting ICE. We also have more than 2,000 other federal law-enforcement agents—I think The Washington Post reported that 25 percent of FBI agents are now detailed over to do law enforcement of civilians in the immigration system. And that’s a huge shift from having law enforcement go after who we’d consider to be bad guys, to instead go after immigrants who have done nothing except enter the country unlawfully. And even the number of people that have entered the country unlawfully is lower than the number of people that they’re arresting. Of the folks that are being arrested, 70 percent have absolutely no criminal background, and of the folks that do, there is a very slim number that have any kind of violent criminal background. Most have property crimes or—

Applebaum: Parking tickets, I read in one case.

O’Herron: Parking tickets, even. Correct. And so you’ve taken your FBI agent who’s well trained to go after a drug trafficker or child predator, and instead you have them going after a landscaper or a guy who works at the car wash—to go after civilians.

Applebaum: If this is illegal, if it breaks existing laws, why can’t courts seem to stop this kind of behavior?

O’Herron: I think the courts have been stopping this behavior, or at least they’re trying. There have been some really important rulings out of both Chicago and Los Angeles, which is where we’ve seen a lot of violence against immigrants in the last few months. A district court in Los Angeles, for example, ruled that ICE could not arrest immigrants without reasonable suspicion and couldn’t rely on certain factors, like race and speech, to support that reasonable-suspicion determination. That order was stayed by the Supreme Court, unfortunately. But in the intervening period, while the court’s order was in effect, those orders were followed.

Applebaum: But it’s not stopping them from continuing to arrest people.

O’Herron: Well, I think there is a sense from the top that the agents who are taking these actions are not gonna have any consequences for those actions. For example, there was a video that circulated quite broadly of a woman who was pushed by an ICE agent outside the New York immigration office. She was shoved across a hallway, and she fell. She ended up being hospitalized. Initially, ICE came out with a statement that said that type of action was unacceptable, but a few days later, it was reported that that ICE agent was back on the job.

The administration also has cut many of the oversight offices that are supposed to be places that compile and check that kind of abuse. These are really important offices that field thousands of complaints every year on exactly this kind of behavior. And instead, now we have to rely on the courts exclusively to take these actions.

Applebaum: Taking a step back, it seems that what you are saying is that we are granting a heavily armed federal police force permission to break the law with impunity. They are not punished for either illegal or unethical actions, and no one is keeping track.

O’Herron: You can still file a complaint with ICE. And even though that may seem like a futile exercise, it is really important for tracking what is happening. Those records are then available by [the Freedom of Information Act]. They’re available to Congress. They will be available to some future administration to be able to identify what has happened and provide redress.

Applebaum: It looks to me like the nature of immigration enforcement is changing, that it’s beginning to look something a lot more like the War on Terror.

O’Herron: Yeah, I think that’s right. What we now see is a very heavy, militarized law-enforcement presence with very little oversight. You’ve got ICE agents and their law-enforcement partners using—they’re dressed like military soldiers. They are using military weapons. They are rappelling from Black Hawk helicopters. They’re using flash-bang grenades to clear out buildings.  They’re zip-tying the elderly, children as a way of evacuating a building. These are tools that are used by armed soldiers against enemies—not that we use against civilians.

So I do think there is an effort to terrorize, to intimidate, and probably to get people to self-deport or to not come in the first place. And I think it also is an effort to enforce this narrative that we’re going after the worst of the worst. That has been the line that the administration has been using, but that’s not what they’re actually doing. By making it look like they need all of this backup, they need this heavy-duty equipment, it suggests that that is in fact what they’re doing. But the data does not support that claim.

Applebaum: So they’re trying to convince people that this is a real military operation against real terrorists. They even made a recruiting video out of the raid that deployed Black Hawk helicopters, making it seem something like the Marines in Iraq. But even that raid, it was allegedly meant to target a Venezuelan gang, and yet no one who was detained appears to be a member of a gang, or even a criminal. So it seems that it’s ordinary people.

O’Herron: Correct. Being pulled out of, you know, in the middle of the night to sit in the cold and wait for a chance to say that they’re a citizen.

Applebaum: We’ve been talking about ICE, but that is only one aspect of the new military presence on America’s streets. The other is the National Guard.

Liza Goitein: To me, a police state is a place where the presence of, whether it’s the federal military or law enforcement, is so heavy that people are really kind of living in fear, and they’re changing the way they behave.

Applebaum: In addition to ICE, President Donald Trump has also deployed the National Guard in several big cities. I’ve seen them hanging around Metro stops in Washington, D.C., fully armed, which I find very jarring. I asked my second guest, Liza Goitein, also of the Brennan Center, whether there are any precedents for this.

Goitein: No president has used the military domestically in the way that President Trump is using the military.

Goitein: Never. For street crime? In our nation’s history, presidents have deployed troops to quell civil unrest or to enforce the law a total of 30 times. And the last time was in 1992, so over 30 years ago.

So what we’re seeing now, not only has Trump deployed the military into American cities three times in just over eight months in office, compared to 30 times in the nation’s entire history before this, but he’s also doing it in circumstances where it just hasn’t been done this way before.

Applebaum: Right, so neither is the state asking for help, nor is the state acting in violation of federal law. So there’s no—none of the excuses that have ever been used before are being used.

Goitein: Exactly. I mean, the only time I think the military has been used for street crime was in Hawaii during World War II when Congress authorized martial law. And Hawaii wasn’t a state at the time. Having said that, the law is—it’s 10 USC § 12406. I wish it had a catchy name.

Goitein: It doesn’t. Okay, so I’m just gonna call it Section 12406. And that’s a law that allows the president to federalize National Guard forces. Now, this law has never been used to deploy troops to quell civil unrest, at least not on its own. He’s using it in an unprecedented way.

Applebaum: And he’s doing so on the grounds that there’s an emergency, right? He’s claiming he’s claiming emergency powers. There’s a very bad tradition of leaders using emergencies to do things that are illegal. I mean, it goes back to the 1930s and earlier.

Goitein: Well, yeah, and it’s a hallmark of authoritarian regimes around the world, because emergency powers free leaders from legal constraints that they would otherwise face. And so there’s obviously a temptation to either exploit real crises or to manufacture crises in order to act without these legal limits.

Right. Of course the president has already used exaggerated claims about “unrest,” and therefore “emergency,” in Portland to try to justify the use of troops there, possibly after being shown outdated video. Historically, wars have also given leaders an excuse to crack down on protest or to claim emergency powers. You know in the run up to the U.S. incursion into Venezuela, I did wonder whether the purpose was to create a reason for the president to declare an emergency. Which leads me to the next question, which is whether the military is now at risk of becoming a political tool, used by the White House, not to defend Americans from their enemies, but to promote the President’s power or status and to punish his enemies.

Goitein: When soldiers are dragged into what is widely perceived to be a domestic political fight, that this—first of all, it’s really bad for the morale of the soldiers. That’s not why they enlisted. They don’t like being dragged into politics. But also, it undermines public trust in the military. When you do that, that really weakens our military, when it cannot appeal to and draw from all sectors of the U.S. population, when it loses the public confidence.

And you have to worry about the long-term effects on the military in terms of who is going to join up and who’s going to stay in the military. And increasingly, are we going to see that the people who enlist, the people who stay in the military, are people who either agree with the president’s political agenda, agree that the military should be used to police fellow Americans, or at least are okay with the military being used in that way? And that would very fundamentally and dangerously change what our military is.

Applebaum: Yeah. One of the sources of legitimacy of the U.S. military is that it is perceived as bipartisan, and it is perceived as an institution that protects all of us. And so, presumably, if it loses that, then it loses some of its legitimacy in the eyes of Americans.

Goitein: Absolutely. And that’s really one of the main dangers of what’s happening now that I think not enough people are focused on.

Applebaum: Let me ask you a different question about the future: Do you think, as some governors have warned, that the deployment of armed forces on our streets—National Guard, ICE, and others—will be used to shape public opinion in the run-up to midterm elections this year and maybe during the elections themselves?

Goitein: Yeah, there’s certainly a risk that the president would attempt to deploy troops around the time of an election on the theory that people are less likely to come out and vote if they think that the streets are gonna be full of, you know, heavily armed, federal law enforcement or military troops. That’s going to dissuade some people from getting out and exercising the right to vote.

You really have to worry that not only that this is happening so often—we’re seeing a routinization of the use of the military domestically—but also that we’re seeing a real creep in terms of what it’s being used for. So first it started with protests against ICE raids that were supposedly interfering with ICE’s ability to conduct those raids. Then it was general crime control in Washington, D.C., and you have to wonder what the next reason is going to be. Now, it might continue for a while to be crime control or, you know, protests. But the next reason could be claims of voter fraud, which is a phenomenon that is statistically almost nonexistent.

Applebaum: So you could imagine ICE or the military being used to police polling stations?

Goitein: Well, no, they can’t be used to police polling stations. No. The law very explicitly says that U.S. military and federal armed agents cannot be present at polling stations unless force is necessary to repel armed enemies of the United States. We do have these very strong laws in place that prohibit interference with elections generally and specifically by the military. So that’s off the table. Or at least if they were to do it, it would be flagrantly and obviously illegal.

Applebaum: So technically, we have laws on the books that should prevent troops from being used inside a polling booth. But this administration has already demonstrated that it’s willing to break laws. And maybe, one of the purposes of troop deployment in cities is just to create a general climate of fear, to make people afraid to participate in public life?

Goitein: I mean, it’s certainly the predictable effect of deploying the military on the streets on a sort of routinized basis—to change people’s behavior so that they are afraid to exercise their rights, so that they do behave differently.

So my concern is that we’re moving towards a status quo in which the cities of this country really feel like police states. And to me, a police state is a place where the presence of—whether it’s the federal military or law enforcement—is so heavy and the chill on people’s exercise of their rights is so acute that people are really kind of living in fear, and they’re changing the way they behave.

I personally know several people who are U.S. citizens or immigrants who are lawfully in this country, who have told me that they are staying inside as much as they can, and not going out unless they have to.

Goitein: To me that kind of chill and that kind of change in behavior is what really marks life in a police state.

            <h2>How Donald Trump Broke With His Own Foreign Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/01/trump-foreign-policy-worlds-police-force/685559/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Until recently, Donald Trump was consistent about this: The time for the United States to police the world, enforcing laws and norms, was over. “We are going to take care of this country first before we worry about everybody else in the world,” he told The New York Times in 2016.

“We more and more are not wanting to be the policemen of the world,” he said during a press conference with Nigeria’s president in 2018. “We’re spending tremendous amounts of money for decades policing the world, and that shouldn’t be the priority.” During the 2020 campaign, he often included a line in his stump speech complaining that American troops had spent 19 years serving as “policemen” in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Trump also rejected the idea that the United States had any kind of moral standing to criticize, much less regulate, the behavior of other nations. When Bill O’Reilly objected to Trump’s warmth toward Vladimir Putin in 2017, the president scoffed: “There are a lot of killers. You think our country’s so innocent?”

If anyone gave the U.S. the benefit of the doubt then, Trump has squandered the possibility now. In his second term, Trump has returned the nation to its role as global policeman—but this time, it’s as the world’s dirty cop, running rackets and thumbing its nose at the law even as it cracks down on alleged criminality by other countries’ leaders. He launched air strikes on Christmas Day in Nigeria, the very country he held up eight years ago as one where the U.S. shouldn’t be involved. Days later, U.S. troops snatched the Venezuelan autocrat Nicolás Maduro and his wife in Caracas. Trump told the Times yesterday that the U.S. could spend years controlling Venezuela. This week, the Trump aide Stephen Miller all but announced plans to annex Greenland.

Although the idea of a global policeman originated as a metaphor, the White House has made it literal. Take the boat strikes in the Caribbean, where U.S. law-enforcement agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration have long operated. But whereas previous administrations have used law-enforcement agencies to police drug trafficking, the Trump administration has chosen to rely on the armed forces. He has instructed them to conduct lethal, extrajudicial, and likely illegal drone strikes, even as the administration argues that it need not notify Congress of the actions under the War Powers Resolution because U.S. troops are not in danger. As for the raid in Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also described Maduro’s capture as “a law-enforcement operation,” telling George Stephanopoulos, “We didn’t occupy a country. This was an arrest operation.”

This takes some intellectual contortions to accept. Although officials say that the Justice Department wrote a memo justifying the action legally, the administration has not publicly shared the rationale, and international-law experts have almost unanimously agreed that the U.S. violated international law to arrest Maduro this way. In domestic policing, Trump has long espoused what I call “lawless order”—the idea that those in power can break the law in order to achieve their idea of society—and the president is now extending that to the rest of the world.

This is only one of the inconsistencies that characterize Trump’s approach to law and order. A justice system depends on the idea that laws and enforcement are reasonably consistent and predictable, but Trump offers none of that. On the one hand, he has arrested Maduro and brought him to the U.S., and plans to try him for drug trafficking. On the other, he last month pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras who had been convicted and imprisoned in the United States on very similar charges. He has correctly labeled Maduro an “illegitimate dictator,” but he has made the self-described Salvadoran dictator Nayib Bukele a key ally and welcomed him to the White House. Trump isn’t the best avatar of legal probity himself: He was convicted of 34 felonies in 2024, and escaped trial on several more serious ones only by virtue of being elected president.

What Trump is doing in Venezuela and beyond isn’t enforcing norms and ensuring security. It’s finding a way to make a buck. If you listened to Trump closely when he was rejecting intervention in the past, he hinted at this possibility. Although he complained about American troops being dispatched around the world, he often added that the problem was that the U.S. didn’t receive any direct, immediate monetary compensation for it. (The Iraq War was a mistake, he argued, not because it failed to achieve geopolitical change but because the U.S. didn’t take Iraq’s oil.)

Now he’s out to get his cut. He has openly acknowledged that the U.S. got involved in Venezuela because of oil, and the administration has declared its intent to control the country’s petroleum industry “indefinitely.” In the Arctic Circle, he’s attempting to establish a protection racket, arguing that Denmark doesn’t have the means to defend Greenland. Nice island you got there. Be a shame if something happened to it.

The U.S. has, in the past, made common cause with dictators when expedient, overthrown democratically elected leaders when nervous, and stayed out of righteous causes when doubtful of the upsides of getting involved; presidents have made moves to boost the U.S. economy or their own political prospects. The war hero Smedley Butler famously accused the U.S. government of racketeering in 1935. But even purported deference to a higher principle constrained and directed the shape of global involvement. Trump has abandoned that pretense, and no one dares to stop him. He is getting his way right now, but the long-term effects may be dangerous: When a dirty cop walks the beat, he encourages bad behavior in his precinct rather than suppressing it.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

An Underappreciated Variable in Sports Success

Chief among the burdens weighing upon the weary sports parent—worse than the endless commutes, the exorbitant fees, the obnoxious parents on the other team—is the sense that your every decision has the power to make or break your child’s future. Should your 11-year-old show up to her elementary-school holiday concert, even if it means missing a practice with the elite soccer team to which you’ve pledged 100 percent attendance? What if this turns out to be the fork in the road that consigns her to the athletic scrap heap? …

Rationally, stressing out over missing a single practice is ridiculous. Believing that it matters, though, can be strangely reassuring, because of the suggestion that the future is under your control. Forecasting athletic careers is an imperfect science: Not every top draft pick pans out; not every star was a top draft pick. Unexpected injuries aside, the imprecision of our predictions is usually seen as a measurement problem. If we could only figure out which factors mattered most—how to quantify talent, which types of practice best develop it—we would be able to plot athletic trajectories with confidence.

Unless, of course, this tidy relationship between cause and effect is an illusion. What if the real prerequisite for athletic stardom is that you have to get lucky?

Explore. A theme keeps popping up in relationship advice, Julie Beck writes: Don’t vent so much.

Read. The philosopher Rebecca Newberger Goldstein’s latest book explores a new understanding of human beings’ most basic desire, John Kaag writes.

Over the past 15 or 20 years, I’ve watched as the Grateful Dead has gone from casually dismissed sideshow to critical touchstone, cited by even the coolest bands as an influence. I’d like to say that I was ahead of the curve, but I can’t take much credit: My parents, longtime Deadheads, indoctrinated me from an early age. I recently filmed a video as part of The Atlantic’s “Behind the Byline” series where I talk about the Dead—and get quizzed on how fast I can name that tune and identify the era. To be honest, my colleague Matteo Wong’s advice on pasta might be more useful.

Trump&#39;s government announces defunding of the NOAA.

Hey now we haven&#39;t heard their evidence yet

&quot;Record Ocean Heat is Intensifying Climate Disasters, Data Shows&quot; Vs. &quot;No it isn&#39;t&quot;

Trump just needs to see a hurricane destroy Mar-a-lago and suddenly NOAA will get billions in funding.

The entire continent of Europe has the one temperature?

Because the US Eastern Seaboard and Gulf region had one of the milder hurricane seasons this year than usual  [al.com]:

&quot;There were two tropical storms in the southern Gulf’s Bay of Campeche in 2025, but this was the first year since 2014 that there was not a tropical threat to the northern Gulf Coast, according to NOAA data. It was also the first time in a decade that a hurricane did not make landfall in the United States at all, according to NOAA.&quot;

- A âoehighâ density of plasma (high is relative, in reality itâ(TM)s close to a vacuum)- A high temperature (not relative, literally the hottest things in the solar system)- A long time at those conditions.

The higher you make the product of those three the more fusion you get and the more energy you get.

At the same time though, you need to stop your fusing stuff from touching the outside of your reactor, because itâ(TM)s incredibly high temperature and radioactivity will destroy the reactor.  It will also rapidly cool the reaction, shutting it down.  That means you need to be really good at containing the hot plasma in the middle of the reactor.

These reactors do this by using magnets to squeeze the plasma into the middle (increasing the density), and various forms of heating to get to the desired temperatures.  However, when you squeeze the plasma, it wriggles around like an eel trying to escape.  At some point when you try to grip it too hard, the eel just slips straight out and shoots across the reactor into the walls.  That limits the size of the product described at the start, and so limits the amount of power you can get out.

These scientists have discovered that if youâ(TM)re very careful about how you position the eel when you start squeezing you can squeeze a lot harder before it starts wriggling about like crazy.

Fusion needs three things to work:

- A &quot;high&quot; density of plasma (high is relative, in reality it(TM)&#39;s close to a vacuum)
- A high temperature (not relative, literally the hottest things in the solar system)
- A long time at those conditions.This is called the Lawson criterion [wikipedia.org]. And yes, you can offset the last two with more of the first, a higher density allows for lower temperature and a shorter enclosing time.

- A &quot;high&quot; density of plasma (high is relative, in reality it(TM)&#39;s close to a vacuum)

This is called the Lawson criterion [wikipedia.org]. And yes, you can offset the last two with more of the first, a higher density allows for lower temperature and a shorter enclosing time.

If the past is any indication, the answer is no.  They&#39;ll have to build another multi-billion dollar test apparatus over a decade only to figure out they&#39;re still 10 years away from viability. :)

Unlikely because its magnets suck by modern standards and so it canâ(TM)t reach very high pressures.  SPARC/ARC might do it though.  And yes, we absolutely will have commercial fusion in 20 years.  Likely more like 5-10.

But most likely not with Tokamak style reactors.

&quot;And yes, we absolutely will have commercial fusion in 20 years. Likely more like 5-10.&quot;

We absolutely will not. There may be some test reactors that are energy positive for significant periods of time, but to have solved all the remaining issues AND designed AND built multi megawatt commercial reactors?

Seems like it&#39;s the new old buzz word to accompany the power of tomorrow.

On a side note I saw Keanu Reeves was working on a fusion project back in 1996. Maybe that will be commercially available if Morgan Freeman doesn&#39;t keep getting in his way. It could be huge!

Back in the 1980s, Yosemite National Park was having a serious problem with bears: They would wander into campgrounds and break into the garbage bins. This put both bears and people at risk. So the Park Service started installing armored garbage cans that were tricky to open—you had to swing a latch, align two bits of handle, that sort of thing. But it turns out it’s actually quite tricky to get the design of these cans just right. Make it too complex and people can’t get them open to put away their garbage in the first place.

Yes. Scheier on Security (already linked by CaptQuark). I use that in my IT Security lectures to illustrate human limitations, together with the Dunning-Kruger effect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), the &quot;shooting the messenger&quot; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_the_messenger) extreme management failure, and the Peter Principle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle).

It&#39;s why the current state of bear resistant trash cans relies on something a bear doesn&#39;t have - an opposable thumb. Otherwise bears just figure it all out. And yes, they test with actual bears who literally destroy test trash bins - it&#39;s not always the lid the bear gets through - sometimes they just bash the sides until it breaks wide open.

As for dogs, most get cause and effect pretty rapidly. Most can learn that &quot;vet&quot; means a scary car ride instead of a normal car ride (dogs are especially good a picking

Well, yes and no. No, the world model of a dog is a lot simpler than even that of a not very smart human. And yes, smart dogs will navigate their world model a lot more competent than not very smart humans (which unfortunately is the majority).

The funny thing about LLMs we (well, the smart ones of us) are finding out is that while LLMs do not and cannot be AGI, a lot of humans seem to not have or only have tiny amounts of General Intelligence. And hence they mistake LLMs for &quot;smart&quot;.

Problem is, she also has the attention span of an ADHD toddler.

... Unless there&#39;s something you don&#39;t want her doing. Then she&#39;s seemingly able to focus for hours or even days.

I know that feeling.Loves to go out for a walk, but don&#39;t want the harness that the leash goes on.

I have a dog that is as dumb as nine rocks. I love him mind you. But just .. so .. dumb.

I know from experience. I had a Jack Russel Terrier mix who on his own (not taught) learned a couple of hundred words I estimate. The word &quot;vet&quot; would make him dash off and hide. Any word for a food he liked he would learn quickly -- if we said it he would bark loudly. Also words about going outside. We began spelling food words or using euphemisms (&quot;canine doctor&quot;). Not quite as impressive as the dogs described here, but then he was never tested like that so maybe he could have done it.

My folks had a miniature Schnauzer like that. For example, we had to spell the name of the nearby park otherwise he would go crazy.

Also border collies. I have no experience training dogs and I was staying with a friend for a couple of weeks. I dog sat a bit when she was at work and accidentally taught the dog a new word. Fortunately it was a useful one!

We had some lab mixes over the years that could learn the names of specific toys. They had a big box full of toys, and you could say, &quot;Go get the dragon,&quot; or, &quot;Go get the rope,&quot; or &quot;Go get the big ball&quot; and they&#39;d get it right every time. They also knew enough words to sometimes try to mimic them with their growls and barks, which got pretty funny at times.

I&#39;ve seen dogs trying to say a word or two in videos but never in real life where one can interact. Seems incredibly entertaining.

Our dog knows the names of family members and friends, which nobody has ever taught him, and is an 11 pound dog with a similarly tiny brain.  Dogs are able to do all kinds of things.  This article is a bit &quot;duh&quot;.

Maybe the article was written by people who never owned dogs... /s

The scientist is a dog and animal trainer.  Sometimes experts get a system that works and then see everything through that system, missing things right under those noses.

If my mom calls and I put on the speaker phone, my dog recognizes her voice and gets super excited because he thinks it means her dog will be visiting.

In my classroom, my dog has paid enough attention to the classroom that when I say words to close a lesson, he gets up before the kids do.

&quot;Serious&quot; scientists are still hung up on the idea that anything other than humans is running on pure instinct, with no higher brain function at all, so they get shocked and amazed when they see proof themselves that there&#39;s something more there than reactive instinct. Meanwhile, those of us that have lived with animals our entire lives knew there was way more going on in their heads than there is in the average human. We didn&#39;t just develop a thinking capacity in a vacuum. Predator species, even reptile an

One dog I had as a kid (an American Eskimo) had a ridiculously large vocabulary. You could tell that she was always listening to everything said in the house. When we wouldn&#39;t want her to know what we were talking about we would spell words, and then she learned the spellings. My friends didn&#39;t believe me, so they would try spelling words using monotone voices, directed at somebody else etc, and she would always react.

She wasn&#39;t necessarily the most trainable dog because she was a bit stubborn, but you coul

That would be a lot more valuable to me than bouncing the results from shorts....

Yeah some of the shorts are worth watching from indie creators. cooking, language, music etc.

Shorts are just YouTube&#39;s copy of their competition, designed to engage youth.  They are mostly worthless, juvenile entertainment and the few exceptions are excerpts of useful videos and not needed.

This channel does very funny animations. https://www.youtube.com/@purin... [youtube.com]

dear Youtube, please stop messing with my custom uBlock filters.  i had that silly shit *solved*

I use uBlock to remove shorts entirely from Youtube. Just removing shorts from search is nice, but I do not want to see them at all.

This.  No matter how much you tell YT to show less shorts, they just keep coming.

Don&#39;t forgot the firefox extension &quot;unhook&quot;..really quite useful to clearing the clutter on YT.

How far we have come.Indeed.  Why it seems like only yesterday I was adding the word “short” to my YouTube search query, confused as to what the fuck TFS is rambling on about..since it works exactly as one would expect. Shocking how YouTube didn’t realize this.  It’s only an entire fucking chapter in the No Shit Sherlock Search trilogy.

Next, allow me to toggle Shorts on or off in the subscription part of the mobile app.

And allow me to turn off community posts from people in the community pages of youtube channels. I don&#39;t want that cluttering up my phone or tablet.

I agree... I would really love to have a system setting that said &quot;No shorts, ever, anywhere on the platform&quot;  but we must be grateful for the fact that it&#39;s only taken how many years for YT to finally listen to those of us who&#39;ve been screaming for today&#39;s enhancement?

As others have said... now it&#39;s time for a &quot;No AI&quot; filter but unfortunately YT doesn&#39;t ask uploaders whether their video is AI generated or not -- it asks far more vague questions that also require anyone who uses VFX (such as almost any mode

Wonder why the -1 moderation.  Many extensions changed hands, ended up stealing people&#39;s data, etc.  Main reason I&#39;m reluctant to install any of them any more.

... you can use &quot;gisdev&quot;&#39;s filters and remove ALL shorts. Period.

Why donâ(TM)t they allow searching based on video content. For example you should be able to search using queries like âoevideo where tan cat jumps on dogâ etc. ?

They have it because shorts are addictive for our short attention spans.  They&#39;d be stupid to ignore that revenue stream.

Go stand on a NYC subway where 90% of people are looking at their phone, check what they&#39;re looking at.  It&#39;s literally 90% all vertical shorts, some mobile games, and the rare person has a downloaded anime or tv show.

You just need to edit the feed URL manually.Replace the &quot;UC&quot; from channel_id with &quot;UULF&quot;, and replace &quot;channel_id&quot; with &quot;playlist_id&quot;.

Shorts are crap.  If you happen to watch one and inadvertently scroll too far up or down, the short disappears and is replaced by something else. But even worse, you can&#39;t go back to where you where.  Hitting back on your browser does not return you to what you were watching.

Granted, I hardly ever go to YT any more except for one or two select sites and to listen to music, but even that is becoming less and less worthwhile. Having to go through twenty or thirty scripts to figure out which ones need turned o

A decade ago, when we imagined the horrors of living in a world fractured into different realities, we pictured something technologically dystopian. Experts warned that the time would come when we, as a public, would no longer be able to tell what’s real and what’s not. We would be fed snippets meant to inflame our anger and disgust. There would be candidate sex tapes and footage of crimes committed by racial minorities and leaked audio files with politicians saying horrible things—all fabrications. We would live in a swirl of anguished mass confusion.

But now that that technology is here, it’s finally time to admit it wasn’t ever necessary. At least not to destroy our own shared reality. For that, we just need partisan loyalties.

On Wednesday, when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman in her car in Minneapolis, the casual and disproportionate violence seemed indisputable: no angle showed Renee Good, the driver, gunning for the ICE agent. The most charitable defense of the agent was that he was jumpy and reacted out of fear when the car started moving near his foot; it was harder to defend him shooting at the window after Good had already cleared him. But immediately, people with partisan and commercial interests in defending ICE declared that the video showed Good was trying to kill the ICE agent. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called it “domestic terrorism.” Official government statements cited a “ramming” event. President Trump wrote on social media that the car’s driver “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.” If you watch the videos, the ICE agent not only appears to have escaped unscathed, he also calmly holsters his gun and walks toward the car after the shooting.

And if social media is any indication—and it must be, as it remains one of the key places where large parts of the population take their cues on how to digest political news—the right has agreed to this interpretation. It needed no fake evidence; it only needed an assertion from authorities in the movement that there was a way to process what they were seeing without challenging their narratives. A simple answer that showed how, if you just thought about things the right way, you could ignore your lying eyes.

Yes, when the videos first emerged, there was some small amount of accompanying A.I.-driven disinformation. Some internet users shared A.I.-produced efforts to “unmask” the ICE agent who killed her, and others shared A.I.-generated photos of Good in conversation with the ICE agent. (Ultimately, A.I.’s biggest influence on this story was for provocation: An anonymous internet user asked an A.I. chatbot to reimagine her corpse in a bikini.)

But for the most part, the discussions surrounding the incident started from the authentic bystander videos, all of which clearly showed Good being shot as she was driving away from the officers. Trump and his allies didn’t need fraudulent evidence; they only needed to lie to themselves about what the video showed. The real video was enough for that.

As a result of all this, instead of mourning a tragedy, we’re stuck in a debate between two entirely different translations of the same material. This matters not just because it warps truth and dishonors Good’s memory but because it makes improving the world impossible. The first step to coming together to address a problem—a failure in training or protocol; a too-casual use of deadly force; a culture of hostility toward the public; or the charged situation itself, the result of a city under siege—is agreeing there is a problem. Right now, the mechanism for agreeing on that starting point is broken.

And when everything is subjective, nobody ever has to be accountable. That’s particularly true in the killing of Renee Good. But it’s also true with another event that unfolded this week: the ongoing rewriting of the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and the state-funded efforts to recast it as a patriotic response to a stolen election. The insurrectionists have received pardons and are asking for reparations; they no longer have to worry about accountability.

It has become clear that the insistence on polarized realities poses deeply existential threats. Threats to democracy, as with the notion that you can simply declare your election won. Threats to public safety, as with the refusal to acknowledge millions dead from a global pandemic. Threats to the planet, as with the refusal to recognize climate science. On a more intimate scale, it’s also just exhausting. It’s exhausting to be told you didn’t see what you saw; that you are lying; that you are acting on corrupt motivation, rather than pain in witnessing a human life snuffed out so casually. It’s exhausting to try to extend compassion and to be told that doing so is an inherently partisan activity.

The left is not immune to this. Liberals watched as a flailing President Biden crowed that we “finally beat Medicare” in a debate, and many still insisted he was fit for office. There had been appearances that showed his mental deterioration before that, and there would be others afterward. And yet they shook off what they could plainly see.

Still, Trump is in power, he has torn down all political norms, and his party bears far more responsibility for where we are today. But as long as everyone is willing to do this, to ignore what is right in front of us in order to arm ourselves for conversations to be won or lost, the dynamics will never change: Nothing is ever real, or not real. It’s always gray, always partisan.

Artificial intelligence will undoubtedly make all of this worse. But we won’t have to wait for that dark moment when it subsumes our reality; we’re already all too willing to alter reality in our own minds.

Last month, the Supreme Court held arguments in Olivier v. City of Brandon, a little-discussed case out of the controversial 5th Circuit that sounded, at first, like it would boil down to familiar ideological flashpoints. An evangelical preacher challenged a city ordinance under the First and 14th amendments that confined protesters to a designated zone outside a public amphitheater in Brandon, Mississippi. After the city’s police chief restricted where and how he could speak outside the theater, the preacher was cited, paid a fine, and later sued to prevent the city from enforcing the ordinance against him again.

But inside the courtroom, the argument barely touched speech or religion. Instead, the justices together gravitated toward something else entirely: a problem about time, causation, and whether constitutional authority can be temporally partitioned. Does the Constitution operate only forward? Can a law be unconstitutional tomorrow yet legally untouchable yesterday? And can a single conviction permanently close the courthouse doors to the people most harmed by an unconstitutional rule?

Those questions animated nearly every exchange. The court was wrestling not with what the First Amendment protects, but with whether constitutional rights can be exhausted by a single successful act of punishment.

The case turns on Heck v. Humphrey, a 1994 decision holding that civil rights lawsuits cannot be used to undermine the validity of a still-standing criminal conviction. The idea is straightforward. If you want to challenge the legality of your conviction or confinement, you must proceed through habeas, not through a damages suit.

But Olivier is not asking to undo his past conviction. He is asking the court to prevent the city from enforcing the ordinance against him in the future. The 5th Circuit nevertheless held that even this forward-looking challenge is barred under Heck because success would “necessarily imply” that his earlier conviction was invalid.

That logic produces something like constitutional amnesia. A potentially unconstitutional law can be challenged by people who have never been punished under it, but not by the person who has already borne its force. The state’s prior enforcement becomes a kind of legal eraser, wiping away the injured party’s ability to seek future protection.

What makes this move especially strained is that Heck was never meant to function as a roving doctrine of constitutional quarantine. It was designed to prevent civil lawsuits from becoming backdoor appeals of criminal judgments. It polices remedies and the finality of convictions, not the enforceability of unconstitutional laws going forward. When the doctrine is stretched to block purely prospective relief, it stops mediating between two remedial systems and starts manufacturing a new form of immunity, one that insulates unconstitutional rules simply because they have already succeeded once. In that transformation, Heck ceases to be a rule about procedural sequencing and becomes a rule about who is permitted to invoke constitutional protection at all.

The court seemed acutely aware of the tension. Several justices pressed the same concern from different angles. If Olivier wins and the ordinance is declared unconstitutional, does that not logically demonstrate that his past conviction was unlawful too? Justice Elena Kagan put the problem plainly. If a court declares the statute unconstitutional, “what follows from that logically is that the past conviction was infirm.”

The discomfort was palpable. No one wanted to say out loud that constitutional protection must bend to the preservation of old judgments. Yet that is exactly what the 5th Circuit’s rule requires.

As the hypotheticals posed by the justices multiplied, the doctrine began to drift from lived reality. What if a defendant is still on probation when he seeks prospective relief? Would an injunction against future enforcement undermine the probation condition not to violate the law again? What if collateral consequences persist, such as reporting requirements or licensing barriers?

The answers became increasingly abstract. The law tried to slice time into clean compartments. Yesterday’s conviction remains untouched. Tomorrow’s enforcement is forbidden. Between the two sits a fragile procedural fiction the system clings to in order to pretend these worlds do not meaningfully collide.

This is where rights start to resemble procedural ghosts. They exist in theory but lose substance in practice. They hover over the future while refusing to acknowledge the bodies they already passed through. Law becomes ritualized rather than responsive, and the problem of temporality determines whether constitutional law recognizes continuity across lived experience or whether it tolerates a fragmented legal time in which the same rule can be forbidden prospectively yet insulated retrospectively.

One irony hovered over the argument. The person with the strongest proof that the ordinance threatens constitutional injury is Olivier himself. He has already been stopped, cited, and punished. Past enforcement is the clearest evidence that future enforcement is likely. Even the government conceded that a third party could bring the same challenge and that such a ruling would equally undermine the logic of Olivier’s conviction.

The result is a system in which the people most harmed by unconstitutional laws become the least able to contest them and the Constitution speaks through hypothetical plaintiffs rather than lived ones. Beneath the doctrinal sparring lies a familiar institutional fear characterized by destabilizing final judgments, opening procedural floodgates, and unraveling the architecture of criminal finality. Courts value closure, fear endless relitigation, and worry about conflicting judgments.

Those concerns are not frivolous. But they carry a cost. When administrative peace becomes the dominant value, constitutional rights risk becoming archival artifacts rather than living guarantees. The question is not whether finality matters, but whether finality should subordinate the Constitution itself.

At its core, Olivier asks whether constitutional rights belong to citizens as ongoing protections or merely as retrospective abstractions that harden once violated. Can the Constitution operate only in the future while the past is sealed off as doctrinally untouchable? Or does constitutional meaning necessarily travel across time, illuminating both what was done and what may not be done again?

If constitutional protections can expire the moment the state successfully enforces a law once, then what exactly are they protecting?

The first year of President Donald Trump’s second term in office has seen him unleash heavily armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents in Democratic-leaning cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and Minneapolis in what clearly appears to be a campaign of harassment and intimidation aimed at punishing those cities for their citizens’ political views. These officers’ behavior has been violent enough that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker recently established a commission to look into charging federal agents in state court for their actions. So far, however, despite a growing list of violent and threatening acts by ICE and CBP, no local prosecutor in any city that ICE and CBP has “blitzed” has filed charges against any federal officers.

That may now change. On Wednesday, an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old widowed mother of a now-orphaned 6-year-old child, whose car was blocking theirs. While the Department of Homeland Security quickly claimed the officer was acting in self-defense—DHS Secretary Kristi Noem hyperbolically said the officer was defending himself against “domestic terrorism”—cellphone videos taken by people on the scene tell a much different story. The officers aggressively approached the car, and none of the officers involved appear to be in much risk of harm before one opens fire at almost point-blank range, firing multiple shots through the window of the car, striking Good in the head and killing her. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has already said the state will “ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.” And the Minneapolis police chief has likewise called for an investigation in a statement that put Good’s life, not the officer’s safety, in the foreground. All this certainly seems to suggest there is a real chance that local officials are open to arresting the still-unnamed ICE officer and charging him with homicide.

Which, to be clear, they legally can do. Back in October, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of state for policy who is the driving force behind the current militaristic deployment of ICE and CBP, publicly told ICE officers during a Fox News interview that local officials could not even stop them, much less arrest them. But he is wrong. While it is true that federal courts have read the U.S. Constitution’s “supremacy clause” to give federal law enforcement a lot of protection from local charges, that protection can disappear if those officers act too recklessly, as is certainly plausible here.

It is also important to note that the claim made on Thursday by Noem that the FBI is excluding Minnesota authorities from the investigation because only the FBI has jurisdiction is completely incorrect as well. The FBI’s own website acknowledges that it cannot “take over” investigations from local authorities.

So the question now becomes not whether local officials can prosecute the ICE agent, but whether an investigation yields proof a crime was committed and they have the political desire to follow through with charges. At the investigatory level, it is not promising that the Minnesota’s state-level Bureau of Criminal Apprehension announced that it was no longer investigating the shooting due to the FBI’s refusal to cooperate, a choice that is not legally required by the FBI’s obstructive actions. But the Minneapolis Police Department, which is ultimately under the control of a clearly angry Mayor Jacob Frey, is still free to conduct its own investigation.

Perhaps more important, there is certainly evidence to suggest that the Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty—who can bring charges even without any arrest—is not one to back down from a case like this. The former chief public defender for Hennepin County (the home of Minneapolis), she ran as a reform candidate for the top prosecutor job in 2022; one of her platform’s positions was the need to better hold police accountable for misconduct, including charging them when they break the law.

Since taking office, she has sought to do so, if perhaps sometimes arguably too aggressively. In 2024, she found herself caught up in a controversy over charging a state trooper, Ryan Londregan, with homicide when he shot and killed Ricky Cobb II during a traffic stop. Londregan shot and killed Cobb when, he claimed, Cobb was reaching for his gun during a struggle during the stop. While Moriarty pushed for charges, she eventually had to hire outside counsel to pursue the case because allegedly no prosecutors in her own office were willing to. At one point the state attorney general, Keith Ellison, said he was keeping tabs on the case in case he needed to step in to deal with it himself, likely out of concern that Moriarty was being overly aggressive. Tellingly, the state police union, the MPPOA, asked for Ellison—the man whose office convicted Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd—to intervene, although Moriarty eventually dropped the charges on her own.

In other words, Moriarty does not appear to be one who would back down from a fight here. And it is a fight that will likely be politically popular. ICE is deeply unpopular nationwide. The only federal agency that is liked less is the IRS. And despite a massive media and sign-on incentive campaign fueled by billions of unrestricted dollars that Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” gave ICE, the agency has struggled to find people willing to join it. Moreover, Moriarty represents the people of Hennepin County, where Kamala Harris defeated Trump in 2024 by over 40 points, and ICE is absolutely detested by Democrats and independents. In a November 2025 YouGov poll, 85 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of independents said they “somewhat or strongly disapprove” of ICE. And while GOP support for ICE remains quite high, we saw in Chicago that even Republicans seem to tire of ICE when it arrives in their communities.

One important caveat: The political upside is not directly relevant for Moriarty, since she announced this summer that she is not running for reelection. But she said that she was declining to run because she wanted the rest of her term to be about putting criminal legal reform in a good light and felt controversies around her distracted from that, so the politics of charging an ICE officer likely still matter to her. And the outrage already clearly brewing in Minneapolis makes it clear that the people of Hennepin are demanding accountability.

It’s also worth asking why we haven’t seen any similar efforts to prosecute federal officers in other strongly Democratic-leaning counties that have seen aggressive, violent ICE and CBP enforcement. Part of it is likely just the nature of the cases: The other lethal shootings have seemed more ambiguous, and the returns on going after nonhomicide assaults—even egregious ones like sniping a reverend in the head with a pepper ball—may not justify the unavoidable challenges of trying to convict federal officials on state charges.

But part of it may also be that we are seeing some of the costs of the Democrats’ only-lukewarm embrace of criminal legal reform. In 2024, a tough-on-crime Democrat, who received the endorsement of the local police union, squeaked out a razor-thin win over a more reform-minded candidate in the primary for Cook County state’s attorney, leaving Chicago with a prosecutor disinclined to go after the police in general as “Operation Midway Blitz” kicked off. And in Los Angeles, reformer George Gascón lost his reelection campaign in 2024 to a former federal prosecutor who has often remained distinctly quiet in the face of aggressive ICE behavior. By electing prosecutors less willing to confront police misconduct, two cities hit hard by ICE also found themselves with prosecutors less willing to stand up against ICE for them. (At least in California, however, the state attorney general still has the freedom to step in to pick up any perceived slack; the Illinois attorney general has less power in this regard.)

But whatever hesitancy we have seen elsewhere, it’s certainly possible that Minneapolis will be the first city to push back against the current right-wing authoritarianism in D.C. by indicting one of its federal agents for murder. The video evidence is shocking, the public outrage in Minneapolis and beyond is growing, and the city happens to be home to a prosecutor who has spent her legal career fighting police violence.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA is bringing the Crew-11 astronauts back to Earth early after one encountered a medical issue that could not be dealt with aboard the orbiting outpost.

On Wednesday, the astronauts were preparing for a spacewalk scheduled for Thursday. However, after the spacewalk was postponed due to a medical concern, NASA concluded by the end of Thursday that bringing the crew back to Earth early – likely within the next few days – was the safest option.

NASA protected the astronaut&#39;s privacy, declining to identify which of the four crew members was affected or specify the condition&#39;s nature. Officials said the astronaut&#39;s condition was stable, requiring no emergency deorbit, and was unrelated to International Space Station operations.

Crew-11 consists of NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Michael Fincke, JAXA astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. Cardman and Fincke were due to perform the spacewalk.

&quot;This is not an injury that occurred in the pursuit of operations,&quot; said NASA Chief Health and Medical Officer James Polk during a briefing.

Freshly appointed NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said: &quot;It&#39;s the end of the Crew-11 mission right now. They&#39;ve achieved almost all of their mission objectives.&quot;

The early departure will reduce the ISS&#39;s crew to three, including one US astronaut. NASA and its partners will attempt to advance the launch of the Crew-12 mission.

NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya noted that the ISS has operated with three crew members before, though the station was smaller then. He said &quot;the vehicle is very autonomous and robust.&quot;

NASA astronaut Chris Williams will maintain US operations solo until Crew-12 arrives. Kshatriya said Williams is &quot;trained to do every task that we could ask him to do on the vehicle,&quot; with many ISS payloads operated from the ground.

This marks the first medical evacuation in the ISS&#39;s 25-year crewed history. Polk said that analysis models indicate a medical evacuation is expected every three years. The ISS&#39;s medical facilities can diagnose and treat many conditions without early returns.

Yet the incident highlights deep-space mission risks. Controllers could retrieve this astronaut. However, on Mars missions or even long-duration lunar trips, that option might not exist. ®

            <h2>Copper supplies set to peak just as tech needs more</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Concerns are mounting over copper supplies, with a fresh study warning that demand will likely outstrip production within a decade, threatening to constrain global technological advancement.

Electrification of industry, electric vehicles, and the AI-driven boom in IT infrastructure are all fueling demand for copper, used for everything from cabling to chip interconnects.

However, a study by financial analyst S&P Global estimates that worldwide production of the metal will peak in 2030 at 33 million metric tons, while demand is forecast to continue growing to reach 42 million metric tons by 2040 - a 50 percent increase from current levels, creating a supply shortfall of about 10 million metric tons without meaningful expansion.

The result? Soaring copper prices, making electrical goods and IT kit costlier to produce. The metal already hit a historical high of $5.84 per pound in late 2025, according to some sources.

Although S&P labels its report &quot;Copper in the Age of AI,&quot; the datacenter boom is not the largest consumer. Instead, core economic demand - domestic electrification worldwide, including in developing countries - leads the charge. Electric vehicles, solar and wind generation (more than 90 percent of new generating capacity installed globally in 2025), plus expanding transmission infrastructure all add pressure.

Yet while global demand accelerates, current supply is set to decline as existing resources deplete, S&P warns.

Primary supply from mining copper faces declining ore grades, rising costs, and increasingly complex extraction. Bringing new mines into use also involves long timescales, averaging 17 years.

Another report last year from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) suggested that climate change threatens copper mines, which require steady water supplies but are often located in drought-risk regions.

Secondary supply from recycled sources can&#39;t close the gap, S&P says. While telcos transitioning to fiber-optic cabling may free up 800,000 metric tons of copper wiring, the analyst projects recycling will provide only a third of total supply by 2040, leaving a substantial shortfall even with aggressive collection improvements.

Meeting rising demand requires considerable effort and innovation. S&P calls for streamlined permitting to shorten mine development timelines, stable investment frameworks, new technology, and expanded processing capacity beyond existing hubs.

China presents a particular concern: with 40 to 50 percent of global copper smelting and refining capacity, the concentration &quot;amplifies systemic risks and exposes the supply chain to geopolitical shocks&quot; - echoing fears over China&#39;s dominance of rare earth minerals and legacy semiconductors.

Primary production remains the only real solution to bridging the gap, S&P concludes, but ramping up mining output will require effort and investment.

&quot;Future copper supply depends not only on geology, engineering, logistics, and investment, but also on governance and policies,&quot; the report states, noting that smelting and refining also form a critical node in the supply chain, especially as capacity is concentrated in a limited number of countries.

&quot;Building a more resilient global copper system requires multilateral cooperation and more regional diversification,&quot; it says.

Sadly, multilateral cooperation itself seems in short supply in the current geopolitical climate. ®

            <h2>China-linked cybercrims abused VMware ESXi zero-days a year before disclosure</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/09/china_esxi_zerodays/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Chinese-linked cybercriminals were sitting on a working VMware ESXi hypervisor escape kit more than a year before the bugs it relied on were made public.

That&#39;s according to researchers at Huntress, who this week published a breakdown of an intrusion they observed in December 2025 in which a &quot;sophisticated&quot; toolkit was used to break out of virtual machines and target the ESXi hypervisor itself. The security firm says parts of the code point to development starting as early as February 2024 – a full year before VMware disclosed the bugs in March 2025.

The incident began in a very unglamorous way – with a compromised SonicWall VPN appliance. From there, the attackers were able to commandeer a Domain Admin account, pivot across the network, and eventually deploy a suite of tools that Huntress says exploited multiple flaws to escape a guest VM and reach the underlying ESXi hypervisor.

VM escape bugs are particularly serious because they break a promise virtualization is built on: that a hacked VM stays in its own box. In this case, the attackers appear to have stitched together ESXi-specific tricks that enabled them to jump the fence and execute code on the hypervisor itself.

Huntress&#39;s analysis of the binaries revealed development paths with simplified Chinese strings and folders labeled with Chinese text meaning &quot;All version escape – delivery,&quot; hinting at the region and intent behind the work. What&#39;s more, the researchers say the code carried timestamps showing it was put together well before VMware acknowledged or fixed the vulnerabilities.

Those flaws – tracked as CVE-2025-22224, CVE-2025-22225, and CVE-2025-22226 – were flagged by VMware in March 2025 as critical and high-severity bugs that could be chained to compromise the hypervisor from a guest VM. At the time, the company warned it had &quot;information to suggest that exploitation [of all three CVEs] has occurred in the wild.&quot;

While organizations scrambled to patch their ESXi hosts once the advisory dropped, Huntress&#39;s findings suggest at least some skilled actors were already weaponizing those issues long before IT teams were even aware they existed.

This wasn&#39;t just a smash-and-grab. Huntress says the attackers disabled VMware&#39;s own drivers, loaded unsigned kernel modules, and phoned home in ways designed to go unnoticed. The toolkit supported a wide range of ESXi versions, spanning over 150 builds, which would have let the attackers hit a broad swath of environments had they not been stopped, it added.

It&#39;s also not the first time attackers linked to China have been caught quietly abusing zero-days in widely used enterprise software, and campaigns like Volt Typhoon showed how China-linked attackers can sit quietly inside enterprise networks for months, keeping their heads down. In that case, too, most victims had no idea anything was wrong until well after the fact. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Opinion Wait? What? I was just cruising along the information superhighway – yes, I&#39;m old, deal with it – when I spotted a Y Combinator story announcing, &quot;Microsoft Office renamed to &#39;Microsoft 365 Copilot app&#39;.&quot; Excuse me!? I looked closer and found that, sure enough, it certainly looked like Microsoft had renamed Office to the God-awful &quot;Microsoft 365 Copilot.&quot;

A deeper dive revealed that while Microsoft had successfully confused people across the internet, Redmond hadn&#39;t actually renamed Microsoft 365. Not yet, anyway. I mean, they&#39;re slapping the Copilot label on everything else, and they&#39;ve integrated it into Office, excuse me, Microsoft 365, why not Microsoft 365 Copilot?

What really happened was that Microsoft changed the Microsoft 365 Copilot app product page to read, and I quote, &quot;The Microsoft 365 Copilot app (formerly Office) lets you create, share, and collaborate all in one place with your favorite apps, now including Copilot.&quot;

Sure sounds like they&#39;ve changed the name, doesn&#39;t it? What actually happened was that the &quot;Office&quot; Microsoft was referring to here was an ancient 2019 Office app that directed users to the free online versions of Office programs. Microsoft had made this change many months ago, but no one had noticed until recently, hence all the confusion.

Oh, and by the way, the latest version of the Office standalone software suite, Microsoft Office 2024, is still with us. There may be another PC-centric version after that, but I wouldn&#39;t bet on it.

This isn&#39;t the first time Microsoft has confounded loyal users. Take Copilot itself. Microsoft now uses the single Copilot brand for very different offerings: Microsoft 365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot, Copilot in Windows, Copilot for Security, and more. Each has its own capabilities, pricing, and integration with the rest of the Microsoft software suite. It&#39;s so bad that the National Advertising Division (NAD), part of the Better Business Bureau, found that Microsoft&#39;s &quot;Copilot&quot; branding was misleading. You think!

Indeed, Microsoft has a long history of bad branding. For example, the Enterprise and SMB Office subscriptions have repeatedly been renamed: Office 365 ProPlus to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise; Office 365 Business to Microsoft 365 Business. And we can&#39;t forget Microsoft&#39;s switch from Lync to Skype to Skype for Business, and finally to Teams. These layered branding changes came on top of shifts in backends and feature sets, adding to users&#39; puzzlement.

Last but not least, my Microsoft programming buddies have faced nigh unto endless confusion about Microsoft&#39;s .NET branding. It&#39;s bewildered developers for years because names, version numbers, and even the meaning of &quot;.NET&quot; itself have changed multiple times. The result is persistent ambiguity about which runtime or framework is being discussed at a given moment. For ages, developers have had to distinguish between .NET Framework (Windows‑only, up to 4.8), .NET Core (cross‑platform, up to 3.1), and .NET Standard (a shared API spec), all branded with &quot;.NET&quot; but referring to very different things.

As bad as Microsoft is at naming its products, there are far worse out there. I mean, bad names and all, Microsoft hasn&#39;t lost money. That&#39;s not the case with Elon Musk renaming Twitter to X. By replacing a globally understood verb, &quot;tweet,&quot; and a distinctive bird icon with a generic letter, Twitter lost its hard‑won product identity. This, in turn, helped ruin Twitter&#39;s finances. Analyst estimates suggest X&#39;s global ad revenue dropped by about 46 percent, from about $4.5 billion in 2022 to roughly $2.2 billion in 2023 after the rebrand. The company still hasn&#39;t recovered. Currently, Twitter&#39;s estimated revenue is around $2.9 billion.

It also hasn&#39;t helped that the &quot;X&quot; site has become, as the Financial Times put it, &quot;the deepfake porn site formerly known as Twitter.&quot; I know Musk got some kind of prepubescent boy pleasure out of renaming the site to X, but as far as business goes, the move looks ever more stupid by the day.

Other major tech companies also have a way of making terrible branding decisions. For example, the Facebook-to-Meta rename was framed as a visionary pivot to the metaverse. Even then, it was seen as a reputation escape hatch amid leaks, antitrust pressure, and a collapse in trust. Now, the metaverse, which never saw any pickup, is seen as a failure as its funding within the company keeps being cut back. These days, the metaverse is little more than a bad joke, along with Non-Fungible Token (NFT) art.

Far less dramatic, but just as pointless, was Alphabet&#39;s creation as Google&#39;s holding company. Even stock market players who swear by the Magnificent Seven call it Alphabet (Google).

It&#39;s in the intersection of technology and entertainment, though, that we find two of the dumbest rebrands.

First, there was Netflix, which briefly spun off its DVD‑by‑mail business as Qwikster. &quot;Q what?&quot; you ask? Exactly. This move forced customers to juggle two brands, two sites, and two bills, with no benefits whatsoever. The backlash was immediate and severe. Netflix reversed the decision within weeks. Today, the only people who remember it are marketing professionals, where &quot;Qwikster&quot; is shorthand for avoidable, self‑inflicted brand damage.

Far more recently, there was Warner Bros. Discovery&#39;s brain-dead decision to drop &quot;HBO&quot; from HBO Max. Why anyone thought that dumping a premium, decades‑old brand was a good idea is beyond me. HBO&#39;s tagline, &quot;It&#39;s not TV. It&#39;s HBO,&quot; became synonymous with top production values, creative freedom for writers and directors, and risk‑taking, adult storytelling in shows like The Sopranos, The Wire, and Game of Thrones. To dump that brand in an increasingly competitive online streaming market was beyond stupid. It took two years to reverse course. That was two years too long.

I know in tech circles people like to dismiss marketing and branding as irrelevant. It&#39;s not. If people are confused about exactly what you&#39;re offering, they won&#39;t spend money on your products or services.

The companies I mentioned here were all big enough to survive their branding blunders. Yours may not be so lucky, so take your time and get your naming and logos right. ®

            <div id="article-text">Tough microbes able to survive extreme environments on Earth could be the key to constructing buildings to allow humans to survive on Mars, according to a research paper.

A global research team has analyzed the prospects for biomineralization on Mars, a process in which bacteria, fungi, and microalgae can create minerals as part of their metabolism, offering a byproduct that could be useful to prospective Martian explorers by providing the raw materials needed to produce aggregates such as concrete.

With an extremely thin and mostly carbon dioxide atmosphere, air pressure less than 1 percent of Earth&#39;s, and temperatures ranging from -90°C up to 26°C, Mars might not be a hospitable place for most terrestrial life forms, but some microorganisms have been found to thrive in acidic lakes, volcanic soils, and deep caves.

Polytechnic University of Milan materials engineering postdoctoral researcher Shiva Khoshtinat and a multidisciplinary team focused on a partnership between two bacteria: Sporosarcina pasteurii – which makes calcium carbonate through the breakdown of urea – and Chroococcidiopsis, which can survive extreme environments, including simulated Martian conditions.

The researchers propose a system in which the two organisms work together. Chroococcidiopsis releases oxygen, which helps support Sporosarcina pasteurii and produces an extracellular polymeric substance that can protect the latter bacteria from damaging UV radiation on Mars. Meanwhile, Sporosarcina produces polymers that help create minerals the authors think might be able to bind the Martian soil – regolith – to produce a material similar to concrete.

The plan is then to use this aggregate to 3D-print buildings on Mars, the process offering the added benefit of producing excess oxygen to support human life, while excess ammonia could be useful in growing food.

There are some snags, though. Detailed analysis of the regolith will be needed to see if the proposal works, and plans to return samples to Earth from Mars have been repeatedly delayed. Recent reports suggest the Mars Sample Return program lacks political support.

Even if the plan were revived, there would still be significant barriers to overcome. &quot;Integration into life support systems for recycling waste gases, supplying oxygen, or generating construction materials requires comprehensive safety and reliability assessments,&quot; said the paper published in Frontiers in Microbiology.

&quot;Without integrated, long-duration testing in analog or space environments, the pathway from concept to application remains highly speculative.&quot;

Other proposals to make useful materials from extra-terrestrial soils include the application of potato starch and a pinch of salt. ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! Today&#39;s bork - on a UK border control wait-time screen - is doubly unfortunate. Tired passengers get no clue how long until someone checks their passport, and of all organizations that should keep security certs current, the one responsible for keeping out criminals tops the list.

Spotted by eagle-eyed Register reader Alan Graystone while slogging through Border Control at Birmingham Airport, there are multiple borks on show here. Yes, a security certificate problem is not the greatest sight to see while waiting for paperwork to be inspected. However, worse still is the fact the display still appears to be running Windows 7.

If we&#39;re not mistaken, the revocation error message has been rendered in the Windows Aero GUI introduced in Windows Vista two decades ago and continued through the era of Windows 7. It was ditched in Windows 8 in favor of something flatter and subsequently more &quot;fluent.&quot; Years after Microsoft abandoned the design, Apple had a go with its &quot;Liquid Glass&quot; user interface.

Windows 7 reached the end of the road in 2020, although some editions lingered on a little longer, and it was possible to keep the lights on via Extended Security Updates (ESU), although even that program came to an end in 2023.

As it turned out, our reader reported that it took a mere 10 minutes to whizz through the border at Birmingham – very speedy when compared to certain other ports of entry.

Assuming the time on the display is correct – just before 0730 on October 30 – that would have left plenty of time in which to enjoy a beverage or snack following passport inspection, and more than enough time to deal with whatever certificate problem has befallen the digital signage.

Although perhaps it is best to remain in the dark when it comes to wait times. Much like the progress bar of lies that occasionally afflicts modern applications, sometimes it is best to stand in Schrodinger&#39;s queue while the signage is borked and the wait time is in a state of quantum. ®

At CES 2026 this week, people kept asking me what health tech I was seeing on the show floor. My only answer was this: bodily fluids. As in urine, blood, sweat, and saliva.

With most people, my response typically got a handful of groans and raised eyebrows. Among insiders, I surprised no one.

CES is ground zero of the wellness wild west. At Eureka Park and the Venetian Expo, you’ll find dozens of digital health startups hawking everything from smartwatches and smart rings to smart pillows. This isn’t new, per se. Urine tech in particular has always been a staple at the show, but what’s notable this year isn’t simply the presence of this tech — it’s the idea that mining these fluids can help you live longer and healthier.

Here’s some of what I saw: at-home hormone testing kits using urine and saliva; smart menstrual pads and panty liners; an in-toilet hydration tracker; a mirror that analyzes your facial blood flow to estimate how well you’re aging; a sperm microscope; and a smart scale that analyzes metabolic health through foot sweat.

It’s not just tiny startups, either. Bigger names in the space are also opening their platforms to accommodate data sources beyond heart rate. At the show, Withings announced it was partnering with Abbott to integrate the latter’s continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). Oura has a similar partnership with Dexcom that was announced in 2025. Whoop also added the ability to get blood panel data integrated into its app last year, followed soon by Oura, and now Ultrahuman is doing the same.

At the core, this fixation on bodily fluids is evidence that the entire industry is doubling down on metabolic health as the next frontier. Where digital health started with cardiovascular health, the next phase hinges on your metabolism. So after logging tens of thousands of steps on the show floor, I sat down with Oura CEO Tom Hale and Dexcom CEO Jake Leach to talk about where metabolic tech is going, the challenges ahead, and what we’re likely to see as consumers.

Both said the real balancing act is between finding useful data from additional metrics and the potential to overwhelm people with health anxiety. While people may be fine with step and heart rate data, getting into deeper metabolic insights comes with much more sensitive data. Introducing more advanced detection features — like, say, high blood pressure or glucose alerts — raises the stakes.

“Actually, we don’t need more sensors. We need more sense,” says Hale, who views metabolic insights derived from blood or urine testing as more likely to be episodic than continuous. For Hale, the point is to combine occasional, use-case-driven data with longer-term baseline data.

“You’re trying to solve a certain problem. Maybe you’re going through a super stressful time, and you’re trying to manage your stress because you’re hypertensive. Okay, maybe a cortisol sweat test is really useful, but when you figure that out, are you going to continually measure your cortisol? Probably not.”

“Bringing the data together in one place is really helpful. Having it in disparate places on disparate devices is problematic, but you’ve got to have technology and software surface actual insights and not just, ‘Here’s all these blood markers and here’s where they should be,’” says Leach.

This is a tale as old as health tech — and one many companies are trying to solve with AI. Hence why you’re starting to see so many companies adding AI-powered nutrition tracking, chatbots, and insights into their apps. Dexcom added AI insights for its Stelo CGM. Oura has also done it. Meanwhile, at CES 2026, Garmin announced it was also adding AI nutrition logging to its app for subscribers.

On paper, it’s a trend that makes a ton of sense. The reality is that the AI just isn’t there yet. When I push Leach on that, he agrees.

“We’ve got to push past that, and that is where things are kind of stuck. A technology like CGMs that has such obvious outcomes is a great technology to be pioneering that,” Leach says, noting that there are direct correlations between the lifestyle changes a person makes and how they’re reflected in their glucose readings.

The other problem, however, is data privacy. Getting blood tests is invasive, and many people currently live in a state of heightened anxiety. It’s a tough time for health tech to ask for more data from its users.

Case in point, Oura — and by extension, Hale — received backlash earlier this summer when Oura was revealed to have a partnership with Palantir and the Defense Department. Users accused the company of selling and sharing user data, forcing Hale to come on social media to refute the accusation. In public statements on social media, Hale stated that Oura never sells or shares user data; the Palantir partnership in question referred to a separate enterprise program. When I press the issue, Hale reiterates this point, adding that users’ menstrual data in particular is off-limits.

Months later, Hale says “Palantir-gate” didn’t hurt the company much overall, but was a compelling experience. “We weren’t selling anybody’s data, but we learned just how afraid people are about that and how much of a third rail that is.”

Otherwise, both Leach and Hale pointed to nutrition, blood pressure, and wearable gadget ecosystems as likely trends in the space. Dexcom plans to add macro tracking and a redesigned app later this year. Meanwhile, Hale noted that we might soon start seeing greater integration between smart glasses and food tracking. For example, taking a photo of your meal, getting calorie estimates, and then cross-referencing all that data with your given tracker of choice. Hale also identified chronic condition management as another potential avenue wearables and health tech are starting to explore.

“The wearable space in general is experiencing quite the boom right now, and I think it’s driven by the actual desire of people to live healthier and for healthcare systems to improve their outcomes,” agrees Leach. “Wearable technology is the way we do this at scale, because not every doctor can see every patient all of the time.”

Taking all this in, I don’t think the average Joe is suddenly going to be installing pee collectors in their toilet, going for monthly blood draws, or stepping on $600 scales that tell you how long you’re going to live based on your foot sweat. That would truly be a dystopian 2026. But based on what I saw, and what I heard from Hale and Leach, I do think you’re going to start seeing a larger shift away from basic fitness and more toward this idea of promoting longevity through preventive measures. It’s going to be less about closing your rings every day and more about doing small lifestyle experiments over a few months and tracking any changes. Optimistically, those changes may help prevent or improve common ailments that build up over time, like diabetes, hypertension, or high cholesterol. Maybe those experiments will involve bodily fluids, maybe not. But clearly, the industry seems to think metabolism is the key to unlocking a healthier you.

Unfortunately, I think that means more bodily fluids.

All the gadgets, gizmos, and stories from another year at the biggest show in tech.

This year’s CES was an odd one. This is a conference usually dominated by futuristic, expensive TVs and futuristic, expensive cars, but those things weren’t what dominated CES 2026. Instead, Las Vegas was filled with new ideas about old gadgets and showed us a whole lot of really impressive hardware waiting on software to catch up.

On this episode of The Vergecast, recorded live at the Brooklyn Bowl in Vegas, David and Nilay talk through some of the big stories from this year’s show. (Thanks to everyone who came to see us and stuck around after for drinks and bowling — we had a blast hanging with all of you!) We talk about the robots that can’t seem to stand up, why it seems like every company is suddenly making everything, the return of the Weird Ideas About PCs, battery life, and much more.

The focus at CES is always on individual products, and there are lots of interesting ones this year, from the Lego Smart Brick to the Clicks Communicator to the rows upon rows of robot vacuums we saw in the convention center. Some things will ship and be great; some won’t. (We have a game in this episode about that, too.) But every year, if you look past the gadgets themselves, you can start to get a sense of what the tech industry cares about — and how our lives might change in the year to come. It’s still early, and 2026 is shaping up to be a year, but we have some ideas already.

If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, and to check out the rest of our CES coverage, here are some links to get you started:

            <h2>Kia’s EV2 is its smallest and most affordable EV for Europe</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/858912/kia-ev2-announce-specs-range-europe">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Kia isn’t planning on bringing the small city car to the US anytime soon. What a shame.

Kia isn’t planning on bringing the small city car to the US anytime soon. What a shame.

Kia unveiled the EV2, a small and affordably priced electric vehicle built for the European market. The EV2 made its debut at the Brussels Auto Show, where executives touted it as its “most compact” EV to date.

Of course, it was another in a long line of affordable, capable, and impressively designed EVs that won’t be available to US customers — at least not right away. And it arrives at a time when Europeans have many affordable options from which to chose, potentially complicating Kia’s strategy for the EV2.

The EV2 will come in two trims: a Standard-range version, with 42.2kWh battery pack and 317 km (197 miles) of range based on the WLTP cycle; and a Long-range trim, with 61kWh pack and over 440 km (273 miles) of range. The Standard-range EV2 will accelerate from 0-100 km/s in 8.7 seconds, while the Long-range will do the same in 9.5 seconds.

The EV2 has a crisp, squared-off profile with sleek surfaces, tall, upright proportions, and signature LED daytime running lights front and rear, in a clear reflection of Kia’s current design direction. When it arrives, it will slot beneath the EV3 and EV4, the latter of which is scheduled to go into production ahead of the EV2. And like the EV3, the EV2 will be built on a scaled-backed version of Hyundai’s Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) platform in order to keep costs down.

That means a 400-volt architecture, rather than an 800-volt one for quicker fast-charging. Kia says both versions of the EVs will fast-charge from 10-80 percent in 30 minutes, which is a bit pokier when compared to 20-25 minutes it takes the EV6 and EV9 to do the same. And in a first for Kia, the EV2 will support both 11kW and 22kW AC charging, in a nod to the predominant form of charging in Europe. The EV2 also supports bidirectional charging, as well as vehicle-to-load and vehicle-to-grid charging.

But just because the EV2 is small and unluxurious doesn’t mean it won’t have a few bells and whistles. Kia is stocking its new model with a bevy of ADAS features, like adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking, as well as remote smart parking, enabling owners to park their vehicles from the outside by using the key fob.

Kia says the Standard-range model will go into production at its factory in Slovakia starting in February 2026, followed by the longer-range version and GT trims in June 2026. That, plus American car shoppers’ apparent disdain for small cars, means the EV2 is unlikely to go on sale here. It’s a shame, too. Americans would likely respond favorably to a $20,000 EV, as the EV2 is estimated to cost.

The CES show floor officially closes its doors at the end of the day, but there’s still a trickle of announcements and reveals coming out of Las Vegas. If you’re struggling to stay on top of all the new tech, gadgets, concepts, and AI-powered devices as the final day of CES gets underway, we’re still rounding up the best hardware and upgrades that have debuted so far so you can quickly get up to speed.

As the show draws to a close for another year, you can still catch up on all of The Verge’s CES 2026 coverage here.

Preset scenes are the easiest way to take advantage of color-changing smart lights in a room, but the effect isn’t as impactful as it could be when randomly spread across lamps and bulbs. Philips Hue’s solution is a new feature called SpatialAware. After installing smart bulbs and placing smart lamps around a room, you use the Hue app to scan the space with your smartphone’s AR capabilities. This generates a 3D model that SpatialAware uses to understand where every light is located so it can more intelligently distribute specific colors. To more accurately re-create a sunset, for example, SpatialAware will set the lights on one side of a room to warm yellow tones, while lights on the opposite side have darker tones.

The new feature will be released in Spring 2026 and will be compatible with Hue products connected to the Hue Bridge Pro.

The famous guitar maker announced its first pair of wireless headphones at CES this year, under its consumer electronics brand, Fender Audio. The Mix, as the headphones are simply called, feature 40mm “hyper-efficient Graphene drivers” and ANC with up to 52 hours of battery life while blocking noise, or up to 100 hours with ANC off. Hidden beneath the Mix’s ear cushions you’ll find an easily accessible and replaceable battery on one side, while the other holds a USB-C wireless transmitter enabling lossless 96kHz/24bit LHDC streaming, low-latency LC3, and Auracast wireless modes. They’re expected to launch this year for $299.99.

The Verge’s Sean Hollister went hands on with a fascinating new material called Soramatex. Its creator, a company called Sora Materials, wouldn’t reveal what it’s made from, other than saying it uses carbon powder. Soramatex could be useful as everything from insulation to soundproofing, but it will almost certainly find its way into aerospace applications because the material is so lightweight you can’t actually feel it while holding it in your hands.

Modular controllers that let you physically swap out buttons and joysticks aren’t a new idea. But Hyperkin and GameSir are delivering two innovations with their X5 Alteron controller that doesn’t yet have a release date. It’s the first clamp-on controller with an expanding mechanism to adapt to various mobile devices (including the Switch) to feature modular controls. It’s also the first modular controller that goes beyond just letting you rearrange buttons and joysticks or swap out their underlying hardware. The X5 Alteron will be upgradable with optional modules turning it into an N64- or GameCube-style gamepad. There’s also plans for a module with a touchpad for replicating a mouse.

Satechi already sells several accessories designed to complement Apple’s Mac Mini and expand its capabilities. Its new Thunderbolt 5 CubeDock goes one step further and looks like the tiny desktop computer’s long lost twin. It’s a standalone hub with three Thunderbolt 5 ports offering up to 120Gbps speeds, slower USB-C and USB-A ports, a memory card reader, a 2.5Gb Ethernet port, HDMI ports supporting up to three 8K monitors on Windows, and a NVMe SSD slot adding up to an extra 8TB of storage. It’s available for preorder now for $399.99 and expected to ship in Q1 2026.

It’s a lofty claim, but startup Donut Lab, an EV startup that spun off from Verge Motorcycles (no relation), claims to already be in production of a solid-state battery with an an energy density of 400 Wh/kg. That would give an EV about 30 percent more range than if it was using a lithium-ion battery of the same weight. Donut Lab also says its solid-state batteries are cheaper to manufacture and have a much longer life cycle. They’ll first be used in the Verge TS Pro electric superbike that can be fully recharged in just 10 minutes, if the startup delivers on its claims.

There are some good reasons to upgrade your leaf blower this year. Following the debut of Hoto’s slick leaf blower last November, a company called Whisper Aero has announced the Tone T1 it claims is up to 40 percent quieter than other electric blowers on the market. At full power, it sends leaves and debris flying with a 150mph blast but produces only 52 decibels of noise that’s quieter than a refrigerator. It’s available for preorder now starting at $599 and is expected to ship in September 2026.

Coming to Kickstarter in March 2026 and tentatively priced at $2,000 for a complete kit, Fly Wing’s X-Wing Fighter (we’ll see how long that name stays) is a folding foam drone that can take off and land vertically using four propellers, but fly like a plane. Inside its tiny cockpit is a head-tracking camera that sends live video to a pair of DJI goggles, giving you a first-person view as you pilot the drone for up to 60 minutes on a full charge.

First announced at CES 2025 in sizes up to 31.5 inches, PocketBook has announced two larger versions of its InkPoster that now use a 40.5-inch version of E Ink’s Spectra 6 color screen. Both the InkPoster Tela and Duna can display and regularly cycle through photos and artwork customized through a mobile app. But the Duna is wrapped in a sculpted frame created by Pininfarina and has access to exclusive design sketches from the Italian design house’s archives. When available later this year, the Duna’s pricing is expected to start at $6,000.

Two years ago at CES 2024, L’Oréal introduced its Airlight Pro hair dryer that added infrared light to speed up drying and reduce the amount of heat being applied to hair. Its new Light Straight features similar tech, but in the form of a flat iron that can be used to straighten or curl hair in just one pass. Similar hair-styling tools will heat up to more than 400 degrees Fahrenheit, but L’Oréal’s Light Straight maxes out at 320 degrees while still being faster and causing less damage. It’s set to release in 2027, when pricing will also be revealed.

Most of us haven’t upgraded to Wi-Fi 7 routers yet, but technology marches on, and CES 2026 saw the debut of Wi-Fi 8 routers and chips despite the fact the official IEEE 802.11bn specification may not be finalized until mid to late 2028. One of the more unusual designs at this year’s show is the Asus ROG NeoCore concept router that looks like a 20-sided role playing die with a hollow bottom. You can’t buy one yet, and the prototype broke when The Verge’s Sean Hollister picked it up, but the unusual router design hides its antennas along the internal edges of the polyhedron so it doesn’t look like an alien spider.

Motorola is no stranger to folding phones, but the company has so far stuck with clamshell-style handsets, inspired by its iconic ultrathin cellphone. At CES 2026, Motorola announced its first book-style folding smartphone featuring a 6.6-inch outer screen, an 8.1-inch 2K LTPO inner display, a trio of 50-megapixel cameras on the back, a 32-megapixel selfie camera on the front, and a 20-megapixel camera inside. The Verge’s Allison Johnson went hands-on with the new Razr Fold, but couldn’t get Motorola to reveal pricing for when the phone launches in North America this summer.

After releasing a cute donut-shaped wireless charger in December, Ikea announced two new Matter-compatible lighting products at CES 2026 including an upgraded version of its Varmblixt donut lamp. The original version had a glossy reflective finish, but the new Varmblixt has a matte finish to diffuse and accentuate its internal LED lighting. When it launches in April 2026 for $99.99, the smart donut lamp will come with one of Ikea’s new Bilresa remotes that can be used to cycle through 12 color presets. You can also pair the lamp to Ikea’s Dirigera hub and Ikea Home Smart app to gain access to additional color settings.

Most red and infrared light therapy masks are rigid and chunky, making you look like an old-timey hockey goalie ready for a game as you climb into bed. L’Oréal’s new LED face mask is instead made from a thin, lightweight, and flexible material that’s more comfortable and also positions its lighting closer to your face. As a result, instead of having to wear it for 10 to 20 minutes, the company says you only need to wear L’Oréal’s mask for five to 10 minutes to treat lines and wrinkles. Pricing isn’t known, and you’ll have to wait until at least 2027 to buy one, pending FDA clearance.

In addition to new Matter-compatible lamps, Ikea announced a new Bluetooth speaker during its CES debut. Besides its compact size (measuring just 3 inches on its longest side) and striking white, dark pink, and lime green color options, the Kallsup speaker’s most compelling feature will be its $10 price tag when it launches in April 2026. The Kallsup is “surprisingly loud,” according to The Verge’s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, but if you need more decibels you can pair and sync up to 100 of them to fill your entire home with sound.

How does Lenovo plan to top the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 laptop it debuted at CES 2025 with a rollable screen that expands vertically from 14- to 16.7-inches? By turning the feature on its side. Lenovo’s new Pro Rollable gaming laptop’s screen expands horizontally from 16 inches with a 16:10 aspect ratio to an ultrawide 24 inches. It’s based on the Legion Pro 7i and will potentially feature an Intel Core Ultra processor paired with Nvidia’s flagship RTX 5090 laptop GPU, but the Pro Rollable is strictly a concept at this time.

A year ago, Roborock debuted its Saros Z70 robot vacuum at CES 2025 with an articulated robotic arm that could reach in front of the robovac to pick up items like socks instead of running them over. The company’s new Saros Rover vacuum also features appendages, but in the form of two extending legs with wheels the robot can use to climb and clean stairs. A robovac that can clean multiple floors of a home by navigating stairs isn’t a new idea, but the Saros Rover can also clean each step as it climbs — albeit very slowly based on demos at CES 2026. There’s no timeline for a release yet as Roborock says it’s still in development, but the Saros Rover isn’t just a concept.

For the first time since Corsair acquired Elgato in 2018, the company is incorporating Stream Deck controls into a wired mechanical gaming keyboard. The keyboard side of the Corsair Galleon 100 SD has features like an 8,000Hz polling rate and a hot-swappable PCB that uses MLX Pulse switches, while on the other side you’ll find an integrated Stream Deck Plus with 12 customizable buttons, a pair of rotary dials, and a 5-inch multipurpose 720 x 1280 IPS display. It will be available starting on January 29th but is now available for preorder for $349.99.

Originally announced as a concept design at IFA 2024, Lenovo is turning the Auto Twist AI PC into a real laptop, now called the ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist laptop. Like the original, it features a 14-inch screen mounted to a motorized pivoting hinge that can automatically open the laptop for you with a knock on the lid or track your head and adjust its orientation to match your posture or position. You’ll be able to buy one in June with prices starting at $1,649.

Razer thinks headphones, not glasses, are the future of AI wearables, as demonstrated by its Project Motoko concept headphones that The Verge’s Victoria Song tried at CES 2026. Project Motoko looks similar to Razer’s wireless gaming headphones but adds a pair of 4K cameras positioned at eye level, near and far field microphones, and AI. The headphones are powered by an unnamed Qualcomm Snapdragon chip and compatible with major AI models that are used to identify images and sounds, or respond to your requests. Battery life has been tested to up to 36 hours, which eclipses all the AI smart glasses on the market.

Anker’s solution to open-ear wireless headphones that can quiet the world around you is a transforming design that positions the AeroFit 2 Pro’s drivers closer to the ear canal. The new $249.95 Shokz OpenFit Pro take a different approach. Instead of true ANC that requires a sealed ear canal, the open-ear buds offer noise reduction using a triple microphone array, a new speaker design, and an adaptive algorithm that generates audio to dampen unwanted sounds. The Verge’s Victoria Song found they worked surprisingly well and was also impressed with the OpenFit Pro’s improved bass performance, which is one place where open-ear headphones often disappoint.

In need of a lot of pixels and ports on your desk? Dell’s UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor is the world’s first 52-inch 6K display and features a 21:9 aspect ratio, a resolution of up to 6,144 x 2,560 at 120Hz, and a slight curve. It also doubles as a dock and includes two HDMI 2.1 ports, two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, and a bunch of upstream and downstream USB-C and USB-A ports, including a Thunderbolt 4 port that can deliver up to 140W of power. It’s available now for $2,899 with a stand, or $2,799 if you want to provide your own.

Does your butt deserve more than just a comfy place to sit? Razer thinks so and has incorporated several of its existing gaming chair accessories into a proof of concept called Project Madison. It’s like the Frankenstein’s monster of gaming chairs incorporating THX-certified speakers with spatial audio, dual RGB light strips, and six haptic motors in the cushions pulsing force feedback effects into your back and below. There’s no pricing estimates, as Razer hasn’t announced if Project Madison will ever go into production.

Our biggest complaint with the original version of OhSnap’s MCON sliding gamepad is that it makes your phone too thick to slip into a pocket or comfortably carry while it’s attached. That problem is potentially being solved with two new versions that debuted at CES 2026. The $100 MCON Slim uses touchpads instead of thumbsticks, while the $60 MCON Lite uses joysticks similar to what’s found on the Nintendo 3Ds. But neither of the thinner versions features the original’s spring-loaded sliding mechanism, so there’s a definite tradeoff.

The Wolverine V3 BT isn’t just another wireless controller featuring drift-resistant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks. It’s also the world’s first gamepad to use ultra-low latency Bluetooth with a a sub-3ms response time. But there’s a catch. As the first accessory to launch under LG’s “Designed for LG Gaming Portal” program, the Wolverine V3 BT only uses ultra-low latency Bluetooth when connected to an LG TV running webOS 25. All other devices will connect to it using standard Bluetooth. Pricing and availability haven’t been finalized.

New OLED gaming monitors making their debut in 2026 should have clearer and sharper text thanks to panel makers Samsung Display and LG Display now lining up the colors of their subpixels in vertical RGB stripes. The improved OLED panels are already being supplied to companies like MSI, and Gigabyte, and at CES 2026, Asus announced three gaming monitors featuring the new “RGB stripe” screen tech. Pricing and availability aren’t known, but the 27-inch ROG Swift OLED PG27UCWM will also use Tandem OLED tech for increased brightness and longevity, while the 34-inch ROG Swift OLED PG34WCDN and the ROG Strix OLED XG34WCDMS will feature quantum dot OLED panels.

Smart door locks that conveniently automatically unlock as you approach aren’t a new idea, but they typically rely on a mix of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, geofencing, and apps that are frequently unreliable. Aqara’s new $269.99 U400 smart deadbolt lock is the first to work with Apple’s Home Key’s hands-free unlocking using the U1 ultra-wideband (UWB) chip found in many iPhones and Apple Watches, without the need for a special app. The Verge’s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy had the chance to test the new smart lock for a week and found it “worked every time without any waiting,” making it a “significant upgrade” for their front door.

Although it’s currently just an R&D concept, Samsung Display showcased a new folding OLED panel that doesn’t have the visible crease that every foldable phone on the market exhibits when they’re opened. Samsung Display has been a longtime panel provider for Apple, so could this be the OLED screen that will be used in the rumored foldable iPhone?

Acer announced several new laptops at CES 2026, but the standout is its Swift 16 AI featuring what the company claims is the world’s largest haptic trackpad. It will give your fingers a good workout as they slide back and forth across its wide expanse, but the laptop includes a stylus, turning the trackpad into a tablet for sketching or annotating documents. The Swift 16 AI will be available with Intel Panther Lake chips (up to the Core Ultra X9 388H), plenty of ports, and an optional OLED display when it launches in Q1 2026.

Want the portability of a laptop without the cramped keyboard? HP crammed an entire mini desktop computer into its new Eliteboard G1a keyboard, including an AMD Ryzen AI 300-series chip, stereo speakers, RAM, storage, a cooling fan, and ports. It can be connected to up to two 4K displays using a daisy-chain connection and paired to a Bluetooth mouse. Pricing hasn’t been announced, but the G1a is expected to launch in March.

Samsung debuted one of the more impressive TVs at CES this year with a monstrous 130-inch Micro RGB TV featuring a frame designed to “appear less like a television and more like a vast, immersive window that visually expands the room,” according to a release from the company. Pricing and availability haven’t been announced, but the TV will most likely be one of those upgrades that if you have to ask how much it costs, it’s probably not in your budget.

Lego doesn’t regularly exhibit at CES, but at this year’s show it announced its new Smart Play platform that’s debuting in three new Star Wars building sets in March. The platform relies on a new 2x4 Lego Smart Brick featuring interactive LED lighting, wireless connectivity, a speaker, microphone, and various sensors that can detect light, movements, tilting, and gestures. The Smart Brick works alongside NFC-equipped smart tags (Lego tile pieces) and minifigures to enable new interactive play opportunities. You can use the Smart Brick to trigger crash sounds when a Lego racecar flips over, for example, or start playing The Imperial March when the new Emperor Palpatine figure is placed on his throne.

Using an adjustable ear-hook design that repositions the drivers at the entrance of your ear canal, the Soundcore AeroFit 2 Pro are one of the first wireless open-ear headphones that can be converted to an earbuds mode with active noise cancellation. You have the option of naturally hearing the world around you along with your music or podcasts, or blocking out your environment entirely. They’re available now through Anker’s online store for $179.99, but battery life maxes out at just 7 hours with the headphones alone, or up to 34 when paired with their charging case.

Amazon is jumping on the art TV bandwagon with its new 4K edge-lit LED Ember Artline TV. Available this spring in 55 to 65-inch sizes starting at $899, the TV has a matte finish to make photos and artwork look less like a screen and more like artwork hanging on your wall. Amazon is giving customers their choice of 10 different frame styles to help match their room, while the TV can provide personalized recommendations for artwork that will best match the decor based on photos of the room where it’s installed.

Anker’s latest floor-mopping robovac will make your home smell better one way or another. Launching later this month for $1,599, the Eufy S2 is rated at up to 30,000Pa of suction, uses AI-powered obstacle detection and real-time 3D mapping to navigate your home and avoid obstacles, and has a retractable mop head that cleans itself with electrolyzed water. If that doesn’t alleviate bad smells, the Eufy S2 can instead mask them using a built-in aromatherapy dispenser with scents that include citrus, bamboo, basil, or sage.

Samsung hasn’t changed much with the design of its third-generation Freestyle projector. The new Freestyle Plus still looks like an oversize soda can and features an integrated stand, speakers, and Wi-Fi. But it’s nearly twice as bright as its predecessor at 430 ISO lumens, and it’s getting a host of new AI-powered automatic adjustment features. We got to try them out at CES 2026 and were impressed with the Freestyle Plus’ ability to automatically correct its alignment when projected on challenging surfaces like the corner of a room or even a wavy curtain.

8BitDo originally made a name for itself with budget-friendly but well-featured alternatives to Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft’s controllers. It’s still very good at that, but 8BitDo’s new Ultimate 3E Controller for Xbox will be its most expensive gamepad when it launches in Q2 of 2026 for $149.99 and one of its most customizable. If tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks, Hall effect triggers with adjustable stops, and official Xbox support (using a USB dongle) aren’t enough to sell you on the 3E, it also comes with interchangeable button modules letting you choose between membrane buttons and clicky micro switches.

First announced last month, The Verge’s Allison Johnson finally got some hands-on time with the Galaxy Z TriFold that uses a pair of inward-folding hinges to expand from a chunky phone to a large tablet. For now it’s only available in Korea, but the Z TriFold is expected to be available in the US sometime in Q1 2026 for what will most likely be a hefty chunk of change. Its biggest selling point, according to Johnson, is the potential to carry around a laptop replacement in your pocket. “The thing that makes the TriFold feel like it could finally be The One — the one device you can carry around, leaving all others behind — is none other than DeX. On the TriFold, DeX isn’t just a desktop environment when you pair it with an external display. It’s a whole standalone mode with windowing to your heart’s content.”

If you always seem to remember what groceries you need after you get home from the store, GE Appliances’ new package-scanning fridge can help you create a comprehensive shopping list. Launching in April 2026 for $4,899, the GE Profile Smart 4-Door French-Door Refrigerator with Kitchen Assistant has a scanner on the front you can use to scan empty packages, and you can manually add items to a shopping list using an 8-inch tablet on the door. There’s even a camera inside the fridge you can remotely access through an app to check if you’ve run out of something while you’re shopping.

Clicks is best known for its smartphone cases that add a physical BlackBerry-style compact keyboard. Its latest creation has that same keyboard, but also a 4.03-inch OLED screen, front and rear cameras, a headphone jack, and a 5G data connection, and it runs Android 16. The Clicks Communicator is designed to be an alternative to your daily driver smartphone that you can limit to essential apps to minimize distractions. At $499 it’s priced similarly to the Pixel 9A, but you can reserve one now for a limited time to get a discount.

As TCL and Hisense have done, LG is looking to usurp the dominance of Samsung’s The Frame in the art TV category. Its new LG Gallery TV leverages the company’s Gallery+ service that launched earlier this year to display everything from art to gaming scenes. The Gallery TV is a mini-LED TV with what is likely a matte coating, but LG describes it as having a “specialized screen that reduces glare and minimizes reflections for an art-like viewing experience.” It comes with a white frame, and while you can purchase additional wood-colored frames, pricing for the LG Gallery TV hasn’t been announced.

LG’s CLOiD is a home robot that can potentially do more than just clean your floors. The robot features a pair of articulated arms with seven degrees of motion mounted to a mobile base with a torso that can tilt and bend. LG says CLOiD can perform household tasks like folding and stacking laundry, putting food in the oven, or fetching something from your fridge. Can it do that faster or more reliably than you can? That remains to be seen, but CLOiD could be even more useful as a mobile smart home hub you can converse with as it follows you around the house.

Samsung’s Family Hub smart fridges aren’t new, but the company will soon be introducing a new feature for added convenience: voice-activated door opening and closing. When your hands are full of groceries, or are dirty while you’re whipping up a meal, you’ll be able to ask Bixby to “Shut the fridge door,” or “Open the door,” and it will open over 90 degrees giving you full access. If your mouth is full of food and you can’t properly articulate what you want, the door can also be opened or closed using a tap of your palm or the back of your hand.

If you pulled a Honey, I Shrunk the Kids on the Las Vegas Sphere, you’d end up with something like SwitchBot’s new dome-shaped Obboto RGB desk lamp. It’s wrapped in over 2,900 color-changing LEDs and can display preset animations, animated GIFs, AI-powered “mood animations,” music visualizers, or just the local weather and time if you want to be practical. Pricing and availability haven’t been announced yet.

Petkit’s new automatic pet feeder that can dole out up to seven days of wet food isn’t just about alleviating guilt about leaving your furry friend behind while you travel. The Yumshare Daily Feast uses an NFC tracking system to remove meals that haven’t been eaten in 48 hours and UVC lighting to sanitize the system for delivering fresh ones. What’s potentially even more useful is an AI-powered 1080p night vision camera that tracks when and how much your pet eats to provide insights on their diet and possible health issues. It’s expected to launch in April 2026 and will be sold through pet food companies.

Six years after its first Wallpaper TV debuted in 2017, LG has revived the line with its new LG OLED evo W6. The TV is 9mm thick thanks to its redesigned internal architecture and features a new mount so it can sit completely flush against a wall. Further improving installation is the W6’s use of LG’s Zero Connect Box which wireless sends a video signal from up to 33 feet away. The only physical cable you need to route to the W6 is for power. It will be available in 77 and 83-inch sizes.

GameSir may have already clinched the title for weirdest controller at CES 2026. The company shared more details about its upcoming Swift Drive gamepad that features a small steering wheel in the middle of the controller. The wheel’s connected to a high-precision Hall effect encoder and an equally small direct drive motor that provides force feedback effects while playing racing games and sims. There are additional haptic motors located in the gamepad’s Hall effect triggers to simulate effects like ABS braking, and it’s got RGB lighting effects that can be synced to your game. Pricing and availability haven’t been revealed yet.

It’s not quite as adorable as the furry Mirumi robot that debuted at last year’s CES, but Yukai Engineering’s new Baby FuFu is potentially more practical. It looks like a cuddly cat that’s huffing and puffing and features an internal fan that will keep young kids cool while preventing tiny fingers from reaching any dangerous moving parts. It’s expected to arrive in mid-2026 for $50 to $60.

Update, January 9th: Added new announcements from the show.

            <div id="article-text">CES is a lot — a deluge of consumer tech surrounded by lots of bad carpeting. The Verge’s on-the-ground team of super nerds covered so many new products and technologies that it’s understandable if it was all a little overwhelming.

That’s why we’ve gathered up a collection of trend reports from the show to help make sense of everything that happened at CES 2026, which, by extension, is a preview of the big tech stories for the year to come.

This is Optimizer, a weekly newsletter sent every Friday from Verge senior reviewer Victoria Song that dissects and discusses the latest phones, smartwatches, apps, and other gizmos that swear they’re going to change your life.

At CES 2026 this week, people kept asking me what health tech I was seeing on the show floor. My only answer was this: bodily fluids. As in urine, blood, sweat, and saliva.

You can’t shake a stick without hitting an AI gadget at CES this year, with artificial smarts now embedded in just about every wearable, screen, and appliance across the show floor, not to mention the armies of AI companions, toys, and robots.

But those are just the beginning. We’ve seen AI pop up in much stranger places too, from hair clippers to stick vacs, and at least one case where even the manufacturer itself seemed unsure what made its products “AI.”

This is Lowpass by Janko Roettgers, a newsletter on the ever-evolving intersection of tech and entertainment, syndicated just for The Verge subscribers once a week.

Every year, TV makers flock to CES in Las Vegas to show off bigger, brighter, and better-looking displays. And every year, the same companies also use the show to throw a bunch of spaghetti against the wall as they try to figure out how to sell those big TV sets to consumers busy watching TikTok videos on their phones.

CES is a land of bold announcements of amazing, innovative products and technologies that will revolutionize the world, often set for release in two years’ time. Twenty-four months seems to be about the right hype window: close enough to generate excitement and investment, but far enough that everyone forgets about your promises before that deadline quietly comes and goes.

It was CES 2018 when Henrik Fisker made such a proclamation, saying that his team of gurus had cracked the code of solid-state batteries. By 2020, he said, those batteries would be in mass production. The car was the EMotion, which never did come to market. By 2021, the company had given up on the solid-state dream, and by 2024, the whole operation went bust.

The personal computer has remained surprisingly resilient to change over the past 15 years. Apple promised a “post-PC” era with the iPad in 2010 and failed to deliver one. Smartphones even overtook laptops as the most popular device to connect to the internet a decade ago, but millions of people still kept buying PCs every year. But this PC resiliency is going to be tested even further this year.

RAM and NAND / SSD prices have surged in recent months due to shortages created by AI data center demand. Some stores have had to sell memory like it’s lobster, prebuilt PC costs have risen, and some assemblers are even selling PCs without RAM.

For all the time that I’ve been covering technology, there’s been a hierarchy when it comes to TV brands. The big three — Sony, Samsung, and LG — have been on top for a while. Pioneer and Panasonic were up there with plasma TVs, and Panasonic is getting back in the game in the States. Hisense, TCL, and Vizio battled it out as midrange tiers for years before Vizio pivoted from hardware profits to an ad-centric model under Walmart, leaving the other two to one-up each other by offering the most bang for the buck.

But over the past couple years, both TCL and Hisense have made impressive strides in performance, bringing them closer and closer to Sony, Samsung, and LG. And it’s not just that they made incremental improvements; both companies have been innovating and leading with technology. Hisense was the first company to debut an RGB LED TV last year (other companies were developing the technology, but Hisense showed it first). And this year TCL’s X11L leads the way as the first TV with reformulated quantum dots and a new color filter.

There are some things you can reliably expect to see at the Consumer Electronics Show every year. Companies will announce big splashy TVs, there’s going to be a bunch of new gadgets for charging your other gadgets, and the odds are good that a robot or two is going to hilariously malfunction.

But CES always manages to sneak in a few surprises, whether with what has been announced, what hasn’t made an appearance, and trends that no one saw coming. We’ve rounded up the biggest CES 2026 curveballs so far.

The first Wi-Fi 8 routers and chips made a surprise appearance at CES 2026, and could launch this year, only a couple of years after Wi-Fi 7 debuted. So, if you don’t already have a Wi-Fi 7 router — and many of us don’t — you might want to consider holding off on upgrading.

Rather than focusing on speed upgrades, Wi-Fi 8 promises improved stability. It offers the high speeds and bandwidth of Wi-Fi 7, but with improved power efficiency, higher throughput, and better peer-to-peer communication between devices. Wi-Fi 8 is also better at maintaining fast, stable connections when users are moving devices around, or moving them further away from their router. As a result, Wi-Fi 8 users will experience less “dropping out” or freezing and better streaming and gaming performance.

If you listen to the CES hype machine this year, you might think that robots are finally ready to take over your domestic duties. To some extent that’s true, but take note of the plural: there’s no single robot ready to take over all of your household chores yet, but an army of them just might.

You might have had one of these single-purpose robots in your home for years already, of course. Robot vacuum cleaners have long been capable of automating a single, specific task, and it’s no surprise that it’s the same companies behind those bots pushing home robots forward now.

Artificial intelligence doesn’t always want to optimize your life or steal your job. Sometimes, AI just wants to be your friend. And while robot pets weren’t the biggest stars of CES 2026, they’ve become more than just noise and are signaling how AI is apparently leaving our screens and taking on a physical presence in our lives.

To be clear, there’s no shortage of purpose-built machines on display in Las Vegas: there’s Samsung’s voice-controlled refrigerator, Bosch’s Alexa Plus-powered AI barista, and smarter robovacs like Narwal’s earring-finding Flow 2 or Anker’s Eufy S2, which moonlights as an aromatherapy diffuser – all promising to automate the drudgery of daily life. Humanoid robots like LG’s CLOiD and SwitchBot’s Onero H1 stole much of the spotlight, too, taking that logic a step further by promising more general-purpose helpers around the home — or the factory floor, in the case of Boston Dynamics’ Atlas — even if they remain years away from everyday use.

There was a time not too long ago when buying a power bank was as easy as choosing the cheapest portable battery that could charge your phone and quickly slip into your pocket, purse, or backpack. The hardest part was deciding whether it was time to ditch USB-A ports.

Recently, however, brands have been slathering on features, many of which are superfluous, in an attempt to both stand out from the commodified pack and justify higher price points. It’s especially prevalent amongst the bigger power banks that can also charge laptops, those that butt right up to the “airline friendly” 99Wh (around 27,650mAh) size limit.

It’s a beautiful, cloudless day in San Francisco, and I’m sitting in the passenger seat of a Mercedes-Benz CLA sedan. The driver, Lucas, has his hands on the steering wheel, but it’s really just for show: the car is essentially driving itself.

The vehicle is using Mercedes’ new Drive Assist Pro, a point-to-point Level 2 (L2) driver-assist system that is powered by Nvidia and getting ready to roll out to more automakers in 2026. This is the chipmaker’s big bet on driving automation, one it thinks can help grow its tiny automotive business into something more substantial and more profitable. Think of it as Nvidia’s answer to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving.

New OLED gaming monitors from top companies coming out this year should look clearer and crisper. LG Display and Samsung Display, which typically provide the actual panels used in gaming monitors, are finally lining up the colors of their subpixels in vertical RGB stripes — remember when we used to worry about Pentile OLED displays? — which means, among other improvements, the panels should have easier-to-read text.

You can see for yourself how Asus and MSI are touting changes to their upcoming monitors with Stripe RGB technology — for Asus, with the ROG Swift OLED PG27UCWM, ROG Swift OLED PG34WCDN, and ROG Strix OLED XG34WCDMS, and for MSI, with the MEG X and MPG 341CQR QD-OLED X36:

            <div id="article-text">X’s sexual deepfake machine is still running, despite Grok saying otherwise.

X’s sexual deepfake machine is still running, despite Grok saying otherwise.

Elon Musk’s X has partially restricted access to Grok’s image editing capabilities amid growing backlash to the flood of nonconsensual, sexualized deepfakes of adults and minors generated by the platform. As of this writing, it no longer generates images as @grok replies for free, but Grok’s image editing tools remain readily available for any X user to churn out images, both sexualized and tame.

X users were previously able to ask Grok — by tagging @grok in a tweet — to edit or create images on the platform. Users now attempting this are met with an automated response from the chatbot’s account, telling them that “Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers.” The reply includes a link encouraging them to subscribe to X’s paid programs “to unlock these features.”

The message gives the impression that only paid X users can edit or create images using Grok. That message is reinforced in the many headlines circulating right now stating that xAI, another Musk company that makes Grok, has restricted Grok’s image editing abilities to this select group of users. But that impression is false. All X users — including free ones — can still use Grok to edit and create images, including the sexually suggestive deepfakes that landed Grok in hot water to begin with.

Interacting with Grok through replies on X is just one of several ways to use the AI chatbot. For example, the “Edit image” button still invokes Grok on every image displayed on X’s desktop website, and that same button can be accessed on the X app by long-pressing on any image. Grok can also be accessed through a standalone website or app, as well as via a highly promoted tab in the X apps and X website. These remain readily available to free users, and require no additional effort compared to the @grok command.

The Verge tested the Grok website, app, and X tab with free accounts and Grok readily complied with our requests to edit or generate a variety of images, including a full “nudify” and one of Musk wearing a bikini.

The restrictions on X come after Grok has been used to generate sexual images primarily of women, many of them real, as well as minors. Much of this landed on X, which the Financial Times dubbed “the deepfake porn site formerly known as Twitter.” The deepfake undressings, as well as other sexual material, have outraged regulators worldwide, who have threatened to take action against X, though the deepfakes may fall into something of a legal void.

An unnamed spokesperson for the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who on Thursday said he would not tolerate the situation, said that putting the deepfake factory behind a paywall wasn’t a solution. “The move simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service. It’s not a solution. In fact, it’s insulting to victims of misogyny and sexual violence.”

Musk and xAI have also threatened to take action against users who create illegal content using Grok, rather than ensuring that guardrails exist to make it impossible to create it in the first place.

X’s approach — limiting access rather than constraining use — contrasts with the approach taken by other AI companies like Google and OpenAI, which tend to impose strict guardrails on tools like Gemini and ChatGPT, rather than allow free rein for those who pay. Musk has reportedly opposed stricter guardrails personally, and several members of xAI’s already sparse safety team reportedly quit in the lead up to the deluge of digital undressings.

X did not respond to The Verge’s request for comment.

Update, January 9th: Added comment from spokesperson for UK Prime Minister.

How I learned to stop worrying and love AI slop

If I were to locate the moment AI slop broke through into popular consciousness, I’d pick the video of rabbits bouncing on a trampoline that went viral last summer. For many savvy internet users, myself included, it was the first time we were fooled by an AI video, and it ended up spawning a wave of almost identical generated clips.

My first reaction was that, broadly speaking, all of this sucked. That’s become a familiar refrain, in think pieces and at dinner parties. Everything online is slop now—the internet “enshittified,” with AI taking much of the blame. Initially, I largely agreed. But then friends started sharing AI clips in group chats that were compellingly weird, or funny. Some even had a grain of brilliance.

I had to admit I didn’t fully understand what I was rejecting—what I found so objectionable. To try to get to the bottom of how I felt (and why), I spoke to the people making the videos, a company creating bespoke tools for creators, and experts who study how new media becomes culture. What I found convinced me that maybe generative AI will not end up ruining everything after all. Read the full story.

A new CRISPR startup is betting regulators will ease up on gene-editingHere at MIT Technology Review we’ve been writing about the gene-editing technology CRISPR since 2013, calling it the biggest biotech breakthrough of the century. Yet so far, there’s been only one gene-editing drug approved, and it’s been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease.It’s becoming clear that the impact of CRISPR isn’t as big as we all hoped. In fact, there’s a pall of discouragement over the entire field—with some journalists saying the gene-editing revolution has “lost its mojo.”So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments which could avoid costly new trials or approvals for every new version. Read the full story.

America’s new dietary guidelines ignore decades of scientific research

The first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Wednesday, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. Let’s take a look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.

How to measure the returns on R&D spendingGiven the draconian cuts to US federal funding for science, it’s worth asking some hard-nosed money questions: How much should we be spending on R&D? How much value do we get out of such investments, anyway?To answer that, in several recent papers, economists have approached this issue in clever new ways.  And, though they ask slightly different questions, their conclusions share a bottom line: R&D is, in fact, one of the better long-term investments that the government can make.

            <div id="article-text">Here at MIT Technology Review we’ve been writing about the gene-editing technology CRISPR since 2013, calling it the biggest biotech breakthrough of the century. Yet so far, there’s been only one gene-editing drug approved. It’s been used commercially on only about 40 patients, all with sickle-cell disease.

It’s becoming clear that the impact of CRISPR isn’t as big as we all hoped. In fact, there’s a pall of discouragement over the entire field—with some journalists saying the gene-editing revolution has “lost its mojo.”

So what will it take for CRISPR to help more people? A new startup says the answer could be an “umbrella approach” to testing and commercializing treatments. Aurora Therapeutics, which has $16 million from Menlo Ventures and counts CRISPR co-inventor Jennifer Doudna as an advisor, essentially hopes to win approval for gene-editing drugs that can be slightly adjusted, or personalized, without requiring costly new trials or approvals for every new version.

The need to change regulations around gene-editing treatments was endorsed in November by the head of the US Food and Drug Administration, Martin Makary, who said the agency would open a “new” regulatory pathway for “bespoke, personalized therapies” that can’t easily be tested in conventional ways.

Aurora’s first target, the rare inherited disease phenylketonuria, also known as PKU, is a case in point. People with PKU lack a working version of an enzyme needed to use up the amino acid phenylalanine, a component of pretty much all meat and protein. If the amino acid builds up, it causes brain damage. So patients usually go on an onerous “diet for life” of special formula drinks and vegetables.

In theory, gene editing can fix PKU. In mice, scientists have already restored the gene for the enzyme by rewriting DNA in liver cells, which both make the enzyme and are some of the easiest to reach with a gene-editing drug. The problem is that in human patients, many different mutations can affect the critical gene. According to Cory Harding, a researcher at Oregon Health Sciences University, scientists know about 1,600 different DNA mutations that cause PKU.

There’s no way anyone will develop 1,600 different gene-editing drugs. Instead, Aurora’s goal is to eventually win approval for a single gene editor that, with minor adjustments, could be used to correct several of the most common mutations, including one that’s responsible for about 10% of the estimated 20,000 PKU cases in the US.

“We can’t have a separate clinical trial for each mutation,” says Edward Kaye, the CEO of Aurora. “The way the FDA approves gene editing has to change, and I think they’ve been very understanding that is the case.”

A gene editor is a special protein that can zero in on a specific location in the genome and change it. To prepare one, Aurora will put genetic code for the editor into a nanoparticle along with a targeting molecule. In total, it will involve about 5,000 gene letters. But only 20 of them need to change in order to redirect the treatment to repair a different mutation.

“Over 99% of the drug stays the same,” says Johnny Hu, a partner at Menlo Ventures, which put up the funding for the startup.

The new company came together after Hu met over pizza with Fyodor Urnov, an outspoken gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is Aurora’s cofounder and sits on its board.

In 2022, Urnov had written a New York Times editorial bemoaning the “chasm” between what editing technology can do and the “legal, financial, and organizational” realities preventing researchers from curing people.

“I went to Fyodor and said, ‘Hey, we’re getting all these great results in the clinic with CRISPR, but why hasn’t it scaled?” says Hu. Part of the reason is that most gene-editing companies are chasing the same few conditions, such as sickle-cell, where (as luck would have it) a single edit works for all patients. But that leaves around 400 million people who have 7,000 other inherited conditions without much hope to get their DNA fixed, Urnov estimated in his editorial.

Then, last May, came the dramatic demonstration of the first fully “personalized” gene-editing treatment. A team in Philadelphia, assisted by Urnov and others, succeeded in correcting the DNA of a baby, named KJ Muldoon, who had an entirely unique mutation that caused a metabolic disease. Though it didn’t target PKU, the project showed that gene editing could theoretically fix some inherited diseases “on demand.”

It also underscored a big problem. Treating a single child required a large team and cost millions in time, effort, and materials—all to create a drug that would never be used again.

That’s exactly the sort of situation the new “umbrella” trials are supposed to address. Kiran Musunuru, who co-led the team at the University of Pennsylvania, says he’s been in discussions with the FDA to open a study of bespoke gene editors this year focusing on diseases of the type Baby KJ had, called urea cycle disorders. Each time a new patient appears, he says, they’ll try to quickly put together a variant of their gene-editing drug that’s tuned to fix that child’s particular genetic problem.

Musunuru, who isn’t involved with Aurora, does not think the company’s plans for PKU count as fully personalized editors. “These corporate PKU efforts have nothing whatsoever to do with Baby KJ,” he says. He says his center continues to focus on mutations “so ultra-rare that we don’t see any scenario where a for-profit gene-editing company would find that indication to be commercially viable.”

Instead, what’s occurring in PKU, says Musunuru, is that researchers have realized they can assemble “a bunch” of the most frequent mutations “into a large enough group of patients to make a platform PKU therapy commercially viable.”

While that would still leave out many patients with extra-rare gene errors, Musunuru says any gene-editing treatment at all would still be “a big improvement over the status quo, which  is zero genetic therapies for PKU.”

            <h2>America’s new dietary guidelines ignore decades of scientific research</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1130905/americas-diet-guidelines-ignore-scientific-research-red-meat-beef-tallow/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The new year has barely begun, but the first days of 2026 have brought big news for health. On Monday, the US’s federal health agency upended its recommendations for routine childhood vaccinations—a move that health associations worry puts children at unnecessary risk of preventable disease.

There was more news from the federal government on Wednesday, when health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his colleagues at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled new dietary guidelines for Americans. And they are causing a bit of a stir.

That’s partly because they recommend products like red meat, butter, and beef tallow—foods that have been linked to cardiovascular disease, and that nutrition experts have been recommending people limit in their diets.

These guidelines are a big deal—they influence food assistance programs and school lunches, for example. So this week let’s look at the good, the bad, and the ugly advice being dished up to Americans by their government.

The government dietary guidelines have been around since the 1980s. They are updated every five years, in a process that typically involves a team of nutrition scientists who have combed over scientific research for years. That team will first publish its findings in a scientific report, and, around a year later, the finalized Dietary Guidelines for Americans are published.

The last guidelines covered the period 2020 to 2025, and new guidelines were expected in the summer of 2025. Work had already been underway for years; the scientific report intended to inform them was published back in 2024. But the publication of the guidelines was delayed by last year’s government shutdown, Kennedy said last year. They were finally published yesterday.

Nutrition experts had been waiting with bated breath. Nutrition science has evolved slightly over the last five years, and some were expecting to see new recommendations. Research now suggests, for example, that there is no “safe” level of alcohol consumption.

We are also beginning to learn more about health risks associated with some ultraprocessed foods (although we still don’t have a good understanding of what they might be, or what even counts as “ultraprocessed”.) And some scientists were expecting to see the new guidelines factor in environmental sustainability, says Gabby Headrick, the associate director of food and nutrition policy at George Washington University’s Institute for Food Safety & Nutrition Security in Washington DC.

Many of the recommendations are sensible. The guidelines recommend a diet rich in whole foods, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. They recommend avoiding highly processed foods and added sugars. They also highlight the importance of dietary protein, whole grains, and “healthy” fats.

But not all of them are, says Headrick. The guidelines open with a “new pyramid” of foods. This inverted triangle is topped with “protein, dairy, and healthy fats” on one side and “vegetables and fruits” on the other.

There are a few problems with this image. For starters, its shape—nutrition scientists have long moved on from the food pyramids of the 1990s, says Headrick. They’re confusing and make it difficult for people to understand what the contents of their plate should look like. That’s why scientists now use an image of a plate to depict a healthy diet.

“We&#39;ve been using MyPlate to describe the dietary guidelines in a very consumer-friendly, nutrition-education-friendly way for over the last decade now,” says Headrick. (The UK’s National Health Service takes a similar approach.)

And then there’s the content of that food pyramid. It puts a significant focus on meat and whole-fat dairy produce. The top left image—the one most viewers will probably see first—is of a steak. Smack in the middle of the pyramid is a stick of butter. That’s new. And it’s not a good thing.

While both red meat and whole-fat dairy can certainly form part of a healthy diet, nutrition scientists have long been recommending that most people try to limit their consumption of these foods. Both can be high in saturated fat, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease—the leading cause of death in the US. In 2015, on the basis of limited evidence, the World Health Organization classified red meat as “probably carcinogenic to humans.”

Also concerning is the document’s definition of “healthy fats,” which includes butter and beef tallow (a MAHA favorite). Neither food is generally considered to be as healthy as olive oil, for example. While olive oil contains around two grams of saturated fat per tablespoon, a tablespoon of beef tallow has around six grams of saturated fat, and the same amount of butter contains around seven grams of saturated fat, says Headrick.

“I think these are pretty harmful dietary recommendations to be making when we have established that those specific foods likely do not have health-promoting benefits,” she adds.

Red meat is not exactly a sustainable food, and neither are dairy products. And the advice on alcohol is relatively vague, recommending that people “consume less alcohol for better overall health” (which might leave you wondering: Less than what?).

There are other questionable recommendations in the guidelines. Americans are advised to include more protein in their diets—at levels between 1.2 and 1.6 grams daily per kilo of body weight, 50% to 100% more than recommended in previous guidelines. There’s a risk that increasing protein consumption to such levels could raise a person’s intake of both calories and saturated fats to unhealthy levels, says José Ordovás, a senior nutrition scientist at Tufts University. “I would err on the low side,” he says.

Some nutrition scientists are questioning why these changes have been made. It’s not as though the new recommendations were in the 2024 scientific report. And the evidence on red meat and saturated fat hasn’t changed, says Headrick.

In reporting this piece, I contacted many contributors to the previous guidelines, and some who had led research for 2024’s scientific report. None of them agreed to comment on the new guidelines on the record. Some seemed disgruntled. One merely told me that the process by which the new guidelines had been created was “opaque.”

“These people invested a lot of their time, and they did a thorough job [over] a couple of years, identifying [relevant scientific studies],” says Ordovás. “I’m not surprised that when they see that [their] work was ignored and replaced with something [put together] quickly, that they feel a little bit disappointed,” he says.

Researchers are getting organoids pregnant with human embryos

At first glance, it looks like the start of a human pregnancy: A ball-shaped embryo presses into the lining of the uterus then grips tight, burrowing in as the first tendrils of a future placenta appear. This is implantation—the moment that pregnancy officially begins.

Only none of it is happening inside a body. These images were captured in a Beijing laboratory, inside a microfluidic chip, as scientists watched the scene unfold.

In three recent papers published by Cell Press, scientists report what they call the most accurate efforts yet to mimic the first moments of pregnancy in the lab. They’ve taken human embryos from IVF centers and let these merge with “organoids” made of endometrial cells, which form the lining of the uterus. Read our story about their work, and what might come next.

LLMs contain a LOT of parameters. But what’s a parameter?

A large language model’s parameters are often said to be the dials and levers that control how it behaves. Think of a planet-size pinball machine that sends its balls pinging from one end to the other via billions of paddles and bumpers set just so. Tweak those settings and the balls will behave in a different way.

OpenAI’s GPT-3, released in 2020, had 175 billion parameters. Google DeepMind’s latest LLM, Gemini 3, may have at least a trillion—some think it’s probably more like 7 trillion—but the company isn’t saying. (With competition now fierce, AI firms no longer share information about how their models are built.)

But the basics of what parameters are and how they make LLMs do the remarkable things that they do are the same across different models. Ever wondered what makes an LLM really tick—what’s behind the colorful pinball-machine metaphors? Let’s dive in.

What new legal challenges mean for the future of US offshore wind

For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? Concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the US’s struggling offshore wind industry.

            <h2>Using unstructured data to fuel enterprise AI success</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-08</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/08/1129506/using-unstructured-data-to-fuel-enterprise-ai-success/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Enterprises are sitting on vast quantities of unstructured data, from call records and video footage to customer complaint histories and supply chain signals. Yet this invaluable business intelligence, estimated to make up as much as 90% of the data generated by organizations, historically remained dormant because its unstructured nature makes analysis extremely difficult.

But if managed and centralized effectively, this messy and often voluminous data is not only a precious asset for training and optimizing next-generation AI systems, enhancing their accuracy, context, and adaptability, it can also deliver profound insights that drive real business outcomes.

A compelling example of this can be seen in the US NBA basketball team the Charlotte Hornets who successfully leveraged untapped video footage of gameplay—previously too copious to watch and too unstructured to analyze—to identify a new competition-winning recruit. However, before that data could deliver results, analysts working for the team first had to overcome the critical challenge of preparing the raw, unstructured footage for interpretation.

Unstructured data presents inherent difficulties due to its widely varying format, quality, and reliability, requiring specialized tools like natural language processing and AI to make sense of it.

Every organization’s pool of unstructured data also contains domain-specific characteristics and terminology that generic AI models may not automatically understand. A financial services firm, for example, cannot simply use a general language model for fraud detection. Instead, it needs to adapt the model to understand regulatory language, transaction patterns, industry-specific risk indicators, and unique company context like data policies.

The challenge intensifies when integrating multiple data sources with varying structures and quality standards, as teams may struggle to distinguish valuable data from noise.

When the Charlotte Hornets set out to identify a new draft pick for their team, they turned to AI tools including computer vision to analyze raw game footage from smaller leagues, which exist outside the tiers of the game normally visible to NBA scouts and, therefore, are not as readily available for analysis.

“Computer vision is a tool that has existed for some time, but I think the applicability in this age of AI is increasing rapidly,” says Jordan Cealey, senior vice president at AI company Invisible Technologies, which worked with the Charlotte Hornets on this project. “You can now take data sources that you&#39;ve never been able to consume, and provide an analytical layer that&#39;s never existed before.”

By deploying a variety of computer vision techniques, including object and player tracking, movement pattern analysis, and geometrically mapping points on the court, the team was able to extract kinematic data, such as the coordinates of players during movement, and generate metrics like speed and explosiveness to acceleration.

This provided the team with rich, data-driven insights about individual players, helping them to identify and select a new draft whose skill and techniques filled a hole in the Charlotte Hornets’ own capabilities. The chosen athlete went on to be named the most valuable player at the 2025 NBA Summer League and helped the team win their first summer championship title.

Before data from game footage can be used, it needs to be labeled so the model can interpret it. The x and y coordinates of the individual players, seen here in bounding boxes, as well as other features in the scene, are annotated so the model can identify individuals and track their movements through time.

From this successful example, several lessons can be learned. First, unstructured data must be prepared for AI models through intuitive forms of collection, and the right data pipelines and management records. “You can only utilize unstructured data once your structured data is consumable and ready for AI,” says Cealey. “You cannot just throw AI at a problem without doing the prep work.”

For many organizations, this might mean they need to find partners that offer the technical support to fine-tune models to the context of the business. The traditional technology consulting approach, in which an external vendor leads a digital transformation plan over a lengthy timeframe, is not fit for purpose here as AI is moving too fast and solutions need to be configured to a company’s current business reality.

Forward-deployed engineers (FDEs) are an emerging partnership model better suited to the AI era. Initially popularized by Palantir, the FDE model connects product and engineering capabilities directly to the customer’s operational environment. FDEs work closely with customers on-site to understand the context behind a technology initiative before a solution is built.

“We couldn&#39;t do what we do without our FDEs,” says Cealey. “They go out and fine-tune the models, working with our human annotation team to generate a ground truth dataset that can be used to validate or improve the performance of the model in production.”

Second, data needs to be understood within its own context, which requires models to be carefully calibrated to the use case. “You can&#39;t assume that an out-of-the-box computer vision model is going to give you better inventory management, for example, by taking that open source model and applying it to whatever your unstructured data feeds are,” says Cealey. “You need to fine-tune it so it gives you the data exports in the format you want and helps your aims. That&#39;s where you start to see high-performative models that can then actually generate useful data insights.”

For the Hornets, Invisible used five foundation models, which the team fine-tuned to context-specific data. This included teaching the models to understand that they were “looking at” a basketball court as opposed to, say, a football field; to understand how a game of basketball works differently from any other sport the model might have knowledge of (including how many players are on each team); and to understand how to spot rules like “out of bounds.” Once fine-tuned, the models were able to capture subtle and complex visual scenarios, including highly accurate object detection, tracking, postures, and spatial mapping.

Lastly, while the AI technology mix available to companies changes by the day, they cannot eschew old-fashioned commercial metrics: clear goals. Without clarity on the business purpose, AI pilot programs can easily turn into open-ended, meandering research projects that prove expensive in terms of compute, data costs, and staffing.

“The best engagements we have seen are when people know what they want,” Cealey observes. “The worst is when people say ‘we want AI’ but have no direction. In these situations, they are on an endless pursuit without a map.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For offshore wind power in the US, the new year is bringing new legal battles.

On December 22, the Trump administration announced it would pause the leases of five wind farms currently under construction off the US East Coast. Developers were ordered to stop work immediately.

The cited reason? National security, specifically concerns that turbines can cause radar interference. But that’s a known issue, and developers have worked with the government to deal with it for years.

Companies have been quick to file lawsuits, and the court battles could begin as soon as this week. Here’s what the latest kerfuffle might mean for the struggling offshore wind industry in the US.

This pause affects $25 billion in investment in five wind farms: Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off Virginia. Together, those projects had been expected to create 10,000 jobs and power more than 2.5 million homes and businesses.

In a statement announcing the move, the Department of the Interior said that “recently completed classified reports” revealed national security risks, and that the pause would give the government time to work through concerns with developers. The statement specifically says that turbines can create radar interference (more on the technical details here in a moment).

Three of the companies involved have already filed lawsuits, and they’re seeking preliminary injunctions that would allow construction to continue. Orsted and Equinor (the developers for Revolution Wind and Empire Wind, respectively) told the New York Times that their projects went through lengthy federal reviews, which did address concerns about national security.

This is just the latest salvo from the Trump administration against offshore wind. On Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order stopping all new lease approvals for offshore wind farms. (That order was struck down by a judge in December.)

The administration previously ordered Revolution Wind to stop work last year, also citing national security concerns. A federal judge lifted the stop-work order weeks later, after the developer showed that the financial stakes were high, and that government agencies had previously found no national security issues with the project.

There are real challenges that wind farms introduce for radar systems, which are used in everything from air traffic control to weather forecasting to national defense operations. A wind turbine’s spinning can create complex signatures on radar, resulting in so-called clutter.

Previous government reports, including one 2024 report from the Department of Energy and a 2025 report from the Government Accountability Office (an independent government watchdog), have pointed out this issue in the past.

“To date, no mitigation technology has been able to fully restore the technical performance of impacted radars,” as the DOE report puts it. However, there are techniques that can help, including software that acts to remove the signatures of wind turbines. (Think of this as similar to how noise-canceling headphones work, but more complicated, as one expert told TechCrunch.)

But the most widespread and helpful tactic, according to the DOE report, is collaboration between developers and the government. By working together to site and design wind farms strategically, the groups can ensure that the projects don’t interfere with government or military operations. The 2025 GAO report found that government officials, researchers, and offshore wind companies were collaborating effectively, and any concerns could be raised and addressed in the permitting process.

This and other challenges threaten an industry that could be a major boon for the grid. On the East Coast where these projects are located, and in New England specifically, winter can bring tight supplies of fossil fuels and spiking prices because of high demand. It just so happens that offshore winds blow strongest in the winter, so new projects, including the five wrapped up in this fight, could be a major help during the grid’s greatest time of need.

One 2025 study found that if 3.5 gigawatts’ worth of offshore wind had been operational during the 2024-2025 winter, it would have lowered energy prices by 11%. (That’s the combined capacity of Revolution Wind and Vineyard Wind, two of the paused projects, plus two future projects in the pipeline.) Ratepayers would have saved $400 million.

Before Donald Trump was elected, the energy consultancy BloombergNEF projected that the US would build 39 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. Today, that expectation has dropped to just 6 gigawatts. These legal battles could push it lower still.

What’s hardest to wrap my head around is that some of the projects being challenged are nearly finished. The developers of Revolution Wind have installed all the foundations and 58 of 65 turbines, and they say the project is over 87% complete. Empire Wind is over 60% done and is slated to deliver electricity to the grid next year.

To hit the pause button so close to the finish line is chilling, not just for current projects but for future offshore wind efforts in the US. Even if these legal battles clear up and more developers can technically enter the queue, why would they want to? Billions of dollars are at stake, and if there’s one word to describe the current state of the offshore wind industry in the US, it’s “unpredictable.”

            <h2>ChatGPT Health has arrived</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I’ve said this many times: the products we see on the market are rarely visionary leaps. Most of the time, they are mirrors. They reflect people’s habits, shortcuts, fears, and small daily behaviours. Design follows behaviour. Always has.

Think about it. You probably know at least one person who already uses ChatGPT for health-related questions. Not occasionally. Regularly. As a second opinion. As a place to test concerns before saying them out loud. Sometimes even as a therapist, a confidant, or a space where embarrassment does not exist.

When habits become consistent, companies stop observing and start building. At that point, users are no longer just customers. They are co-architects. Their behaviour quietly shapes the product roadmap.

That context matters when looking at what OpenAI announced on January 7, 2026: the launch of ChatGPT Health, a dedicated AI-powered experience focused on healthcare. OpenAI describes it as “a dedicated experience that securely brings your health information and ChatGPT’s intelligence together.”

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Access is limited for now. The company is rolling it out through a waitlist, with gradual expansion planned over the coming weeks. Anyone with a ChatGPT account, Free or paid, can sign up for early access, except users in the European Union, the UK, and Switzerland, where regulatory alignment is still pending.

The stated goal is simple on paper: help people feel more informed, more prepared, and more confident when managing their health. But the numbers behind that decision say more than the press language ever could. According to OpenAI, over 230 million people worldwide already ask health or wellness questions on ChatGPT every week.

That figure raises uncomfortable questions.

Why do so many people turn to an AI for health questions? Is it speed? The promise of an immediate answer? The way our expectations have shifted toward instant clarity, even for complex or sensitive issues? Is it discomfort, the reluctance to speak openly with a doctor about certain topics? Or something deeper, a quiet erosion of trust in human systems, paired with a growing confidence in machines that do not judge, interrupt, or rush?

ChatGPT Health does not answer those questions. It simply formalises the behaviour.

According to OpenAI, the new Health space allows users to securely connect personal health data, including medical records, lab results, and information from fitness or wellness apps. Someone might upload recent blood test results and ask for a summary. Another might connect a step counter and ask how their activity compares to previous months.

The system can integrate data from platforms such as Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Peloton, AllTrails, and even grocery data from Instacart. The promise is contextual responses, not generic advice. Lab results explained in plain language. Patterns highlighted over time. Suggestions for questions to ask during a medical appointment. Diet or exercise ideas grounded in what the data actually shows.

What ChatGPT Health is careful not to do matters just as much as what it can do.

OpenAI is explicit: this is not medical advice. It does not diagnose conditions. It does not prescribe treatments. It is designed to support care, not replace it. The framing is intentional. ChatGPT Health positions itself as an assistant, not an authority. A tool for understanding patterns and preparing conversations, not making decisions in isolation.

That distinction is crucial. And, frankly, it is one I hope users take seriously.

Behind the scenes, OpenAI says the system was developed with extensive medical oversight. Over the past two years, more than 260 physicians from roughly 60 countries reviewed responses and provided feedback, contributing over 600,000 individual evaluation points. The focus was not only accuracy, but tone, clarity, and when the system should clearly encourage users to seek professional care.

To support that process, OpenAI built an internal evaluation framework called HealthBench. It scores responses based on clinician-defined standards, including safety, medical correctness, and appropriateness of guidance. It is an attempt to bring structure to a domain where nuance matters and mistakes carry weight.

Privacy is another pillar OpenAI insists on emphasising. ChatGPT Health operates in a separate, isolated environment within the app. Health-related conversations, connected data sources, and uploaded files are kept entirely separate from regular chats. Health data does not flow into the general ChatGPT memory, and conversations in this space are encrypted.

OpenAI also states that health conversations are not used to train its core models. Whether that assurance will be enough for all users remains to be seen, but the architectural separation signals an awareness of how sensitive this territory is.

In the United States, the system goes a step further. Through a partnership with b.well Connected Health, ChatGPT Health can access real electronic health records from thousands of providers, with user permission. This allows it to summarise official lab reports or condense long medical histories into readable overviews. Outside the US, functionality is more limited, largely due to regulatory differences.

There are potential downstream effects for healthcare providers as well. If patients arrive at appointments already familiar with their data, already aware of trends, already prepared with focused questions, consultations could become more efficient. Less time decoding numbers. More time discussing decisions.

And inevitably, the question surfaces: should doctors be worried?

AI is not a medical professional. It does not examine patients. It does not carry legal responsibility. It cannot replace clinical judgement, experience, or accountability. ChatGPT Health does not change that. It is not a shortcut to self-diagnosis, and it should not be treated as one.

What it does change is the starting point of the conversation.

Used responsibly, ChatGPT Health can help people engage with their own health information instead of avoiding it. Misused, it could reinforce false certainty or delay necessary care. The responsibility, as always, is shared between the tool and the person using it.

Users should stay aware of privacy implications, seek professional advice when it matters, and treat AI guidance as one input among many, not a final answer.

One thing is clear, though. 2026 did not arrive quietly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The AI industry has become adept at measuring itself. Benchmarks improve, model scores rise, and every new release arrives with a list of metrics meant to signal progress. And yet, somewhere between the lab and real life, something keeps slipping.

Which model actually feels better to use?
Which answers would a human trust?
Which system would you put in front of customers, employees, or citizens and feel comfortable standing behind it?

That gap is where LMArena has quietly built its business, and why investors just put $150 million behind it at a $1.7 billion valuation, in a Series A round. The lead investors were Felicis and UC Investments, with participation from major venture firms (Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Lightspeed, The House Fund, Laude Ventures).

For years, benchmarks were the currency of AI credibility: accuracy scores, reasoning tests and standardized datasets. They worked until they didn’t. As models grew larger and more similar, benchmark improvements became marginal. Worse, models began to optimize for the tests themselves rather than real use cases. Static evaluations struggled to reflect how AI behaves in open-ended, messy human interactions.

At the same time, AI systems moved out of labs and into everyday workflows: drafting emails, writing code, powering customer support, assisting with research and advising professionals. The question shifted from “Can the model do this?” to “Should we trust it when it does?”

That’s a different kind of measurement problem.

LMArena’s answer was simple and radical: stop scoring models in isolation. On its platform, users submit a prompt and receive two anonymized responses. No branding. No model names. Just answers. Then the user picks the better one, or neither.

One vote. One comparison. Repeated millions of times.

The result isn’t a definitive “best,” but a living signal of human preference , how people respond to tone, clarity, verbosity and real-world usefulness. When the prompt isn’t clean or predictable, that signal changes. And it captures something benchmarks often miss.

LMArena isn’t about whether a model produces a factually correct answer. It’s about whether humans prefer it when it does. That distinction is subtle but meaningful in practice. Rankings on the Arena leaderboard are now referenced by developers and labs before releases and product decisions. Major models from OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are regularly evaluated there.

Without traditional marketing, LMArena became a mirror the industry watches.

The $150 million round isn’t just a vote of confidence in LMArena’s product. It signals that AI evaluation itself is becoming infrastructure. As the number of models explodes, enterprise buyers face a new question: not how to get AI, but which AI to trust. Vendor claims and classical benchmarks don’t always translate to real-world reliability. Internal testing is expensive and slow.

A neutral, third-party signal, something that sits between model builders and users  is emerging as a critical layer. That’s where LMArena lives. In September 2025, it launched AI Evaluations, a commercial service that turns its crowdsourced comparison engine into a product enterprises and labs can pay to access. LMArena says this service achieved an annualized run rate of about $30 million within months of launch.

For regulators and policymakers, this kind of human-anchored signal matters too. Oversight frameworks need evidence that reflects real usage, not idealized scenarios.

LMArena’s approach isn’t without debate. Platforms that rely on public voting and crowdsourced signals can reflect the preferences of active users, which may not align with the needs of specific professional domains. In response, competitors like Scale AI’s SEAL Showdown have emerged, aiming to offer more granular, representative model rankings across languages, regions and professional contexts.

Academic research also notes that voting-based leaderboards can be susceptible to manipulation if safeguards aren’t in place, and that such systems may favor superficially appealing responses over technically correct ones if quality control isn’t rigorous.

These debates highlight that no single evaluation method captures every dimension of model behavior, but they also underscore the demand for richer, human-grounded signals beyond traditional benchmarks.

There’s a quiet assumption in AI that trust will emerge naturally as models improve. Better reasoning, so the logic goes, will lead to better outcomes. That framing treats alignment as a technical problem with technical solutions.

LMArena challenges that idea. Trust, in real contexts, is social and contextual. It’s built through experience, not claims. It’s shaped by feedback loops that don’t collapse under scale. By letting users, not companies, decide what works, LMArena introduces friction where the industry often prefers momentum. It slows things down just enough to ask, “Is this actually better, or just newer?”

That’s an uncomfortable question in a market driven by constant release cycles. It’s also why LMArena’s rise feels inevitable.

LMArena doesn’t promise safety. It doesn’t declare models good or bad. It doesn’t replace regulation or responsibility. What it does is simpler and more powerful: it keeps score in public. As AI systems become embedded in everyday decisions, tracking performance over time becomes less optional. Someone has to notice regressions, contextual shifts and usability patterns.

In sports, referees and statisticians fill this role. In markets, auditors and rating agencies do. In AI, we’re still inventing that infrastructure.

LMArena’s funding round suggests investors believe this role won’t stay marginal for long. Because when AI is everywhere, the hardest questions aren’t what it can do. They are who we trust when it does it, and how we know we’re right.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.
