            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The global cost of greenhouse gas emissions is nearly double what scientists previously thought, according to a study published Thursday by researchers at the University of California, San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

It is the first time a social cost of carbon (SCC) assessment—a key measure of economic harm caused by climate change—has included damages to the ocean. Global coral loss, fisheries disruption, and coastal infrastructure destruction are estimated to cost nearly $2 trillion annually, fundamentally changing how we measure climate finance.

“For decades, we’ve been estimating the economic cost of climate change while effectively assigning a value of zero to the ocean,” said Bernardo Bastien-Olvera, who led the study during his postdoctoral fellowship at Scripps. “Ocean loss is not just an environmental issue, but a central part of the economic story of climate change.”

The social cost of carbon is an accounting method for working out the monetary cost of each ton of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. “[It] is one of the most efficient tools we have for internalizing climate damages into economic decision-making,” said Amy Campbell, a United Nations climate advisor and former British government COP negotiator.

Calculations have historically been used by international organizations and state departments like the US Environmental Protection Agency to assess policy proposals—though a 2025 White House memo from the Trump administration instructed federal agencies to ignore the data during cost-benefit analyses unless required by law.

“It becomes politically contentious when deciding whose damages are counted, which sectors are included and most importantly how future and retrospective harms are valued,” Campbell said.

Excluding ocean harm, the social cost of carbon is $51 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted. This increases to $97.20 per ton when the ocean, which covers 70 percent of the planet, is included. In 2024, global CO2 emissions were estimated to be 41.6 billion tons, making the 91 percent cost increase significant.

Using greenhouse gas emission predictions, the report estimates the annual damages to traditional markets alone will be $1.66 trillion by 2100.

The study, which began in 2021, brought together scientists from multiple disciplines: Fisheries experts, coral reef researchers, biologists and climate economists. They assessed downstream climate change costs across four key sectors—corals, mangroves, fisheries, and seaports—measuring everything from straightforward market loss of reduced fisheries and marine trade to reductions in ocean-based recreational industries.

Researchers also placed a monetary figure on what economists call non-use values. “Something has value because it makes the world feel more livable, meaningful, or worth protecting, even if we never directly use it,” said Bastien-Olvera, referencing the fiscal merit of ecosystem enjoyment and the cultural loss caused by climate change. “Most people will never visit a coral reef during a full-moon spawning event, or see a deep-sea jellyfish glowing in total darkness. But many still care deeply that these things exist.”

Island economies, which rely more on seafood for nutrition, will face disproportionate financial and health impacts from ocean warming and acidification, the study said. “The countries that have the most responsibility for causing climate change and the most capacity to fix it are not generally the same countries that will experience the largest or most near-term damages,” said Kate Ricke, co-author and climate professor at UCSD’s School of Global Policy and Strategy. Including ocean data in social cost of carbon assessments reveals increased consequences for morbidity and mortality in low-income countries facing increased nutrition deficiency.

Despite the scale of the scientific discovery, Bastien-Olvera and Ricke are optimistic this data will be a wake-up call for international decision-making. “I hope that the high value of ‘blueSCC’ can motivate further investment in adaptation and resilience for ocean systems,” said Ricke, using the term of the ocean-based social cost of carbon and referencing the opportunities to invest in coral reef and mangrove restoration projects.

Meanwhile, Bastien-Olvera believes centering the framework on oceans also recognizes the longstanding conservation approaches of coastal communities, ocean scientists and Indigenous peoples. “For a long time, climate economics treated the ocean values as if it were worth zero,” he said. “This is a first step toward finally acknowledging how wrong that was.”

            <h2>Meta’s layoffs leave Supernatural fitness users in mourning</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tencia Benavidez, a Supernatural user who lives in New Mexico, started her VR workouts during the Covid pandemic. She has been a regular user in the five years since, calling the ability to work out in VR ideal, given that she lives in a rural area where it’s hard to get to a gym or work out outside during a brutal winter. She stuck with Supernatural because of the community and the eagerness of Supernatural’s coaches.

“They seem like really authentic individuals that were not talking down to you,” Benavidez says. “There’s just something really special about those coaches.”

Meta bought Supernatural in 2022, folding it into its then-heavily-invested-in metaverse efforts. The purchase was not a smooth process, as it triggered a lengthy legal battle in which the US Federal Trade Commission tried to block Meta from purchasing the service due to antitrust concerns about Meta “trying to buy its way to the top” of the VR market. Meta ultimately prevailed. At the time, some Supernatural users were cautiously optimistic, hoping that big bag of Zuckerbucks could keep its workout juggernaut afloat.

“Meta fought the government to buy this thing,” Benavidez says. “All that just for them to shut it down? What was the point?”

I reached out to Meta and Supernatural, and neither responded to my requests for comment.

On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Meta has laid off more than 1,000 people across its VR and metaverse efforts. The move comes after years of the company hemorrhaging billions of dollars on its metaverse products. In addition to laying off most of the staff at Supernatural, Meta has shut down three internal VR studios that made games like Resident Evil 4 and Deadpool VR.

“If it was a bottom-line thing, I think they could have charged more money,” Goff Johnson says about Supernatural. “I think people would have paid for it. This just seems unnecessarily heartless.”

There is a split in the community about who will stay and continue to pay the subscription fee and who will leave. Supernatural has more than 3,000 lessons available in the service, so while new content won’t be added, some feel there is plenty of content left in the library. Other users worry about how Supernatural will continue to license music from big-name bands.

“Supernatural is amazing, but I am canceling it because of this,” Chip told me. “The library is large, so there’s enough to keep you busy, but not for the same price.”

There are other VR workout experiences like FitXR or even the VR staple Beat Saber, which Supernatural cribs a lot of design concepts from. Still, they don’t hit the same bar for many of the Supernatural faithful.

“I’m going to stick it out until they turn the lights out on us,” says Stefanie Wong, a Bay Area accountant who has used Supernatural since shortly after the pandemic and has organized and attended meetup events. “It’s not the app. It’s the community, and it’s the coaches that we really, really care about.”

I tried out Supernatural’s Together feature on Wednesday, the day after the layoffs. It’s where I met Chip and Alisa. When we could stop to catch our breath, we talked about the changes coming to the service. They had played through previous sessions hosted by Jane Fonda or playlists with a mix of music that would change regularly. This one was an artist series featuring entirely Imagine Dragons songs.

In the session, as we punched blocks while being serenaded by this shirtless dude crooning, recorded narrations from Supernatural coach Dwana Olsen chimed in to hype us up.

“Take advantage of these moments,” Olsen said as we punched away. “Use these movements to remind you of how much awesome life you have yet to live.”

Frankly, it was downright invigorating. And bittersweet. We ended another round, sweaty, huffing and puffing. Chip, Alisa, and I high-fived like crazy and readied for another round.

“Beautiful,” Alisa said. “It’s just beautiful, isn’t it?”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida—The rocket NASA is preparing to send four astronauts on a trip around the Moon will emerge from its assembly building on Florida’s Space Coast early Saturday for a slow crawl to its seaside launch pad.

Riding atop one of NASA’s diesel-powered crawler transporters, the Space Launch System rocket and its mobile launch platform will exit the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center around 7:00 am EST (11:00 UTC). The massive tracked transporter, certified by Guinness as the world’s heaviest self-propelled vehicle, is expected to cover the four miles between the assembly building and Launch Complex 39B in about eight to 10 hours.

The rollout marks a major step for NASA’s Artemis II mission, the first human voyage to the vicinity of the Moon since the last Apollo lunar landing in December 1972. Artemis II will not land. Instead, a crew of four astronauts will travel around the far side of the Moon at a distance of several thousand miles, setting the record for the farthest humans have ever ventured from Earth.

The flight will culminate with a scorching 25,000 mph (40,000 km per hour) reentry over the Pacific Ocean. The four Artemis II astronauts—NASA’s Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Canada’s Jeremy Hansen—will become the fastest humans in history, edging out a speed record set during the Apollo era of lunar exploration.

The journey for the fully-assembled Moon rocket will begin early Saturday at a slower pace. After leaving the Vehicle Assembly Building, the moving 11 million-pound structure will head east, then make a left turn before climbing the ramp to Pad 39B overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.

“We will be at a cruising speed of under one mile per hour,” said Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA’s launch director for the Artemis II mission. “It’ll be a little slower around the turns and up the hill.”

The crawler carrying the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft was built 60 years ago to haul NASA’s Saturn V rockets, then kept around for the Space Shuttle Program. Now, the vehicle is back to its original purpose of positioning Moon-bound rockets on their launch pads.

“These are the kinds of days that we live for when you do the kind of work that we do,” said John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Mission Management Team for the Artemis II mission. “The rocket and the spacecraft, Orion Integrity, are getting ready to roll to the pad … It really doesn’t get much better than this, and we’re making history.”

You can watch live views of the rollout in this YouTube stream provided by NASA.

Artemis II is the first crew flight of NASA’s Artemis program, an initiative named for the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology. NASA named the program Artemis in 2019, but some of the building blocks have been around for 20 years.

NASA selected Orion contractor Lockheed Martin to oversee the development of a deep space capsule in 2006 as part of the George W. Bush administration’s soon-to-be canceled Constellation program. In 2011, a political bargain between the Obama administration and Congress revived the Orion program and kicked off development of the Space Launch System. The announcement of the Artemis program in 2019 leaned on work already underway on Orion and the SLS rocket as the centerpieces of an architecture to return US astronauts to the Moon.

Tens of billions of dollars later, everything is finally coming together for the final all-important milestone in developing the vehicles for transporting crews between the Earth and the Moon. A human-rated lunar lander and spacesuits tailored for Moonwalking astronauts are still a few years away from readiness. NASA has contracts with SpaceX and Blue Origin for landers, and with Axiom Space for suits.

A successful Artemis II mission would demonstrate to NASA’s managers and engineers that the Orion spacecraft and SLS rocket fulfill their roles in the Artemis architecture. NASA is expected to rely on the SLS rocket, which costs more than $2 billion per flight and is expendable by design, for several more missions until commercial alternatives are available.

America’s return to the Moon now has a geopolitical imperative. China is working to land its own astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030, and US officials want to beat the Chinese to the Moon for the motivation of national prestige and the material benefits of accessing lunar resources, among other reasons. For now, budget-writing lawmakers in Congress and President Donald Trump’s new NASA chief, Jared Isaacman, agree the existing SLS/Orion architecture, despite its cost and shortcomings, offers the surest opportunity to beat the Chinese space program to a crew lunar landing.

Then, if all goes according to plan, NASA can turn to cheaper (and in one case, more capable) rockets to help the government afford the expenditure required to construct a Moon base.

“Putting crew on the rocket and taking the crew around the Moon, this is going be our first step toward a sustained lunar presence,” Honeycutt said. “It’s 10 days [and] four astronauts going farther from Earth than any other human has ever traveled. We’ll be validating the Orion spacecraft’s life support, navigation and crew systems in the really harsh environments of deep space, and that’s going to pave the way for future landings.”

There is still much work ahead before NASA can clear Artemis II for launch. At the launch pad, technicians will complete final checkouts and closeouts before NASA’s launch team gathers in early February for a critical practice countdown. During this countdown, called a Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), Blackwell-Thompson and her team will oversee the loading of the SLS rocket’s core stage and upper stage with super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants.

The cryogenic fluids, particularly liquid hydrogen, gave fits to the Artemis launch team as NASA prepared to launch the Artemis I mission—without astronauts—on the SLS rocket’s first test flight in 2022. Engineers resolved the issues and successfully launched the Artemis I mission in November 2022, and officials will apply the lessons for the Artemis II countdown.

“Artemis I was a test flight, and we learned a lot during that campaign getting to launch,” Blackwell-Thompson said. “And the things that we’ve learned relative to how to go load this vehicle, how to load LOX (liquid oxygen), how to load hydrogen, have all been rolled in to the way in which we intend to do for the Artemis II vehicle.”

Assuming the countdown rehearsal goes according to plan, NASA could be in a position to launch the Artemis II mission as soon as February 6. But the schedule for February 6 is tight, with no margin for error. Officials typically have about five days per month when they can launch Artemis II, when the Moon is in the right position relative to Earth, and the Orion spacecraft can follow the proper trajectory toward reentry and splashdown to limit stress on the capsule’s heat shield.

In February, the available launch dates are February 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11, with launch windows in the overnight hours in Florida. If the mission isn’t off the ground by February 11, NASA will have to stand down until a new series of launch opportunities beginning March 6. The space agency has posted a document showing all available launch dates and times through the end of April.

NASA’s leaders are eager for Artemis II to fly. NASA is not only racing China, a reality the agency’s former administrator acknowledged during the Biden administration. Now, the Trump administration is pushing NASA to accomplish a human landing on the Moon by the end of his presidential term on January 20, 2029.

One of Honeycutt’s jobs as chair of the Mission Management Team (MMT) is ensuring all the Is are dotted and Ts are crossed amid the frenzy of final launch preparations. While the hardware for Artemis II is on the move in Florida, the astronauts and flight controllers are wrapping up their final training and simulations at Johnson Space Center in Houston.

“I think I’ve got a good eye for launch fever,” he said Friday.

“As chair of the MMT, I’ve got one job, and it’s the safe return of Reid, Victor, Christina, and Jeremy. I consider that a duty and a trust, and it’s one I intend to see through.”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/rackspace-raises-email-hosting-prices-by-as-much-as-706-percent/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rackspace’s new pricing for its email hosting services is “devastating,” according to a partner that has been using Rackspace as its email provider since 1999.

In recent weeks, Rackspace updated its email hosting pricing. Its standard plan is now $10 per mailbox per month. Businesses can also pay for the Rackspace Email Plus add-on for an extra $2/mailbox/month (for “file storage, mobile sync, Office-compatible apps, and messaging”), and the Archiving add-on for an extra $6/mailbox/month (for unlimited storage).

As recently as November 2025, Rackspace charged $3/mailbox/month for its Standard plan, and an extra $1/mailbox/month for the Email Plus add-on, and an additional $3/mailbox/month for the Archival add-on, according to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.

Rackspace’s reseller partners have been especially vocal about the impacts of the new pricing.

In a blog post on Thursday, web hosting service provider and Rackspace reseller Laughing Squid said Rackspace is “increasing our email pricing by an astronomical 706 percent, with only a month-and-a half’s notice.”

Laughing Squid founder Scott Beale told Ars Technica that he received the “devastating” news via email on Wednesday. The last time Rackspace increased Laughing Squid’s email prices was by 55 percent in 2019, he said.

“The price increase has a major impact on the ability to make money due to the fact that email is now our largest expense, and we were only given a month-and-a-half notice,” Beale told Ars.

Online, there are reports of Rackspace partners being quoted email pricing increases of 110 percent to nearly 500 percent. The reports say that the new, higher-per-mailbox quotes don’t include volume pricing discounts. Beale noted that Laughing Squid’s quote doesn’t include discounts that the company previously received.

“We had really good reseller pricing that we negotiated with Rackspace due to the number of mailboxes we had with them and how long we had been a customer. All of that seemed to vanish when they notified us of their new pricing,” he said.

Ars contacted Rackspace asking about the 706 percent price hike that Laughing Squid says it’s facing, why Rackspace decided to increase its prices now, and why it didn’t give its partners more advanced notice. A company spokesperson responded, saying:

Rackspace Email is a reliable and secure business-class email solution for small businesses. To continue delivering the service levels our customers expect, effective March 2026, Rackspace Technology is increasing the price of Rackspace Email. We have a support team available to help our customers to discuss their options.

The spokesperson added that Rackspace’s “mission is to deliver quality, trusted and reliable hosted email solution for businesses.”

Despite Rackspace’s stated commitment to email hosting, the prohibitive pricing seems like a deterrent for a business being viewed as high-effort and low-margin. Email has grown complex over the years, requiring time and expertise for proper management at scale. It’s become simpler, or more lucrative, for some cloud companies to focus on selling their managed services on top of offerings like Microsoft 365—as Rackspace does—or Google Workspace and let the larger companies behind those solutions deal with infrastructure costs and complexities.

Rackspace’s price hike also comes as an AI-driven RAM shortage is impacting the availability and affordability of other computing components, including storage.

With Rackspace, which went public in 2020, also having quit hosting Microsoft Exchange following a costly 2022 ransomware attack, the Texas-headquartered company may be looking to minimize its email hosting duties as much as possible.

Meanwhile, Laughing Squid is increasing prices for Rackspace mailboxes and offering services with a different email provider, PolarisMail, to customers at lower prices. Beale said he has reached out to Rackspace about the new pricing but hasn’t heard back yet.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/01/archaeologists-find-a-supersized-medieval-shipwreck-in-denmark/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Archaeologists recently found the wreck of an enormous medieval cargo ship lying on the seafloor off the Danish coast, and it reveals new details of medieval trade and life at sea.

Archaeologists discovered the shipwreck while surveying the seabed in preparation for a construction project for the city of Copenhagen, Denmark. It lay on its side, half-buried in the sand, 12 meters below the choppy surface of the Øresund, the straight that runs between Denmark and Sweden. By comparing the tree rings in the wreck’s wooden planks and timbers with rings from other, precisely dated tree samples, the archaeologists concluded that the ship had been built around 1410 CE.

Svaelget 2, as archaeologists dubbed the wreck (its original name is long since lost to history), was a type of merchant ship called a cog: a wide, flat-bottomed, high-sided ship with an open cargo hold and a square sail on a single mast. A bigger, heavier, more advanced version of the Viking knarrs of centuries past, the cog was the high-tech supertanker of its day. It was built to carry bulky commodities from ports in the Netherlands, north around the coast of Denmark, and then south through the Øresund to trading ports on the Baltic Sea—but this one didn’t quite make it.

Most cogs would have been about 15 to 25 meters long and 5 to 8 meters wide, capable of carrying about 200 tons of cargo—big, impressive ships for their time. But Svaelget 2, an absolute unit of a ship, measured about 28 meters from bow to stern, 9 meters wide, and could have carried about 300 tons. Its size alone was a surprise to the archaeologists.

“We now know, undeniably, that cogs could be this large—that the ship type could be pushed to this extreme,” said archaeologist Otto Uldum of Denmark’s Viking Ship Museum, who led the excavation, in a press release.

Medieval Europe’s merchant class was growing in both size and wealth in the early 1400s, and the cog was both a product of that growth and the engine driving it. The mere fact of its existence points to a society that could afford to invest in building big, expensive trading ships (and could confidently expect a return on that investment). And physically, it’s a product of the same trading networks it supplied: while the heavy timbers of its frame were cut locally in the Netherlands, the Pomeranian oak planks of Svaelget 2’s hull came from Poland.

“The cog revolutionized trade in northern Europe,” said Uldum. “It made it possible to transport goods on a scale never seen before.”

For about 600 years, layers of sand had protected the starboard (right, for you landlubbers) side of the wreck from erosion and decay. Nautical archaeologists usually find only the very bottoms of cogs; the upper structures of the ship—rigging, decks, and castles—quickly decay in the ocean. That means that some of the most innovative parts of the ships’ construction appear only in medieval drawings and descriptions.

But Svaelget 2 offers archaeologists a hands-on look at the real deal, from rigging to the ship’s galley and the stern castle: a tall wooden structure at the back of the ship, where crew and passengers could have sought at least a little shelter from the elements. Medieval drawings and texts describe cogs having high castles at both bow and stern, but archaeologists have never gotten to examine a real one to learn how it’s put together or how it connects with the rest of the ship’s construction.

“We have plenty of drawings of castles, but they have never been found because usually only the bottom of the ship survives,” said Uldum. “[The castle] is a big step forward compared to Viking Age ships, which had only open decks in all kinds of weather.”

Lying on and around the remains of the cog’s decks, Uldum and his colleagues also found stays (ropes that would have held the mast in place) and lines for controlling the ship’s single square sail, along with ropes and chains that would once have secured the merchant vessel’s cargo in the open hold.

The cog would probably have sailed with between 30 and 45 crew members. No remains were found on the wreck, but the lost crew left behind small, tantalizing traces of their lives and their presence. Uldum and his colleagues found combs, shoes, and rosary beads, along with dishes and tableware.

“The sailor brought his comb to keep his hair neat and his rosary to say his prayers,” said Uldum (and one has to picture the sailor’s grandmother beaming proudly at that description). “These personal objects show us that the crew brought everyday items with them. They transferred their life on land to life at sea.”

Life at sea, for the medieval sailors aboard Svaelget 2, would have included at least occasional hot meals, cooked in bronze pots over an open fire in the ship’s galley and eaten on dishes of ceramic and painted wood. Bricks (about 200 of them) and tiles formed a sort of fireplace where the cook could safely build a fire aboard the otherwise very flammable ship.

“It speaks of remarkable comfort and organization on board,” said Uldum. “Now sailors could have hot meals similar to those on land, instead of the dried and cold food that previously dominated life at sea.” Plenty of dried meat and cold biscuits still awaited sailors for the next several centuries, of course, but when weather and time permitted, at least the crew of Svaelget 2 could gather around a hot meal. The galley would have been a relatively new part of shipboard life for sailors in the early 1400s—and it quickly became a vital one.

One thing usually marks the site of a shipwreck, even when everything else has disintegrated into the ocean: ballast stones. When merchant ships were empty, they carried stones in their holds to help keep the ship stable; otherwise, the empty ship would be top-heavy and prone to tipping over, which is usually not ideal. (Modern merchant vessels use water, in special tanks, for ballast.) But Uldum and his colleagues didn’t find ballast stones on Svaelget 2, which means the cog was probably fully laden with cargo when it sank.

But the cargo is also conspicuously absent. Cogs were built to carry bulk goods—things like bricks, grain and other staple foods, fabric, salt, and timber. Those goods would have been stowed in an open hold amidships, secured by ropes and chains (some of which remain on the wreck). But barrels, boards, and bolts of fabric all float. As the ship sank and water washed into the hold, it would have carried away the cargo.

Some of it may have washed up on the shores or even more distant beaches, becoming a windfall for local residents. The rest probably sank to the bottom of the sea, far from the ship and its destination.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/judge-orders-annas-archive-to-delete-scraped-data-no-one-thinks-it-will-comply/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The operator of WorldCat won a default judgment against Anna’s Archive, with a federal judge ruling yesterday that the shadow library must delete all copies of its WorldCat data and stop scraping, using, storing, or distributing the data.

Anna’s Archive is a shadow library and search engine for other shadow libraries that was launched in 2022. It archives books and other written materials and makes them available via torrents, and recently expanded its ambitions by scraping Spotify to make a 300TB copy of the most-streamed songs. Anna’s Archive lost its .org domain a couple of weeks ago but remains online at other domains.

Yesterday’s ruling is in a case filed by OCLC, a nonprofit that operates the WorldCat library catalog on behalf of member libraries. OCLC alleged that Anna’s Archive “illegally hacked WorldCat.org” to steal 2.2TB of data.

Anna’s Archive, which bills itself as “the world’s largest shadow library,” did not respond to the lawsuit and doesn’t seem likely to comply with the judgment. The shadow library creator has written that “we deliberately violate the copyright law in most countries. This allows us to do something that legal entities cannot do: making sure books are mirrored far and wide.”

But the court order has value for OCLC, which said in a November 2025 motion that it “hopes to take the judgment to website hosting services so that OCLC’s WorldCat data will be removed from Anna’s Archive’s websites.” We contacted OCLC about its plans today and will update this article if it provides any information.

The court order, which was previously reported by TorrentFreak, was issued by Judge Michael Watson in US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. “Plaintiff has established that Defendant crashed its website, slowed it, and damaged the servers, and Defendant admitted to the same by way of default,” the ruling said.

Anna’s Archive allegedly began scraping and harvesting data from WorldCat.org in October 2022, “and Plaintiff suffered persistent attacks for roughly a year,” the ruling said. “To accomplish such scraping and harvesting, Defendant allegedly used search bots (automated software applications) that ‘called or pinged the server directly’ and appeared to be ‘legitimate search engine bots from Bing and Google.’”

The court granted OCLC’s motion for default judgment on a breach-of-contract claim related to WorldCat.org terms and conditions, and a trespass-to-chattels claim related to the alleged harm to its website and servers. The court rejected the plaintiff’s tortious-interference-with-contract claim because OCLC’s allegation didn’t include all necessary components to prove the charge, and rejected OCLC’s unjust enrichment claim because it “is preempted by federal copyright law.”

The judgment said Anna’s Archive is permanently enjoined from “scraping or harvesting WorldCat data from WorldCat. org or OCLC’s servers; using, storing, or distributing the WorldCat data on Anna’s Archive’s websites; and encouraging others to scrape, harvest, use, store, or distribute WorldCat data.” It also must “delete all copies of WorldCat data in possession of or easily accessible to it, including all torrents.”

The “Anna” behind Anna’s Archive revealed the WorldCat scraping in an October 2023 blog post. The post said that because WorldCat has “the world’s largest library metadata collection,” the data would help Anna’s Archive make a “list of books that need to be preserved.”

“Even though OCLC is a nonprofit, their business model requires protecting their database,” Anna wrote. “Well, we’re sorry to say, friends at OCLC, we’re giving it all away.”

Anna’s blog said the scraping took place over a year and relied on security flaws that were gradually patched. The “security flaws were slowly fixed one by one, until the final one we found was patched about a month ago,” the October 2023 post said. “By that time we had pretty much all records, and were only going for slightly higher quality records.”

OCLC filed its lawsuit in January 2024. “Beginning in the fall of 2022, OCLC began experiencing cyberattacks on WorldCat.org and OCLC’s servers that significantly affected the speed and operations of WorldCat.org, other OCLC products and services, and OCLC’s servers and network infrastructure,” the lawsuit said. “These attacks continued throughout the following year, forcing OCLC to devote significant time and resources toward non-routine network infrastructure enhancements, maintenance, and troubleshooting.”

OCLC finally learned the perpetrator was Anna’s Archive when the shadow library made its October 2023 announcement. “Anna’s Archive has since made OCLC’s WorldCat data available for en masse for free download and now is actively encouraging its visitors to make use of the data in ‘interesting’ ways,” the lawsuit said, adding that the defendants “have no legal justification for their actions and admit that their general operations violate US and other jurisdictions’ copyright laws.”

Yesterday’s default judgment is not the end of proceedings in the case. OCLC was ordered to file a status report within 30 days “suggesting next steps on the claims for which the Court denied default judgment, unless it files a motion to dismiss its remaining claims against Defendant before then.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amid abysmal car sales that continue to plummet worldwide and major regulatory hurdles plaguing the company’s driver assistance software, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is desperately looking to reinvent the company.

His newfound obsession has been Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot, an invention that he says will transform the EV maker into a $25 trillion robotics company. He’s promised that Optimus will account for the vast majority of the company’s already extremely inflated value — a claim he’s now taking to an extraordinary new extreme.

Responding to a clip of entrepreneur and investor Jason Calacanis claiming during a recent summit that “nobody will remember that Tesla ever made a car” and that “they will only remember” the company building “a billion” Optimus robots, Musk had a sweeping prediction.

Beyond once again demonstrating Musk’s penchant for making vastly exaggerated claims about his companies, the admission neatly summarizes what we’ve suspected for quite some time now: Tesla and Musk are ready to move on from the EV and are looking to capitalize on the next big hype cycle.

Tesla still has a lot to prove when it comes to its bipedal assistant. As part of Musk’s $1 trillion pay package, the company will need to deploy one million Optimus robots, a goal the mercurial CEO has promised could be achieved by 2030.

Reality, however, has plenty of catching up to do. The company has encountered major technical snags in its efforts to build out production lines and reportedly failed to keep up with its own stated goal of building 5,000 Optimus robots last year.

The company’s demos have also fallen far short of expectations, with one robot struggling to walk down a clear office hallway. Tesla is also still heavily relying on teleoperators, suggesting that autonomous operation without the need for a human pilot could still be a long way out.

In short, Musk’s extremely boisterous claims that “Optimus will eliminate poverty and provide universal high income for all” should be taken with a grain of salt.

For now, investors in the EV firm are happily buying into the CEO’s vision. The stock hit an all-time closing high of just shy of $500 in mid-December. That’s despite Tesla still facing declining deliveries and sales as it desperately attempts to reinvent itself as a humanoid robotics company.

            <h2>Scientists Uncover Secret Landscape Hiding Miles Below Antarctica’s Ice</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/science-energy/hidden-landscape-antarctica-ice">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">By creating a new map of Antarctica’s subterranean landscape, researchers have uncovered a vast topography of previously hidden hills, ridges, and even entire mountain ranges lurking miles beneath its frozen exterior.

The findings, detailed in a new study published in the journal Science, could represent a novel method of probing the Antarctic ice that could be instrumental in predicting the frigid continent’s fate amid rapid climate change.

“It’s like before you had a grainy pixel film camera, and now you’ve got a properly zoomed-in digital image of what’s really going on,” lead author Helen Ockenden, a researcher at the University of Grenoble-Alpes in France, told the BBC.

Previous approaches have relied on on-the-ground and aerial missions to use radar to sound out the continent’s subsurface features. But the barren landscape is intimidatingly vast, and these missions can be separated by dozens of miles, leaving scientists with an incomplete picture, which itself can only really guess at what’s trapped below all those miles of ice.

According to an editor’s summary of the study, the Antarctic’s subsurface landscape is so mysterious that we know less about it than we do Mercury. Study coauthor Robert Bingham, a glaciologist at the University of Edinburg, provided an analogy.

“If you imagined the Scottish Highlands or the European Alps were covered by ice and the only way to understand their shape was the occasional flight several kilometers apart,” he told the BBC, “there’s no way that you would see all these sharp mountains and valleys that we know to be there.”

Space provides an alternative. Using a combination of optical images and radar data taken by satellites, and then combining this with models on how subsurface ice flows, Ockenden and her team teased out the undulations in the bedrock underneath the ice, according to Science.

“It’s a little bit like if you’re kayaking in a river, and there’s rocks underneath the water, sometimes there’s eddies in the surface, which can tell you about the rocks under the water,” Ockenden told the BBC. When the ice flows over a ridge or hill the bedrock, “that manifests in the topography of the surface, but also in the velocity as well.”

The novel approach uncovered a far more interesting and heterogeneous landscape than what was suspected before: alpine valleys, eroded lowlands, and a vast network of channels formed by flowing water spanning hundreds of miles.

It isn’t perfect, according to University of Texas at Austin glaciologist Duncan Young, who wasn’t involved in the study. He told Science that the approach can’t pick up features smaller than a few meters across, for which traditional radar approaches will still be the best to uncover.

Still, it provides a good guide for where radar surveys should look.

“We’re not so blind now,” Bingham told Science. “We have a really good impression of where the bed’s quite rough, where you would need to survey closely if you really want to see the details of the features.”

Understanding Antarctica’s buried geography and fluvial networks will be crucial to understanding how its immense reserves of ice will be affected by climate change. Already, scientists predict that the potential collapse of just one of the continent’s ice sheets — connected to the infamous Thwaites or “Doomsday” glacier — could raise sea levels by dozens of feet in the coming centuries. Subterranean happenings turned out to be an alarming development in our understanding of the the Thwaites’ health, when scientists discovered that its bottom side, once thought to be protected by the seabed, was actually being exposed to warming seawater. Similar revelations, with new imaging techniques, could come to bear on our understanding of the continent at large.

            <h2>Man Trains Crows to Attack MAGA Hats</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-18</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For almost ten years, red MAGA hats have been an immediately identifiable sign of one’s political affiliation with president Donald Trump. The white-on-red design has become a powerful symbol for his supporters and their retrograde agenda, drawing comparisons to the Confederate flag.

And as Trump’s polling numbers continue to plummet, with the majority of Americans calling the first year of his second term a failure, more and more voters are becoming disillusioned.

In a particularly creative expression of anti-MAGA sentiment, a man who goes by the username “biz_dave” says he successfully trained crows to attack MAGA hats. As detailed in a series of posts on Threads, the self-proclaimed “big nerd” and “very part-time artist” stuck some tasty treats, including “peanuts, chicken scraps, mealworms, and dog kibble,” underneath a MAGA hat.

He explained that it took four months to get the crows to regularly come down to feed on the treats.

“Once they were coming regularly, it was only about three months to get them to the hat removal stage,” biz_dave wrote.

Footage shows the black feathered creatures swooping down and plucking off the red hat to access their tasty meal.

“Some folks want to befriend crows, or get them to bring trinkets,” he wrote. “I have… other goals.”

The self-proclaimed artist noted that his “favorite part has been discovering new and interesting behaviors from these amazing creatures,” showing off footage of a crow vocalizing, before ripping off the red hat.

Crows are considered to be exceptionally intelligent, with some experts arguing they could be the cleverest animal on the planet other than primates. Some research has even found they possess the complex problem-solving skills of a seven-year-old child.

They’ve been observed using hooked tools they created to retrieve grubs and insects from inside trees, identify people who have previously posed a threat — effectively holding grudges — or use gestures to communicate.

In 2022, scientists found that crows can understand recursion, the concept of embedding structures inside other structures.

In short, it’s no wonder it only took a couple of months for the crows to learn to attack the red MAGA hats.

It’s still unclear if the animals have struck a Trump fan in the wild yet.

“Do we know if they have taken anyone’s hat yet?” one Threads user asked.

“Nothing confirmed,” biz_dave replied. “Anxious for reports.”

            <div id="article-text">While AI companies continue to command the global economy and pour billions of dollars into building data centers, it’s still not even clear that their products can deliver on one of their core premises: increasing productivity.

One big skeptic of the tech’s economic promises is vice president and principal analyst at the global market analytics firm JP Gownder, who says we’re simply “not seeing” an AI-driven boost to productivity in any of the available data.

“You begin to get the picture that information technology isn’t measured always in as linear a way into productivity as people assume,” he told The Register in a new interview. “It just isn’t there.”

This isn’t a statement on how transformative AI might or might not be. It could have massive effects without necessarily translating to economic gains, a phenomenon known as the Solow Paradox, named after the Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Solow who correctly predicted “that by 1987 the effects of the PC revolution can be seen everywhere, except in the productivity statistics,” in Gownder’s analysis.

He pointed to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showing how between 1947 to 1973 — before the advent of PCS — productivity improved by 2.7 percent annually, but only 2.1 percent between 1990 and 2001, once PCs had hit the mainstream.

“So despite all those PCs, it was a lot lower,” Gownder said. “And [from] 2007 to 2019 it was 1.5 percent.”

Mountains of research as well as cases of workplace deployment of AI have suggested that the tech is far from being ready for primetime. One notable MIT study found that 95 percent of companies that integrated AI saw zero meaningful growth in revenue. For coding tasks, one of AI’s most widely hyped applications, another study showed that programmers who used AI coding tools actually became slower at their jobs.

AIs designed to automate entire tasks aren’t looking too hot either: when researchers at the Center for AI Safety tested AI agents’ ability to complete remote work tasks, not a single model was able to complete more than three percent of their assignments. The very introduction of AI into the workplace appears to be disastrous for employee relations, suggests another study, which found that AI resulted in employees passing off low quality “workslop” with the expectation that someone else down the line would polish the AI’s shoddy output.

“A lot of generative AI stuff isn’t really working,” Gownder told The Register. “And I’m not just talking about your consumer experience, which has its own gaps, but the MIT study that suggested that 95 percent of all generative AI projects are not yielding a tangible [profit and loss] benefit. So no actual [return on investment.]”

“It is just further context that says we’re not at a place where lots and lots of people are losing their jobs right now,” he added.

That said, Forrester’s research does predict that AI and other automation tech, like physical robots, will see a hefty six percent of jobs replaced by 2030, amounting to some 10.4 million roles.

“These jobs are lost structurally, like they’re gone for good, because they’ve been replaced,” Gownder told The Register. “That’s not an insignificant hit to the economy.”

There may come a point where employers realize that AI isn’t working out, Gownder said. Some bosses who fired workers in favor of AI agents have already eaten crow and rehired their human grunts. But “AI” may simply be a way of papering over other forms of cost-cutting.

“Outsourcing is a very popular one,” he told The Register. “They’re firing people because of AI, and then three weeks later they hire a team in India because the labor is so much cheaper.”

            <div id="article-text">You know the old adage “don’t believe everything you see on the internet”? In the age of AI, it’s never been more relevant.

Late in December, Denver Bronco’s beat writer Cody Roark was surprised to learn he was dead, leaving behind a 5 year old child. As far as he knew, he had never fathered a child, and was very much still alive.

Yet that’s not what the post on Facebook claimed. There, an image shared by the page “Wild Horse Warriors” featured an AI generated image of the sports journalist holding a child, with a big “RIP” stitched across it.

Though the Facebook page has since been taken down, the Denver Post reports that it described Roark as a “Denver Broncos analyst” who’d “dedicated over a decade to protecting the team,” before passing away due to a “heartbreaking domestic violence incident.”

Of course, the whole thing was AI, as Roark would later conclude.

“It was just one of those things you hate seeing,” he later told the DP during an interview. “Just doesn’t make sense. I always thought, like — usually you see that happen to, like, high-profile celebrities.”

“For that to happen to me was just really weird. Very, very weird,” Roark said.

The account in question, Wild Horse Warriors, had snared some 6,200 followers over the last few months. The DP reports that, prior to it being taken down by Facebook, it averaged about four completely hallucinated Denver Broncos stories every day. Many of them contained content that could impact people’s reputations, like a false claim that Bronco’s wide receiver Courtland Sutton refused to wear an armband in support of LGBTQ people during a game.

Though Roark seems no worse for the wear, the incident follows a similar pattern emerging from other AI systems. In December, for example, Google’s AI overview — that little summary that now appears at the top of every Google search — falsely claimed a Canadian folk musician was a convicted sex offender.

That claim cost the musician at least one gig, and untold reputational harm that can be difficult to repair — just one more sign that through AI, tech corporations have provided a potent new tool for anyone trafficking in misinformation.

            <div id="article-text">Will the slow anaconda crush of AI mean the end of journalism? It’s hard to imagine it completely eliminating the profession outright, unless the machines end up enslaving humanity à la the “Matrix” films. There will always be nosy gumshoes meddling in everyone’s affairs.

But major media companies are in dire straits, and their executives aren’t sounding too cheerful about the future, which could hold in store the end of the traditional news agency.

That’s according to a new survey of over 280 media leaders from 51 countries conducted by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (RISJ). It found that on average, the sample of editors, CEOs, and digital executives expect traffic to their websites to plummet by 43 percent over the next three years — which would be a disastrous blow to their commercial operations.

Traffic to news sites has already been plunging, a trend that preceded the AI boom but only accelerated as chatbots like ChatGPT began to replace the search engine. Analytics data cited in the RISJ report shows that web traffic directed to news sites from Google Search has plummeted 33 percent across the globe.

With omens like those, Nick Newman, senior research associate at the RISJ, predicts the “traffic era” of the early internet, which once sustained traditional publishers, may finally be coming to an end.

“It is not clear what comes next,” Newman told The Guardian. “Publishers fear that AI chatbots are creating a new convenient way of accessing information that could leave news brands — and journalists — out in the cold.”

“But tech platforms do not hold all the cards,” he added. “Reliable news, expert analysis and points of view remain important both to individuals and to society, particularly in uncertain times. Great storytelling — and a human touch — is going to be hard for AI to replicate.”

Some publishers seeing the writing on the wall have pivoted to embracing AI tech. But the way it’s being deployed in many cases is almost certainly a miscalculation, imperiling fundamental tenets of good journalism by introducing hallucinating tech into the loop — which is to say nothing of the coincidentally-timed layoffs that have been hamstringing the industry.

Some cases seem more innocuous. The New York Times, for example, has been using AI to help craft headlines. But in an alarming recent demonstration of how the tech can go drastically wrong, the Washington Post launched a feature last month for producing personalized AI-generated podcasts that would relay the newspaper’s latest stories, which immediately sparked uproar both internally and externally. The podcasts were riddled with factual errors and in some cases even editorialized on developing stories. The venture was resoundingly mocked online, and WaPo staffers fumed against leadership, calling it “astonishing” and a “disaster.”

But the logic behind these moves is that desperate times call for desperate, extremely ill-advised measures, and the industry is desperate indeed. According to the RISJ report, only 38 percent of the surveyed media leaders say they’re confident about journalism’s prospects in the years ahead, a staggering 22 percent drop from four years ago.

To navigate these waters, the publishers emphasized doubling down on some aspects of what makes journalism unique, like original investigations, on-the-ground reporting, and human-oriented stories. On the other hand, they said they’d scale back general news and service journalism, which they expected to be commoditized by AI. They also favored pivoting journalists into content creation, such as making shortform videos, to gain a foothold in social media.

It’s been a minute, folks! As you might recall, the newsletter took a little holiday break. We’re back and well into 2026. And a lot has happened since the last edition.

I spent the first week of the year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. And while I wrote about this last January, it’s worth repeating: U.S. automakers have left the building.

What has filled the void in the Las Vegas Convention Center? Autonomous vehicle tech companies (Zoox, Tensor Auto, Tier IV, and Waymo, which rebranded its Zeekr RT, to name a few), Chinese automakers like Geely and GWM, software and automotive chip companies, and loads of what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang calls “physical AI.”

The term, which is sometimes called “embodied AI,” describes the use of AI outside the digital world and into the real, physics-based one. AI models, combined with sensors, cameras, and the motorized controls, allow that physical thing — humanoid robot, drone, autonomous forklift, robotaxi — to detect and understand what’s in this real environment and make decisions to operate within it. And it was all over the place from agriculture and robotics to autonomous vehicles and drones, industrial manufacturing, and wearables.

Hyundai had one of the busiest and largest exhibits with a near-constant line wrapped around the entrance. The Korean automaker wasn’t showing cars. Nope, it was robots of various forms, including the Atlas humanoid robot, courtesy of its subsidiary Boston Dynamics. There were also innovations that have come out of Hyundai Motor Group Robotics LAB, including a robot that charges electric autonomous vehicles, and a four-wheel electric platform called the Mobile Eccentric Droid (MobEd) that is going into production this year. It seems everyone was embracing and showcasing robotics, particularly humanoids.

The hype around humanoids, specifically, and physical AI, in general, was palpable. I asked Mobileye co-founder and president Amnon Shashua about this because his company just bought his humanoid robotics startup for $900 million: “What do you say when people tell you humanoid robots are all hype?”

“The internet was also a hype, remember in 2000, the crisis of the internet,” Shashua said. “It did not mean that [the] internet is not a real thing. Hype means that companies are overvalued for a certain period of time, and then they crash. It does not mean that the domain is not real. I believe that the domain of humanoids is real.”

Now onto the other non-CES and more recent news …

President Trump made comments this week at a Detroit Economic Club meeting about welcoming Chinese automakers into the United States that did not sit well with many in the auto industry, according to insiders I have spoken to. Specifically, I have been told the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (the industry lobbying group) is “freaking out,” one DC insider told me.

“If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbors, that’s great, I love that,” Trump said, according to reporters in attendance. “Let China come in, let Japan come in.”

A couple of notes. Japanese companies like Toyota are already very much in the United States. The bigger hurdle, beyond protests from within the boardrooms of U.S. automakers, is existing law. In 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security issued a rule that restricts the import and sale of certain connected vehicles and related hardware and software linked to China or Russia. This essentially bans the sale of Chinese vehicles in the country.

Avery Ash, who is CEO of SAFE, a nonpartisan organization focused on securing U.S. energy, critical materials, and supply chains, weighed in about the dangers of allowing Chinese automakers to sell their vehicles in the United States. Side note: Ash was on my podcast, the Autonocast, which touches on some of this subject.

“Welcoming Chinese automakers to build cars here in the U.S. will reverse these hard-won accomplishments and put Americans at risk,” he said. ”We’ve seen this strategy backfire in Europe and elsewhere — it would have potentially catastrophic impacts on our automotive industry, have ripple effects on our entire defense industrial base, and make every American less secure.”

Meanwhile, Canada is opening the door to Chinese automakers. Canadian prime minister Mark Carney announced his country will slash its 100% import tax on Chinese EVs to just 6.1%, Sean O’Kane reports.

Budget carrier Allegiant agreed to buy rival Sun Country Airlines for about $1.5 billion in cash and stock.

Dealerware, which sells software services to automotive OEMs and retailers, was acquired by a group of investors led by Wavecrest Growth Partners and Radian Capital. Automotive Ventures and automotive industry executives David Metter and Devin Daly also participated. The terms were not disclosed.

Long-distance bus and train provider Flix acquired the majority share of European airport transfer-platform Flibco. Luxembourg company SLG will retain some ownership stake in Flibco. Terms weren’t disclosed.

JetZero, the Long Beach, California, startup developing a midsized triangular aircraft designed to save on fuel, raised $175 million in a Series B round led by B Capital, Bloomberg reported.

Joby Aviation, a company developing electric air taxis, reached an agreement to buy a 700,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Dayton, Ohio, to support its plans to double production to four aircraft per month in 2027.

Luminar has reached a deal to sell its lidar business to a company called Quantum Computing Inc. for just $22 million. If that seems low, you’re right. Luminar’s valuation peaked in 2021 at $11 billion.

Bluspark Global, a New York-based shipping and supply chain software company, didn’t realize its platform was vulnerable and open to anyone on the internet. Here’s how a security researcher (and TechCrunch) got it fixed.

The Federal Trade Commission finalized an order that bans General Motors and its OnStar telematics service from sharing certain consumer data with consumer reporting agencies. Read the full story on what that means.

InDrive, the company that started as a ride-hailing platform that lets users set the price, is diversifying and starting to execute on its “super app” strategy. That means more in-app advertising across its top 20 markets and expanding grocery delivery to Pakistan. Read the full story here.

Motional, the majority Hyundai-owned autonomous vehicle company, has rebooted. When Motional paused its operations last year, I wasn’t sure it was going to survive. Other AV companies with big backers have seen their funding disappear in a blink, so it was certainly plausible. But the company is here and with a new AI-first approach. Before you roll your eyes at that term, take a read of my article, which includes a demo ride and an interview with CEO Laura Major. Then feel free to hit my inbox with your thoughts.

New York governor Kathy Hochul plans to introduce legislation that would effectively legalize robotaxis in the state with the exception of New York City. No details on this yet; I’ve been told it will all be revealed in her executive budget proposal next week. What we do know is the proposal is designed to expand the state’s existing AV pilot program to allow for “the limited deployment of commercial for-hire autonomous passenger vehicles outside New York City.” My article delves deeper into what she shared and gives an update on Waymo’s NYC permit.

Tesla is ditching the one-time fee option for its Full Self-driving (Supervised) software and will now sell access to the feature through a monthly subscription.

On-demand drone delivery company Wing is bringing its service to another 150 Walmart stores as part of an expanded partnership with the retailer.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A report from market intelligence firm Similarweb suggests that Meta’s Threads is now seeing more daily usage than Elon Musk’s X on mobile devices. While X still dominates Threads on the web, the Threads mobile app for iOS and Android has continued to see an increase in daily active users over the past several months.

Similarweb’s data shows that Threads had 141.5 million daily active users on iOS and Android as of January 7, 2026, after months of growth, while X has 125 million daily active users on mobile devices.

This appears to be the result of longer-term trends, rather than a reaction to the recent X controversies, where users were discovered using the platform’s integrated AI, Grok, to create non-consensual nude images of women, including, sometimes minors. Concern around the deepfake images has now prompted California’s attorney general to open an investigation into Grok, following similar investigations by other regions, like the UK, EU, India, Brazil, and many more.

The drama on X also led social networking startup Bluesky to see an increase in app installs in recent days.

Instead, Threads’ boost in daily mobile usage may be driven by other factors, including cross-promotions from Meta’s larger social apps like Facebook and Instagram (where Threads is regularly advertised to existing users), its focus on creators, and the rapid rollout of new features. Over the past year, Threads has added features like interest-based communities, better filters, DMs, long-form text, disappearing posts, and has recently been spotted testing games.

Combined, the daily active user increases suggest that more people are using Threads on mobile as a more regular habit.

According to Meta’s official numbers, the tech giant said in August 2025 that Threads had reached over 400 million monthly active users. The company subsequently reported in October of last year that Threads had 150 million daily active users.

The growth trends have been continuing for many months. Similarweb last summer reported that Threads was closing the gap with X on mobile devices after seeing 127.8% year-over-year growth as of late June 2025.

Relatedly, Similarweb observed that X is still ahead of Threads in the U.S., but the gap is narrowing. A year ago, X had twice as many daily active users in the U.S. as it does now.

In addition, Threads has little traction on the web while X maintains a fairly steady web audience with around 150 million daily web visits, according to Similarweb data. As of earlier this week (January 13), X was seeing 145.4 million daily web visits, while Threads saw 8.5 million daily web visits across Threads.com and Threads.net combined.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The weather in Las Vegas wasn’t looking good. The plan had been that each employee of YC-backed Bucket Robotics would carry parts of their booth in their luggage to the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show. But CEO and founder Matt Puchalski didn’t want to take the chance that one (or all) of their flights would be delayed. So he rented a Hyundai Santa Fe and packed it up.

“It was… it was tight,” he said with a laugh on the show floor.

It took 12 hours driving in the rain, but the gear – and Puchalski – made it safely to Las Vegas, and so began the young company’s first-ever CES.

San Francisco-based Bucket Robotics was just one of thousands of companies exhibiting at the annual tech conference, a speck of sand on a beach full of products and promises. But despite its modest setup in the automotive-focused West Hall, Puchalski said the trip was worth it.

Part of that was a willingness to be tireless, observant, and always ready to pitch.

An engineer by trade, Puchalski spent most of the last decade working on autonomous vehicles at Uber, Argo AI, Ford’s subsidiary Latitude AI, and SoftBank-backed Stack AV.

At those jobs, Puchalski developed deep connections in the automotive industry, and we crossed paths all week.

There he was at an industry networking party one night. On another night, in my hotel lobby at 10 p.m., he was debating how to balance quality and manufacturing yield with Sanjay Dastoor — founder of mobility startups Skip and Boosted, both of which also got off the ground at YC.

But I first ran into Puchalski during breakfast at the hotel. Seated at the table next to me, he and sales associate Max Joseph were running through preparations for the conference’s “Media Day” over (allegedly) cage-free eggs.

Puchalski’s verve piqued my interest, and after making an intro, he told me what Bucket Robotics is up to. Before I knew it, he had cracked open a bright yellow Pelican case and I was holding a small piece of plastic.

Started as part of YC’s Spring 2024 batch, Bucket Robotics is all about using advanced vision systems to do quality inspections, specifically for surfaces. The goal is to automate a menial task that Puchalski joked is usually done by “dudes in Wisconsin,” and to accelerate the broad, multi-industry effort to onshore manufacturing.

One example Puchalski offered was car door handles. It’s a part customers touch every day, so it needs to be structurally sound, and that kind of quality inspection is basically solved.

But it can be challenging to make sure the surface is flawless. Is the color right? Are there any burn or scuff marks? These are the questions Bucket Robotics wants to answer.

“It’s deeply hard to automate these types of challenges without huge volumes of data, so auto manufacturers just throw dudes in Wisconsin at this problem,” he said.

Bucket Robotics solves that data problem by working from the CAD files for a particular part. It then generates a bunch of simulated defects – burn marks, bumps, breaks – so that its vision software can detect those problems quickly on a production line.

There’s no need for manual labeling, and the company claims its models can deploy “in minutes” while also adapting if products or production lines change. One of the big selling points to date is that Bucket Robotics can integrate into existing production lines without adding new hardware, Puchalski said.

This has already attracted customers in automotive and in defense, setting up Bucket Robotics to pursue the increasingly popular path of becoming a “dual-use” company.

When the show floor opened, the first two hours were “intense,” Puchalski said. Attendees in suits snooped around the startup’s tables, plucked orange stickers with the Bucket Robotics logo, and quizzed the employees about their tech.

More importantly, Puchalski said the level of interest stayed consistent throughout the week. He had “real technical discussions” with people from the worlds of manufacturing, robotics, and automation. He said Friday that he’s spent the week since the show on follow-up calls with prospective customers and investors.

CES can be a slog, but Bucket Robotics survived. Now comes the actual hard part: building a business, scaling, fundraising, and striking commercial deals.

As for the “dudes in Wisconsin,” Puchalski doesn’t see his company as a threat to their livelihoods. Those jobs are just as much about spotting defects as they are about identifying the root cause of the problem, he said.

And besides, Puchalski added, automating surface quality inspection is something that the manufacturing industry has been trying to do for decades.

“So when we go to our customers, it’s incredibly exciting,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’re at all concerned about privacy, the rise of AI personal assistants can feel alarming. It’s difficult to use one without sharing personal information, which is retained by the model’s parent company. With OpenAI already testing advertising, it’s easy to imagine the same data collection that fuels Facebook and Google creeping into your chatbot conversations.

A new project, launched in December by Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike, is showing what a privacy-conscious AI service might look like. Confer is designed to look and feel like ChatGPT or Claude, but the backend is arranged to avoid data collection, with the open-source rigor that makes Signal so trusted. Your Confer conversations can’t be used to train the model or target ads, for the simple reason that the host will never have access to them.

For Marlinspike, those protections are a response to the intimate nature of the service.

“It’s a form of technology that actively invites confession,” says Marlinspike. “Chat interfaces like ChatGPT know more about people than any other technology before. When you combine that with advertising, it’s like someone paying your therapist to convince you to buy something.”

Ensuring that privacy requires several different systems working in concert.

First, Confer encrypts messages to and from the system using the WebAuthn passkey system. (Unfortunately, that standard works best on mobile devices or Macs running Sequoia, although you can also make it work on Windows or Linux with a password manager.) On the server side, all Confer’s inference processing is done in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), with remote attestation systems in place to verify the system hasn’t been compromised. Inside that, there’s an array of open-weight foundation models handling whatever query comes in.

The result is a lot more complicated than a standard inference setup (which is fairly complicated already), but it delivers on Confer’s basic promise to users. As long as those protections are in place, you can have sensitive conversations with the model without any information leaking out.

Confer’s free tier is limited to 20 messages a day and five active chats. Users willing to pay $35 a month will get unlimited access, along with more advanced models and personalization. That’s quite a bit more than ChatGPT’s Plus plan — but privacy doesn’t come cheap.

            <h2>Why Silicon Valley is really talking about fleeing California (it’s not the 5%)</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/why-silicon-valley-is-really-talking-about-fleeing-california-its-not-the-5/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’ve been following the billionaire exodus from California with some confusion, here’s what’s actually driving the nervousness: it’s not the 5% rate. As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.

Take Larry Page, who about 3% of Google but controls roughly 30% of its voting power through dual-class stock. Under this proposal, he’d owe taxes on that 30%. For a company valued in the hundreds of billions, that’s a lot more than a rounding error. The Post reports that one SpaceX alumni founder building grid technology would face a tax bill at the Series B stage of the company that would wipe out his entire holdings.

David Gamage, the University of Missouri law professor who helped craft the proposal, thinks Silicon Valley is overreacting. “I don’t understand why the billionaires just aren’t calling good tax lawyers,” he told The San Francisco Standard this week. Gamage insists founders wouldn’t be forced to sell. Those with most of their wealth in private stock could open a deferral account for assets they don’t want taxed immediately — California would instead take 5% whenever those shares are eventually sold. “If your startup fails, you pay nothing,” he explained. “But if your startup is the next Google, you’re giving California a share of your gamble.” He also said founders could submit alternative valuations from certified appraisers reflecting what shares could actually sell for, rather than being stuck with the default voting-control formula.

But that’s pretty small consolation. For startups that aren’t publicly traded, calculating valuations is “inherently difficult,” tax expert Jared Walczak told the Post. “These are not clear cut—you could come to a very different conclusion not because of dishonesty.” And if the state disagrees with your appraisal, it’s not just the company on the hook; the state can also penalize the person who calculated the valuation. Even with alternative appraisals, founders would still face enormous tax bills on control they hold but wealth they haven’t realized.

Now, if you’ve been under a rock: California’s health care union is pushing a ballot initiative for a one-time 5% tax on anyone worth over $1 billion. The union argues it’s necessary to offset the deep cuts to health care that President Trump signed into law last year, including slashes to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. As originally envisioned, they expect to raise about $100 billion from roughly 200 individuals and the tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026.

But the resistance is fierce and bipartisan. As reported last weekend by the WSJ, Silicon Valley elite have formed a Signal chat called “Save California” that includes everyone from Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks to Kamala Harris mega-donor Chris Larsen. They’ve called the proposal “Communism” and “poorly defined.” Some are taking just-in-case measures, too, with Larry Page reportedly dropping $173.4 million on two Miami waterfront properties across last month and the first week of the new year, and Peter Thiel’s firm leasing Miami office space last month. (Thiel has had ties to Miami for years — including a home — but an uncharacteristic press release about the move was seemingly meant to send a message.)

Even Governor Gavin Newsom is fighting it. “This will be defeated, there’s no question in my mind,” he told the New York Times this week, adding that he’d been “relentlessly working behind the scenes” against the proposal. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”

For now, the union isn’t backing down. “We’re simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives,” said executive committee member Debru Carthan to the Journal last weekend. “The few who left have shown the world just how outrageously greedy they truly are.”

The proposal needs 875,000 signatures to make November’s ballot, where it would need a simple majority to pass.

            <h2>Who gets to inherit the stars? A space ethicist on what we’re not talking about</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/who-gets-to-inherit-the-stars-a-space-ethicist-on-what-were-not-talking-about/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In October, at a tech conference in Italy, Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos predicted that millions of people will be living in space “in the next couple of decades” and “mostly,” he’d said, “because they want to,” because robots will be more cost-effective than humans for doing the actual work in space.

No doubt that’s why my ears perked up when, at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco weeks later, I found an on-stage prediction by Will Bruey, the founder of space manufacturing startup Varda Space Industries, so striking. Rather than robots doing the work as Bezos envisioned, Bruey said that within 15 to 20 years, it will be cheaper to send a “working-class human” to orbit for a month than to develop better machines.

In the moment, few in the tech-forward audience seemed taken aback at what many might consider a provocative statement about cost savings. But that raised questions for me – and it has certainly raised questions for others – about who, exactly, will be working among the stars, and under what conditions.

To explore these questions, I spoke this week with Mary-Jane Rubenstein, dean of social sciences and professor of religion and science and technology studies at Wesleyan University. Rubenstein is the author of the book Worlds Without End: The Many Lives of the Multiverse, which director Daniel Kwan used as research for the award-winning 2022 film “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” More recently, she’s been examining the ethics of space expansion.

Rubenstein’s response to Bruey’s prediction cuts to a fundamental issue – which is power imbalance.”Workers already have a hard enough time on Earth paying their bills and keeping themselves safe . . . and insured,” she told me. “And that dependence on our employers only increases dramatically when one is dependent on one’s employer not just for a paycheck and sometimes for health care, but also for basic access, to food and to water – and also to air.”

Her assessment of space as a workplace was pretty direct. While it’s easy to romanticize space as an escape to a pristine frontier where people will float weightlessly among the stars, it’s worth remembering there are no oceans or mountains or chirpy birds in space. It’s “not nice up there,” said Rubenstein. “It is not nice at all.”

But worker protections aren’t Rubenstein’s only concern. There’s also the increasingly contentious question of who owns what in space – a legal gray area that’s becoming more problematic as commercial space operations accelerate.

The 1967 Outer Space Treaty established that no nation could claim sovereignty over celestial bodies. The moon, Mars, asteroids – these are supposed to belong to all of humanity. But in 2015, the U.S. passed the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act, which says that while you can’t own the moon, you can own whatever you extract from it. Silicon Valley got starry-eyed almost immediately; the law opened the door to commercial exploitation of space resources, even as the rest of the world watched with concern.

Rubenstein offers an analogy: It’s like saying you can’t own a house, but you can own everything inside it. Actually, she corrects herself, saying it’s worse than that. “It’s more like saying you can’t own the house, but you can have the floorboards and the beams. Because the stuff that is in the moon is the moon. There’s no difference between the stuff the moon contains and the moon itself.”

Companies have been positioning themselves to exploit this framework for some time. AstroForge is pursuing asteroid mining.  Interlune wants to extract Helium-3 from the moon. The problem is that these aren’t renewable resources. “Once the U.S. takes [the Helium-3], China can’t get it,” says Rubenstein. “Once China takes it, the U.S. can’t get it.”

The international reaction to that 2015 act was swift. At the 2016 UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) meeting, Russia called the it a unilateral violation of international law. Belgium warned about global economic imbalances.

In response, the U.S. in 2020 created the Artemis Accords – bilateral agreements with allied nations that formalized the American interpretation of space law, particularly around resource extraction. Countries worried about being left out of the new space economy signed on. There are now 60 signatories, though notably Russia and China are not among them.

There is grumbling in the background, though. “This is one of those instances of the U.S. setting rules and then asking other people to join in or be left out,” Rubenstein says. The Accords don’t say resource extraction is explicitly legal – just that it doesn’t constitute the “national appropriation” that the Outer Space Treaty forbids. It’s a careful dance around a fraught issue.

Her proposed solution to addressing it is straightforward if exceedingly unlikely: hand control back to the UN and COPUOS. In the absence of that, she suggests repealing the Wolf Amendment, a 2011 law that essentially bans NASA and other federal agencies from using federal funds to work with China or Chinese-owned companies without explicit FBI certification and Congressional approval.

When people tell Rubenstein that collaboration with China is impossible, she has a ready response: “We’re talking about an industry that is saying things like, ‘It’ll totally be possible to house thousands of people in a space hotel,’ or ‘It’ll be possible within 10 years to ship a million people to Mars, where there’s no air and where the radioactivity will give you cancer in a second and where your blood will boil and your face will fall off.’ If it’s possible to imagine doing those things, I think it is possible to imagine the U.S. talking to China.”

Rubenstein’s broader concern is about what we’re choosing to do with space. She sees the current approach – turning the moon into what she calls “a cosmic gas station,” mining asteroids, establishing warfare capabilities in orbit – as profoundly misguided.

Science fiction has given us different templates for imagining space, she notes. She divides the genre into three broad categories. First, there’s the “conquest” genre, or stories written “in service of the expansion of a nation-state or the expansion of capital,” treating space as the next frontier to conquer, just as European explorers once viewed new continents.

Then there’s dystopian science fiction, meant as warnings about destructive paths. But here’s where something odd happens: “Some tech companies seem to sort of miss the joke in this dystopian genre and just sort of actualize whatever the warning was,” she says.

The third strand uses space to imagine alternative societies with different ideas of justice and care –  what Rubenstein calls “speculative fiction” in a “high-tech key,” meaning they use futuristic technological settings as their framework.

When it first became clear which template was dominating actual space development (fully in the conquest category), she got depressed. “This seemed to me a real missed opportunity for extending the values and priorities that we have in this world into those realms that we have previously reserved for thinking in different kinds of ways.”

Rubenstein isn’t expecting dramatic policy shifts anytime soon, but she sees some realistic paths forward. One is tightening environmental regulations for space actors; as she notes, we’re only beginning to understand how rocket emissions and re-entering debris affect the ozone layer we spent decades repairing.

A more promising opportunity, though, is space debris. With more than 40,000 trackable objects now circling Earth at 17,000 miles per hour, we’re approaching the Kessler effect – a runaway collision scenario that could make orbit unusable for any future launches. “Nobody wants that,” she says. “The U.S. government doesn’t want that. China doesn’t want it. The industry doesn’t want it.” It’s rare to find an issue where every stakeholder’s interests align perfectly, but “space garbage is bad for everybody,” she notes.

She’s now working on a proposal for an annual conference bringing together academics, NASA representatives, and industry figures to discuss how to approach space “mindfully, ethically, collaboratively.”

Whether anyone will listen is another question. There certainly doesn’t seem to be much motivation to come together on the issue. In fact, back in July of last year, Congress introduced legislation to make the Wolf Amendment permanent, which would entrench restrictions on China cooperation rather than loosen them.

In the background, startup founders are projecting major changes in space within five to ten years, companies are positioning themselves to mine asteroids and the moon, and Bruey’s prediction about blue-collar workers in orbit hangs in the air, unanswered.

            <h2><em>SNL</em> Aces the <em>Heated Rivalry</em> Meme</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/snl-heated-rivalry-harry-potter-spoof/685672/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The reference points were readily identifiable: a chance meeting between characters from different worlds, a sport involving sticks and a flying round projectile whose nuances would be lost on the average American. Yep, Saturday Night Live was doing yet another Harry Potter sketch—but this time with a spicy twist.

As those descriptions—and the furtive glances exchanged by last night’s host, Finn Wolfhard, and the SNL cast member Ben Marshall, playing Potter and Ron Weasley—implied, a page-to-screen sensation of a more recent vintage was also being spoofed. Count SNL’s writers among the many HBO Max watchers who have jumped on the Heated Rivalry bandwagon, giving us the pretaped sketch “Heated Wizardry,” an elaborate, meme-ready mash-up of J. K. Rowling’s wizarding world and the streaming show based on Rachel Reid’s hockey-themed gay romance series.

For “Heated Wizardry” to land, viewers had to have at least a passing familiarity with each story’s component parts: the enemies-turned-lovers arc of Reid’s protagonists, Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov; the broad strokes of Rowling’s boarding school for magical kids. Fans of the former could get a kick out of seeing Wolfhard and Marshall in saucy stretching poses previously struck by the Heated Rivalry stars Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams. Fans of the latter could enjoy the realization of online fan-fiction fantasies pairing Harry with his best friend. And the gags kept coming: Harry and Ron canoodling beneath an invisibility cloak; barely coded sexts sent via owl; Jason Momoa, popping up as Hagrid, punning on the name of Harry and Ron’s classmate Neville Longbottom.

The most telling joke rested in a fake blurb from the equally fake website Hornymuggles.net—“Finally, finally, yes!”—mocking the unwavering attachment of Harry Potter fans. The seventh and final Potter novel was published in 2007, and the eight-part film franchise it inspired wrapped in 2011. But in today’s TV and movie environment, fans, studios, and streamers can’t let any story end. That’s how an in-world textbook from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone became a fundraising tie-in that launched a full-fledged trilogy of shoddy Fantastic Beasts movies, and why the books are being refashioned into what HBO envisions as a decade-long TV series.

The potential for endless extension is especially true of anything as massively popular and lucrative as Stranger Things, the recently concluded Netflix show that launched Wolfhard’s career. Stranger Things’ transformation—from a charming homage to ’80s blockbusters to a sprawling transmedia franchise—was ribbed later in last night’s episode, in a commercial parody imagining a string of continuations. The final beat was dedicated to devotees who had such a hard time letting go that they whipped up the viral rumor of a “secret” series finale.

That flurry of (to quote the sketch) “sequels, prequels, requels, and spin-offs” lampooned another property that HBO’s corporate parent keeps reviving: Sex and the City. Jumping off from the actual ending of Stranger Things—in which Wolfhard’s character realizes his writerly ambitions—SNL dropped the actor and his co-stars Gaten Matarazzo and Caleb McLaughlin into ’90s New York City. Over cosmos, they traded the kind of cheeky banter that defined the interactions among Carrie Bradshaw and her friends across 94 episodes, two movies, a YA origin story adapted into a show on the CW network, and an HBO Max follow-up series.

Heated Rivalry could be destined for a similar drawn-out fate. The Canadian streaming platform Crave, which first aired the show in November, has ordered a second season. And the show’s source material, Reid’s Game Changers series, has included six novels thus far and features plenty of other couples who could take to the ice on-screen. A seventh Game Changers installment is due this fall. Seven books? That sounds like something a premium TV service and its subscribers could keep a good, heavily suggestive grip on for at least 10 years.</div>

            <h2>‘Abolish ICE’ Is Back</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/abolish-ice-democrats-defund-police/685665/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">History might not repeat itself, but the slogans sometimes do. And in the days since an ICE officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis, some Democratic candidates and commentators have joined in on a familiar refrain. “Dismantling ICE is the moderate position,” Graham Platner, the U.S. Senate candidate in Maine, said in a statement on X. “If Trump’s ICE is shooting and kidnapping people, then abolish it,” wrote Jack Schlossberg, a candidate for Congress in New York. Even Bill Kristol, the erstwhile Republican turned Trump critic, logged on to share a simple, straightforward message: “Abolish ICE.”

A growing number of Americans disagree with how the agency is handling its mission. But where many Democrats hear “Abolish ICE” as a righteous call to action, others in the party register the clanging of alarm bells. These anxious Democrats believe that such a maximalist demand plays directly into Republicans’ hands by making the party seem unserious about immigration. Some of them are pleading with members of their party to avoid adopting the motto. “Unless you truly believe that the United States should not have an agency that enforces immigration and customs laws,” reads a memo from the center-left think tank Searchlight Institute, “you should not say you want to abolish ICE.”

The slogan conjures a not-so-distant time in American politics when even the highest-profile Democrats, under pressure from progressives, embraced a host of deeply unpopular positions, including defunding the police and decriminalizing border crossings. Many members of the party blame this period, at least in part, for the return of Donald Trump—and they’re desperate not to relive it. “Oh my God. Déja vú all over again,” Lis Smith, a national party strategist, told me when I asked about the slogan. “Sigh,” Lanae Erickson, a senior vice president at the center-left think tank Third Way, texted me. “Can that be my on the record quote?”

“Abolish ICE” went mainstream in 2018 amid public outrage over the Trump administration separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border. The slogan, embraced widely by progressives, quickly became a litmus test for candidates running in Democratic-leaning districts across the country. But the movement was never especially popular among the broader American electorate, and its proponents could never seem to agree about whether the phrase meant abolishing ICE forever, or abolishing it and replacing it with something else. Critics worried that adopting the phrase hurt Democratic credibility on immigration, an issue on which the party already suffered from low public trust. Eventually, even the activist who helped popularize the slogan in 2018 mostly abandoned it.

Eight years later, as masked men patrol neighborhoods far from the southern border, calls to dismantle ICE are resonating differently. In the days since an ICE officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, stories have circulated of federal agents (from both ICE and Border Patrol) pepper-spraying and tear-gassing families and students, and shoving a protester into oncoming traffic. Photos have shown neighborhoods filled with tear gas. A Texas medical examiner is likely, The Washington Post recently reported, to classify an ICE detainee’s recent death as a homicide.

Polling suggests that Americans don’t like what they’re seeing: Roughly 57 percent say they disapprove of how ICE is handling immigration enforcement; about half believe that ICE is making cities less safe. And two polls taken after Good’s killing show that support for abolishing ICE has increased about 13 percent since July 2019. Even Joe Rogan, the high-profile podcast host who endorsed Trump in 2024, seems disillusioned. “Are we really gonna be the Gestapo?” Rogan asked this week. “‘Where’s your papers?’ Is that what we’ve come to?” (The Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told me in a statement that ICE “will continue to carry out immigration enforcement for the safety of Americans who have been victimized by rapists, murderers, drug traffickers, and gang members.” In response to Rogan, McLaughlin said on Fox News that the agency has to have a presence in Minneapolis “because we don’t have state and local law enforcement’s help.”)

Most Democrats have not called for ICE’s outright abolition. But a few are recent adopters of the slogan. “I was of the belief that perhaps we could reform ICE. Now I am of the belief that it has to be dismantled as an entity,” Representative Adriano Espaillat of New York said last week. Michigan’s Representative Shri Thanedar, who in June was one of 75 Democrats who signed legislation expressing “gratitude” for ICE, just introduced the Abolish ICE Act. Other progressive members of Congress have been on this particular train for years. Representatives Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley have all reiterated their demands to abolish the agency in the past week. “I made this call back in 2018, and that’s because I saw where this agency was going,” Abdul El-Sayed, a U.S. Senate candidate in Michigan, told me. Trump is “trying to create an independent, domestic source of state power answerable only to him.” By now, he added, ICE is “corrupted beyond repair.”

A common belief among ICE’s critics is that no amount of funding or training can fix the agency. Abolition “is the baseline at a certain point,” Usamah Andrabi, the communications director at the progressive group Justice Democrats, told me. The organization works to unseat Democratic incumbents who aren’t sufficiently progressive, and will be focused on that goal as the 2026 primaries intensify. Democrats “need to heed the calls” of the people they represent, Andrabi said, and many of those people “are demanding that we abolish ICE.”

All of this is nightmare fuel for a certain type of Democrat—namely, the kind who is focused on winning elections in swing states and purple districts. These Democrats believe that the mayhem caused by ICE’s raids gives the party an uncharacteristic upper hand over Republicans on immigration—and that demands to eliminate the agency erase that leverage. Americans mostly support immigration-enforcement efforts and, in particular, the deportation of unauthorized immigrants with violent criminal records.

“When you say ‘Abolish ICE,’ that means you’re abolishing the agency that’s in charge of enforcing immigration law in this country,” Tré Easton, the vice president for public policy at the Searchlight Institute, told me. “Especially in a time when Democrats don’t have a lot of credibility on the immigration issue, it’s really, really, a fraught path that they should not go down.” Easton and others argue that the demands to abolish ICE are akin to the calls to “defund the police” that progressives made in 2020 after the killing of George Floyd. Both slogans appeared in response to terrible abuses of power, they say, but both were overcorrections. As with police, “the question is not whether ICE should exist; the question is whether they should follow the laws and be held accountable,” Erickson, from Third Way, told me.

The fight over “Abolish ICE” can feel like semantics—and it sort of is. Strategists at the Searchlight Institute and Third Way have asked their fellow Democrats to please avoid saying “Abolish ICE” and instead to advocate for reforming it and retraining agents. They argue that Democratic leaders could use subpoenas, congressional hearings, and appropriations riders to hold ICE to account—and to make a broader argument about public safety. Some of them point to Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona as an example of an effective messenger: ICE is “out of control,” Gallego said in a recent interview. “People want a slimmed-down ICE that is truly focused on security.”

Somewhat surprisingly, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who ran for Congress in 2018 on a promise to abolish ICE, has in recent days reframed the issue as a question of funding. “The cuts to your health care are what’s paying for this,” she said of Congress letting health-care subsidies expire and increasing funding for ICE and other agencies. “You get screwed over to pay a bunch of thugs in the street that are shooting mothers in the face.” That interview “is what highly effective messaging on ICE can look like—without saying ‘abolish ICE,’” Adam Jentleson, the president of the Searchlight Institute, wrote on X. (Ocasio-Cortez says she does still support shutting down the agency.)

The overarching concern for Democrats like Jentleson is that members of their party seem not to have absorbed a crucial lesson from recent elections: that Republicans can and will use Democrats’ own words against them. In 2022, for example, former Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes lost his challenge to Senator Ron Johnson by only a hair, after it came to light that Barnes had previously signaled support for abolishing ICE and defunding the police. (Barnes, in his current campaign for governor, has steered clear of the issue.) Vice President Kamala Harris’s own mixed record on immigration was fodder for Republicans. During the 2024 election cycle, which famously did not turn out well for Harris or her party, Republicans spent $741 million on immigration-related ads, according to an estimate from the nonpartisan policy organization America Forward.

Now, as then, Republicans are eager to exploit “Abolish ICE.” Democrats “don’t want our border secured or criminal illegal aliens being removed,” and want to defund “federal law-enforcement agencies who are protecting public safety,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a press briefing after Good’s killing. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told reporters this week that Democrats “have been for open borders” for years.

Notably, none of the leading 2028 presidential contenders has demanded that ICE be dismantled. Aside from Platner and El-Sayed, Democratic Senate candidates have stuck with calls for reform and for an investigation into Good’s killing. Still, as ICE expands operations in Minneapolis and beyond, and as anti-ICE protests intensify, it’s reasonable to anticipate more viral videos, outrage, and allegations of violence. Which means it’s also reasonable to expect that Democratic primary candidates will face pressure to condemn the agency in the strongest possible terms. How these Democrats decide to respond may help determine their party’s fate in November.</div>

            <h2>Why the Trump Administration Is Obsessed With Whole Milk</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/whole-milk-saturated-fat-trump-kennedy/685669/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Milk is mundane in most contexts, but you can’t help noticing when it is smeared across the upper lips of America’s government officials. An image of Donald Trump sporting a milk mustache and glowering over a glass of milk was just one of many dairy-themed posts shared by government accounts on X during the past week, all of which made clear that the milk was whole. In one video, a seemingly AI-generated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. takes a sip and is transported to a nightclub, suddenly milk-mustachioed; in another, former Housing Secretary Ben Carson raises a glass of full-fat and sports a white ’stache. The upper lips of the former collegiate swimmer Riley Gaines and the former NBA player Enes Kantor Freedom, among other personalities embraced by the right, also got the whole-milk treatment.

The posts were shared to celebrate a big month for whole milk. On January 7, the Department of Agriculture released its updated Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which newly recommend whole dairy over low-fat products, and placed a carton of whole milk near the top of a revamped, upside-down food pyramid. Then, on Wednesday, President Trump signed into law a bill allowing schools to serve whole milk after more than a decade of being restricted to low-fat.

Medical professionals, who have long advised people to avoid full-fat dairy because it contains high levels of saturated fat, were generally critical of the new dietary guidelines for milk. But Kennedy and Trump, along with other government officials, have framed it as a major win for health. Kennedy recently argued that America’s children have been missing out on key nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D because they don’t want to drink the low-fat milk served in schools. The new law, he said at its signing, embodies the new dietary guidelines’ directive to “eat real food.”

The low-fat-versus-whole controversy is a real, active scientific debate. For roughly the past two decades, reduced-fat milk (2 percent milk fat, by weight) has dominated American refrigerators largely thanks to fears about fat in general, and saturated fat in particular. Copious research has linked saturated-fat intake with health issues including cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as death from all causes. It also leads to higher LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, which has been shown to cause strokes and heart attacks, Kyla Lara-Breitinger, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic, told me.

Saturated fat generally isn’t a huge concern for children, so giving them the option to drink whole milk at school is somewhat less fraught, Steven Abrams, a child-nutrition expert and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told me. And some researchers propose that, because whole milk is more satiating, kids who drink it are less likely to reach for other high-calorie foods. “Full-fat dairy is especially important for kids ages 12 months to 10 years to meet energy needs and promote brain development,” a spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture wrote in an email. But the AAP holds that kids should switch to drinking low-fat or skim at age 2.

In contrast to most nutritionists, Kennedy is all in on saturated fat, championing foods such as butter, beef tallow, and red meat. At a press conference to announce the new dietary guidelines, Kennedy proclaimed that the government was “ending the war on saturated fats.” The reality is more confusing. The new dietary guidelines promote more foods that are high in saturated fat, but they retain the old recommendation to limit daily saturated-fat intake to 10 percent of total calories, or about 20 grams a day in a 2,000-calorie diet. A single cup of whole milk has 5 grams. If a person consumes the recommended three daily servings of full-fat dairy, it would be “pretty close to impossible” to stay within the saturated fat limit, Caitlin Dow, a senior nutrition scientist at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, told me. (The White House and the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.)

A relatively new and controversial school of thought posits that full-fat milk isn’t as harmful as other sources of saturated fat. A 2018 study that involved participants from 21 countries found that dairy consumption—even whole-fat dairy—was negatively correlated with mortality and major cardiovascular-disease events. Other studies have shown that the consumption of whole-fat dairy is linked to decreased diabetes risk and doesn’t cause weight gain. “There’s no convincing evidence that low-fat dairy is preferable to whole-fat dairy for any health outcome,” Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist at Tufts University who was a co-author on the 2018 study, told me. The broader research community has so far resisted this idea, but has acknowledged that the science on dairy fat has become more complex. “The reason you’re getting so many conflicting opinions is that the evidence is very controversial,” Lara-Breitinger said, noting the lack of randomized clinical trials comparing whole-fat and low-fat dairy.

Ultimately, milk isn’t “going to make or break a diet,” Dow said. Dairy makes up just 10 percent of the average American’s caloric intake, and most of that is cheese. Even for kids, very real concerns, such as obesity and diabetes, will probably not be solved—or meaningfully exacerbated—by a switch to whole milk. “You could probably have either low-fat or whole-fat, and it doesn’t matter,” Mozaffarian said.

As I have written previously, Americans have spent roughly the past 150 years quarreling about various aspects of milk, including its benefits, safety, and chemical composition. That’s partly because dairy is a powerful industry; last year, dairy products in the U.S. had an economic impact of nearly $780 billion. But since 2012, when the USDA under then-President Barack Obama required schools to serve only low-fat milk, student milk consumption has declined; according to the dairy industry, that’s because low-fat milk doesn’t taste as good. The Trump administration’s promotion of whole milk, Dow said, “really, really supports the dairy industry’s bottom line.” In fact, many of the reviewers of the new dietary guidelines were recently found to have ties to the beef and dairy industries. (When I asked the USDA about allegations of industry influence on the push for whole milk, the spokesperson asserted that the evidence “was evaluated based solely on scientific rigor, study design, consistency of findings, and biological plausibility.”)

Read: Milk has divided Americans for more than 150 years

Beyond serving as an economic engine, milk is a potent cultural symbol. It has long evoked an idealized past: a simpler time when cows roamed through pastures and produced pure, wholesome milk, and the Americans who tended them thrived in harmony with the natural world. Dairy companies have leaned into that aesthetic, featuring barns, fields, and words such as pure on milk cartons. Milk is also culturally linked to strength, wealth, and beauty, thanks in no small part to the celebrity-studded dairy ads of the late 20th century, including the “Got Milk?” campaign referenced by the Trump administration’s milk mustaches. Such positive associations make milk a powerful metaphor for what America could be—if certain unsavory elements of modernity could be undone or erased.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, this association has also been invoked in racist contexts for more than a century. In a 1923 speech, Herbert Hoover, who was then commerce secretary and would be elected president five years later, framed milk as a means to ensure “the very growth and virility of the white races.” Modern-day white nationalists and alt-right groups hold up dairy milk as a symbol of whiteness and masculinity, in contrast to soy milk, which they associate with the woke, feminist, multiracial left. (Yes, seriously.)

The idealized era of perfectly safe, perfectly wholesome dairy never really existed. “This whole idea that there was a time when we were healthy, and during that time we were eating steak and drinking whole milk, is not rooted in any reality,” Dow said. Nevertheless, it resonates with the MAHA and MAGA agendas, which both center on the belief that America will return to its former glory if it can re-create the past. The Trump administration’s endorsement of whole milk may nominally be about public health. But a recent White House post featuring a retro illustration of the president as an old-fashioned milkman, captioned “Make Whole Milk Great Again,” was all about aspiration—and the purified nation, untainted by modernity, that America could someday become.</div>

            <h2>Trump Doesn’t Want Legal Immigrants Either</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/trump-legal-immigration/685649/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Of the many recent targets of the Trump administration’s ire—Jerome Powell, Denmark, Minneapolis—legal immigration may have been the least conspicuous and most consequential. On Wednesday, the State Department announced that it would “pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates.” The countries affected include Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Pakistan, and Nigeria. Among other measures taken to slash legal immigration in 2025, the Trump administration imposed travel restrictions or entry bans on people from 39 countries. Plot all of these countries on a map—newly targeted and old—and you will see that most of Africa, large swaths of Asia, and much of the Muslim world are now unwelcome. Western Europe is unscathed.

The Trump administration is not merely stomping out illegal immigration. It is trying, by executive fiat, to return America to the harsh quotas and nation-based restrictions that lasted from 1921 to 1965. In MAGA mythology, these were America’s glorious decades. Stephen Miller, one of the president’s most powerful advisers, romanticizes it as a period of prosperity and innovation, prematurely stalled because America decided to “open our borders to the entire third world for sixty years.” The plan is to return to a past that never really was—only to harm the future. Economic and technological progress depends on America’s continued attraction to the world’s best minds, which are not just in Western Europe.

The new policy affecting 75 countries does not restrict the flow of temporary visitors, including those arriving for business, education, and tourism. But it will prevent family members of American citizens—including spouses and young children—from receiving a visa or green card. Under what is known as the public-charge rule, authorities can reject applications from would-be immigrants who might seek government benefits if admitted. The Biden administration had weakened the public-charge rule when it decided to exclude noncash benefits, such as food stamps and Medicaid, from consideration. The new Trump policy goes beyond mere correction and represents a kind of collective punishment, presuming that all citizens of a country would fail to meet the criteria, whatever their individual circumstances.

It is unclear what calculations were made or formulas were followed in deciding which foreigners are too likely to be burdens. Recent research by Daniel DiMartino, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, has calculated the net fiscal impact—balancing future tax receipts against use of government programs—of various immigrant groups. He finds that the average Colombian migrant has a strongly positive fiscal impact, reducing national debt by $500,000 over 30 years, whereas “the most fiscally burdensome immigrants are Salvadorans, who increase the national debt by over $50,000 over 30 years.” Yet Colombians are now restricted, and Salvadorans are not.

The same traits—sloppy reasoning but a desire for collective punishment—animate other immigration-policy announcements. After the fatal shooting of a National Guard member in Washington, D.C., allegedly by an Afghan national, President Trump added several African countries to his travel-ban list. The administration employed the same logic when announcing in December that it had suspended the diversity-lottery visa program, created by Congress, because one of its recipients had allegedly killed two students at Brown University and one professor at MIT. The assailant was of Portuguese origin—but almost half of the recipients of the 55,000 green cards awarded annually by the program are from Africa. A crime committed by a single migrant is now a license for sweeping restrictions on prospective legal migrants.

Other policies convey the administration’s animus to migrants—first-generation, second-generation, low-skilled, high-skilled. Trump attempted to end birthright citizenship, a constitutional right guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, through one of the first executive orders of his second term. In September, Trump tried to impose a $100,000 surcharge on highly skilled immigrants pursuing an H-1B. (Courts have held up these efforts.) In December, The New York Times reported that the administration was setting targets of up to 200 denaturalization cases a month for foreign-born American citizens. The administration has also boasted about achieving net-negative immigration.

There are exceptions, of course. The refugee program has nearly ceased to exist, except for white Afrikaners from South Africa. State Department data show that from February to December, only 1,226 refugees were admitted into the country (less than 2 percent of the average rate of admission since the start of 1975). Of these, 86 percent were from South Africa. Certain kinds of globalists, the extremely wealthy kind, also are welcome in America after all. Foreigners who can afford either the Trump Gold Card (for $1 million) or, even better, the Trump Platinum Card (for $5 million) can obtain a visa. As an end run around Congress, which is normally the creator of new visa categories, these fees are technically voluntary gifts given to the Department of Commerce—like the expensive tchotchkes you had to buy in D.C. cannabis shops to receive a “gift” of marijuana.

The details differ, but the underlying anxieties of today’s immigration restrictionists are the same ones that motivated America to close its borders one century ago. In 1924, Calvin Coolidge signed the Johnson-Reed Act, which essentially banned immigration from the continents of Asia and Africa while also severely restricting immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe (then considered undesirable). “America must be kept American,” he said. An article Coolidge wrote in 1921 gives a better sense of his state of mind: “Our country must cease to be regarded as a dumping ground,” he argued. “There are racial considerations too grave to be brushed aside for any sentimental reasons. Biological laws tell us that certain divergent people will not mix or blend. The Nordics propagate themselves fully. With other races, the outcome shows deterioration on both sides.” Although Trump has made his preference for Nordic countries known, alongside his disgust with migrants from Somalia, explicit statements of this kind are, for the moment, confined to fringe figures in the MAGA movement, such as the white nationalist Nick Fuentes.

Unlike when it enacted the immigration restrictions of the 1920s, Congress has passed no specific act sanctioning Trump’s actions. In the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Republicans gave the president a huge influx of cash—$170 billion—for his immigration agenda, including ICE and the border wall. Trump is able to do what he likes because Congress has already turned over so much of its immigration authority to the executive branch. For example, the Immigration and Nationality Act lets the president suspend the entry of immigrants if he deems their presence “detrimental to the interest of the United States”—for as long as he wants. The Supreme Court has interpreted this delegation of authority as carte blanche. In December, a federal judge ruled that Trump had the authority to impose the $100,000 fee on H-1B visas.

Of course, that which is imposed by executive fiat can later be repealed by executive fiat. And America has arguably ping-ponged between two extremes of immigration policy. During Joe Biden’s term, the net number of migrants in the country grew by 6.8 million, most of them unauthorized, which pushed America’s share of foreign-born residents to its highest level ever. Border mismanagement, alongside Biden’s stubbornness and senescence, helped return Trump to the White House. A more rational immigration policy may emerge under a future president. But Trump has spent one year tightening the ratchet against legal immigration—an effort that will stymie the prosperity he seeks. He has three more years to do as he sees fit.</div>

            <h2>Take a Close Look at Trump’s Portrait</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/01/trumps-national-gallery-portrait/685666/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">“Why does he look so angry?” one visitor to the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., asked our guide, as if that were a question with an answer. The docent had finally stopped before the black-and-white photograph of a looming, glaring President Trump that dominates the entrance to the final rooms of the “America’s Presidents” exhibit. We had managed not to talk about him for several minutes, swerving left toward the bright, kinetic John F. Kennedy painted by the abstract expressionist Elaine de Kooning and then crossing right to view Kehinde Wiley’s portrait of Barack Obama—a calm, floating, saintlike figure surrounded by leaves and flowers.

But the president with the gorilla posture, knuckles firmly planted on the presidential desk, had to be dealt with. Someone else in our group asked why the Smithsonian had capitulated to Trump. Two days earlier, The Washington Post had broken the news that the National Portrait Gallery, which is overseen by the Smithsonian Institution, had swapped out an older portrait of Trump for the current one and put up a terse “tombstone” plaque that notes only the photographer’s name, Trump’s date of birth, and his years in office. All of the other presidential portraits in the gallery are accompanied by long assessments of each presidency, its successes and failures. They cite Andrew Johnson’s and Bill Clinton’s impeachments, and the label beside the previous Trump photograph mentioned Trump’s impeachments, too—but the new one, of course, does not. (That other photograph and caption can still be seen on the gallery website.)

Like some demonic trickster of folklore, Trump moves through the world robbing it of speech. The question about the Smithsonian’s capitulation left even our docent, a well-informed man, at a loss for words. He couldn’t address that, he said, but he could tell us a great deal about the desk in the Oval Office that Trump is leaning on: It is called the Resolute Desk because it was made from the oak timbers of the H.M.S. Resolute, a British Arctic-exploration ship.

The National Portrait Gallery spokesperson, noting that the museum had rotated in new Trump portraits before, dismissed the tweaks as routine. But when it comes to Trump and the preservation of historical memory, nothing is routine. The administration began pressuring the Smithsonian for changes almost as soon as Trump returned to office. In March, he signed an executive order demanding that the Smithsonian review its exhibitions for “improper ideology.” In May, Trump forced out the National Portrait Gallery’s director, Kim Sajet, on grounds of excessive partisanship. (He tried to fire her even though that was not within his power, and she resigned.) At the time, the White House wrote up its objections in a list obtained by The New York Times; one complained about the allusions to his impeachments. In July, the National Museum of American History took references to Trump’s impeachments out of its presidential exhibit. These were restored in August, but in watered-down form. Meanwhile, the National Portrait Gallery has said that it’s planning a larger “refresh” of the “America’s Presidents” exhibit and is exploring putting more tombstone labels there and elsewhere.

Many bad things are happening in America right now, and the suppression of wall text in an art museum, even a quasi-governmental one, is far from the worst of them. Yet both the uninformative label and the new portrait are worth lingering on, for two reasons. First, the fact that Trump’s impeachments were censored, and nothing else at the National Portrait Gallery has been—that we know of—is a reminder that although the administration couches its assaults on American institutions as a campaign against “wokeness,” what the president really cares about is his own reputation.

Second, Trump is a man who spends a lot of time shaping his image. Many unusual artistic choices had to be made to arrive at the official White House photo of his second administration, a snarling headshot lit from below that plays off the mug shot taken at the Georgia jailhouse in 2023, when Trump was booked on election-racketeering charges. (The official photo hangs in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.) “He’s very hands-on,” Shealah Craighead, the chief White House photographer during the first Trump administration, told The New York Times for an article about the inaugural photo. When Trump swapped photographs in the National Portrait Gallery, he was sending a message. Decoding it provides some small insight into why he feels the need to look so angry—though I suspect we’ll never understand that completely.

The first president in the “America’s Presidents” gallery is, of course, George Washington. His portrait was painted in 1796 by the artist Gilbert Stuart, who may be more famous for a different portrait of Washington, which became the face on the $1 bill. With this work, however, Stuart effectively invented the presidential portrait.

To the contemporary eye, Washington looks uncommonly grand; indeed, the style of composition is known as grand manner. The painting shows the full figure of the great leader, his already-large frame—he was more than 6 feet tall—exaggerated by a bigger-than-life 8-by-6-foot canvas. He stretches out his hand in the classical gesture of a man making a speech. (Stuart is thought to have based the pose on Washington’s 1795 address to Congress.) The furniture in the room is ornate and gilded. Lace cascades from his cuffs and neck. He holds a gold-handled saber.

But an 18th-century viewer familiar with European royal portraiture would have understood that even as Stuart was invoking its conventions, he was also defying them, endowing Washington with the authority of a head of state while differentiating him from a king. The historian David C. Ward calls the portrait “an explicitly antimonarchical work of art.” In lieu of regal robes, the president wears a plain black suit. Compared with the mighty swords that dangle by the side of European rulers, his saber is barely noticeable. The Federalist Papers rest on top of the table, the U.S. Constitution below. (The guide pointed out the Constitution, adding, “I’ll let you think about that.”)

Washington’s most presidential feature, though, is his expression. His lips are pressed into a faint grimace, but his eyes are calm and steady, gazing into the distance as if toward the future. This is not another proud autocrat, but an ardent visionary who is tamping himself down so as to model neutrality. He is a republican, which is the point. In a shaky union still divided over the question of federation, he unifies rather than divides; he may have led the nation in war, but here he seeks peace. The circumspect Washington embodies the ideal of government that had recently been put forth in The Federalist Papers: the maintenance of equilibrium through judicious balance. In the state, the balance is one of powers; in the statesman, it is of feelings about power. Here is a president who would know to step down after his second term.

Washington’s portrait sets the emotional tone of the exhibit; he is the benchmark of presidential temperament. Stuart also painted the half-length portrait of Thomas Jefferson, whose lips form the same tight line. His brow is heavier, though, and his eyes half-hooded. He seems remote, unknowable—a complicated man. James Madison has sagging jowls and a mournful gaze turned up toward God, suggesting that the co-author of The Federalist Papers had considerable gravitas. Aesthetically, the best portrait is that of Grover Cleveland; it also makes him very likable. Cleveland sits at a table messy with books and papers, leaning on one arm and looking up as if listening attentively. His legs are spread wide to accommodate his girth, and his expression is frank and open. He could be one of Frans Hals’s friendly tavern-goers.

The captions steer us toward interpretations of presidential affect. James Buchanan looks prissy and irresolute, especially after we learn that he “did little to prevent the first seven Southern states from seceding,” and that the Civil War broke out “only a few weeks after he had left office.” Gerald Ford faces us squarely in the canonical stance of the decent man. He granted amnesty to both Richard Nixon and Vietnam-draft evaders, and is the first to smile—faintly—in his presidential portrait. By the time we get to George W. Bush, the norms of self-presentation have relaxed even further: He sits on a low couch in his shirtsleeves. His uncertain electoral victory and failure to mitigate the effects of Hurricane Katrina make him sound like a lightweight, and his smile verges on pleading.

Only one other president projects anything like Trump’s aggression. That is a seated but powerful Theodore Roosevelt, his gaze fierce and his walrus mustache seeming to emphasize a downward turn of the lips. One hand clutches a riding whip; the other is balled into a fist. “An outsize personality who preached the benefits of the ‘strenuous life,’” the caption reads, “while also being among the most learned of presidents.”

The Trump photograph that was installed this month, however, occupies a whole other political universe—just like its subject. It is the third to go on display at the National Portrait Gallery during his second administration; he scowls in all three of them. (The scowl is “his favorite pose,” Craighead, the former White House photographer, also told the Times. “He doesn’t want to smile because it seems weak, is probably what he would say.”)

In the first of this term’s photos, displayed in early 2025 to mark his inauguration, Trump is seated at his desk and turns to look at us. We seem to be standing to his right, almost as his equals, and his left hand rests on the desk. In the second portrait, his dark suit recedes into a dark background, highlighting his loud red tie, but he clasps his hands calmly in front of him. To spot changes in the pitch of Trump’s ever-present bad temper, you have to look at the hands. That he leans into his fists in the portrait that is now hanging in the presidents gallery says everything you need to know. In the absence of curatorial guidance, nothing shields us from his naked belligerence. He invades the space and overpowers the viewer. I thought of ICE occupying blue-state cities. I felt certain that I was supposed to, though later I wondered whether I was supposed to think at all.

The photo informs us, wordlessly, that we have come under the rule of a monarch, and not just a monarch: a would-be tyrant. We don’t know what images, if any, influenced the photographer, Daniel Torok, but somewhere in the background lurks Hans Holbein the Younger’s most famous state portrait, a full-frontal depiction of Henry VIII, who, after he broke with the Catholic Church, became the head of his own church, laying claim to God-given authority.

The original Henry VIII portrait, painted in 1537, formed part of a mural that was lost in a fire, but in most of the copies made over the centuries, the king’s swollen face and massive body overwhelm the frame. A comically large codpiece pokes out between the folds of his skirt. One hand fingers the strap of a hanging dagger, and his eyes fix the viewer with a cold, appraising stare. Henry was egotistical and ruthless, and executed almost everyone who opposed him; the fierce, blunt portrait is said to have terrified his court. I’m sure he liked that.</div>

Many people will disagree with me, but I don&#39;t think patented ideas/concepts/inventions should be included in any standards.

If it&#39;s a standard it should be available for anyone who wants to make a compatible widget or device or program to use.  Anything &quot;restricted&quot; makes the standard less useful.

It&#39;s very lucrative for companies to get their patented things included in a standard, and they push for this to happen for just that reason.

But it should not be allowed.  If you have a patented idea, go ahead and develop it and license it as you choose.  But if you&#39;re developing a standard, keep your patent out of it.

Mostly I&#39;m surprised to learn that Acer still exists. Or perhaps the Acer computer company I dealt with more than 30 years ago disappeared and the name was picked up by someone else?

On your substance, this example might be relevant: If your book is adopted as a textbook in Japan, you lose your copyright.

All these companies are doing is the same thing people who steal music, movies, and software are doing. They&#39;re just availing themselves of the 1s and 0s without paying for them.  Since nothing is taken, there is no issue.

2,000 g&#39;s is definitely a ton of gravity.

Among them, two main units have the maximum capacity of 1900 gt, the maximum centrifugal acceleration of 1500 g and the maximum load of 32 t. So, this one can do max 1500 g for 1.26 ton, or 32t at 60g. It also says the largest outside of China are 1200 g*t.Here&#39;s a more detailed, if older article: https://www.zju.edu.cn/english...

What&#39;s the maximum gravity for something the size of a Saiyan? I know a guy who might be interested.

What is Saiyan? You simply divide 1900 tons by its mass (in tons) if it is less than or equal to 32 tons and there you are.

What&#39;s the maximum gravity for something the size of a Saiyan? I know a guy who might be interested.I heard he’s only interested if it can be fitted with a hyperbolic time chamber.

Maybe, there&#39;s a piece in the Interesting Engineering website where they claim they&#39;ll be studying small models, roughly a ton in size. So, if it is a cube made from concrete, about 70 cm per side?

The correct terms are tonne-force (tf), Megagram-force (Mgf) or Megapond (Mp) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

Flip the vector the other way and with some gravity-based stabilisers, maybe we could use it to hyper-launch objects/shuttles into space without the need to burn rocket fuel.

Can we use Trump as a test subject, please?

This thing has a very obvious dual use, for studying all those &quot;hypersonic&quot;, that is, high acceleration military projectiles.

Flip the vector the other way and with some gravity-based stabilisers, maybe we could use it to hyper-launch objects/shuttles into space without the need to burn rocket fuel.An ordinary ultracentrifuge would rip itself apart if suddenly unbalanced, for example, by suddenly releasing a projectile.A spin launcher has completely different design constraints.

A spin launcher has completely different design constraints.

This is only megagravity, it is no where near ultragravity, let alone hypergravity.

Yes, the thing about this particular one is that it spins a much larger load at high g than previous designs. Ultracentrifuges [wikipedia.org] can routinely reach a million g, but not for kilogram samples. Large centrifuges can spin hundreds of kilograms, some possibly even a ton (or tonne) or more, but not at super high g.

I&#39;m not sure exactly what research requires thousands or millions of g on large samples, but if that&#39;s what you need, this machine provides it.

You can squish something real good in a hydraulic press. You can put it in a diamond cell. You can do all sorts of things to it without spinning it up that would actually exceed internal forces generated by gravity loading alone.

A vacuum press is not the same as a hydraulic press.This is more evenly spread uniform force; plus also top pressing down on bottom as well. If you only think top-down then they are the same if that is all that is going on but it&#39;s not all of it.

I didn&#39;t read TFA, I just started some back of the envelope math. I was wondering what you build this thing out of and what material has a tensile strength to weigh ratio to hold anything at 2,000 g&#39;s. Turns out carbon fiber can easily do it.

Assuming I have a 1m high strength carbon fiber rod with a cross section of 1 cm^2, that&#39;s 100 cm^3. According to the Googles, carbon fiber has a density of about 1.6 g/cm^3 so the whole rod has a mass of 160g.

Also according to the Googles, an ultra-strong version of th

While our understanding of gravity indicates that the affects will be nearly identical, it&#39;s not the same. Furthermore, there may be some effects of gravity that we have yet to understand which do not conform to simulated gravity via centrifuge.

A larger satellite can have a larger signals collecting area, can have much more sophisticated electronics, can have better shielding against radiation, and (if it uses solar panels) can have substantially larger panels because it&#39;ll have the fuel to manoever.

Now, whether or not these particular large satellites are better, proof is in the pudding. Clearly, they&#39;re still being idiots about reflectivity. (Yes, you&#39;ve got to get rid of the heat, and that&#39;s best done in a direction that doesn&#39;t worsen your altitude, but there&#39;s ways to do this that don&#39;t interfere with astronomy,)

>&quot;Could We Provide Better Cellphone Service With Fewer, Bigger Satellites?&quot;

Define &quot;better&quot;.  Better than more smaller satellites?  Better than land-based systems?

As an augmentation to land-based systems, satellite service can be a great boon.  But it is also a scary &quot;single point of failure&quot; issue.  Satellite service is easier to jam/block, will suffer from space-based radiation, requires more device power, has sky-visibility issues, and considering the apparent space hostility, easy to knock out a few t

With 90 sats, each one has to cover 1% of the globe. Break out your trigonometry and you&#39;ll figure out that in the extreme edge of a coverage cell, minimum range is 1000 miles. Assuming you can talk to it just over the horizon. Spoiler alert: you can&#39;t and that&#39;s going to make the max range at the end of coverage bigger.

This is in contrast to starlink where there&#39;s always one almost overhead and less than 500 miles away.

The extra up to 1000 miles round trip (500 up and 500 down, not counting differences in

Presumably, irrespective of optical coatings added, these satellites will be highly reflective in the radio bands where it operates.

Radio astronomers might have something to say about that too.

. . . and that means we’re a long way from replacing most cell towers.

A key limitation is that cell phones generate very weak signals, which significantly lowers the achievable density. For example, look at StarLinks’s latest generation, V3, where each satellite projects multiple 400 km^2 coverage beams. Each beam can only service a limited amount of phones before the phones start interfering with each other. It’s maybe a hundred active phones per beam if each phone’s bandwidth is ke

The &quot;thousands of antennas&quot; are supposed to work around that, presumably by allowing much better beam-steering (narrower beams and attenuated sidelobes; the alternative is that they&#39;re fixed-beam antennas).  The trade-off is that it requires a lot more processing power to steer the beams, even more processing if they&#39;re doing it in the digital domain (which they presumably are), and a tighter beam is less able to adapt to dynamics of the user -- managing a static velocity isn&#39;t hard, but variable accelerati

It does have that dot-com feel doesn&#39;t it.  The script kiddies are back in town! :)

It&#39;s also reminiscent of the &quot;we must have cloud everything&quot; frenzy.  It didn&#39;t matter if any value was created as long as everyone knew it was &quot;cloud first&quot; or (worse) just lift and shift the lot to (insert public cloud provider) until the inevitable hangover occurred when lack of governance and strategy resulted in huge ongoing cloud provider charges with little in the way ROI to show for it.

Retailers do. The goal is to push customers into buying more stuff, so they want to use AI to push more products in front of you.

Upsell widgets usually are limited in what they can show you (you know because when you check out, you get a screen saying &quot;Check out these special offers!&quot; with more products).

The goal is to get AI bots to inundate you with products so you get the Costco effect where you only wanted one item but leave with dozens more items.

Retailers do. The goal is to push customers into buying more stuff, so they want to use AI to push more products in front of you.That is, at best, a secondary goal. Their goal in this is to get rid of employees, which are the second biggest cost in a retail operation.And they&#39;ll regret it, because it will drive people away even faster than the poorly trained employees pushing &quot;this month&#39;s special&quot; too hard. When you scream at employees, they stop. AI won&#39;t.  It can&#39;t be bargained with. It can&#39;t be reasoned with. It doesn&#39;t feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, even after you&#39;re dead!

If I have to use an automated phone thing, I&#39;ve found that repeatedly requesting &#39;talk to a human&#39; gets a human on the line.

They are in a difficult position. If they don&#39;t invest in it and it does turn out to be a hit, then they will be far behind.  Doesnt mean it isn&#39;t all speculation at this point.

I disagree. I’m at a tech firm and all product groups have been instructed to add AI into their products.  It doesn’t matter in which way. Any way. We just need something to say and look like we are doing something.  So, get cracking.

I have had a single customer mention AI in the past year, and I’ve been on about 75 roadmap calls.

Facebook rebranded themselves &quot;Meta&quot; and dumped tens of billions into the &quot;metaverse&quot;, a concept that few people are interested in and show no sign of ever being interested in.

Companies can and do make dumb decisions that don&#39;t pan out and double-down on those decisions all the time. Why is AI different to you? What does the investor class know that we don&#39;t know or can&#39;t read for ourselves?

The promise of AI is &quot;AGI&quot;, an ill-defined concept that will supposedly replace hundreds of millions of expensive work

Who wants this? The competitors of anyone using it. Because the more our competitors use crap like this, the more of their customers will come to us.

This past year has been rough for retail (which is why so many companies are looking to cut costs with magic AI pixies like this), but we&#39;ve doubled down on real customer service, and my end of year bonus was a month and a half&#39;s pay (on top of the quarterly bonuses that have average about half of that each)).

They have to make some serious progress towards not being a huge pile of burning cash in the next year, and this is one of the many increasingly desperate ways they will try to do that.

I expect it to end with begging and bribing the goverment to foot the bill, but the politicans of today are already piling up way more debt than ever before, so they might not want to bail out openAI. But the AI bubble is propping up the economy, in that sense its too big to fail, and we can&#39;t let china get ahead, right? Right guys?! I mean we just let them get ahead with electric vehicles and solar power so THIS time we&#39;re not going to!

Amazon made demonstrable progress towards the goal of dominating e-commerce with consumers. AI hasn&#39;t made any demonstrable progress towards achieving AGI. LLMs aren&#39;t the vehicle for AGI.

Yes but have you seen a shop owner stuffing things into your bag that you are supposed to buy?

A few weeks back I called a BBQ restaurant in Vero Beach FL to order dinner. A very pleasant woman answered the phone and asked for my order. It took about 15 seconds to realize I was speaking to a bot (bonus points, it was the first day of roll-out) and I&#39;m thinking &#39;here we go, gonna be another &#39;11th floor elevator&#39; sketch&#39;. TL;DR, it worked perfectly for my order. Nothing I said was misinterpreted and the final order was exactly as I ordered. I spoke to another customer while I was waiting for my pickup

Why did you have to figure it out? Why didn&#39;t the bot identify itself?That is a great question and, upon reflection, think that systems should identify as a bot and offer an option to speak to a human somewhere in the Q&A process. As I said, my order was bog standard but it&#39;s possible I could have asked for human assistance if I needed to change something from non-standard. Systems should make it clear that human help is available and how to get to that person.FWIW, non-LLM automated answering systems (press 1 for , 2 for  and none of them are what I really need) have suf

This is 75% speech recognition and maybe 25% AI.

If the menu is known to the system and you order based on the items as they are named in the menu, a simple speech recognition program with simple heuristics will likely work most of the time.

The AI comes into play when you deviate from the menu in any way or need to ask it questions. This is a good application for LLMs. There&#39;s not much &quot;thinking&quot; and it&#39;s mostly pattern recognition.

You aren&#39;t likely to know if the business is doing this unless they advertise it.

Many stores already have interior and exterior video surveillance cameras. The &quot;A.I. start-ups&quot; can simply analyze the existing video streams, no need for a special camera. And if the video is being recorded, which is often the case, they could work off of the recordings.

Stores with self-checkouts are already using it to detect theft. I know for a fact that both Walmart and Home Depot employ this. It uses both cameras and data from the self-checkouts to find behaviors such as concealing items or deliberate mis-scanning to cheat the system.

Home Depot&#39;s AI system falsely labeled me as a shoplifter when I was checking out. I bought some simple plumbing fittings and made the &quot;mistake&quot; of scanning one item twice (because I had two) and putting the other item in the bag without s

If they go back to the old days of showing &quot;there are no results for your search&quot; instead of the standard infinite scrolling of today, that would be nice.

Or do they mean in terms of production process, management, etc?

&quot;in-store cameras that can detect a customer&#39;s age or gender&quot; ....and adjust the prices accordingly.

Are you a person of color? Automatically update the e-ink tags on every aisle they&#39;re in to add a 4% &quot;ethnic fee&quot;.Are you female? Increase all the prices of feminine products by 7% automatically anytime they enter an aisle with tampons, makeup, etc.Are you a dude with a beer belly? Awesome, automatically jack up the beer prices by 10%, then have the e-ink tags advertise that beer is &#39;on sale&#39; and lower the pr

&#39;One battle after another&#39; and the ai agent asked &#39;is that a movie?&#39;

More crap being forced on the world that no one is asking for. This is just another futile attempt to find a use for all this AI BS. Funny thing is though, there just isn&#39;t enough workforce optimization (ie layoffs) or increased sales to be had that could possibly offset the insane and unsustainable levels of spending we&#39;re seeing on this front. Trying to milk a rock.

Right now, I get all kinds of irrelevant shit when I use Amazon search for &quot;#2 x 1/2 slot head wood screws&quot;.  Think about what the new-and-improved AI enabled Amazon search will return.  &quot;You asked for #2 x 1/2 slot head wood screws.

And we&#39;re all going to be right about AI.

AI have plenty uses, but right now there&#39;s a bunch of morons bruteforcing instead of investing in optimizing and creating new ways to use it.This won&#39;t be a hype that will die by just being useless as NFTs were. The &quot;crash&quot; will happen with some random ass guy optimizing the fuck out of it and making all the hyper servers useless overnight.

And it is run by the president of the land of the brave, the home of the free.

If you need a pardon, or some other service, like removing a regulation, etc, you negotiate the price, buy some of his memecoins and voila, the government gets it done.

I dunno, it seems the grifter keeps on delivering. [apnews.com]

The 10 biggest holders of TrumpCoin (roughly those who held about $250,000 or more) got an exclusive dinner with him at the White House. When this was announced the value shot up because this became a great way to get a ear with the President.

In the grand scheme of things, this is relatively cheap, campaign financing wise.

That&#39;s not universally accurate.  Some of them were jokes.  (Admittedly, at least one of the jokes started handling real money.)

FWIW, I don&#39;t know if they counted &quot;in game&quot; currencies as &quot;cryptocurrency&quot;, but I don&#39;t know why they shouldn&#39;t.  Buying a &quot;magic sword&quot; isn&#39;t much different from buying a link to a picture.

The ICO days of 2017-2020/2021 produced a lot of now-dead projects as well.  When people can just fork and launch memecoins, there&#39;s plenty of incentive to take a shot at being the next PEPE.  All you need is enough cash for an exchange listing fee.

Please tell me, what percentage of Silicon Valley startups survived in this time frame, what percentage of &quot;new media&quot; outfits made it through this time, and which restaurants opened and stayed open. This is really nothing new. This is, how capitalism is supposed to work: present idea, find initial funding, see, whether you can make money with this. Fail early, fail often, find your path to success.

You realize, that most web startups from late 90ies went up in smoke, but you&#39;ll agree, that the web is here t

No idea, and that fact isn&#39;t relevant to the discussion.  Even the sketchiest dot bomb era startup pales in comparison to garbage like PEPE2.

It would be nice if we could get a cryptocurrency with true anonymity like Monero, ability to prune the blockchain so only the minimum transactions have to be kept, and so the blockchain never constantly grows, supports &quot;taxes&quot;, where when Alice sends Bob one unit of the coin, a tenth of the unit is created and sent to Charlie who is the government tax office.  This way, taxes are paid automatically (although in an inflationary manner).

Would be nice to see more experimental coins, and not just pump/dump stu

Your taxes idea is compatible with any smart contract but it will be a barrier to adoption. Why would I use a stablecoin that taxes me when there are ones that don&#39;t?

They are cryptomagically blockchained so no way they are able to fail like these fake tokens.Since I don&#39;t legally own the picture, I printed out the NFT QR code and put it above my couch, which is a real vintage bull leather couch by the way.All my best friends are so jealous  and take pictures over my couch all the time.

If the point of most of these cryptos was for their creators to jump on the hype train and make a quick cash crab, and those creators successfully executed an exit strategy to dump their crypto product somewhere near its peak - then those cryptos were a success; they did not fail in their intended purpose.

I&#39;ve personally launched at least 5 ( A bunch of reeeeaaal duds).

47% is way more than I expected to not fail.

The thing that gets me is that anybody who has any technical knowledge, upon looking at crypto&#39;s underlying technology: blockchain, can clearly see it doesn&#39;t make sense.

Blockchain isn&#39;t any less fault tolerant than existing systems, and because of its precarious &quot;decentralized&quot; nature, requiring random self-interested parties to see a financial reason to run nodes based on the price of the tokens, there&#39;s no guarantee whatsoever: a) the &quot;price&quot; of a digital abstraction that has no intrinsic value will continue to go up or say above zero, or b) there&#39;s any other reason to run the software and waste resources when it accomplishes nothing for society.

Here is a great documentary that explains it all [youtube.com].    No self-respecting software engineer would buy into this goofy scheme.

If you want &quot;immutability&quot; just use cryptographic signing in traditional, relational databases.

If you want &quot;decentralization&quot; there are better facilities out there that aren&#39;t tied to sketchy ponzi-scheme-like digital tokens, such as IFPS.

Gabfest Reads is a monthly series from the hosts of Slate’s Political Gabfest podcast. Recently, Emily Bazelon spoke with Curtis Sittenfeld about her short story collection, “Show Don’t Tell.” During their discussion, they explored recurring themes of the stories—from troubled marriages and middle age, to the passage of time and how our perception of people and events changes over the years.This partial transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Emily Bazelon: A theme in this book that’s very present is marriage. And actually most of the marriages seemed bad to me as I was reading through this. I was feeling kind of sorry for a lot of people in their partnerships. And there actually is a story called “The Marriage Clock” in which you present explicit advice about how to improve your marriage. And the kind of joke of the story is that the advice comes from a kind of Christian influencer who wrote a really—an accidental—huge bestseller based on this idea of a marriage clock and these various tenets of a good marriage. So how did you come up with this list and what do you actually stand by on this list?

Curtis Sittenfeld: Oh, that’s a good question. Well, let’s see. I’m trying to think how to answer this. I mean, I can’t remember now, it’s like 10 or 12 recommendations and I think they’re a little bit sexist and heteronormative in some cases, but I think probably most of them are good ideas. It’s like, don’t call each other mommy and daddy or like don’t let your children sleep … I mean, I think there are probably good recommendations for the health of a marriage that for many people are probably may be too challenging to adhere to. Or like, I think there can be this tension where what’s good for the family is not good for the marriage. But I mean, I certainly have read marriage self-help books … I think that the two most prominent things that it seems like have permeated the culture are the love languages book and then sort of … I have not actually read the book on attachment theory, but I’m very conversant in attachment theory.

Curtis Sittenfeld: I know— like many people in 2026.

Emily Bazelon: My favorite item on this list, “do not engage in any form of self-grooming in front of your spouse that you wouldn’t perform in the boarding gate area of an airport.”

Curtis Sittenfeld: I’m very interested in the discrepancy between who we aspire to be and who we are on a daily basis. And like so many of us know what we should do to have strong relationships or to have good physical health, but it’s so hard. It’s just so hard. Knowing what the right choices are is different from feeling equipped to make them. And even the person you are at like 3:00 PM or 8:00 PM is maybe less equipped to make good choices than the person you were at like 8:15 AM.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which is so grateful to have you as adoring readers but will sue you in North Carolina if you alienate your affection for us.

We’ve got a lot of foreign policy this week, a telltale sign that the foreign policy ain’t going great. Domestically, control of the Senate could come down to Alaska, or at least that’s what reporters are telling their editors as they try to secure summer trips. And a Ford factory worker became the new face of the resistance.

First, we begin with the slew of scandals and drama at the Justice Department this week and attempt to discern the root of it all.

Even by the Trump Justice Department’s standards over the last year, this was an eyebrow-raising week. We learned Sunday night, from the dawg Jay Powell himself, that the Federal Reserve chair was under DOJ investigation, ostensibly for his testimony related to Fed renovation costs, but really because he wasn’t lowering interest rates fast enough for Trump. The White House has tried to distance itself from the investigation—to portray it as D.C.’s U.S. attorney Jeanine Pirro freelancing—but Trump has been pressuring Powell for a long, long time. We also learned this week that federal prosecutors are investigating five additional Democratic lawmakers who posted a video last year urging troops to ignore illegal orders. (The Pentagon has been harassing another Democrat, Sen. Mark Kelly, for months.) Trump had called their video “seditious.” Meanwhile, a wave of DOJ prosecutors resigned under pressure to investigate not the ICE killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis, but Good’s widow instead.

Amid the backdrop of a lousier-than-usual week at the DOJ, the most revealing story of the week may have been one in the Wall Street Journal about Trump’s increasing frustration with Attorney General Pam Bondi. “The criticisms,” the Journal wrote, “appear to be part of an intense campaign by Trump to pressure the Justice Department to more aggressively pursue his priorities”—specifically, pursuing his enemies. Consider, too, a separate Journal story about a White House photo op with U.S. attorneys last week during which Trump berated them for being “weak” and complained that they weren’t “moving fast enough to prosecute his favored targets.” Trump has a poor history with attorneys general who, at one point or another, can’t find within the law the answers to his questions. So long as Bondi wants to keep her job, there are many more bad weeks ahead.

The retiring North Carolina Republican senator deserves credit this week for offering meaningful pushback to the administration’s threats against Powell. Shortly after Powell’s SOS message went up Sunday night, Tillis announced that he would oppose any of the president’s Fed nominees until the Powell matter was resolved. Given Tillis’ seat on the Banking Committee, that pledge would prevent any Fed nominee—including Powell’s upcoming replacement as chair—from getting voted out of committee. The pushback from Tillis, and a fair number of other Republican senators, was enough to calm markets and put the White House on its back foot.

Tillis, liberated from electoral concerns, has been speaking up against the administration’s errors more openly in the last couple of weeks. We could leave it at that. But the Surge’s bylaws are clear that no nit be left unpicked, and so we have to quibble with his framing. Tillis’ argument is that the administration is making some dumb decisions because Trump is receiving bad advice. Whichever adviser pursued the “vindictive prosecution” against Powell, he said, needs to “grow up and give the president better advice.” And in terms of seizing Greenland, he said separately that he blamed “whoever told the president that this was a viable path. It doesn’t make sense.” We understand that calling the principal himself an idiot wouldn’t be the most effective means of dissuading him from destructive ideas. But it is the principal, not the advisers, who are the problem. Trump wants to annex Greenland because it looks big on a map, and so the advisers are competing with each other to achieve that for him. He insists the Fed lower interest rates faster, so there’s a Cabinet-wide contest to do what it takes. The bad ideas are coming from the man himself, and he won’t take no for an answer.

The president reiterated on Wednesday that the United States “needs” Greenland, and that anything less than Greenland being “in the hands of the UNITED STATES” is “unacceptable.” And on Friday, while a bipartisan congressional delegation visited Copenhagen to reassure Danish leaders that Congress stood in the way of Trump’s Greenland plans (sure you are, guys), Trump was threatening tariffs against countries if they “don’t go along with Greenland.” You can actually hear his dopamine rush when he says this.

On that note, let’s look at a couple of consequences of Trump’s yearlong effort to antagonize the United States’ closest friends and allies in the free world. In a sentence we never quite thought we’d have to write, numerous European Union countries are deploying troops and military personnel to Greenland in a show of support to Denmark against American aggression towards its allies. Repeat: Europe is sending troops to Greenland while America threatens to seize it. And on Friday during a visit to Beijing, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney agreed to slash its 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric cars in exchange for China importing more Canadian agricultural products, and said China had become a more “predictable” trading partner than the U.S. Can the Supreme Court go ahead and release that opinion nuking Trump’s tariffs powers soon, please?

The major recruitment news of the week was that former Democratic Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola launched a bid for Senate against incumbent Republican Dan Sullivan. Peltola, who’s reusing the “Fish, family, and freedom” slogan that carried her to House victory in 2022 before a narrow reelection loss in 2024, gives Democrats a fighting chance in a red state where Peltola has won statewide, given that there’s only one congressional district in Alaska, in very recent memory.

Her recruitment is also a critical piece of a much larger puzzle: Giving Democrats a chance—we’re saying there’s a chance!—to pick up the net four seats they would need to retake control of the Senate in the midterms. If Democrats can retain all of the seats they control (including tough races in Michigan and Georgia), the path to Senate control runs through winning the open seat in North Carolina, finally replacing Susan Collins in Maine, hoping ex-Sen. Sherrod Brown can oust Sen. John Husted in Ohio, and then Peltola in Alaska. This is the way, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave 18 billion interviews this week describing it as such. It’s important to observe that each step along this path is quite difficult, and completing it would require a midterm wave in Democrats’ favor. Stranger things have happened.

Even a handful of days ago, a U.S. intervention against the Iranian regime, as the country was swarmed with protests that were being brutally put down, seemed like it was imminent. Military options had been prepared and presented for the president; U.S. personnel were being advised to leave the U.S. military base in Qatar. By Wednesday night, though, Trump said that “we’ve been told that the killing in Iran is stopping—it’s stopped—it’s stopping. And there’s no plan for executions, or an execution.” Iran had signaled as much on Thursday. What Iran has or has not stopped, we don’t know. But this came as the administration received advice from allies in the region—including Saudi Arabia and Israel—not to intervene, arguing that the protests weren’t strong enough to topple the regime and U.S. intervention would cause regional chaos.

Now, Trump could very well surprise-bomb Iran overnight if someone cracks a little too much fresh-ground pepper on his steak. But with the apparent deescalation, the Surge wants to send its thoughts and prayers to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. As we wrote last week, he was riding high on the Venezuela intervention and hoped that Trump might fulfill Graham’s top bucket-list item—regime change in Iran—next. Graham was all over TV and social media this week egging on his audience of one. He described Trump as “Reagan Plus” and openly urged him to kill Ayatollah Khamenei. He met with the Shah of Iran’s son, who’s eager to take control of the country. When Trump’s tone shift came later in the week, Graham scrambled to deny that Trump had swung against action or that the protests had ebbed in Iran, and said that he no longer wanted to be allies with allies that told Trump not to get involved. It’s always hard for Graham when a country goes un-bombed, and this is the big one. Let’s give him a little space.

Last week in the Senate, five Republicans joined all Democrats to advance a war powers resolution barring the president from using military force in Venezuela without congressional sign-off. Despite his administration’s firm promise that they have no additional military plans in Venezuela, Trump was furious, saying those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Republican leaders and administration officials set off a fierce pressure campaign to kill the resolution.

The pressure campaign was successful. On Wednesday, Senate Republicans killed the resolution with another procedural vote, having convinced two of the five Republicans—Sens. Josh Hawley and Todd Young—to back off. What were their excuses? Both said that they received a variety of “assurances” from the administration that there were no troops in Venezuela at the moment, and that if the administration does want to send troops in the future, it will totally ask Congress first. Now, the Surge doesn’t think it would be that much effort to encode those promises into law, to be extra careful. You just go to the Senate floor, stick your thumb up, and you’ve voted for it. But what do we know?

Trump’s team organized a nice little afternoon for him on Tuesday: a visit to Michigan to visit Ford’s F-150 factory, where the big trucks get made. Neat! As he was walking through the plant with Ford’s CEO, a 40-year-old line worker later identifying himself as TJ Sabula shouted “Pedophile protector!” at Trump. The president pointed back at him, said “Fuck you,” and then gave him the middle finger. Sabula was suspended.

Sabula, in an interview with the Washington Post, said that he had “no regrets whatsoever” about what he did. “I don’t feel as though fate looks upon you often, and when it does, you better be ready to seize the opportunity,” he said. “And today I think I did that.” While Sabula is concerned about losing his job—and maybe should be a little worried about, like, ICE showing up to his door, pretending that he tried to run over the president with one of the trucks he was assembling—his act of heckling is being well remunerated. A couple of GoFundMe pages in his name have raised over $800,000.

President Trump REALLY wants to invoke the Insurrection Act. He’s fallen hard for this 200-year-old law that would allow him to deploy active duty military to enforce civilian law on American streets. On this week’s Amicus podcast, co-host Mark Joseph Stern is joined by Professor Steve Vladeck, a nationally recognized expert on the Supreme Court, federal courts, national security law, and military justice. They discuss what’s been stopping Trump from invoking the act so far, why he has no legal authority to do so right now, and what happens if he does it anyway.

Next, Mark talks to Julia Gegenheimer, former special litigation counsel in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section, and now a special litigation counsel at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection. Julia and Mark discuss the remaining paths to justice after the killing of Renee Good and examine what happens when the DOJ abandons its duty to seek accountability and vindicate civil rights.

Three days ago, Slate published an article I wrote titled “You’ve Heard About Who ICE Is Recruiting. The Truth Is Far Worse. I’m the Proof.” The article details how I, in an effort to learn more about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s hiring practices, applied for a job at ICE—and ended up getting a job offer. To say that I was surprised would be an understatement: For one, I’m a vocal online critic of ICE and the Trump administration. More saliently, I skipped many of the steps required for the application. It’s a wild story—I’d encourage you to read the whole thing—and one that does not reflect particularly well on ICE or its parent organization: the Department of Homeland Security.

In another time, the exposé of an extraordinarily lax hiring process at an agency tasked with keeping the nation safe would be of bipartisan concern. After all, if ICE is going to arm agents and send them out into America’s streets, it should at least know whom it’s sending. Even supporters of ICE’s mission should want to know that the agency is hiring effective people to carry that mission out. And so under another administration, DHS might look into what happened here, figuring out how my application went through and whether it was a one-off glitch or a widespread, systemic issue.

This administration, however, took a different approach. “This is such a lazy lie. This individual was NEVER offered a job at ICE,” DHS said Wednesday through the administration’s most official communication channel: X (formerly Twitter). “Applicants may receive a Tentative Selection Letter following their initial application and interview that is not a job offer. It just means they are invited to submit information for review, similar to any other applicant.”

DHS is correct that I received an initial offer letter. I also, however, received a final offer, as well as an EOD (Entrance On Duty) date of Sept. 30, according to the application portal. The application listed my medical screening and background check as complete, despite me never filling out paperwork for either. Perhaps, had I pressed “Accept” and moved on with the process, they would have caught the glitch, performed the background check, and demanded those papers. But according to ICE’s own application portal, I was offered a job. (I asked ICE’s media department about all of this before publishing my article, but they did not respond.)

I took a screengrab video of my application status on the ICE portal as of Oct. 3, which you can view below.

There’s a lot going on here, so let’s break it down. The dashboard at the beginning of this video provides an overview of my application process for the position of deportation officer. My tentative offer is marked “Sent,” which—as the mouseover demonstrates—means that I did not acknowledge or accept the offer. The Pre-Employment activities section is marked TBD, which makes sense, since I did not complete any of the pre-employment paperwork. And yet, my final offer status reads “accepted” which, according to the mouseover, means “you accepted the Final Offer and your Entry On Duty date (EOD) date has been set.” And indeed, my onboarding status is EOD: “Your EOD has occurred. Welcome to ICE!”

The point here is that the video of ICE’s own portal confirms my story: The agency offered me a job and gave me a start date without, by its own admission, meeting its own standards for vetting.

Later on, you can see the pre-employment part of the portal that claims my medical and background checks are already complete. If this background check occurred without my participation or knowledge, it missed some massive red flags. I did not mention this in the original article, but Jedeed is a Syrian name: My father immigrated in the 1970s. This fact delayed my military clearance by several months back in 2005. Why, if this background check really happened, did no one think to ask about a possible connection to Syria this time around?

I uploaded the video to X in response to DHS’ “lazy lie” accusation, along with the text “You sure about that?” Seven million impressions, over 100,000 likes, and zero response from the Department of Homeland Security. To be fair, they have their hands full right now; they are very busy brutalizing and detaining people as they attempt to go to doctor’s appointments, throwing flash-bang grenades into cars full of children, and terrorizing the residents of a major American city.

DHS’ response is noteworthy because it comes at a moment when the department is demanding the public’s trust. It’s demanding that we believe that the ICE officer who killed Renee Good was in danger (despite contradictory video evidence), and that he left the event badly injured. More broadly, it’s demanding we believe that ICE agents are doing their work under siege, and that they’re the victims of agression—rather than the perpetrators of it. There are already plenty of reason to be deeply skeptical of any and all of that, but add this to the list: If DHS will lie so brazenly about this story, why would we believe anything else the department’s mouthpieces have to say?

Which brings me to the larger point of Tuesday’s article. We are not simply dealing with a broken hiring system or a lack of training within ICE’s ranks. This sloppy application process, and the DHS’ apathetic, angry response, are just two symptoms of a systemic disregard for the lives and safety of American residents—citizens and noncitizens alike.

The presence of an armed, masked, and improperly vetted force with no oversight and “absolute immunity” (not in a legal sense, but in the sense that the Trump administration’s DOJ will not prosecute them) should concern everyone in the country. What we are dealing with, in Minneapolis and across this nation, is an emergency—and no amount of DHS propaganda can make it go away.

President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act on Thursday to quell protests against the federal occupation of the Twin Cities, a move that would allow him to send in the military over Minnesota’s opposition. Masked immigration officers are currently rampaging through Minneapolis and St. Paul, brutalizing protesters and arresting individuals on the basis of race, drawing widespread opposition from local leaders and communities. The president evidently believes that he can wield the Insurrection Act to suppress their First Amendment rights and impose a kind of military rule on the streets.

But what exactly is this law—and why hasn’t Trump deployed it already? To explain what the Insurrection Act truly authorizes and the risks that come with invoking it, Mark Joseph Stern spoke with Georgetown Law professor Steve Vladeck on this week’s episode of Amicus. Vladeck is an expert on military law and author of the One First Substack. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mark Joseph Stern: Let’s start with the absolute basics: What is the Insurrection Act?

Steve Vladeck: The Insurrection Act is the common—if misleading—name that we’ve given to a series of statutes that trace all the way back to 1792. These statutes carry into force Congress’ constitutional power to provide for the “calling forth of the militia”—and then later, the military—to suppress insurrection, to repel invasion, or “execute the laws of the Union.” The idea was that Congress should be able to allow the president, in very narrow but important circumstances, to use military force as a backup when civilian order and civilian law enforcement has broken down.

So the idea was that it would be used in narrow circumstances, but the language is actually fairly broad. How have presidents invoked it in the past? It seems like, for the most part, they’ve actually been pretty restrained and not used it the way Trump wants to use it.

The history of the Insurrection Act is of pretty responsible usage of a statute that could be interpreted, in a vacuum, as a remarkably broad delegation of power to the president. We’ve had somewhere around 30 invocations of the statute across American history. But the last one was 34 years ago when President George H.W. Bush used it to help send troops in during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.

Although those 30 invocations might have been politically controversial in some cases, they weren’t legally controversial. When President Kennedy sent troops into Mississippi in 1962 to protect James Meredith and the 300 law enforcement officers who were there with him, that was politically controversial because the South didn’t want them. It was not legally controversial because those guys were at perilous risk of being lynched. And Mississippi’s local and state authorities were not exactly helping. So presidents have been responsible historically; they’ve usually had compelling factual bases for invoking the Insurrection Act. It hasn’t been used as a permanent way to deploy troops into our cities. Even the Justice Department, which is not shy about claiming power for the president, has taken a very narrow view of when they can use it.

It sounds like you don’t think that the protests in the Twin Cities right now actually give Trump legitimate grounds to invoke the Insurrection Act.

I don’t think it’s even close. But there is a problem of folks coming to this history fresh, who don’t know the backstory or the historical pedigree here. Because you could read the statute and say: If I squint a little, one protester throwing a rock at an ICE officer is impeding law enforcement. But the Insurrection Act is not about private conduct. It is really about circumstances where the states themselves are unwilling or unable to enforce their laws, or where they’re specifically thwarting federal law enforcement.

Every time the Trump administration points to an example of something bad happening to an ICE officer, the culprits are protesters, not state officials. President Trump can mouth off about the mayor and the governor, but he doesn’t have any specific examples of policies or episodes where state and local governments have been the reasons why ICE has been impeded. If it were otherwise—if one person doing one thing to impede an ICE officer from carrying out their duties was sufficient to justify an invocation of the Insurrection Act—then all protests would trigger the Insurrection Act. And that’s not how we’ve ever understood the Insurrection Act. It would not make any sense with First Amendment values.

Why hasn’t Trump invoked the Insurrection Act yet?

I think there are two reasons. One is political and one is legal. The political reason is that there really still are political obstacles to invoking the Insurrection Act. The president would invite blowback, even from some members of the Republican caucus and Congress. Not many, but given how razor-thin the Republicans’ margin is in the House right now, it wouldn’t take that many votes to really upend all of this.

Then the legal part is that the administration will be sued, and there are probably some folks who are wary that the facts, as they currently stand, make it at least somewhat questionable whether they will win that case. As opposed to a scenario where there’s a more visible unprovoked assault on an ICE officer, or a state official who is directly involved in impeding ICE. I think that might be the pretext they’re looking for.

That’s, of course, my next question: If Trump invokes the law, there will be a legal challenge, and it will go to the Supreme Court. What will that challenge look like, and do you really think it’ll have a chance of prevailing at SCOTUS? Is there also a chance that justices could say they just don’t have authority to overrule the commander-in-chief on this?

I don’t think the court will go quite that far. What I worry about more is a ruling that says that the president’s entitled to a whole lot of deference, not that the courts are powerless. I don’t think John Roberts is going to join an opinion that says the court is powerless about anything. But I do worry about the fight over the facts. In the National Guard cases, the lower courts made a series of factual findings that are inconsistent with what the executive branch said was the factual basis for deploying the troops. Do the courts have the power to do that? That will be the fight.

This is why I think the facts actually are going to matter. If and when the president invokes the Insurrection Act, will there be more of a factual basis than there is here on Friday morning? Does the district court make factual findings that are actually well-supported by the record and would be difficult for the Supreme Court to run away from? The devil’s going to be in the details.

It sounds like you think six of the justices really don’t want to call Donald Trump a liar. But to block the use of the Insurrection Act in the Twin Cities, the Supreme Court would probably have to say that Trump, executive branch officials, and law enforcement officers are not telling the truth. And the court is clearly hesitant to do that.

I could also imagine a universe in which even the factual claims made by the Trump administration, taken at face value, could be held insufficient. The only way the Supreme Court could rule against Trump without second-guessing him is an opinion that says: Even assuming all this is true, that’s still not enough for the Insurrection Act. I have no faith that Justices Kavanaugh, Thomas, Alito, or Gorsuch would join such an opinion. So we’re back to where we are so often in these cases, which is: Where are the chief and Justice Barrett?

I don’t know. I’m heartened about what happened in the National Guard case, which is a sign that they do not just reflexively rule for the Trump administration. But it’s going to depend on just how divorced from reality the administration’s factual arguments are. This is why I think they’ve been waiting for something more than the Renee Good incident, for something more than a couple of suspects resisting an ICE arrest. I think they’re waiting for something that they can pitch plausibly as a completely unprovoked act of violence, or interference by a local or state law enforcement officer.

People often say that Trump does whatever he wants and doesn’t listen to his lawyers, but I don’t think that’s true when it comes to stuff that could reach the Supreme Court. I think he is very cautious when dealing with any issue that’s going to go to the justices.

One hundred percent. There’s a reason why they haven’t invoked the Insurrection Act as we’re sitting here today.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/18/nvidia_fp64_emulation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Double precision floating point computation (aka FP64) is what keeps modern aircraft in the sky, rockets going up, vaccines effective, and, yes, nuclear weapons operational. But rather than building dedicated chips that process this essential data type in hardware, Nvidia is leaning on emulation to increase performance for HPC and scientific computing applications, an area where AMD has had the lead in recent generations.

This emulation, we should note, hasn&#39;t replaced hardware FP64 in Nvidia&#39;s GPUs. Nvidia&#39;s newly unveiled Rubin GPUs still deliver about 33 teraFLOPS of peak FP64 performance, but that&#39;s actually one teraFLOP less than the now four-year-old H100.

If you switch on software emulation in Nvidia&#39;s CUDA libraries, the chip can purportedly achieve up to 200 teraFLOPS of FP64 matrix performance. That&#39;s 4.4x of what its outgoing Blackwell accelerators could muster in hardware.

On paper, Rubin isn&#39;t just Nvidia&#39;s most powerful AI accelerator ever, but it&#39;s the most potent GPU for scientific computing in years.

&quot;What we found is, through many studies with partners and with our own internal investigations, is that the accuracy that we get from emulation is at least as good as what we would get out of a tensor core piece of hardware,&quot; Dan Ernst, senior director of supercomputing products at Nvidia, told El Reg.

Emulated FP64, which is not exclusive to Nvidia, has the potential to dramatically improve the throughput and efficiency of modern GPUs. But not everyone is convinced.

&quot;It&#39;s quite good in some of the benchmarks, it&#39;s not obvious it&#39;s good in real, physical scientific simulations,&quot; Nicholas Malaya, an AMD fellow, told us. He argued that, while FP64 emulation certainly warrants further research and experimentation, it&#39;s not quite ready for prime time.

Even as chip designs push for ever lower-precision data types, FP64 remains the gold standard for scientific computing for good reason. FP64 is unmatched in its dynamic range, capable of expressing more than 18.44 quintillion (264) unique values.

To put that in perspective,-modern AI models like DeepSeek R1 are commonly trained at FP8, which can express a paltry 256 unique values. Taking advantage of general homogeneity of neural networks, block-floating-point data types like MXFP8 or MXFP4 can be used to expand their dynamic range.

That&#39;s fine for the fuzzy math that defines large language models, but it&#39;s no replacement for FP64, particularly when it&#39;s the difference between life or death.

Unlike AI workloads, which are highly error-tolerant, HPC simulations rely on fundamental physical principles like conservation of mass and energy. &quot;As soon as you start incurring errors, these finite errors propagate, and they cause things like blow ups,&quot; Malaya said.

The idea of using lower-precision, often integer datatypes, to emulate FP64 isn&#39;t a new idea. &quot;Emulation is old as dirt,&quot; Ernst said. &quot;We had emulation in the mid &#39;50s before we had hardware for floating point.&quot;

This process required significantly more operations to complete, and often incurred a stiff performance penalty as a result, but enabled floating point mathematics even when hardware lacked a dedicated floating point unit (FPU).

By the 1980s, FPUs were becoming commonplace and the need for emulation largely disappeared. However, in early 2024, researchers at the Tokyo and Shibaura institutes of technology published a paper reviving the concept by showing that FP64 matrix operations could be decomposed into multiple INT8 operations that, when run on Nvidia&#39;s tensor cores, achieved higher-than-native performance.

This approach is commonly referred to as the Ozaki scheme, and it&#39;s the foundation for Nvidia&#39;s own FP64 emulation libraries, which were released late last year. And, as Ernst was quick to point out, &quot;it&#39;s still FP64. It&#39;s not mixed precision. It&#39;s just done and constructed in a different way from the hardware perspective.&quot;

Modern GPUs are packed with low-precision tensor cores. Even without the fancy adaptive compression found in Rubin&#39;s tensor cores, the chips are capable of 35 petaFLOPS of dense FP4 compute. By comparison, at FP64, the chips are more than 1,000x slower.

These low-precision tensor cores are really efficient to build and run, so the question became why not use them to do FP64, Ernst explained. &quot;We have the hardware, let&#39;s try use it. That&#39;s the history of supercomputing.&quot;

While Nvidia is keen to highlight the capabilities FP64 emulation enables on its Rubin and even its older Blackwell GPUs, rival AMD doesn&#39;t believe the approach is quite ready.

According to Malaya, FP64 emulation works best for well-conditioned numerical systems, with the High Performance Linpack (HPL) bench being a prime example. &quot;But when you look at material science, combustion codes, banded linear algebra systems, things like that, they are much less well conditioned systems, and suddenly it starts to break down,&quot; he said.

In other words, whether or not FP64 emulation makes sense actually depends on the application in question. For some it&#39;s fine, while in others it&#39;s not.

One of the major sticking points for AMD is that FP64 emulation isn&#39;t exactly IEEE compliant. Nvidia&#39;s algorithms don&#39;t account for things like positive versus negative zeros, not number errors, or infinite number errors.

Because of this, small errors in the intermediary operations used to emulate the higher precision can result in perturbations that can throw off the final result, Malaya explained.

One way around this is to increase the number of operations used. However, at a certain point, the sheer number of operations required outweighs any advantage emulation might have provided.

All of those operations also take up memory. &quot;We have data that shows you&#39;re using about twice the memory capacity in Ozaki to emulate that FP64 matrices,&quot; Malaya said.

For these reasons, the House of Zen is focusing its attention on specialized hardware for applications that rely on double and single precision. Its upcoming MI430X takes advantage of AMD&#39;s chiplet architecture to bolster double and single precision hardware performance.

The challenges facing FP64 emulation algorithms like the Ozaki scheme aren&#39;t lost on Ernst, who is well aware of the gaps in Nvidia&#39;s implementation.

Ernst contended that, for most HPC practitioners, things like positive negative zeroes aren&#39;t that big a deal. Meanwhile, Nvidia has developed supplemental algorithms to detect and mitigate issues like non-numbers, infinite numbers, and inefficient emulation operations.

As for memory consumption, Ernst conceded that it can be a bit higher but emphasized that this overhead is relative to the operation not the application itself. Most of the time, he said, we&#39;re talking about matrices that are at most a few gigabytes in size.

So while it&#39;s true that FP64 emulation isn&#39;t IEEE-compliant, whether this actually matters is heavily dependent on the application in question, Ernst argued. &quot;Most of the use cases where IEEE compliance ordering rules are in play don&#39;t come up in matrix, matrix multiplication cases. There&#39;s not a DGEMM that tends to actually follow that rule anyway,&quot; he said.

Even if Nvidia can overcome the potential pitfalls of FP64 emulation, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the method is only useful for a subset of HPC applications that rely on dense general matrix multiply (DGEMM) operations.

According to Malaya, for somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of HPC workloads, emulation offers little to no benefit.

&quot;In our analysis the vast majority of real HPC workloads rely on vector FMA, not DGEMM,&quot; he said. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a tiny fraction of the market, but it&#39;s actually a niche piece.&quot;

For vector-heavy workloads, like computational fluid dynamics, Nvidia&#39;s Rubin GPUs are forced to run on the slower FP64 vector accelerators in the chip&#39;s CUDA cores.

However, as Ernst was quick to point out: more FLOPS doesn&#39;t always mean useful FLOPS. The same workloads that tend to run on the FP64 vector engines rarely manage to harness more than a fraction of the chip&#39;s theoretical performance, all because the memory can&#39;t keep up.

We see this quite clearly on the TOP500&#39;s vector-heavy High Performance Conjugate Gradient benchmark where CPUs tend to dominate thanks to the higher ratio of bits per FLOPS afforded by their memory subsystems.

Rubin may not deliver the fastest FP64 vector perf, but with 22 TB/s of HBM4 its real world performance in these workloads, it is likely to be much higher than the spec sheet would suggest.

With an influx of new supercomputers powered by Nvidia&#39;s Blackwell and Rubin GPUs coming online over the next few years, any questions regarding the viability of FP64 emulation will be put to the test sooner rather than later.

And since this emulation isn&#39;t tied to specific hardware, there&#39;s the potential for the algorithms to improve over time as researchers uncover scenarios where the technique excels or struggles.

Despite Malaya&#39;s concerns, he noted that AMD is also investigating the use of FP64 emulation on chips like the MI355X, through software flags, to see where it may be appropriate.

IEEE compliance, he told us, would go a long way towards validating the approach by ensuring that the results you get from emulation are the same as what you&#39;d get from dedicated silicon.

&quot;If I can go to a partner and say run these two binaries: this one gives you the same answer as the other and is faster, and yeah under the hood we&#39;re doing some scheme — think that&#39;s a compelling argument that is ready for prime time,&quot; Malaya said.

It may turn out that, for some applications, emulation is more reliable than others, he noted. &quot;We should, as a community, build a basket of apps to look at. I think that&#39;s the way to progress here.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The splendidly-named &quot;OpenSlopware&quot; was, for a short time, a list of open source projects using LLM bots. Due to harassment, it&#39;s gone, but forks of it live on.

&quot;OpenSlopware&quot; was a repository on the European Codeberg git forge containing a list of free software and open source projects which use LLM-bot generated code, or integrate LLMs, or which show signs of &quot;coding assistants&quot; being used on the codebase, such as pull requests created or modified by automated coding tools.

However, its creator – who we are intentionally not naming or tagging here – received so much harassment from LLM boosters that they removed the repository, and indeed their Bluesky account, stating that they would withdraw from social media for a while. Now, if you try to visit the original URL, you will receive only a 404 message.

All is not lost, though. Although it contained human-readable text, it was a Git repository, and so it was possible to fork it – clone its contents into another different repository. Several people did so before the original OpenSlopware creator deleted it again, such as this Small-Hack version, also on Codeberg. The Register has contacted the maintainer of this fork and asked if they&#39;d talk to us about it, but so far, they say they&#39;re still thinking about it. Others were planning to maintain copies but have decided to join forces with this one.

Notably, this is despite some people involved in the original apologizing for their involvement and saying it should not be revived.

This is one of a growing number of sites, groups, and communities, which exist to criticize the growing use and promotion of LLM bots and their output, for which the word &quot;slop&quot; is becoming the standard term. Some merely spell out their criticism, such as this open letter to those who fired or didn&#39;t hire tech writers because of AI. Others go further, and name and shame those responsible. For instance, we recently saw this blog post &quot;Authors&quot; using AI slop in their books: a small list.

One example is the AntiAI subreddit, but there is also a Lemmy instance devoted to it, called Awful.systems. (For those unfamiliar with it, Lemmy is a tool for creating news aggregator and discussion sites – think Reddit or the recently revived, but LLM-infested, Digg – based around the same ActivityPub protocols used by Mastodon and the rest of the Fediverse.)

One of the Awful.systems site admins is Unix sysadmin and former Wikipedia press officer David Gerard, who formerly took an ultra-skeptical view of the cryptocurrency world on Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain (which also inspired a book and a sequel. He now publishes an equally skeptical blog on the subject of the LLM bot industry, Pivot to AI. In an post on the Lemmy instance as well as on his Mastodon feed, he says that Awful.systems also plans to curate and maintain a list along the lines of OpenSlopware – but they&#39;re looking for a comparably-catchy name.

Those still on the fence about the merits of LLM bots and their output may be surprised by the levels of vitriol this inspires, but it is one of the most contentious aspects of the entire computing world today.

In its section Why not LLMs?, the OpenSlopware continuation mentions the copyright and licensing implications, and continues to cite a Wikipedia article detailing the Environmental impact of artificial intelligence.

These are legitimate concerns, but there are many more. As The Reg reported back in July, in the only test of its kind that we know of, the LLM-promoting site Model Evaluation & Threat Research found that although using coding assistants made programmers think that they were working faster, the truth is that debugging the bots&#39; code slowed the humans down by as much as they thought it sped up the process. The implications of this for code quality are obvious. What long-term use does to programmers&#39; analytical faculties is as yet unmeasured, but the effects on social media look frankly terrifying. Its effects on hiring looked dire early last year, and even as companies rehire those laid off, they are paid less afterwards. Claimed productivity gains are nowhere to be seen.

Along with objective, verifiable measurements, such as performance testing of people and code alike, open criticism is needed – no matter how much it upsets some of those being criticized. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hundreds of millions of wireless earbuds, headphones, and speakers are vulnerable to silent hijacking due to a flaw in Google&#39;s Fast Pair system that allows attackers to seize control without the owner ever touching the pairing button.

The issue, dubbed &quot;WhisperPair,&quot; was uncovered by researchers at KU Leuven, who found that many Bluetooth accessories claiming support for Fast Pair fail to properly enforce one of its most basic safety checks. Based on Fast Pair&#39;s uptake, the team says the flaw likely affects &quot;hundreds of millions&quot; of accessories already in circulation.

In theory, Fast Pair devices are supposed to accept new pairing requests only when the user explicitly places them in pairing mode. In practice, the researchers say, many products will happily accept a new connection request at any time.

That creates an opening for attackers within Bluetooth range to step in and pair their own device, even if the accessory is already in use by someone else.

Once paired, the attacker gets the same level of access as a legitimate owner. Depending on the device, that can mean injecting or interrupting audio, manipulating volume, or, in some cases, activating the microphone. It is the sort of pesky thing that does not require nation-state resources or exotic hardware; a nearby phone or laptop is more than enough.

The researchers stress the problem is not Bluetooth itself, but sloppy or incomplete implementations of Google&#39;s Fast Pair specification by device makers. Fast Pair was designed to make connecting accessories to Android devices nearly frictionless, using Bluetooth Low Energy beacons and cloud lookups to speed things along. That convenience has come at the cost of enforcement on the accessory side, where vendors are expected to check whether pairing should even be allowed in the first place.

What&#39;s more, some Fast Pair accessories integrate with Google&#39;s Find My Device network, allowing lost earbuds or headphones to be located using nearby Android phones. If an attacker can pair with an accessory before its rightful owner does, they can potentially register it to their account and receive location updates as it moves around.

Google was alerted to the issue and says it has been working with manufacturers on fixes. Some patches are now trickling out as firmware updates, though coverage is patchy, and plenty of cheaper accessories either don&#39;t get updates at all or rely on clunky vendor apps most users never open.

Tweaking settings on your phone, or switching Fast Pair off entirely, doesn&#39;t solve much if the accessory itself is still happy to accept rogue pairing requests.

The WhisperPair team reported the bug privately last year and sat on the details while vendors were given time to respond, picking up a bug bounty along the way. Their findings are a good example of a recurring problem in the smart device world: security rules that look fine on paper can unravel quickly once they&#39;re handed to dozens of manufacturers racing to ship cheap hardware. ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! UK water company Severn Trent learned an unfortunate lesson about text-to-speech systems when a robocall to customers went hilariously wrong.

A Reg reader received an automated call warning of potential water discoloration during planned works from January 19-25. The message advised running taps for twenty minutes if the water appeared discolored - standard stuff, if a bit robotic.

In the recording forwarded to us, a female voice told our reader what to expect. All good, if a little robotic.

However, things went off the rails a bit when the robot attempted to read out the URL for Severn Trent: http://www.stwater.co.uk/discolouration.

For anyone concerned, the URL redirects to a secure connection.

The robot took a run at it, but the result was unlikely to be what the water company wanted. We imagine Severn Trent was hoping for &quot;S T Water,&quot; but instead got &quot;S Twatter.&quot;

Text-to-speech blunders are nothing new. This writer has fond memories of home computers with primitive speech synthesizers producing similar gaffes to the horror of listening parents, and later validating Interactive Voice Response Systems (IVRS) to spare customers confusion and embarrassment.

Decades later, and in an era where Artificial Intelligence should be able to navigate linguistic landmines, it&#39;s almost reassuring that blindly feeding text into a system without human verification can still produce unintended results.

Unless Severn Trent, a UK water company, is about to undergo a rebrand, and the robot has inadvertently blabbed. Calling yourself S Twatter, however, would be a very brave move, particularly in the UK.

Someone should probably add a quality check to that robocall system. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI&#39;s budget ChatGPT Go subscription tier has migrated to the US, soon to be accompanied by advertising. The company&#39;s free tier will be similarly afflicted.

ChatGPT Go, the company&#39;s cheapest paid offering, has been an option in 171 countries since August and is now available stateside for $8 per month.

&quot;In the coming weeks, we&#39;re also planning to start testing ads in the US for the free and Go tiers, so more people can benefit from our tools with fewer usage limits or without having to pay,&quot; said Fidji Simo, OpenAI&#39;s CEO of applications. &quot;Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise subscriptions will not include ads.&quot;

About 5 percent, or 35 million, of ChatGPT&#39;s weekly active user base as of July 2025 paid for Plus ($20/month) or Pro ($200/month) subscriptions, according to The Information. The company reportedly projects that by 2030 about 8.5 percent of a weekly active user base of roughly 2.6 billion - around 220 million people - will pay for a Plus subscription. With so many non-paying customers, ads may be its only route to financial survival. (That or a government bailout, which the company says won&#39;t happen.)

OpenAI has reportedly committed to spend more than $1 trillion to fuel its quest for the vaguely defined idea of &quot;artificial general intelligence.&quot; The AI giant lost north of $11.5 billion in the third quarter alone, according to numbers Microsoft – a large OpenAI investor – disclosed in its financial filings.

Meanwhile, online advertising is a massive business, contributing more than $74 billion to Google&#39;s revenues and more than $50 billion to Meta&#39;s revenues in the third quarter of 2025 alone. And chatbots like ChatGPT are technically capable of capturing a massive amount of extremely personal data, given that people use them for everything from vibe coding to online companionship to informal therapy.

Simo acknowledged the need to preserve people&#39;s trust in ChatGPT – to the extent that people trust LLMs known for making things up and getting things wrong – and made a number of vague commitments to offer reassurance that their artificial intelligence agent wouldn&#39;t become a mercenary sales agent.

This included a reiteration of the claim that the company&#39;s pursuit of advertising aligns with its mission to ensure AGI – a moving target based on some determination of human intellectual equivalency – &quot;benefits all of humanity.&quot;

Ads, Simo promised, will not influence the answers provided by ChatGPT, will be &quot;optimized based on what&#39;s most helpful to you,&quot; as Simo put it, and will be distinct and clearly labelled.

ChatGPT users under 18, and queries about sensitive topics like health or politics, will be spared from ads, or so it&#39;s claimed.

&quot;We keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers, and we never sell your data to advertisers,&quot; Simo said, adding that users will have the ability to control how their data is used and to disable personalization.

&quot;Selling data&quot; can mean different things in different contexts, but may be disallowed if consent is lacking, depending on the relevant privacy rules. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), it can mean &quot;selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer&#39;s personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.&quot;

Google and Meta have both insisted they don&#39;t sell personal data, but they certainly use it to target their own ads, and their decades of privacy missteps attest to the relevance of those claims.

Miranda Bogen, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology&#39;s AI Governance Lab, argues that even in the absence of data sharing, ad targeting can harm privacy. OpenAI&#39;s shift toward advertising presents risks for the company and its customers, she said.

&quot;Even if AI platforms don&#39;t share data directly with advertisers, business models based on targeted advertising put really dangerous incentives in place when it comes to user privacy,&quot; said Bogen in an emailed statement. &quot;This decision raises real questions about how business models will shape AI in the long run.&quot;

Bogen said that people use chatbots for a variety of reasons, including as companions and advisors. She argues that when tools try to exploit trust to sell goods, that may be problematic.

&quot;AI companies should be extremely careful not to repeat the many mistakes that have been made — and harms that have resulted from — the adoption of personalized ads on social media and around the web,&quot; she said.

Meta has integrated AI into its advertising business and uses AI-generated images in ads. But efforts by chatbot maker Perplexity to present ads in conjunction with its AI search service have fallen flat. Perplexity paused accepting new ad clients in October last year, following the departure of its head of advertising.

Lower-tier ChatGPT users who haven&#39;t bought their way out of advertising may still have some say in whether they see ads. Several makers of ad blocking applications and extensions already claim their tools can block ads that appear in ChatGPT. That may hold true when ChatGPT is accessed from the browser but is likely to be less feasible in OpenAI&#39;s native desktop apps. The possibilities will become clearer once OpenAI starts serving ads. ®

            <h2>Trump wants big tech to pay for big beautiful power plants</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/17/trump_wants_big_tech_pay_power_plants/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration says it wants big tech companies to take more accountability for the power their datacenters consume in an effort to shield voters from higher power bills at home.

On Friday, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and US Interior Secretary (and former Microsoft exec) Doug Burgum met with mid-Atlantic governors to pressure PJM Interconnection - one of the largest grid operators in the country - to hold an emergency auction to address rising energy demand from AI datacenter developments to the tune of $15 billion.

PJM is home to the largest concentration of datacenters in the US. Many new bit barns now exceed 100 megawatts of power capacity, with the likes of OpenAI and Meta already eyeing multi-gigawatt campuses.

These buildouts have sparked fears of higher power bills for local residents, something that hasn&#39;t sat well with politicians on either side of the aisle.

Last month, a trio of Democratic senators launched a probe into why consumers were seeing higher rates despite datacenter operators&#39; claims otherwise.

Rising energy prices haven&#39;t been popular with the US president either. On Monday, Trump used his personal echo chamber Truth Social to declare &quot;I never want Americans to pay higher electricity bills because of datacenters.&quot;

The initiative launched on Friday seeks to secure new baseload power generation, with US tech titans putting up the cash for 15-year contracts.

The DoE argues such an auction is justified after PJM&#39;s decision to take 17 gigawatts of capacity offline between 2020 and 2025. Much of the capacity which was already retired or slated for retirement was produced by coal-fired steam generators, for which Trump has shown a particular affinity.

&quot;In the coming years, America&#39;s reindustrialization and the AI race will require a significantly larger supply of around-the-clock, reliable, and uninterrupted power,&quot; an Energy.gov fact sheet reads. &quot;The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas.&quot;

In response to the Trump administration&#39;s demands, PJM&#39;s board of managers released a plan Friday directing the grid operator&#39;s staff to &quot;develop a proposal to both accelerate and execute&quot; a backstop procurement to supplement the company&#39;s last capacity auction.

The idea of datacenters bringing their own power has gained momentum in recent months, as operators have grappled with both long-term and immediate energy demands.

These efforts have included commissioning new gas generator plants along with portable generators to serve as stopgaps. Meanwhile, hyperscalers have placed bets on nuclear power startups like Oklo or X-Energy to satisfy their long-term power demands.

In a blog post on Tuesday, Microsoft formalized its commitments to &quot;pay its way&quot; to ensure local utility customers didn&#39;t end up footing the bill.

In spite of these initiatives, supply chain challenges continue to dog operators. Gas generators offer an easy path to addressing demand, but the equipment necessary to build and deploy them is locked up, with waitlists stretching out to 2030.

Meanwhile, even the most optimistic forecasts won&#39;t see the first commercial small modular reactors come online until the end of the decade.

Having said that, Microsoft has had some luck backing efforts to restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1 reactor. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s the one that didn&#39;t partially melt down in the late &#39;70s. The reactor is set to resume operations later next year. ®

It only affected Enterprise and IoT editions of Windows 11 23H2, and an emergency fix is already available.

Microsoft released its first security update of 2026 for Windows 11 on January 13th. Just four days later, it was forced to release an emergency out-of-band update to fix some pretty serious bugs, the first one introduced.

The security patch was stopping some systems from shutting down or hibernating properly, and also preventing some users from logging in via remote desktop. The impact of the shutdown bug was limited to machines still running Windows 11 23H2, and only those running either the Enterprise of IoT editions. Still, this is just the latest buggy update that has forced Microsoft to issue an out-of-band update, something that used to be pretty rare, but seems to be becoming increasingly common.

Microsoft has identified issues upon installing the January 2026 Windows security update. To address these issues, an out-of-band (OOB) update was released today, January 17, 2026.

- Connection and authentication failures in remote connection applications: This issue affects multiple platforms including Windows 11, version 25H2; Windows 10, version 22H2 ESU; and Windows Server 2025. See the bottom of this message for the complete list of affected products.

-Devices with Secure Launch might fail to shut down or hibernate: This issue only affects Windows 11, version 23H2.

Update January 18th: Added context specifying that only Windows 11 23H2 was affected.

Good deals are often hard to come by at the beginning of the year — which is precisely what makes Best Buy’s Winter Sale worth checking out. The ongoing sales event features discounts on everything from big-ticket OLED TVs to smaller electronics, including fitness trackers that can help you achieve your New Year’s resolutions. There are also solid deals to be had on laptops, Bose headphones, and other Verge-approved pieces of tech, many of which are matching their best prices to date.

The sale ends on January 19th, meaning you have the rest of the weekend to shop. Below, we’ve rounded up the deals — both big and small — that are genuinely worth your attention.

If you’re after a big-screen OLED, LG’s entry-level B5 Series TV remains one of the most affordable options available. And right now, it’s an even better value at Best Buy, where it has fallen to a new low of $1,499.99 ($1,500 off) in the larger 77-inch configuration.

Although it’s considered one of LG’s budget TVs and doesn’t get as bright as its pricier siblings, the B4 still delivers impressive image quality. You get rich colors, deep blacks, and great viewing angles, along with support for Dolby Vision. It supports Dolby Atmos, too, along with a solid set of gaming specs, including a 120Hz panel with a variable refresh rate, support for AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync, and four HDMI 2.1 ports for connecting the latest consoles. It runs on LG’s webOS platform as well, which lets you take advantage of Amazon Alexa and provides easy access to popular streaming apps like Netflix, HBO Max, and more.

Sony’s Bravia 8 II is also worth a look if you’re okay with splurging on a high-end TV. Named “King of TV” at the Value Electronics’ 2025 TV Shootout, Sony’s Bravia 8 II delivers one of the closest theater-level experiences you can get at home. And right now, you can buy the 65-inch panel for around $2,399.99 ($900 off) from Best Buy, Amazon, and directly from Sony, which is one of its better prices to date.

John Higgins, The Verge’s new(ish) TV reviewer, said that if he had to buy a TV today, this is the one he’d choose. It delivers deep blacks, excellent shadow detail, and some of the best image processing and upscaling we’ve seen, making lower-quality 1080p content look noticeably cleaner than on rivals. The Bravia 8 II also runs Google TV, which feels more intuitive and less cluttered than LG’s webOS, and features a 120Hz panel with two HDMI 2.1 ports for 4K gaming at 120Hz, plus two HDMI 2.0 ports capped at 4K / 60Hz. It doesn’t support Nvidia G-Sync or AMD FreeSync Premium, but for watching movies and TV shows, it’s one of the best OLEDs you can buy.

Bose’s first-gen flagships are a replacement for the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 that offer a more travel-friendly design, spatial audio, better call quality, excellent comfort, and some of the best noise cancellation around.

If you’re looking for an excellent pair of noise-canceling headphones that are easy to take on the go, Bose’s first-gen QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are on sale in select colors for $279 ($150 off) at Best Buy, matching their all-time low. Bose is also offering the over-ear headphones at that price, though, again, only in select colors.

The original QC Ultra remain our favorite pair for travel, thanks to a foldable design that makes them easy to pack, a lightweight and comfortable fit, and battery life that lasts up to 24 hours. They also deliver top-tier ANC and pleasing sound, with an Immersive Audio feature that isn’t always consistent but works well when it does. Plus, you get a natural-sounding transparency mode for when you want to let outside sound in. If you’re fine skipping newer upgrades found in the second-gen model, such as support for lossless audio over USB, the first-gen pair are a great value — especially since they’re currently about $100 cheaper.

The Amazfit Active 2 delivers outsized value for the price. It looks spiffy and has a wide array of health tracking features, plus built-in GPS and AI chatbots to provide extra context to your data. Read our review.

If you’re looking for a great all-around fitness tracker, the Amazfit Active 2 is still available for $84.99 ($15 off) at Best Buy, Amazon, and Target, which is just $5 shy of its lowest price to date.

The Active 2, which is currently our favorite fitness tracker, delivers far more than you’d expect at this price. It features a comfortable design with a chic stainless steel case and a bright, tempered-glass OLED display, along with up to nine days of battery life. It covers all the basics and then some, too, allowing you to leverage more premium features like menstrual cycle tracking, abnormal heart rate notifications, continuous heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, and detailed sleep tracking. You also get support for more than 160 sport types, including a strength training mode that counts reps for you, as well as offline maps with turn-by-turn navigation.

Speaking of Bose, Best Buy is also currently selling the latest Bose SoundLink Micro for a new low of $99 ($30 off), with retailers like Amazon and Walmart matching said price.

Bose’s pocketable Bluetooth speaker delivers solid sound for its size and even lets you adjust EQ through a companion app, unlike the first-gen model. It also offers up to 12 hours of battery life, recharges quickly via USB-C, and is surprisingly rugged thanks to an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. A built-in strap lets you easily attach it to a bag or bike, too, and if you already own a compatible Bose speaker or soundbar, you can pair the two together — or link a second-gen SoundLink Micro for stereo sound.

It’s first in the series to support multitouch for controlling two effects at once.

The Kaoss Pad has seen many different iterations, but the mainline effect unit and sampler hasn’t received an update since the launch of the KP3+ in 2013. Korg has finally given it the attention it deserves with the release of the Kaoss Pad V. Rather than a dramatic reimagining of what a Kaoss Pad is, the V takes the core idea — an effect unit with an X / Y pad for controlling parameters in a natural, performance-focused way.

The big innovation on the Kaoss Pad V is that it can recognize two fingers simultaneously to control two distinct sets of parameters, or even two entirely different effects. It also has a dedicated voice effects engine for vocoding and harmonizing. It can even convert vocal input into MIDI for controlling other gear. Imagine being able to control a drum machine by beatboxing, or a synth by humming.

The sampling and looping features have also been improved. You can record up to eight bars, overdub, and even chop and rearrange your loop. Those looping features are all the more useful since Korg finally added a balanced input so you can capture cleaner audio from mics, synths, and other instruments. Though, it sticks with unbalanced RCA ins and outs on the back, which are more useful for DJ setups, but less so in a studio.

One thing that has not gotten an upgrade, unfortunately, in 13 years is the price. The KP3+ launched at $349.99 in 2013, which, accounting for inflation, is about $493 in 2026 money. But the Korg Kaoss Pad V is for preorder at a whoping $649.99.

            <div id="article-text">The powerful exchange yanked its support of the Senate CLARITY Act at the last minute — and the rest of the crypto world, from Kraken to a16z, is infuriated.

The powerful exchange yanked its support of the Senate CLARITY Act at the last minute — and the rest of the crypto world, from Kraken to a16z, is infuriated.

January was going to be a landmark month for the crypto industry. The Senate would start negotiating the finer details of the CLARITY Act, a major law that would finally enshrine the fundamental structure of how the crypto market could legally operate in the United States: what digital assets counted as a security versus a commodity, what regulatory responsibilities companies had to abide by, what legal protections consumers could have. The House had already passed their version months ago. The White House was ready to sign it. Democrats and Republicans seemed to agree on the bill’s fundamentals.

And crypto, which had spent decades navigating a regulatory gray zone, would finally have a set of rules to work off of — maybe not perfect rules, but hard rules. “[We] don’t want to be in a place where, with the change of every administration, what you can and can’t do with software, or what you can and can’t publish, changes,” Connor Brown, the Head of Strategy for the Bitcoin Policy Institute, told The Verge.

Last Wednesday, just before midnight, everything fell apart.

Hours before the Senate Banking Committee would have convened for markup on Thursday — the period where a group of Republicans and Democrats would negotiate over every single word, clause, and amendment in the hundred-plus draft, to prepare it for a final Senate vote — Coinbase, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, announced that having reviewed the final draft of the bill, they were withdrawing their support for the CLARITY Act altogether.

“We’d rather have no bill than a bad bill,” CEO Brian Armstrong said on X, and later pinned the blame on a third party: the big banks, whose lobbyists had swooped in at the last minute to curb the threat of customers storing their money in crypto wallets instead of savings accounts.

Armstrong had several specific objections, but one hill Coinbase seems prepared to die on: whether crypto owners would be able to earn interest or other rewards off of holding stablecoins, a token whose price was pegged to the value of the US dollar, in the way that consumers could earn interest from money deposited in traditional bank accounts. (Coinbase did not return a request for comment.)

Banking committee chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) immediately cancelled the markup, just a “brief pause” to renegotiate. Lobbyists began calling around and analysts began dissecting the draft. But notably, the vast majority of crypto’s biggest players, from exchanges to investors, publicly announced that they would support the Senate bill, and implicitly bashed Coinbase for derailing its passage.

“Reasonable people can disagree on specific provisions. That is precisely why the final stage of this process matters,” Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi said on Thursday, reaffirming his support of the CLARITY Act. “The right response to outstanding issues is to resolve them not to abandon years of bipartisan progress and start over from scratch.” His sentiment was shared by a16z managing partner Chris Dixon, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and even David Sacks, the powerful White House special advisor on AI and Crypto, who urged Coinbase to “resolve any remaining differences” before the end of the month.

While the rest of the industry is willing to deal with the problems Armstrong pointed out in exchange for having a law, Coinbase — a publicly-traded company that offers yield-bearing stablecoin accounts — would suffer the most if the interest issue remains intact. But there is a real deadline to lock in any sort of meaningful crypto legislation, and it starts the moment that members of Congress begin running for re-election.

Midterm elections are generally guaranteed to kill any incentive for bipartisan consensus, but especially so in this cycle, where elected officials will have to face furious constituents who might see support of CLARITY as a proxy for supporting Trump. It doesn’t help that the Senate Republicans are trying to box out a Democrat-written provision that would prevent Trump from profiting off of crypto assets. Campaigns start in March, and the Senate is not in session next week, giving them less than a month to hammer out any issues before switching to campaign mode.

That is an exceedingly short amount of time for the Banking Committee to renegotiate new language, mark up that bill, send it to the Senate Agriculture Committee (which is responsible for regulating commodities), and negotiate even further before it even hits the Senate floor for a full vote. And “floor time” — when the Senate can summon all 100 members to vote for a bill in person — is an increasingly rare commodity before the election season. (Most of it will likely be burned on averting yet another government shutdown.)

Punting the bill to next year isn’t a safe option, either. It’s widely expected that the Republicans will lose either the House or the Senate, giving Democrats the means to block CLARITY’s passage for whatever reason they cite. And while the current president might be a steadfast ally to the crypto industry, there’s no telling who will come after him, much less how they’d feel about crypto.

“Will we ever have a setup as favorable as we do right now? Hard to imagine,” Seth Hertlein, the global head of policy at Ledger. “Could it happen? Sure, maybe, nobody knows. But there’s definitely a sense that if we don’t get it done now, either it’s not going to happen, or it will happen on much less favorable terms.”

In the meantime, however, DC policymakers are frustrated that Coinbase reopened a debate that had seemingly been settled last year: the House had already spent years writing and negotiating a crypto market structure bill, which passed last August with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. In the defense of Coinbase, the Senate’s version now had to contend with the demands of the finance industry, which had not initially weighed in on crypto market structure until late last year, as well as the progressive Democrat Senators on the committee. And, of course, the Senate had insisted on writing its own version of the bill instead of working off the House’s version.

“The Senate is where House bills go to die,” said Hertlein. “That’s a common Washington bubble joke.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is The Stepback, a weekly newsletter breaking down one essential story from the tech world. For more on dystopian developments in AI, follow Hayden Field. The Stepback arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for The Stepback here.

You could say it all started with Elon Musk’s AI FOMO — and his crusade against “wokeness.” When his AI company, xAI, announced Grok in November 2023, it was described as a chatbot with “a rebellious streak” and the ability to “answer spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.” The chatbot debuted after a few months of development and just two months of training, and the announcement highlighted that Grok would have real-time knowledge of the X platform.

But there are inherent risks to a chatbot having both the run of the internet and X, and it’s safe to say xAI may not have taken the necessary steps to address them. Since Musk took over Twitter in 2022 and renamed it X, he laid off 30% of its global trust and safety staff and cut its number of safety engineers by 80%, Australia’s online safety watchdog said last January. As for xAI, when Grok was released, it was unclear whether xAI had a safety team already in place. When Grok 4 was released in July, it took more than a month for the company to release a model card — a practice typically seen as an industry standard, which details safety tests and potential concerns. Two weeks after Grok 4’s release, an xAI employee wrote on X that he was hiring for xAI’s safety team and that they “urgently need strong engineers/researchers.” In response to a commenter, who asked, “xAI does safety?” the original employee said xAI was “working on it.”

Journalist Kat Tenbarge wrote about how she first started seeing sexually explicit deepfakes go viral on Grok in June 2023. Those images obviously weren’t created by Grok — it didn’t even have the ability to generate images until August 2024 — but X’s response to the concerns was varied. Even last January, Grok was inciting controversy for AI-generated images. And this past August, Grok’s “spicy” video-generation mode created nude deepfakes of Taylor Swift without even being asked. Experts have told The Verge since September that the company takes a whack-a-mole approach to safety and guardrails — and that it’s difficult enough to keep an AI system on the straight and narrow when you design it with safety in mind from the beginning, let alone if you’re going back to fix baked-in problems. Now, it seems that approach has blown up in xAI’s face.

Grok has spent the last couple of weeks spreading nonconsensual, sexualized deepfakes of adults and minors all over the platform, as promoted. Screenshots show Grok complying with users asking it to replace women’s clothing with lingerie and make them spread their legs, as well as to put small children in bikinis. And there are even more egregious reports. It’s gotten so bad that during a 24-hour analysis of Grok-created images on X, one estimate gauged the chatbot to be generating about 6,700 sexually suggestive or “nudifying” images per hour. Part of the reason for the onslaught is a recent feature added to Grok, allowing users to use an “edit” button to ask the chatbot to change images, without the original poster’s consent.

Since then, we’ve seen a handful of countries either investigate the matter or threaten to ban X altogether. Members of the French government promised an investigation, as did the Indian IT ministry, and a Malaysian government commission wrote a letter about its concerns. California governor Gavin Newsom called on the US Attorney General to investigate xAI. The United Kingdom said it is planning to pass a law banning the creation of AI-generated nonconsensual, sexualized images, and the country’s communications-industry regulator said it would investigate both X and the images that had been generated in order to see if they violated its Online Safety Act. And this week, both Malaysia and Indonesia blocked access to Grok.

xAI initially said its goal for Grok was to “assist humanity in its quest for understanding and knowledge,” “maximally benefit all of humanity,” and “empower our users with our AI tools, subject to the law,” as well as to “serve as a powerful research assistant for anyone.” That’s a far cry from generating nude-adjacent deepfakes of women without their consent, let alone minors.

On Wednesday evening, as pressure on the company heightened, X’s Safety account put out a statement that the platform has “implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,” and that the restriction “applies to all users, including paid subscribers.” On top of that, only paid subscribers can use Grok to create or edit any sort of image moving forward, according to X. The statement went on to say that X “now geoblock[s] the ability of all users to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear, and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it’s illegal,” which was a strange point to make since earlier in the statement, the company said it was not allowing anyone to use Grok to edit images in such a way.

Another important point: My colleagues tested Grok’s image-generation restrictions on Wednesday to find that it took less than a minute to get around most guardrails. Although asking the chatbot to “put her in a bikini” or “remove her clothes” produced censored results, they found, it had no qualms about delivering on prompts like “show me her cleavage,” “make her breasts bigger,” and “put her in a crop top and low-rise shorts,” as well as generating images in lingerie and sexualized poses. As of Wednesday evening, we were still able to get the Grok app to generate revealing images of people, using a free account.

Even after X’s Wednesday statement, we may see a number of other countries either ban or block access to either all of X or just Grok, at least temporarily. We’ll also see how the proposed laws and investigations around the world play out. The pressure is mounting for Musk, who on Wednesday afternoon took to X to say that he is “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok.” Hours later, X’s Safety team put out its statement, saying it’s “working around the clock to add additional safeguards, take swift and decisive action to remove violating and illegal content, permanently suspend accounts where appropriate, and collaborate with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.”

What technically is and isn’t against the law is a big question here. For instance, experts told The Verge earlier this month that AI-generated images of identifiable minors in bikinis, or potentially even naked, may not technically be illegal under current child sexual abuse material (CSAM) laws in the US, though of course disturbing and unethical. But lascivious images of minors in such situations are against the law. We’ll see if those definitions expand or change, even though the current laws are a bit of a patchwork.

As for nonconsensual intimate deepfakes of adult women, the Take It Down Act, signed into law in May 2025, bars nonconsensual AI-generated “intimate visual depictions” and requires certain platforms to rapidly remove them. The grace period before the latter part goes into effect — requiring platforms to actually remove them — ends in May 2026, so we may see some significant developments in the next six months.

But don’t worry, someone recorded it for posterity.

”Share a Disney quote that sums up how you’re feeling right now!”

That’s what Disney posted on Threads the other day, and people immediately replied with lines from Star Wars, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and even Mary Poppins. The throughline between all the quotes: they were pretty pointedly anti-fascist and clearly aimed at the current administration.

Apparently, Disney either couldn’t handle the anti-fascist messaging of its own movies or was too afraid of pissing off the powers that be, because it quickly deleted the post. Thankfully, one resourceful Threads user recorded it for posterity, reminding us that yes, the human world is, in fact, a mess.

Depending who you ask, AI-powered coding is either giving software developers an unprecedented productivity boost or churning out masses of poorly designed code that saps their attention and sets software projects up for serious long term-maintenance problems.

The problem is right now, it’s not easy to know which is true.

As tech giants pour billions into large language models (LLMs), coding has been touted as the technology’s killer app. Executives enamored with the potential are pushing engineers to lean into an AI-powered future. But after speaking to more than 30 developers, technology executives, analysts, and researchers, MIT Technology Review found that the picture is not as straightforward as it might seem. Read the full story.

Generative coding is one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. Learn more about why that is, and check out the rest of the list!

This story was also part of our Hype Correction package. You can read the rest of the stories here.

Earlier this week, MIT Technology Review published our annual list of Ten Breakthrough Technologies.

This year’s list includes tech that’s set to transform the energy industry, artificial intelligence, space travel—and of course biotech and health. Our breakthrough biotechnologies for 2026 involve editing a baby’s genes and, separately, resurrecting genes from ancient species. We also included a controversial technology that offers parents the chance to screen their embryos for characteristics like height and intelligence. Here’s the story behind our biotech choices.

“I am very annoyed. I’m very disappointed. I’m seriously frustrated.”

—Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla tells attendees at a healthcare conference this week his feelings about the anti-vaccine agenda Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been implementing, Bloomberg reports.

Technically speaking, neuroscientists have been able to read your mind for decades. It’s not easy, mind you. First, you must lie motionless within a fMRI scanner, perhaps for hours, while you watch films or listen to audiobooks.

If you do elect to endure claustrophobic hours in the scanner, the software will learn to generate a bespoke reconstruction of what you were seeing or listening to, just by analyzing how blood moves through your brain.

More recently, researchers have deployed generative AI tools, like Stable Diffusion and GPT, to create far more realistic, if not entirely accurate, reconstructions of films and podcasts based on neural activity. So how close are we to genuine “mind reading?” Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, MIT Technology Review published its annual list of Ten Breakthrough Technologies. As always, it features technologies that made the news last year, and which—for better or worse—stand to make waves in the coming years. They’re the technologies you should really be paying attention to.

This year’s list includes tech that’s set to transform the energy industry, artificial intelligence, space travel—and of course biotech and health. Our breakthrough biotechnologies for 2026 involve editing a baby’s genes and, separately, resurrecting genes from ancient species. We also included a controversial technology that offers parents the chance to screen their embryos for characteristics like height and intelligence. Here’s the story behind our biotech choices.

In August 2024, KJ Muldoon was born with a rare genetic disorder that allowed toxic ammonia to build up in his blood. The disease can be fatal, and KJ was at risk of developing neurological disorders. At the time, his best bet for survival involved waiting for a liver transplant.

Then he was offered an experimental gene therapy—a personalized “base editing” treatment designed to correct the specific genetic “misspellings” responsible for his disease. It seems to have worked! Three doses later, KJ is doing well. He took his first steps in December, shortly before spending his first Christmas at home.

KJ’s story is hugely encouraging. The team behind his treatment is planning a clinical trial for infants with similar disorders caused by different genetic mutations. The team members hope to win regulatory approval on the back of a small trial—a move that could make the expensive treatment (KJ’s cost around $1 million) more accessible, potentially within a few years.

Others are getting in on the action, too. Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted the team that developed KJ’s treatment. He recently cofounded Aurora Therapeutics, a startup that hopes to develop gene-editing drugs for another disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). The goal is to obtain regulatory approval for a single drug that can then be adjusted or personalized for individuals without having to go through more clinical trials.

US regulators seem to be amenable to the idea and have described a potential approval pathway for such “bespoke, personalized therapies.” Watch this space.

It was a big year for Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company hoping to “de-extinct” animals like the woolly mammoth and the dodo. In March, the company created what it called “woolly mice”—rodents with furry coats and curly whiskers akin to those of woolly mammoths.

The company made an even more dramatic claim the following month, when it announced it had created three dire wolves. These striking snow-white animals were created by making 20 genetic changes to the DNA of gray wolves based on genetic research on ancient dire wolf bones, the company said at the time.

Whether these animals can really be called dire wolves is debatable, to say the least. But the technology behind their creation is undeniably fascinating. We’re talking about the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, which can then be introduced into cells from other, modern-day species.

Analysis of ancient DNA can reveal all sorts of fascinating insights into human ancestors and other animals. And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more here.

IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.

Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.

This is controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.

Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing, you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to have their “best baby.” Read more here.

In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he bought a new laptop and iPhone. He wanted to reduce the risk of having his personal devices confiscated, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, it’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing. Read the full story.

As thousands of companies trumpet their plans to cut carbon pollution, a small group of sustainability consultants has emerged as the go-to arbiter of corporate climate action.

The Science Based Targets initiative, or SBTi, helps businesses develop a timetable for action to shrink their climate footprint through some combination of cutting greenhouse-gas pollution and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. After years of small-scale sustainability work, SBTi is growing rapidly, and governments are paying attention.

But while the group has earned praise for reeling the private sector into constructive conversations about climate emissions, its rising influence has also attracted scrutiny and raised questions about why a single organization is setting the standards for many of the world’s largest companies.

            <div id="article-text">Happy New Year! I know it’s a bit late to say, but it never quite feels like the year has started until the new edition of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies list comes out.

For 25 years, MIT Technology Review has put together this package, which highlights the technologies that we think are going to matter in the future. This year’s version has some stars, including gene resurrection (remember all the dire wolf hype last year?) and commercial space stations.

And of course, the world of climate and energy is represented with sodium-ion batteries, next-generation nuclear, and hyperscale AI data centers. Let’s take a look at what ended up on the list, and what it says about this moment for climate tech.

I’ve been covering sodium-ion batteries for years, but this moment feels like a breakout one for the technology.

Today, lithium-ion cells power everything from EVs, phones, and computers to huge stationary storage arrays that help support the grid. But researchers and battery companies have been racing to develop an alternative, driven by the relative scarcity of lithium and the metal’s volatile price in recent years.

Sodium-ion batteries could be that alternative. Sodium is much more abundant than lithium, and it could unlock cheaper batteries that hold a lower fire risk.

There are limitations here: Sodium-ion batteries won’t be able to pack as much energy into cells as their lithium counterparts. But it might not matter, especially for grid storage and smaller EVs.

In recent years, we’ve seen a ton of interest in sodium-based batteries, particularly from major companies in China. Now the new technology is starting to make its way into the world—CATL says it started manufacturing these batteries at scale in 2025.

Nuclear reactors are an important part of grids around the world today—massive workhorse reactors generate reliable, consistent electricity. But the countries with the oldest and most built-out fleets have struggled to add to them in recent years, since reactors are massive and cost billions. Recent high-profile projects have gone way over budget and faced serious delays.

Next-generation reactor designs could help the industry break out of the old blueprint and get more nuclear power online more quickly, and they’re starting to get closer to becoming reality.

There’s a huge variety of proposals when it comes to what’s next for nuclear. Some companies are building smaller reactors, which they say could make it easier to finance new projects, and get them done on time.

Other companies are focusing on tweaking key technical bits of reactors, using alternative fuels or coolants that help ferry heat out of the reactor core. These changes could help reactors generate electricity more efficiently and safely.

Kairos Power was the first US company to receive approval to begin construction on a next-generation reactor to produce electricity. China is emerging as a major center of nuclear development, with the country’s national nuclear company reportedly working on several next-gen reactors.

This one isn’t quite what I would call a climate technology, but I spent most of last year reporting on the climate and environmental impacts of AI, and the AI boom is deeply intertwined with climate and energy.

Data centers aren’t new, but we’re seeing a wave of larger centers being proposed and built to support the rise of AI. Some of these facilities require a gigawatt or more of power—that’s like the output of an entire conventional nuclear power plant, just for one data center.

(This feels like a good time to mention that our Breakthrough Technologies list doesn’t just highlight tech that we think will have a straightforwardly positive influence on the world. I think back to our 2023 list, which included mass-market military drones.)

There’s no denying that new, supersize data centers are an important force driving electricity demand, sparking major public pushback, and emerging as a key bit of our new global infrastructure.

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.  Here’s what that might look like.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI’s decision to introduce advertisements inside ChatGPT for free users and its new $8 “Go” tier is already shaping up to be one of the most consequential pivots in generative AI’s short history. It’s not a simple business tweak. It’s a reframing of where digital intent, attention, and commercial influence intersect in an age where conversations increasingly replace search bars.

Yet, this moment will be remembered not as the day ads arrived in ChatGPT, but as the day two decades of assumptions about search and digital advertising broke open.

Read that again: ads won’t sit beside or above a list of links, as they do on Google. They will appear inside the conversational flow, at the moment a user has just received a helpful answer.

This is not incremental. It’s a new interface for intent.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

For years, OpenAI developed ChatGPT as an ad-free oasis in a web saturated with promotions, pop-ups, and sponsored results. Now it’s embracing the oldest monetization strategy on the internet: advertising.  The company insists ads will be clearly labeled, won’t influence AI responses, and won’t depend on selling individual user data. Ads will appear below answers when relevant, and paid tiers like Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise remain ad-free.

To understand why this matters, you need to see it not as an ad insertion, but as a shift in how commerce enters human intent, at the moment of decision, not distraction.

In a classic Google search, thoughtful queries turn into ranked links and ad slots beside them. In a ChatGPT conversation, a user asks a question, gets an answer, and stays in context; the frame never changes. An ad beneath that response isn’t an interruption; it’s an extension of the thought process. This subtle repositioning changes how brands can engage a user: they’re not chasing clicks after a search, they’re walking up with the answer itself.

That’s a paradigm shift. Brands are no longer competing for top billing on a results page; they are competing to be part of the narrative that unfolds between a question and a resolution. It’s a level of semantic proximity to intent that search ads never capture, because even the best keywords are guesses at nuance. ChatGPT sees nuance first.

Let restaurants, retailers, and SaaS companies imagine that: not just showing an ad after someone searches “best CRM tools,” but appearing contextually right when someone asks “what CRM features matter to small teams.” That changes where conversion flows start.

This isn’t happening. OpenAI’s infrastructure costs are enormous, and its free user base dwarfs its subscriber base. Only a small fraction of ChatGPT’s hundreds of millions of weekly active users currently pay. Advertising offers a scalable revenue path that could subsidize free access and help the company balance long-term costs.

It’s striking that OpenAI once positioned ads as a “last resort.” Now they’re a strategic mainstay. That tells you two things: the scale of AI compute bills is real, and the company is trying to find a sustainable business model that doesn’t rely solely on subscription fatigue.

ChatGPT’s value isn’t just utility; it’s credibility, the feeling that the answer isn’t trying to sell you something. Introducing ads atop or below answers may be technically neutral, but perception is sticky. Once a user notices “Sponsored” within the thoughtful flow of a conversation, trust becomes negotiable. Academic research on ads in AI interfaces shows that even labeled ads can reduce perceived trust and make users feel manipulated, especially if they blur with responses.

OpenAI recognizes this. It’s promising to avoid showing ads in sensitive contexts, like health, politics, or personal advice, and won’t target minors. It’s also pledging that ads won’t twist the model’s answers.

Yet trust isn’t a function of code; it’s a feeling users develop over time. One poorly placed ad recommendation, even if accurate, can make people wonder whether the answer was shaped by commercial rather than objective logic.

From a creative standpoint, this is both exciting and fraught. The ads we’ve long tolerated have trained us to think of marketing as interruption: banners, pop-ups, pre-roll videos. ChatGPT’s approach suggests something closer to contextual dialogue, where an ad feels like a part of exploration. The brands that succeed here won’t be the loudest; they’ll be the most relevant, most resonant, and most human. They’ll read like answers, not impositions, because they’re embedded in answers.

That opens a new creative demand: marketers will need to think less about clickbait hooks and more about narrative relevance, how to be helpful within a user’s question, not beside it.

Is this the end of Google? No. Google’s advertising machine is vast, integrated, and highly optimized. Its AI integration in search, including AI summaries, already blends insight with ads in ways that are more sophisticated than many realize.

But the rise of ads in ChatGPT signals that intent has multiple layers now. There’s traditional search intent tied to links and pages, and there’s conversational intent captured in natural language interactions. These layers will coexist, sometimes reinforce, sometimes compete.

Advertisers and creators today often optimize for keywords. Tomorrow, they’ll optimize for conversational moments, the semantic cues that signal purchase interest within a dialogue.

The rollout now is just the beginning. If AI systems evolve into multi-modal, interactive assistants that help people plan trips, make purchases, write essays, plan budgets, and solve problems of every sort, the point at which commerce enters that interaction becomes crucial.

The question is no longer “Will people see our ad?” but “Will they trust our recommendation when it pops up next to an AI answer?”

That’s the real test, and the real frontier.

            <h2>BizzyNow opens Mamacrowd equity round to fund “micro-meetings” for business professionals</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/bizzynow-opens-mamacrowd-equity-round">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Italian startup BizzyNow has launched an equity crowdfunding round on Mamacrowd to finance the next phase of its networking app, built around quick, in-person meetups it calls “Bizzy Moments.” The campaign targets €150k–€400k at a €3m pre-money valuation, with a €500 minimum ticket. BizzyNow says proceeds will support go-to-market validation, product upgrades, and the operational groundwork needed to scale.

Professional networking has a timing problem. The most valuable introductions often happen in the gaps: 40 minutes before a flight, a pause between conference sessions, an unscheduled evening in a new city, or the lull after a client meeting. But the tools professionals typically use to connect are optimized for asynchronous, low-context interactions (requests, messages, posts) rather than real-time, location-based intent.

BizzyNow’s premise is simple: when two relevant people are already in the same place, and both have time, “discovering each other” should not require long threads, calendar gymnastics, or cold outreach. The company positions its product as a way to turn downtime during business travel and events into structured, high-signal conversations.

“BizzyNow is built for the moments when professionals are already in the same place, with time to meet, but no practical way to discover each other quickly. We’re giving people a way to use that moment to show their best side, and turn idle business travel time into measurable B2B outcomes”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow is designed to turn “I have 45 minutes” into a practical meeting. The app uses geolocation plus an AI layer and LinkedIn integration to surface nearby professionals who may be relevant, then encourages short, structured meetups lasting roughly 30 to 90 minutes. BizzyNow describes these as micro-meetings held in neutral, community-recommended locations, intended to move beyond chatting into a realconversation. BizzyNow also describes a trust-oriented scoring approach that is meant to reflect the value creates through meetings, emphasizing quality and follow-through rather than connection
volume.

BizzyNow is pitching into a familiar contradiction: professionals are back at conferences, airports, hotels, and coworking spaces, but introductions still default to slow, noisy digital channels. In-person events have regained their role as dealflow engines. Yet discovery remains fragmented across LinkedIn messages, WhatsApp groups, and chance encounters, with little infrastructure for “right person, right place, right time.” BizzyNow is betting that instant, location-aware matching can become a practical layer for high-intent environments, especially where timing is the constraint.

The company’s target segments reflect that focus. In campaign materials, BizzyNow points to business travelers, managers, freelancers, expats, event communities, corporate HR, coworking spaces, hotels, and airports as core audiences and partners.

The raise is being run via Mamacrowd, one of Italy’s established equity crowdfunding platforms, and the campaign is live.

On the Mamacrowd listing, the round is set with:

For early-stage startups, equity crowdfunding can be more than financing. It can act as a public proof point for market interest, build a base of aligned advocates, and strengthen credibility with commercial partners, especially for products that grow through communities.

BizzyNow’s internal materials describe traction that is still early but measurable, including ca. 2,000 free users, 400 weekly active users (22.6% WAU-to-total), and six active corporate pilots. The same documents state that the company is in pre-revenue, with monetization intentionally deferred during the validation phase. That context matters: this is a campaign funding a transition from adoption validation to monetization proof, not a late-stage expansion round.

“Crowdfunding fits our model because community is not a byproduct for us. It’s part of how we validate activation, refine the product, and build repeatable go-to-market channels before scaling”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow’s pitch deck frames its roadmap as a progression “from validation to global market,” staged across three years:

● 2025: MVP, beta launch, early validation
● 2026: Premium launch, B2B pilots, monetization validation
● 2027: EMEA expansion and scale readiness

That sequencing aligns with what BizzyNow describes in its internal underwriting materials: corporate pilots are active, monetization is modeled to begin mid-2026, and the near-term priority is proving repeatable activation and conversion mechanics.

On use of funds, the Executive Pitch Deck states the round is intended to validate monetization, strengthen product capabilities, and prepare for scale, with spend tied to measurable validation milestones across:

● Marketing & GTM validation
● Product and premium features
● Compliance and governance
● Team and operations

The Mamacrowd campaign further breaks planned allocation into ranges:

● 40%–50% Marketing and Brand Activation
● 20%–25% Technology Development (BizzyNow app)
● 10% Legal and Compliance
● 10%–15% Team and Operations● 10% Strategic reserve

BizzyNow also outlines a B2B-oriented monetization path in its deck and model assumptions, including paid event activations, company-wide licensing, and data/analytics packages, while explicitly noting that projections remain validation-stage assumptions and will be refined as unit economics are proven.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In January 2026, London’s mayor gave a blunt warning that has reverberated far beyond City Hall: artificial intelligence could trigger “mass unemployment” in the capital’s core industries unless policymakers act now.

His words came with an unexpected counterweight: an announcement of free AI training and a dedicated task force to help workers adapt. This juxtaposition captures a tension shaping Europe’s labour landscape: fear and opportunity locked in the same story.

The anxiety isn’t limited to one city. Across the continent, debates about AI’s impact on jobs are intensifying. Visionaries and critics paint dramatically different pictures. Some technologists warn that advanced AI could substitute human labour at an unprecedented pace.

Others argue these fears are exaggerated or misplaced if governments and employers can guide the transition. For many Europeans, the question is no longer theoretical; it is unfolding before their eyes.

At first look, the job market’s headline figures tell a reassuring story: overall unemployment across the European Union remains low, with EU unemployment at about 5.8% in 2025, down from 6.0% a year earlier. Youth unemployment has also declined in many countries, indicating that even entry-level opportunities persist for most workers.

In some sectors where AI tools are already in use, work has been reshaped rather than eliminated. A European study found that 30% of EU workers now use AI at work, especially for text tasks like writing and translation, and that digital tools have become nearly universal (90%) across workplaces.

Many workers report that AI helps them perform tasks more efficiently or take on different responsibilities. At the same time, employers are actively reassessing job roles because of AI, with about 71% of European firms reconsidering job responsibilities due to AI implementation and over a quarter reducing hiring or cutting roles as a direct result of AI deployment.

Beneath these numbers lie subtler shifts. Firms across the EU are becoming cautious about hiring, in part because of economic slowdowns and in part because AI adoption is changing how work gets done. Economic indicators suggest employment growth across the EU will slow in the coming years, with fewer vacancies and reduced labour market dynamism even as AI use spreads.

The most visible tension is at the intersection of perception and preparation. On the one hand, public statements like London’s mayors reflect a palpable fear of displacement. Sectors such as finance, legal services, and customer support, pillars of many European economies,  are widely considered vulnerable to automation and generative AI technologies.

Detailed labour data suggest that many jobs are being reshaped at the task level, even if entire job categories are not yet disappearing wholesale. For example, AI is automating routine text production and data tasks while increasingly augmenting analytical and oversight functions.

On the other hand, there are signs of adaptability. Governments and institutions are launching initiatives to reskill workers and embed AI fluency into professional development. Across Europe, digital skills gaps remain significant; only 56% of adults aged 16-74 had basic digital skills in 2023, well below the EU’s target, indicating the scale of upskilling needed.

Educational efforts range from vocational programs to industry partnerships that teach AI-related skills. For example, private training providers across the EU are expanding online programs in data science, analytics, and AI competencies, reflecting a growing recognition that skills matter as much as technology itself.

It would be a mistake to frame this moment as simply a binary between jobs lost and jobs saved. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts both creation and disruption, with employers foreseeing demand for entirely new roles even as others change or shrink.

The report finds that technologies, including AI, are expected to create millions of new jobs globally while displacing an estimated number of others, highlighting the scale of transformation.

There is also a policy dimension that can’t be overlooked. European institutions are experimenting with social safety nets and active labour market policies that aim to cushion displacement and support transitions.

Proposals like a European AI Social Compact argue for strategies that combine employment support, training, and social protections as central to economic planning.

National governments are debating everything from expanded unemployment support tied to training to tax incentives for companies that invest in human capital alongside AI. These measures acknowledge that the future of work is not simply about machines replacing people, but about how people and machines can be integrated into resilient labour ecosystems.

Yet challenges remain. Entry-level opportunities, the traditional gateway for recent graduates, are tightening in many sectors as employers increasingly use automated systems in recruitment and candidate screening.

Surveys suggest broad concern among young job seekers about prospects in an AI-transformed market, even where overall employment remains stable.

Some employers are re-imagining entry paths by embedding AI training into internship programs, while others are partnering with universities to co-design curricula that emphasize AI-augmented work. These efforts signal that adaptation is possible, but they also highlight how uneven the transition has been so far.

What Europe faces now is not a single story of mass job losses or unrestrained job growth. It is a mosaic of experiences, where headlines of risk and reports of adaptation coexist. The labour market is not static; it is reacting to technology, to policy, to fear and hope in equal measure.

If there is a throughline, it’s this: Europe’s future of work will be shaped not just by the capabilities of artificial intelligence, but by choices about education, regulation, and social support.

The decisions policymakers and employers make today will tilt the balance between disruption and opportunity. In that sense, the conversation is less about whether AI will change jobs; it already is, and more about how Europe navigates the change.

That is the reality workers, firms, and governments must confront together.

This reminds me of the well-known anecdote in Romanian political history in which Ion I.C. (Ionel) Brătianu, asked by historian and politician Nicolae Iorga what a scholar could learn from an engineer, replied with just that phrase, a call for moderation and thoughtful judgment: “Measure, sir, measure!”

Thus, measure, thoughtful regulation, and worker-focused policy will make sure AI supports people’s work, protects rights, and steers technological change toward shared opportunity, not making them unemployed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian cybersecurity startup Aikido Security has closed a $60 million Series B funding round at a $1 billion valuation, marking a rare unicorn milestone for a European security company and highlighting the accelerating interest in developer-centric security platforms.

The round was led by DST Global, a tech-oriented investment firm with a track record of backing major technology companies, and included participation from PSG Equity, Notion Capital, and Singular. Founded in 2022, Aikido has reached a billion-dollar valuation in just three years, a pace few cybersecurity firms attain, and according to company sources, the fastest in Europe.

The new capital will help Aikido accelerate product development and expand further into key markets, especially the United States, where it already generates around half of its revenue. In the past year, the company’s revenue grew roughly fivefold, while its customer base nearly tripled.

Aikido’s core proposition is rooted in the conviction that traditional application security tools have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of software development. Modern engineering teams ship code more frequently, and the widespread adoption of AI tools for coding has heightened both velocity and risk. Legacy scanners and point solutions can generate noise and distract developers, rather than offering actionable insights at the right moment.

Instead of siloed products that address a single layer of the stack, Aikido provides a unified platform that spans code analysis, cloud security, and runtime monitoring, with an emphasis on automation. The platform is designed to detect risks early in the development process, prioritise issues based on real-world impact, and help engineering teams fix problems before they reach production.

CEO Willem Delbare has framed the product as “guardrails” for developers, tools that fit fluidly into existing workflows rather than creating extra hurdles.

Customers range from gaming and mobile app developers to fintech and music streaming platforms, with names like Niantic, Revolut, and SoundCloud appearing among early adopters. These use cases underscore demand for security tools that can keep pace with modern development practices, where agility and context are essential.

Aikido’s valuation and investor interest reflect broader trends in the cybersecurity landscape. Once a domain dominated by perimeter defence and signature-based detection, security has had to adapt as software infrastructure shifts to cloud services, microservices architectures, and continuous delivery. Investors are especially focused on tools that reduce friction for engineering teams and support automated, context-aware security workflows.

DST Global’s lead on the round is noteworthy given the firm’s history of backing companies that scale globally.

In a funding environment where investor scrutiny has tightened and deals are won largely on product differentiation and tangible traction, Aikido’s growth metrics have helped draw attention. A fivefold increase in revenue within a year and strong adoption metrics among engineering teams suggest a product that resonates with users, not just buyers.

Aikido’s unicorn status also illustrates how European startups in traditionally U.S.-centric sectors like cybersecurity can carve out meaningful niches. Security products have long struggled to escape the shadow of established players headquartered in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, but a steady wave of startups with developer-oriented tools has begun to reshape expectations.

That said, the competitive landscape remains crowded.

Vendors across cloud security, application scanning, vulnerability management, and developer tooling are all vying for engineering team attention. Some focus on narrow functions such as static analysis or open-source risk, while others bundle broader offerings. Aikido bets that a unified, integrated experience can reduce cognitive load and streamline security workflows.

In its own communications, Aikido has described evolving toward what it calls “self-securing software,” a future state where systems can automatically test, detect, and remediate vulnerabilities without extensive human intervention. This vision is reflected in recent product releases that embed automated penetration testing and contextual risk analysis directly into development pipelines.

Technical roadmaps shared by the company suggest deeper integrations with cloud platforms and enhanced automation capabilities, allowing developers to catch and fix issues as code is written and deployed. This direction aligns with broader industry shifts toward “security as code,” where security functions are embedded in the same workflows as infrastructure and application development.

Expanding partnerships with cloud providers and refining API-first integrations are likely priorities for Aikido in the near term. As engineering teams increasingly adopt secure development practices as part of their standard operating model, integrated platforms become more attractive than point solutions that require separate processes and tools.

Aikido’s rapid growth and investor backing reinforce a fundamental shift in security tooling: developers are now viewed as primary stakeholders in safeguarding software. This contrasts with earlier models where specialised security teams acted as gatekeepers. By aligning security functions with development workflows, tools like Aikido aim to reduce friction while improving risk visibility.

For investors, the deal is a signal that cybersecurity remains a fertile ground for innovation, particularly where AI and automation intersect with foundational development practices. As software becomes more complex and distributed, demand for real-time, integrated security controls will only rise.

Aikido’s unicorn milestone is less about the label and more about the validation of a model that places developers at the centre of security. If successful, this approach could influence how future security platforms are built and adopted across the industry.
