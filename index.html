            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/new-ai-plugin-uses-wikipedias-ai-writing-detection-rules-to-help-it-sound-human/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Saturday, tech entrepreneur Siqi Chen released an open source plugin for Anthropic’s Claude Code AI assistant that instructs the AI model to stop writing like an AI model. Called “Humanizer,” the simple prompt plugin feeds Claude a list of 24 language and formatting patterns that Wikipedia editors have listed as chatbot giveaways. Chen published the plugin on GitHub, where it has picked up over 1,600 stars as of Monday.

“It’s really handy that Wikipedia went and collated a detailed list of ‘signs of AI writing,’” Chen wrote on X. “So much so that you can just tell your LLM to… not do that.”

The source material is a guide from WikiProject AI Cleanup, a group of Wikipedia editors who have been hunting AI-generated articles since late 2023. French Wikipedia editor Ilyas Lebleu founded the project. The volunteers have tagged over 500 articles for review and, in August 2025, published a formal list of the patterns they kept seeing.

Chen’s tool is a “skill file” for Claude Code, Anthropic’s terminal-based coding assistant, which involves a Markdown-formatted file that adds a list of written instructions (you can see them here) appended to the prompt fed into the large language model (LLM) that powers the assistant. Unlike a normal system prompt, for example, the skill information is formatted in a standardized way that Claude models are fine-tuned to interpret with more precision than a plain system prompt. (Custom skills require a paid Claude subscription with code execution turned on.)

But as with all AI prompts, language models don’t always perfectly follow skill files, so does the Humanizer actually work? In our limited testing, Chen’s skill file made the AI agent’s output sound less precise and more casual, but it could have some drawbacks: it won’t improve factuality and might harm coding ability.

In particular, some of Humanizer’s instructions might lead you astray, depending on the task. For example, the Humanizer skill includes the line: “Have opinions. Don’t just report facts – react to them. ‘I genuinely don’t know how to feel about this’ is more human than neutrally listing pros and cons.” While being imperfect seems human, this kind of advice would probably not do you any favors if you were using Claude to write technical documentation.

Even with its drawbacks, it’s ironic that one of the web’s most referenced rule sets for detecting AI-assisted writing may help some people subvert it.

So what does AI writing look like? The Wikipedia guide is specific with many examples, but we’ll give you just one here for brevity’s sake.

Some chatbots love to pump up their subjects with phrases like “marking a pivotal moment” or “stands as a testament to,” according to the guide. They write like tourism brochures, calling views “breathtaking” and describing towns as “nestled within” scenic regions. They tack “-ing” phrases onto the end of sentences to sound analytical: “symbolizing the region’s commitment to innovation.”

To work around those rules, the Humanizer skill tells Claude to replace inflated language with plain facts and offers this example transformation:

Before: “The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain.”

After: “The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was established in 1989 to collect and publish regional statistics.”

Claude will read that and do its best as a pattern-matching machine to create an output that matches the context of the conversation or task at hand.

Even with such a confident set of rules crafted by Wikipedia editors, we’ve previously written about why AI writing detectors don’t work reliably: There is nothing inherently unique about human writing that reliably differentiates it from LLM writing.

One reason is that even though most AI language models tend toward certain types of language, they can also be prompted to avoid them, as with the Humanizer skill. (Although sometimes it’s very difficult, as OpenAI found in its yearslong struggle against the em dash.)

Also, humans can write in chatbot-like ways. For example, this article likely contains some “AI-written traits” that trigger AI detectors even though it was written by a professional writer—especially if we use even a single em dash—because most LLMs picked up writing techniques from examples of professional writing scraped from the web.

Along those lines, the Wikipedia guide has a caveat worth noting: While the list points out some obvious tells of, say, unaltered ChatGPT usage, it’s still composed of observations, not ironclad rules. A 2025 preprint cited on the page found that heavy users of large language models correctly spot AI-generated articles about 90 percent of the time. That sounds great until you realize that 10 percent are false positives, which is enough to potentially throw out some quality writing in pursuit of detecting AI slop.

Taking a step back, that probably means AI detection work might need to go deeper than flagging particular phrasing and delve (see what I did there?) more into the substantive factual content of the work itself.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Helix Nebula is one of the most well-known and commonly photographed planetary nebulae because it resembles the “Eye of Sauron.” It is also one of the closest bright nebulae to Earth, located approximately 655 light-years from our Solar System.

You may not know what this particular nebula looks like when reading its name, but the Hubble Space Telescope has taken some iconic images of it over the years. And almost certainly, you’ll recognize a photograph of the Helix Nebula, shown below.

Like many objects in astronomy, planetary nebulae have a confusing name, since they are formed not by planets but by stars like our own Sun, though a little larger. Near the end of their lives, these stars shed large amounts of gas in an expanding shell that, however briefly in cosmological time, put on a grand show.

Now the James Webb Space Telescope has turned its sights on the Helix Nebula, and, oh my, does it have a story to tell. NASA released the new images of the nebula on Tuesday.

In this image, there are vibrant pillars of gas along the inner region of the nebula’s expanding shell of gas. According to the space agency, this is what we’re seeing:

A blazing white dwarf, the leftover core of the dying star, lies right at the heart of the nebula, out of the frame of the Webb image. Its intense radiation lights up the surrounding gas, creating a rainbow of features: hot ionized gas closest to the white dwarf, cooler molecular hydrogen farther out, and protective pockets where more complex molecules can begin to form within dust clouds. This interaction is vital, as it’s the raw material from which new planets may one day form in other star systems.

In Webb’s image of the Helix Nebula, color represents the temperature and chemistry. A touch of a blue hue marks the hottest gas in this field, energized by intense ultraviolet light from the white dwarf. Farther out, the gas cools into the yellow regions where hydrogen atoms join into molecules. At the outer edges, the reddish tones trace the coolest material, where gas begins to thin and dust can take shape. Together, the colors show the star’s final breath transforming into the raw ingredients for new worlds, adding to the wealth of knowledge gained from Webb about the origin of planets.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/zuck-stuck-on-trumps-bad-side-ftc-appeals-loss-in-meta-monopoly-case/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Still feeling uneasy about Meta’s acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, the Federal Trade Commission will be appealing a November ruling that cleared Meta of allegations that it holds an illegal monopoly in a market dubbed “personal social networking.”

The FTC hopes the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia will agree that “robust evidence at trial” showed that Meta’s acquisitions were improper. In the initial trial, the FTC sought a breakup of Meta’s apps, with Meta risking forced divestments of Instagram or WhatsApp.

In a press release Tuesday, the FTC confirmed that it “continues to allege” that “for over a decade Meta has illegally maintained a monopoly in personal social networking services through anticompetitive conduct—by buying the significant competitive threats it identified in Instagram and WhatsApp.”

Talking to press, FTC spokesperson Joe Simonson pointed out that the case against Meta originated during Donald Trump’s prior term, Reuters reported. Back then, Trump was frustrated with Facebook, claiming the company and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, were “anti-Trump” in 2017, the BBC reported. His frustrations only grew when Meta banned his Facebook and Instagram accounts in 2021.

Ahead of Trump’s second term, Zuckerberg has attempted to improve relations with Trump, donating $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund in a move the BBC reported was intended to “repair his and his firm’s relationship with Trump.” Last January, Meta also paid Trump $25 million to settle lawsuits over his Facebook and Instagram suspensions, NPR reported.

But these moves don’t appear to have affected the FTC’s resolve to undo Meta’s alleged monopoly. On Tuesday, Simonson said the Meta crackdown remained a priority because the agency believes that “Meta violated our antitrust laws when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp,” and “consequently, American consumers have suffered from Meta’s monopoly.”

For Meta, the renewed fight comes at a time when most tech companies are walking tightropes to avoid any possible retaliation from Trump, not just social platforms. After defeating the FTC last fall, Meta’s chief legal officer, Jennifer Newstead, didn’t dunk on the FTC but coolly celebrated the ruling for recognizing that “Meta faces fierce competition.” In the same breath, Newstead also seemed to want to take the opportunity to remind the Trump administration that Meta was a friend.

“Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth,” Newstead said. “We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America.”

Similarly, this week, Meta has offered a rather neutral response to the FTC’s announcement. Asked for comment on the FTC’s decision to appeal, Meta’s spokesperson simply told Ars that James Boasberg, the US district judge who sided with Meta, got it right the first time, then repeated one of Trump’s favorite refrains from tech companies.

“The District Court’s decision to reject the FTC’s arguments is correct and recognizes the fierce competition we face,” Meta’s spokesperson said. “We will remain focused on innovating and investing in America.”

Political tensions have remained at the center of the case, perhaps peaking after Boasberg’s ruling.

In November, Simonson criticized Boasberg, telling CNBC that “the deck was always stacked against us with Judge Boasberg, who is currently facing articles of impeachment.”

That push to impeach Boasberg came from Republican lawmaker Brandon Gill, who alleged the judge was abusing his power to censor conservatives, but no actions have been taken since the proposed resolution was submitted to a House committee that month. Republicans, including Trump’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, have complained that Boasberg is a rogue partisan judge, but Boasberg so far has withstood their attacks while continuing to settle cases. Trump’s Truth Social tirades against the judge required a long fact-checking piece from PBS.

But the Meta case itself may be hard to win even with a judge that Republicans favor. Last year, the FTC had tried to argue that Meta faced no real competition in the personal social networking market, with only two rivals to speak of, Snapchat and an app called MeWe. But for social media users, Instagram and TikTok are interchangeable, Meta successfully argued, and that makes TikTok as much a rival as Snapchat, Boasberg agreed.

Additionally, Boasberg was not sold on the FTC’s argument that Meta was allegedly abusing its monopoly power and harming consumers by degrading the quality of the app while increasing ad loads. Rather, he agreed with Meta that the company had added many features “continuously” improving its apps.

Further, social media has changed so much since the days of Facebook competing for user engagement with Instagram that Boasberg emphasized that “the Court finds it impossible to believe that consumers would prefer the versions of Instagram and Facebook that existed a decade ago to the versions that exist today.”

As the FTC revives the case, a new judge will weigh Meta’s arguments, the general thrust of which is that social networking as it was known in the early days of Facebook is dead, making the FTC’s case moot.

It’s unclear whether a different judge will see Meta as a monopolist or if Boasberg was right to conclude that the days of grouping apps into “separate markets of social networking and social media” are over.</div>

            <h2>Verizon starts requiring 365 days of paid service before it will unlock phones</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/verizon-starts-requiring-365-days-of-paid-service-before-it-will-unlock-phones/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Verizon has started enforcing a 365-day lock period on phones purchased through its TracFone division, one week after the Federal Communications Commission waived a requirement that Verizon unlock handsets 60 days after they are activated on its network.

Verizon was previously required to unlock phones automatically after 60 days due to restrictions imposed on its spectrum licenses and merger conditions that helped Verizon obtain approval of its purchase of TracFone. But an update applied today to the TracFone unlocking policy said new phones will be locked for at least a year and that each customer will have to request an unlock instead of getting it automatically.

The “new” TracFone policy is basically a return to the yearlong locking it imposed before Verizon bought the company in 2021. TracFone first agreed to provide unlocking in a 2015 settlement with the Obama-era FCC, which alleged that TracFone failed to comply with a commitment to unlock phones for customers enrolled in the Lifeline subsidy program. TracFone later shortened the locking period from a year to 60 days as a condition of the Verizon merger.

While a locked phone is tied to the network of one carrier, an unlocked phone can be switched to another carrier if the device is compatible with the other carrier’s network. But the new TracFone unlocking policy is stringent, requiring customers to pay for a full year of service before they can get a phone unlocked.

“For all cellphones Activated on or after January 20, 2026, the cellphone will be unlocked upon request after 365 days of paid and active service,” the policy says. A customer who doesn’t maintain an active service plan for the whole 12 months will thus have their unlocking eligibility date delayed.

Besides TracFone, the change applies to prepaid brands Straight Talk, Net10 Wireless, Clearway, Total Wireless, Simple Mobile, SafeLink Wireless, and Walmart Family Mobile. Customers who bought phones before today are still eligible for unlocks after 60 days.

As DroidLife points out, the Verizon-owned prepaid brand Visible is also requiring a year of paid service. The Visible policy updated today requires “at least 365 days of paid service” for an unlocking request. “If you stop paying for service, your progress toward the 365-day requirement pauses. It will resume once you reactivate your account and continue until you reach a total of 365 paid days of service,” the policy says.

The unlocking policy for Verizon-branded phones has not been updated since May 2025. The policy calls for phones to be unlocked automatically after 60 days of paid service, but it will probably be changed soon because of the FCC waiver.

Once updated, the primary Verizon policy will presumably match the TracFone subsidiary’s 365-day locking period, or at least require something longer than 60 days. It’s also likely to require customers to request an unlock since the FCC no longer requires Verizon to unlock phones automatically. We contacted Verizon about its plans today and will update this article if it provides a response.

AT&T’s policy allows unlocking of phones on postpaid plans after 60 days if the device has been paid in full, or after six months for phones on prepaid plans. T-Mobile’s policy allows phones on postpaid plans to be unlocked after 40 days if the device has been paid in full, or after 365 days for phones on prepaid plans.

Verizon and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr have justified longer locking periods as a method of deterring fraud. When approving Verizon’s waiver request, the Carr FCC said the Verizon rule “required one wireless carrier to unlock their handsets well earlier than standard industry practice, thus creating an incentive for bad actors to steal those handsets for purposes of carrying out fraud and other illegal acts.”

Consumer advocacy groups disputed the argument, telling the FCC that “Verizon offers no specific evidence that a longer lock period would have prevented the fraudulent acquisition of the devices it identifies,” and that Verizon is capable of detecting and responding to fraud within 60 days of a phone’s activation. Consumers and small carriers will be hurt by the decision, the groups told the FCC, saying that automatic unlocking “facilitates the resale and reuse of mobile devices, reduces e-waste, and enables low-cost carriers and MVNOs to compete on a more level playing field.”

While the Biden-era FCC’s leadership criticized yearlong locking periods and proposed a 60-day unlocking requirement for all carriers, the Trump FCC appears likely to write a new industry-wide standard that would be welcomed by large mobile carriers. The FCC rejected a request to limit Verizon’s locking period to 180 days and said the Verizon waiver will stay in effect until the agency “decides on an appropriate industry-wide approach for the unlocking of handsets.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">YouTubers have been increasingly frustrated with Google’s management of the platform, with disinformation welcomed back and an aggressive push for more AI (except where Google doesn’t like it). So it’s no surprise that creators have been up in arms over the suspicious removal of YouTube’s advanced SRV3 caption format. You don’t have to worry too much just yet—Google says this is only temporary, and it’s working on a fix for the underlying bug.

Google added support for this custom subtitle format around 2018, giving creators more customization options than with traditional captions. SRV3 (also known as YTT or YouTube Timed Text) allows for custom colors, transparency, animations, fonts, and precise positioning in videos. Uploaders using this format can color-code and position captions to help separate multiple speakers, create sing-along animations, or style them to match the video.

Over the last several days, creators who have become accustomed to this level of control have been dismayed to see that YouTube is no longer accepting videos with this Google-created format. Many worried Google had ditched the format entirely, which could be problematic for all those previously uploaded videos.

Google has now posted a brief statement and confirmed to Ars that it has not ended support for SRV3. However, all is not well. The company says it has temporarily limited the serving of SRV3 caption files because they may break playback for some users. That’s pretty vague, but it sounds like developers made a change to the platform without taking into account how it might interfere with SRV3 captions. Rather than allow those videos to be non-functional, it’s disabling most of the captions.

Google’s forum post says that while SRV3 is disabled, creators will not be able to upload new SRV3 captions. Videos that already have them may not show any captions until the feature is restored. However, Google notes most uploaders use other caption formats and are not affected by the playback bug.

Interestingly, Google also notes that the changes should be temporary for almost all videos. That implies some features of SRV3 may not be fully supported with whatever Google is doing on the back end. The company makes no promises about a timeline to re-enable SRV3—creators who have relied heavily on it may have to go back and re-create their captions in less capable formats or simply rely on AI-generated captions in the meantime.

Regardless of whether Google knew this would happen, it shouldn’t have left the community to stew about it for a week. This also suggests Google isn’t very serious about supporting its in-house CC format, which it has opted not to officially document. Creators should probably factor that into their future plans.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/01/be-on-the-lookout-for-flesh-eating-flies-cdc-tells-clinicians-in-alert/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert to clinicians Tuesday, warning that the savage, flesh-eating parasitic fly—the New World Screwworm—is not only approaching the Texas border, but also felling an increasing number of animals in the bordering Mexican state of Tamaulipas.

The advisory, released through the agency’s Health Alert Network, directs doctors, veterinarians, and other health workers to be on the lookout for patients with wounds teeming with ferocious maggots burrowing into their living flesh. The alert also provides guidance on what to do if any such festering wounds are encountered—namely, remove each and every maggot to prevent the patient from dying, and, under no circumstance allow any of the parasites to survive and escape.

The New World Screwworm (NWS) is a fly that lays its eggs—up to 400 at a time—in the wounds, orifices, and mucus membranes of any warm-blooded animal. The eggs hatch into flesh-eating maggots, which look and act much like screws, twisting and boring into their victims while eating them alive.

While the flies are indiscriminate killers, they’re particularly devastating to livestock and are estimated to cause hundreds of millions of dollars in damage each year. As such, the US Department of Agriculture has been leading the response to the threat, which had been held far at bay until recently. NWS used to be endemic in the US, causing heavy losses to cattle in the country. But, in the 1950s, US scientists developed a strategy to eliminate the flies by raising and releasing sterile male flies. The method exploits the fact that female flies mate only once in their 21-day lifespan. Thus, unproductive mating with a flood of sterile males can cause the population to crash.

With this strategy, screwworms were eradicated from the US around 1966 and, through coordinated efforts, cleared out from Central America in the subsequent decades. They were declared eradicated from Panama in 2006 and actively held at bay with continual sterile-fly releases along the Darién Gap, creating a biological barrier. But the barrier was breached in 2022 amid development and movement through and around the gap. Since then, the flies have quickly been marching north with the help of unregulated cattle movements.

Across Central America and Mexico, there have been 1,190 human cases of NWS reported and seven deaths. More than 148,000 animals have been affected.

In September, the USDA warned that an 8-month-old cow with an active NWS infection was found in a feedlot in the Mexican state of Nuevo León, just 70 miles from the border. The finding prompted Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller to step up warnings about the threat.

“The screwworm is dangerously close,” Miller said at the time. “It nearly wiped out our cattle industry before; we need to act forcefully now.”

According to the USDA’s latest data, Nuevo León has seen three cases in the outbreak, with none that are currently active. But, its neighboring state, Tamaulipas, is having a flare-up, with eight animal cases considered active. The Mexican state shares a border with the southern-most portion of Texas. Mexico overall has reported 24 hospitalizations among people and 601 animal cases.

For now, the NWS has not been detected in the US, and the CDC considers the risk to people to be low.

“However, given the potential for geographic spread, CDC is issuing this Health Advisory to increase awareness of the outbreak and to summarize CDC recommendations for clinicians and health departments in the United States on case identification and reporting, specimen collection, diagnosis, and treatment of NWS, as well as guidance for the public,” the agency said.

Generally, the agency advises being on the lookout for egg masses or fly larvae in wounds or infection sites, especially if there’s destruction of living tissue or feelings of movement. Once discovered, health care workers should report the case and promptly remove and kill all larvae and eggs, preferably by drowning in a sealed, leak-proof container of 70 percent ethanol. “Failure to kill and properly dispose of all larvae or eggs could result in the new introduction and spread of NWS in the local environment,” the CDC warns in bold. At least 10 dead larvae should then be sent to the CDC for confirmation.

The USDA is currently releasing 100 million sterile male flies per week in Mexico to try to establish a new biological barrier.

This isn’t the fly’s first attempt at a US comeback since the 1960s. In 2016, the flies were somehow reintroduced to the Florida Keys, where they viciously attacked Key Deer, an endangered species and the smallest of North America’s white-tailed deer. The flies were eliminated again in 2017 using the sterile fly method.</div>

            <h2>China Has Screwed Up Really, Really Badly</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/china-screwed-up-fertility-rate">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For many decades, the Chinese government attempted to limit population growth through a one-child policy — only to abolish the rule in 2016 as it realized that the number of annual births had started to plummet at alarming levels.

The aggressive policy — alongside other extreme measures — succeeded far too well, with birth rates dropping a staggering 17 percent between 2024 and 2025 to the lowest level since 1949. The country’s population is now actively shrinking each year, and it’s hard to imagine how the trend could be reversed.

The situation has gotten so dire that Beijing eliminated tax incentives on condoms, hormonal birth control, and other contraceptives, as Fortune reports. Basically, it’s now desperately trying to reverse itself out of a fertility crisis of its own doing. President Xi Jinping has practically been pleading with the country’s women to bear more children.

Yet fewer and fewer women thereare interested in raising a family, sending China well below the “replacement rate” of 2.1 children per woman, meaning the government’s interventions are doing little to address the issue. Many countries around the world, including most of North and South America, and Europe, are already experiencing below-replacement fertility rates. The situation playing out in China is a preview for what’s still to come in many other regions projected to experience a similar decline.

“The empirical evidence from other countries so far is that monetary incentives have almost no effect in raising fertility,” University of California professor of sociology Wang Feng told the New York Times.

Despite its economy growing by five percent last year, over 11 million people died while only 7.92 million babies were born. Meanwhile, a hot new app is trending in China that takes the form of a countdown timer that has to be reset regularly by single people so that their friends and family will know if they die alone.

The number of working-age people is also dropping as the population continues to age, further taxing healthcare systems and pension funds. The major drop in the fertility rate will continue to have devastating effects, shifting demographics that could result in a worsening economic outlook. The cost of raising a child in China is still extremely high compared to other countries.

“With China’s economic woes, young people may want to wait and see, and that’s not good news for raising fertility,” Wang told the NYT.

In short, whether taxes on contraceptives and Xi’s calls for a “new type of marriage and childbearing culture” will reverse China’s plummeting birthrate remains unclear at best.

The country’s population has been shrinking since 2022, and judging by the latest numbers, the trend is bound to continue. And as the population continues to age, hundreds of millions could soon be leaving the workforce — a demographic crisis and ticking time bomb in one.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">While the United States under Donald Trump escalates tensions with its longstanding geopolitical allies, its neighbor to the north is growing increasingly wary of its antics.

Recently, Canada has announced a number of moves viewed as part of a pivot away from close ties to the United States. Over the weekend, Canadian prime minister Mark Carney announced a strategic partnership with the People’s Republic of China. The commercial agreement involved reduced tariff rates on Chinese energy, technology, and consumer goods like EVs, which will see their tariff rate fall from 100 percent to just 6.1 percent.

That announcement dominated headlines over the weekend, but Canada’s also preparing for worsening relations in less obvious ways. One of them is by drawing up military models to repel a theoretical invasion from the US — the first time in a century that Canadian Armed Forces have done so.

The extraordinary news was reported by the Globe and Mail, a major Canadian newspaper which spoke to a number of anonymous military officials working to develop the plans. According to two senior government officials, the Canadian armed forces were drafting insurgent-like tactics mirroring those used by the Taliban to fight back against the US invasion of Afghanistan.

If the history of US intervention any indication, those tactics might be the winning move should such a spectacular attack ever come. Though the US has more military resources at its disposal than any empire in history, that pen-and-paper might doesn’t always translate to success on the ground.

When the US went into Afghanistan in 2001, for example, a severe lack of intelligence hindered its military successes for nearly a decade, according to an analysis by Harvard’s Belfer Center. Despite engaging in the “enhanced interrogation” of Afghan civilians, the US continued to struggle as Taliban forces carried out frequent rural ambushes and attacks with improvised explosives, culminating in the total US withdrawal from the nation in 2020.

It’s a staggering irony of US imperial aggression, and an indication of just how frayed relations really are between the two neighboring countries.

Though the military models are only pen-and-paper frameworks, they come in the wake of tangible military aggression from the US military under Trump. The horrific attacks on Venezuela, for example, constitute the US military’s first “publicly acknowledged” airstrikes in Central or South America since the US invasion of Panama in 1989, per the Wall Street Journal.

Last year, Trump repeatedly made overtures about Canada becoming the “51st state.” Whether that’s a reference to assimilation or invasion isn’t clear, but Canadians were outraged over the comments all the same.

            <div id="article-text">Wondering what your career looks like in our increasingly uncertain, AI-powered future? According to Palantir CEO Alex Karp, it’s going to involve less of the comfortable office work to which most people aspire, a more old fashioned grunt work with your hands.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum yesterday, Karp insisted that the future of work is vocational — not just for those already in manufacturing and the skilled trades, but for the majority of humanity.

In the age of AI, Karp told attendees at a forum, a strong formal education in any of the humanities will soon spell certain doom.

“You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy; hopefully you have some other skill,” he warned, adding that AI “will destroy humanities jobs.”

Karp, who himself holds humanities degrees from the elite liberal arts institutions of Haverford College and Stanford Law, will presumably be alright. With a net worth of $15.5 billion — well within the top 0.1 percent of global wealth owners — the Palantir CEO has enough money and power to live like a feudal lord (and that’s before AI even takes over.)

The rest of us, he indicates, will be stuck on the assembly line, building whatever the tech companies require.

“If you’re a vocational technician, or like, we’re building batteries for a battery company… now you’re very valuable, if not irreplaceable,” Karp insisted. “I mean, y’know, not to divert to my usual political screeds, but there will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training.”

Now, there’s nothing wrong with vocational work or manufacturing. The global economy runs on these jobs. But in a theoretical world so fundamentally transformed by AI that intellectual labor essentially ceases to exist, it’s telling that tech billionaires like Karp see the rest of humanity as their worker bees.

It seems that the AI revolution never seems to threaten those who stand to profit the most from it — just the 99.9 percent of us building their batteries.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After more than forty years, a bizarre panel from “The Far Side” comic strip has finally become prophecy. The cartoon depicts a strangely eye-less, bipedal cow standing in front of a bench of oddly-shaped objects, with the caption “Cow tools,” and no further context.

The “joke” — that cows are too stupid to make practical tools? — landed so flat that the cartoonist Gary Larson issued a public statement explaining it after readers swamped newspapers with confused inquiries after it ran.

Larson probably couldn’t predict that “Cow tools” would become a cultish internet meme decades later, serving for those in the know as an endearing icon of anti-humor — with such a heavy emphasis on the “anti” part that it borders on avant-garde art.

Similarly, the storied cartoonist probably never anticipated that “Cow tools” would turn out to be a real phenomenon.

You heard that right. In a new study published in the journal Current Biology, scientists say they’ve documented the first ever verified case of a bovine using a tool, suggesting we’ve been seriously underestimating the intelligence of these gentle creatures.

In footage shared by the researchers, the cow named Veronika holds a lengthy broom handle in her mouth and manipulates it to scratch herself, displaying impressive dexterity as she reaches everywhere on her body from her stomach to her rear end.

The feat is clearly no fluke, and remarkably, Veronika had received no training.

“[Veronika] did not fashion tools like the cow in Gary Larson’s cartoon, but she selected, adjusted, and used one with notable dexterity and flexibility,” the researchers wrote in the study. “Perhaps the real absurdity lies not in imagining a tool-using cow, but in assuming such a thing could never exist.”

Cows itch, just like us. But Veronika the cow takes things into her own hands. Or rather: into her mouth.Scientists say it’s the first experimentally verified instance of cattle using a tool.  https://t.co/lnEEHQgVai pic.twitter.com/kxGEK4MWsH

The authors highlight how astonishingly little research has been done to explore the cognitive abilities of cows and other cattle. As author Alice Auersperg, a cognitive biologist at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, put it, the “findings highlight how assumptions about livestock intelligence may reflect gaps in observation rather than genuine cognitive limits,” she said in a statement about the work.

Veronika is a Swiss Brown cow and was raised by a farmer in Austria, who starting ten years ago began to notice that the creature would sometimes pick up sticks on her own to scratch herself. After a video taken of Veronika’s shrewd habits caught the researcher’s attention, they immediately traveled to the farm to study her closely, performing controlled trials in which they carefully observed and recorded her habits.

The findings were stunning. They found that Veronika would consistently target specific body parts, and that she generally preferred using the brush end of the stick to scratch herself — except when she scratched more sensitive regions of her body, when she instead favored the smooth end. In further evidence of the cow’s deliberate control, she used wide, forceful movements to scratch her upper body, while soothing her lower-body with slower and more controlled ones. This demonstrates “genuinely flexible tool use,” lead author Antonio Osuna-Mascaró, a researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, said in the statement, as well as the ability to anticipate the “outcome of her actions and adjusting her grip and movements accordingly.”

Tool use was once considered the hallmark of human intelligence, but that notion has firmly been debunked, challenging a narrower understanding of what intelligence is. Some chimpanzees, for example, use sticks to extract termites from trees. Crows, too, are frequently observed using twigs to reach their grub.

That said, tool usage is rarely observed in the wild, and it’s even more rare to see it used in a “flexible,” multi-purpose manner.

“Because she is using the tool on her own body, this represents an egocentric form of tool use, which is generally considered less complex than tool use directed at external objects,” said Osuna-Mascaró. “At the same time, she faces clear physical constraints, as she must manipulate tools with her mouth.”

While Veronika’s skills are stunning, she probably isn’t an singularly intelligent cow — which is encouraging to scientists. “We know more about the tool use of exotic animals on remote islands than we do about the cows we live with,” Osuna-Mascaró told CNN in an interview. Now, at least, we’re “starting to be sensitive enough to observe them.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, we broke down a major debacle unfolding in the health research space. To recap: over the past month, concerned researchers have been sounding the alarm about a reprehensible vaccine study which was to be funded by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to the tune of $1.6 million.

According to the trial protocols, obtained by Inside Medicine writer and physician Jeremy Faust from an anonymous American employee at the US Center for Disease Control (US CDC), the research would have followed 14,000 infants in the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau. The problem? Only 7,000 of those newborns would have received an urgently needed hepatitis B vaccine, in order to compare the two groups. On top of the flagrant ethics violations, the total cost of the research would have exceeded the cost to pay for “over a decade’s worth of Hepatitis B vaccine birth doses [for everyone] in Guinea-Bissau.”

In their interview with Faust, the unnamed CDC employee called it “another Tuskegee,” a reference to the Tuskegee syphilis study, in which hundreds of Black men with syphilis were studied by government researchers — who never informed them of their disease or made them aware of the treatment that had been discovered for it.

“I have read every word of the protocol dated January 14, 2026,” Faust told Futurism in an email. “It is wretched.”

At the time of our writing, the Guardian had reported that officials with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention — the public health agency run by the African Union, not to be confused with the US CDC — stated that the trial had been halted, seemingly by Guinea-Bissau’s public health authorities.

This is where things get weird. In an email responding to our post about the situation, an official from the HHS press office declared that the vaccine trial was still on.

“To be clear, the trial will proceed as planned,” the spokesperson insisted. “Africa CDC, an organization with no affiliation to the US CDC, shared weeks-old communications unrelated to the trial as part of a public-relations campaign aimed to shape public perception rather than engaging with the scientific facts.”

The official also makes it clear that the HHS sees these infants more like lab rats than human beings.

“This research represents the world’s first, and potentially only, opportunity to rigorously evaluate the overall health effects of [hepatitis B],” they continued.

Those comments are astonishing enough. But in followup remarks that they insisted were “on background” — despite the fact that we’d agreed to no such arrangement — they went on to disparage their colleagues at the Africa CDC in coarse terms that were striking even by the standards of the notoriously churlish Trump administration.

“This is a powerless, fake organization attempting to manufacture credibility by repeating its claims publicly,” the spokesperson wrote. “It is not a reliable source, and its statements should be treated accordingly.”

The HHS didn’t respond to repeated requests to explain the outburst.

It’s a stunning comment about the Africa CDC, the official health agency of the African Union, which represents 55 African nations. This isn’t some fly-by-night shell operation — it’sa health organization that served as the COVID-19 testing hub for 48 African countries at the outbreak of the pandemic, and which has coordinated millions of emergency vaccines for infectious diseases ranging from malaria to mpox.

In October, the World Health Organization and the Africa CDC signed a landmark collaboration agreement to “consolidate their partnership” and “accelerate progress toward shared health goals.” Simply put, if there were any serious question of Africa CDC’s legitimacy, the WHO — a specialized agency of the United Nations — would not have signed off on this strategic agreement.

As for the HHS claiming the controversial study is still on, the Africa CDC tells us there’s a press conference this Thursday — so we’ll be watching.

            <h2>The CEO of Microsoft Suddenly Sounds Extremely Nervous About AI</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It sounds like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is already coming up with excuses in case the whole AI boom turns out to be a massive bust— which, by the way, he’s warning might come to pass.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday, Nadella pontificated about what would constitute such a speculative bubble, and said that the long-term success of AI tech hinges on it being used across a broad range of industries — as well as seeing an uptick in adoption in the developing world where it’s not as popular, the Financial Times reports. If AI fails, in other words, it’s everyone else’s fault for not using it.

Nadella explained the pitfalls the AI industry would need to avoid, perhaps betraying his own anxieties about its future.

“For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,” Nadella said, as quoted by the FT. The “tell-tale sign of if it’s a bubble,” he added, would be if only tech companies were benefitting from the rise of AI. He gave the example of a pharmaceutical company using AI to accelerate drug trials; it doesn’t need to be used to discover the “magical molecule,” but provide some other tangible, less extraordinary benefit to developing the product.

Nadella is adamant that these kinds of boosts that AI provides will justify AI and carry the industry, stressing less spectacular and more practical applications of the tech.

“I’m much more confident that this is a technology that will, in fact, build on the rails of cloud and mobile, diffuse faster, and bend the productivity curve, and bring local surplus and economic growth all around the world,” he proclaimed.

Nadella’s anxiety-tinged and more mundane-sounding forecasts for AI’s future comes as he’s been notably defensive about AI lately, as Microsoft reaffirms its commitment to spend tens of billions more on data centers and other AI-related costs. Earlier this month, he begged the public to stop using the term “slop,” the rapidly accepted new lingo for describing the shoddy text, images, and videos churned out by AI models, which Merriam-Webster crowned word of the year. Nadella’s thesis seemed to be that we should stop being mean about AI as it refines its “jagged edges” — which could take a while, by his own admission.

He isn’t alone in tamping down his promises for AI as a cloud of uncertainty looms over the industry, with experts continuing to raise the specter of AI progress hitting a wall, and noting that years into the AI boom, the tech still hasn’t yielded meaningful gains in productivity. Many tech CEOs not named Elon Musk have tried to pretend that they haven’t been using the pursuit of building a fabled artificial general intelligence, or AGI, as the rallying cry for the industry this whole time, as the idea of creating such a system that surpasses human intelligence seems more and more far fetched in the immediate term.

Striking a similar tone, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar declared that the company will focus on “practical adoption” of AI in 2026, and “how people, companies, and countries are using it day to day.” ChatGPT users will soon get a first hand look of what this pivot to practical economics looks like: last week, the company announced that free users will start being targeted with sponsored ads and content based on their conversations.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/adobe-acrobat-now-lets-you-edit-files-using-prompts-generate-podcast-summaries/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Adobe has been aggressively adding AI features to all its products in the last few years. The company is now adding more AI tools to Acrobat, including the ability to generate podcast summaries of files, create presentations, and a way for users to edit files using prompts.

The company launched Adobe Spaces last year, which is a collection of files and notes that multiple users can access. Now, Adobe is allowing users to use the information stored in these files and notes to create a presentation using text prompts.

For instance, if a user has financial details, product plans, and competitor analysis available in a Space, they can build a pitch deck for clients that focuses on why their product can solve problems better than rivals.

Acrobat’s AI assistant first generates an editable presentation with points that the deck would cover. You can then use Adobe Express’s theme library, stock photos, or use your own images to build the presentation. Plus, you can easily apply your brand’s theme or edit individual slides using Express.

Tools like Canva and NotebookLM already offer the ability to convert documents into presentations. Besides, newer startups are also working on letting people use AI to create presentations by tapping different sources.

Adobe is also letting users create a podcast to summarize a file or a Space within Acrobat. Notably, tools like Google’s NotebookLM, Speechify, and ElevenLabs’ Reader app also let users create personalized podcasts using various notes and documents.

Acrobat is also getting the ability to let users edit files using prompts. The company said that users can take 12 actions, including removing pages, text, comments, and images; finding and replacing words and phrases; and adding e-signatures and passwords.

Acrobat already had sharing capabilities with Spaces, but now, when you share files with others, the files will house AI-generated summaries, with citations pointing to an exact location in the file. Contributors can also comment on files, or add or remove content.

Plus, users can use the default AI assistant or pick other assistant roles, like “analyst,” “entertainer,” or “instructor.” You can also create a custom assistant using a prompt.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/nyt-games-scrabble-like-game-crossplay-is-a-dream-come-true/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">I have long dreamed of a better world: one where I would unlock my phone to find a notification that my grandma has challenged me to a game of Scrabble. I would play my word. She would play hers. We would play back and forth over a few days, and the entire time, neither of us would have to see any overwhelming technicolor ads with deceptive skip buttons that blast us with even more pop-ups. It’s a simple life.

You would think such an app already existed. You would be wrong. Until now. (Zynga, I will never forgive you for what you’ve done to Words with Friends).

At last, New York Times Games has brought my humble dreams to life with a Scrabble-like multiplayer app called Crossplay, available now on iOS and Android.

Crossplay is not a Scrabble clone exactly, but unless you are the type of Scrabble lover that goes to tournaments or memorizes the Scrabble dictionary, it’s basically Scrabble. The game board and tile distribution are a bit different, and there’s a slight rule change around what happens once the bag runs out of tiles. Those differences may have been done for legal reasons. As a casual player, I barely noticed them.

Like other social word games, Crossplay allows you to invite friends to play, or you can get matched with strangers near your skill level. For New York Times Games subscribers, the game will have no ads at all, but free users might see some banner ads. Still, it beats paying $10 a month to remove ads from Words With Friends, yet still have to deal with a cartoon-like interface among other features that annoy me.

While Scrabble purists may quibble about the slight rule changes, they may find delight in a feature of the game called CrossBot. Like the WordleBot and ConnectionsBot, CrossBot analyzes each move of your game to determine where you may have made a better move. It ranks your gameplay in terms of both luck and strategy, then highlights both your best moves, and those where you faltered.

The New York Times has been publishing its Crossword puzzle since 1942, but its digital gaming business kicked into high gear in 2022 when it bought Wordle after it went viral. According to data from ValueAct Capital, a hedge fund that invests in the Times, users spent more time in the Games app than the actual News app by the end of 2023.

I’m not the only one who was craving a multi-player word game without egregious distractions — Jonathan Knight, Head of Games at the New York Times, thinks this is what makes its Games vertical so successful.

“Games like Spelling Bee and Wordle found a way to take the magical ‘solve a puzzle’ feeling and create a very mainstream, quick, snackable version of that that works well on your phone, that’s very sharable with friends and family, and that I think is very respectful of your time,” Knight told TechCrunch. “You can just decide to do it in the morning, or at night before you go to bed, and then go to bed.”

According to the New York Times, Wordle was played 4.2 billion times in 2025. Connections was played 1.6 billion times.

When TechCrunch spoke to Wordle creator Josh Wardle shortly before he sold his game, he shared a mindset similar to Knight’s. He told us, “people have an appetite for things that transparently don’t want anything from you.”

Sure, a publicly traded company like the New York Times isn’t as pure of heart as an indie developer making a game for his partner, but the spirit of the game has persisted. Even as Wordle’s viral moment passed, people kept up with their daily habit, according to Knight.

“The share rate on Wordle — the percentage of users that share every day — has not changed since we acquired the game,” he said. “It’s a really cool way to bring people together. You know, we see the Pope talking about his Wordle, sharing with his brother.”

Now, Knight’s team wants to extend the quiet simplicity of its games philosophy to Crossplay.

“We wanted people to be able to just get in and play the game with friends and family, and then get on with your day,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It all began in sales. That’s where Cam Badger got his start, at a pharmaceutical company. He expected to find structure and mentorship on the job but instead found “fragmented training, inconsistent coaching, and no real way to scale learning in a meaningful way,” he told TechCrunch.

He spent four years as a sales rep, then a sales trainer, and then worked for a medical startup where he met Bhrugu Giri. The two lamented about how awful many sales reps were at life science companies like pharma businesses, medical device startups, and so forth. The duo decided to try and fix this, launching PraxisPro, a sales coaching platform specifically targeted at medical fields.

He believes that better salespeople will help get more treatments into doctor’s hands, which will ultimately help their patients.

“When commercial interactions with healthcare providers are ineffective, patients don’t get a fair shot at therapies that could meaningfully change their lives,” Badger, the company’s CEO, said.

PraxisPro launched in 2023, though its first product was not released until 2025. The company announced on Wednesday a $6 million seed round led by AlleyCorp. Others in the round include FlyBridge, South Loop Ventures, and Zeal Capital Partners.

PraxisPro is a standalone platform that can also be integrated into enterprise software. It develops small language models trained on life science data to help each company navigate the nuances and context needed to interact with healthcare providers. From there, the company has created an AI agent that helps the commercial sales team practice their communication skills before engaging with customers.

Badger said communication is critical in medical sales. So many teams are worried about staying compliant, as each company is responsible for ensuring sales messaging complies with legal frameworks. Aside from helping train sales reps to stay compliant, PraxisPro also hopes to help better execute them to communicate patient needs with healthcare providers.

Right now, a salesperson may have 15 interactions with a health care provider as part of the sales process. PraxisPro has a conversational AI feature that lets sales reps practice and plan these interactions and be better prepared for what the discussion usually entails, including any pushback that might come up.

There are other AI role-playing tools (like Quantified and SmartWinnr), but Badger says his is different because his company is trained on smaller data sets and specifically focuses on the life sciences sector. The fresh capital will be used toward research and development, he said.

In many ways, this was the tool he wished he had when he was still working as a sales rep all those years ago. He struggled, he said, and almost lost his job, but managed to work his way up to become one of the company’s top performers. Now, he wants to give others a hand.

“If we can give commercial teams the ability to prepare, practice, and engage at a higher level, consistently and responsibly, then we’re not just improving commercial operations, but we’re helping ensure that innovative therapies reach the patients who need them most,” he said.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/lemonade-launches-an-insurance-product-for-tesla-full-self-driving-customers/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Digital insurance company Lemonade is launching a product for users of Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system, known as Full Self-Driving (Supervised), which the insurer promises will cut per-mile rates by “approximately 50%.”

It’s one of the first products geared toward pricing insurance based on how software systems handle driving, and a sign that companies may look to create new lines of business as partial autonomy and true self-driving start to proliferate.

Lemonade said on Wednesday that it is leveraging “vehicle telemetry data that was previously unavailable” thanks to a “technical collaboration with Tesla,” though the insurance company declined to offer more specifics. Lemonade said it would train its own usage-based risk prediction models to determine when a driver is using Full Self-Driving or operating the vehicle themselves, and price accordingly.

Lemonade is calling the new product “Autonomous Car insurance.” Tesla’s software does not currently make cars completely autonomous, and drivers need to be ready to take over at any moment. But the product is clearly a bet that Tesla CEO Elon Musk will ultimately fulfill his long-delayed promise that his company will make that happen.

“Traditional insurers treat a Tesla like any other car, and AI like any other driver. But a driver who can see 360 degrees, never gets drowsy, and reacts in milliseconds isn’t like any other driver,” Shai Wininger, co-founder and president of Lemonade, said in a statement. “Our existing pay-per-mile product has given us something no traditional insurer has: a unique tech stack designed to collect massive amounts of real driving data for precise, dynamic pricing.”

The new car insurance product will launch in Arizona on January 26, and in Oregon the following month. Lemonade claims that “the safer FSD software becomes, the more our prices will drop.” The company’s existing auto insurance offering is available for “most popular cars” in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington.

Tesla has offered its own car insurance to customers for years now, though in late 2025 the company was hit with an enforcement action by California’s Department of Insurance (CDI). The automaker was accused, along with partner State National Insurance Company, of “egregious delays in responding to policyholder claims,” “unreasonable denials,” and engaging in “unfair claims settlement practices.”

Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Deepinder Goyal, the co-founder and CEO of food delivery service Zomato and its parent Eternal, is stepping down from his role and handing the top job to Albinder Dhindsa, the CEO of its quick-commerce division Blinkit.

Goyal on Wednesday said he would remain on Eternal’s board as vice chairman as he shifts focus to “higher-risk exploration and experimentation,” which he says may be harder to pursue within the constraints of a listed company.

“This is a change in title, not in commitment toward outcomes,” Goyal said in a letter to Eternal’s shareholders. “Eternal remains my life’s work.”

Goyal co-founded Zomato with Pankaj Chaddah in 2008 as a restaurant discovery and reviews platform called FoodieBay while both were working at Bain & Company. In 2009, they quit to focus on the business full-time, and rebranded it as Zomato in 2010 amid a naming conflict with eBay, before expanding into food delivery in 2015.

Chaddah left the company in 2018, and Zomato later consolidated its position by acquiring Uber Eats’ India business in 2020, and Blinkit (formerly Grofers) for $568 million in 2022.

The leadership change comes as Eternal reported (PDF) strong momentum in its third quarter, with profit rising about 73% to ₹1.02 billion (around $11.13 million) from a year earlier, on adjusted revenue ₹166.92 billion (about $1.8 billion), up 190% from a year ago.

Blinkit remained the company’s fastest-growing business, with net order value jumping 121% to ₹133.0 billion (roughly $1.45 billion) in the last quarter.

Outside Eternal, Goyal has been working on other projects for the last few months, including a longevity-focused initiative called Continue Research, and an experimental brain-health wearable dubbed “Temple”. He is a co-founder of the aviation startup LAT Aerospace, and also is an angel investor.

The handover could be an indicator of Blinkit’s rising influence inside Eternal, as the company’s growth skews toward quick commerce and away from its mainstay, food delivery.

Quick commerce in India is booming even as the sector faces rising scrutiny over working conditions for the thousands of gig workers employed in the industry. The country’s labour ministry recently asked platforms to drop their “10-minute delivery” marketing, and put in place measures to improve conditions for their delivery personnel.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/zanskar-thinks-1-tw-of-geothermal-power-is-being-overlooked/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The ground beneath our feet holds so much energy that experts at the Department of Energy think geothermal power could generate 60 gigawatts — or nearly 10% of U.S. electricity — by 2050.

Zanskar co-founder and CEO Carl Hoiland thinks that lofty number is too low, mostly because it’s discounting conventional geothermal’s potential.

The DOE’s figures assume advances in enhanced geothermal, which uses fracking techniques to access hot rock deep underground. Companies like Fervo and Sage Geosystems have been pursuing that angle, and experts agree it has tremendous potential. By contrast, conventional geothermal, which taps naturally fractured hotspots, has been stagnant, generating just 4 gigawatts in the United States, up only about a gigawatt in the last decade or so.

Conventional geothermal has been held back by outdated assumptions, Hoiland told TechCrunch.

“They underestimated how many undiscovered systems there are, maybe by an order of magnitude or more,” Hoiland said. With modern drilling techniques, “you can get a lot more out of each of them, maybe even an order of magnitude or more from each of those. All of a sudden the number goes from tens of gigawatts to what could be a terawatt-scale opportunity.”

Zanskar is relying on AI to help break conventional geothermal out of its malaise. In the process, the startup has resuscitated a flagging power plant in New Mexico and discovered two new sites with over 100 megawatts of combined potential.

Those successes have helped Zanskar land a $115 million Series C led by Spring Lane Capital with participation from the All Aboard Fund, Carica Sustainable Investments, Clearvision Ventures, Cross Creek, GVP Climate, Imperative Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Munich Re Ventures, Obvious Ventures, Orion Industrial Ventures, Safar Partners, StepStone Group, Susquehanna Sustainable Investments, Tranquillion, Union Square Ventures, University Growth Fund, and UP.Partners.

Many potential geothermal sites have been overlooked because people have been looking for evidence on the surface like a hot spring or a volcano, Hoiland said. But about 95% of all geothermal systems lack such a tell, he added. “We just keep finding them by accident. That is a great application for AI.”

To find new geothermal resources, Zanskar first feeds supervised machine learning models a range of data, including past accidental discoveries. When they have identified a promising site, the company sends a team to the site validate the discovery.

Zanskar then has to come up with a plan to develop it. For that, the team uses another AI approach, one developed for this very purpose called Bayesian evidential learning (BEL). In BEL, existing data helps build a series of assumptions known as priors, and then models work to falsify those hypotheses, spitting out probabilities for each. Where there are gaps, the startup has built a geothermal simulator to fill in the blanks.

So far, Zanskar’s approach has been working. The previous funding round allowed the startup to explore three sites, each of which it considered a success. “Three of three,” said Zanskar co-founder and CTO Joel Edwards. “What does it look like when you try 10?”

The company has enough sites in the pipeline to support at least a gigawatt of generating capacity, Hoiland said. For now, they’ve been focused on the U.S. West, which has the most potential. He would like to find at least 10 confirmed sites to help Zanskar court project finance investors, which provide access to lower cost capital than VCs. If the company can make that work, then it might get through the valley of death that has claimed many other climate tech startups.

Hoiland is not convinced that Zanskar has solved all the challenges associated with finding geothermal resources, but he’s optimistic the company is on the right path.

“We now know this is the future of exploration,” he said. “This is going to change geothermal in very short order.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Here’s a good rule of thumb for making a movie: Don’t allow the press tour to be the most exciting component. The Rip, from the director Joe Carnahan, is a cop drama where macho guys (and gals) tote carbine rifles and grunt law-enforcement lingo—the kind of crime-genre pablum that commonly gets thrown onto Netflix in mid-January. But this one comes with a ridiculously stacked cast, including, most important, its two leads: Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. The longtime Hollywood pals have dutifully hit the promotional circuit to talk up their latest collaboration, as well as argue over who’s the bigger New England Patriots fan, reminisce on their former shared bank account, and generally remind everyone about the wholesome endurance of their creative bond.

But none of that cheerfulness or easy friend chemistry can be found in the film they’re plugging. Damon and Affleck have acted together on-screen numerous times, but this is their first time sharing the top billing since Dogma, their 1999 dark comedy about a pair of fallen angels. The hiatus makes The Rip the kind of nostalgia-inducing star vehicle that should pique viewers’ curiosity—which is why its seeming disinterest in the leads’ personal connection is so bizarre. Affleck plays the Miami Police Department detective J. D. Byrne, and Damon is his superior, Lieutenant Dane Dumars. Byrne and Dumars get drawn into a conspiracy surrounding a colossal stash of illicit money, which is coveted by cartel leaders and crooked cops alike. Carnahan, however, seems more interested in depicting realistic police procedure than in letting the famous friends have much fun together.

That The Rip is such a bland venue for its charismatic stars’ reunion is a terrible shame. They do look the part, sporting big beards and close-cropped hair; their brows are eternally furrowed and their eyes are constantly narrowed as their characters try to sniff out each other’s loyalty and the loyalty of other teammates drawn in by “the rip” (the $20 million they’ve just discovered). If this film had been made in the ’80s or ’90s, it would be crackling with zippy one-liners—which writers including Shane Black (Lethal Weapon) were paid top dollar to sprinkle into every script. Instead, Carnahan, who’s made other weighty masculine dramas such as Narc, The Grey, and Copshop, is mostly devoted to exploring how a large sum of money starts breeding suspicion among colleagues.

As Dumars and Byrne, Damon and Affleck are reduced to growling law-enforcement speak, barking into walkie-talkies and carrying out every conversation while at least one hand rests on an automatic weapon—just in case someone bursts through the wall. The supporting cast, including Teyana Taylor, Steven Yeun, Kyle Chandler, and Catalina Sandino Moreno, all get their own assault rifle and dictionary of cop lingo. But it seems they’re more likely on board not because of the material but because of the allure of working with Damon and Affleck. (Perhaps also appealing is the fact that the duo’s production company, Artists Equity, worked out a profit-sharing model with Netflix.) The Rip has little else to offer the actors or the audience beyond a plot built on ratcheting up tension and double-crossing characters.

I’m not sure why this is the movie Damon and Affleck decided to reunite as co-leads for. In the lead-up to The Rip’s release, the pair gave context for the long hiatus they took as artistic collaborators. They didn’t want to be seen as a double act, they explained; the media had quickly regarded Damon and Affleck as such after they co-starred in and won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Good Will Hunting. The film, which they wrote together in their early 20s, when they were toiling away on small projects, launched them to megastardom.

Their careers as A-listers have differed quite dramatically, however. Damon became a model of consistency: He headed up robust franchises with the Jason Bourne and Ocean’s movies while also churning out work with serious auteurs such as Martin Scorsese, the Coen brothers, and Christopher Nolan. Affleck’s experience with fame was a roller coaster; he appeared in and out of the tabloids and had multiple declines and comebacks. He’s played two different comic-book superheroes, married two different superstars, and become a celebrated director in his own right, even winning Best Picture at the Oscars for Argo. Yet he’s struggled to maintain a similar artistic quality to Damon, bouncing between high highs (such as Gone Girl) and low lows (perhaps most infamously the box-office bomb Gigli).

Damon and Affleck’s proper post-Dogma on-screen reunion came with Ridley Scott’s The Last Duel in 2021, which the pair co-wrote. The movie was a financial disappointment, but it was well reviewed. They followed that up with Air in 2023, a lighter true-story dramedy about Nike’s courtship of Michael Jordan in the 1980s. In both films, Damon took the lead role and Affleck played a princely supporting character who would swoop in for some comic relief—a fine balance they first established in Good Will Hunting, and one that recalled what drew audiences to them all those years ago. But neither reunion was the total head-to-head that some fans might have longed for.

Watch the promotional videos for The Rip and it’s clear why people may clamor for Damon and Affleck to revive their dynamic. They’re not play-acting their friendship for the cameras; they have a deep, shared history, and are canny about how Hollywood has changed in the decades since they tried breaking into the industry together. (For the record, they’ve been pals since Damon, age 10, met Affleck, age 8, at school.) Their real-world mix of camaraderie and quiet rivalry, however, is a vein they’ve somehow rarely tapped on-screen. Off-screen, Affleck has a slightly rougher star persona, while Damon’s can be a little more withdrawn and intellectual. Their characters in The Rip, meanwhile, left me frustrated by their similarity: They’re essentially just playing two sides of the same coin.

Then again, maybe Damon and Affleck are smart to produce a movie like The Rip. Grumbly action dramas seem to play well on streaming services this time of year, when awards season is dying down and viewers turn to something a little trashier. The movie is hardly a catastrophe; it is just a by-the-book, somewhat forgettable little notch in the crime genre. I’m glad Damon and Affleck are comfortable carrying a film together now, after working hard to establish themselves as individuals. But I’d love to see the actors’ chummy New England competitiveness translate beyond the press-tour TikToks and return to the screen—using the differences that make their partnership intriguing to their benefit.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, has become an evangelist of a certain sort. During her tenure, her department has on multiple occasions released slick social-media recruitment videos in which scripture verses feature prominently.

One video quotes from Isaiah 6:8 (“Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, ‘Whom shall I send and who will go for us?’ I said, ‘Here I am. Send me.’”); another quotes from Proverbs 28:1 (“The wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous are as bold as a lion.”). The most recent DHS video quotes from Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount: “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.

What’s striking is less that the federal government is using Bible verses in its promotional videos than that the agency doing the recruiting is Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The videos, set to music, include militaristic images. They show heavily armed agents in tactical gear, weapons drawn, donning masks, looking through night-vision goggles, zip-lining from helicopters, breaking down doors, and conducting nighttime raids.

From the February 2025 issue: The army of God comes out of the shadows

The message the Trump administration is sending is not subtle: ICE is doing the work of God. The brutal and sometimes lethal tactics being used by a growing number of ICE agents are divinely sanctioned. Come join this holy campaign.  Leni Riefenstahl would have approved.

THE KILLING OF RENEE NICOLE GOOD by an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, has thrust the Department of Homeland Security into the red-hot center of American politics.

A horrifying video of Good being shot—one recent poll found that 82 percent of voters have watched it—provoked nationwide protests and vigils.

Noem, for her part, claimed that Good “committed an act of domestic terrorism” before she was shot four times at point-blank range. After Ross shot Good, a voice on one video could be heard calling her a “fucking bitch.” The Justice Department, meanwhile, is now investigating Good’s widow, prompting six federal prosecutors in Minnesota to resign.

The shooting in Minneapolis wasn’t surprising; under Donald Trump, and especially his immensely powerful aide Stephen Miller, ICE has become militarized, much larger, more aggressive, and less accountable. One former high-ranking Trump-administration official described ICE to me as a “paramilitary police force” under the control of Trump and Miller. (This person requested anonymity for fear of death threats.)

Miller has declared that agents possess “federal immunity,” while Vice President J. D. Vance has said they have “absolute immunity.” Trump, perhaps hoping for a confrontation, wrote on social media on Tuesday, “FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!” Defense Department officials told The Washington Post that the Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers to prepare for a possible deployment to Minneapolis, after Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, despite opposition from state and local officials.

Federal agents have already flooded the streets of Minneapolis. It is a city under siege; residents there say it “feels like an invasion” and compare it to a “military occupation.” Which is precisely what Trump wants. This has been the game plan all along.

“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”

The Bible-quoting videos that ICE is using to recruit agents have a certain logic behind them. DHS says it is looking to hire “brave and heroic Americans,” but it obviously has a special focus on recruiting young men who identify as Christians and whose attitudes and moral instincts align with Trump’s, especially on immigration. Majorities of white evangelicals favor deporting undocumented immigrants to foreign prisons in El Salvador, Rwanda, or Libya without allowing them to challenge their deportation in court (57 percent), and approve of placing immigrants who have entered the country illegally in internment camps (53 percent).

“It has become virtually impossible to write a survey question about immigration policy that is too harsh for white evangelicals to support,” Robert P. Jones, the president of the Public Religion Research Institute, recently wrote.

Tobias Cremer is a member of the European Parliament. His book The Godless Crusade argues that the rise of right-wing populism in the West and its references to religion are driven less by a resurgence of religious fervor than by the emergence of a new secular identity politics. Right-wing populists don’t view Christianity as a faith; rather, Cremer suggests, they use Christianity as a cultural identity marker of the “pure people” against external “others,” while in many cases remaining disconnected from Christian values, beliefs, and institutions.

Many right-wing populists, despite being secular, are successfully recruiting Christians to their cause. And rather than Christians leavening the secular right-wing movements, those movements are prying Christianity further and further away from the ethic and teachings of Jesus.

The Trump administration has gone one step further, inverting authentic Christian faith by selling in a dozen different ways cruelty and the will to power in the name of Jesus. It has welcomed Christians into a theological twilight zone, where the beatitudes are invoked on behalf of a political movement with authoritarian tendencies. This isn’t the first time in history such things have happened.

In the 1920s, within the German Evangelical Church, a movement emerged: Deutsche Christen, or “German Christians.” They became a “church party” that actively supported Adolf Hitler, who self-identified in public as a Christian, even as he privately despised Christianity as a weak religion. Many Germans believed that Hitler had been chosen by God to lead the German state.

The Deutsche Christen promoted the idea of a “heroic” Jesus, even an Aryan Jesus, who fought against the Jewish influence in German life. They were encouraged by the anti-Semitic writings of Martin Luther. In the Martin Luther Memorial Church in Mariendorf, built in 1935, a wood carving on the pulpit depicts Christ preaching to a small group that includes a helmet-wearing Wehrmacht soldier. The church included other Nazi imagery, including an Iron Cross in the church’s chandelier and a baptismal font adorned with a Nazi SA stormtrooper, his head bowed in prayer. The church reflected the desire to construct a Volkskirche—a church that would serve the nation.

This horrifying story isn’t without admirable counterpoints. The Bekennende Kirche, or “Confessing Church,” arose in response to the Deutsche Christen movement. Its most prominent members, including Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Martin Niemöller, were key in publishing the Theological Declaration of Barmen, one of the most significant religious documents of the 20th century. But ultimately the Bekennende Kirche was forced underground and defeated; Bonhoeffer was hanged at the Flossenbürg concentration camp.

America in 2026 is not Germany in 1936; far from it. But we would be mistaken to pretend that political movements that aren’t as malevolent as Nazism can’t still advance sinister ends. We should also acknowledge that over the course of its history, Christianity, which has had glorious moments, has also taken some very dark turns.

Huge numbers of American fundamentalists and evangelicals—not just cultural Christians, but also those who faithfully attend church and Bible-study sessions and prayer gatherings—prefer the MAGA Jesus to the real Jesus. Few of them would say so explicitly, though, because the cognitive dissonance would be too unsettling. And so they have worked hard to construct rationalizations. It’s rather remarkable, really, to see tens of millions of Christians validate, to themselves and to one another, a political movement led by a malignant narcissist—who is driven by hate and bent on revenge, who mocks the dead, and who delights in inflicting pain on the powerless. The wreckage to the Christian faith is incalculable, yet most evangelicals will never break with him. They have invested too much of themselves and their identity in Trump and what he stands for.

This moment, and what it reveals about American Christianity, will be studied for a long time to come. I imagine that when future generations consider those who corrupted their faith in the name of their faith, those who were in positions of spiritual authority and knew better but still kept quiet, and those who bravely spoke out despite the costs, they will get the verdict right.

Several years ago I had a conversation with a theologian, a scholar of Søren Kierkegaard, who told me, “Christianity has in many cases stopped being the home to Jesus.” That, I fear, is the crux of the issue. Christians need to provide the world evidence of the compelling beauty and truth of God, but we cannot show the world what we ourselves cannot see. “Too late have I loved you, O Beauty so ancient, O Beauty so new,” Augustine wrote in his Confessions. It was Augustine’s lament that it had taken him so many years to discover the beauty of the divine. But having discovered it, he was changed by it.

Elizabeth Bruenig: The Catholic Church and the Trump administration are not getting along

Some time ago, it dawned on me that many Christians attempt to evangelize on behalf of a God we wish we knew but whom we do not really and fully know. We have committed to memory the phrases we tell one another. I have wondered sometimes if we mouth those words in the hopes that doing so will change our hearts.

There are shining counterexamples, of course, including people I have met along the journey who can authentically claim, “Thou and thou only, first in my heart; High King of Heaven, my treasure thou art.” But they are the exception, and it does no one any good to deny it. “Christianity has not produced Christlike people on any meaningful scale,” a theologian once told me. That is vividly evident in American politics today, but it is hardly the only domain in which that is true. And until it is less true, we have very little to teach the rest of the world.

My hope, as a Christian, is that those of us who claim to be followers of Jesus will soon discover what Augustine discovered later than he had wished. That we will fall more in love with Beauty so ancient, Beauty so new. That in doing so in a broken world, we will stand out as expressing our faith through love. That we will be repairers of the breach, true peacemakers. And that we will “shine as stars in the world.” The world would be better for it, and so would we.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/greenland-davos-trump-nato/685688/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Franklin D. Roosevelt famously illustrated with a simple metaphor the need for a healthy transatlantic alliance. Justifying his decision to lend Great Britain warships and other military supplies in the early days of World War II, Roosevelt likened it to loaning a neighbor a garden hose to put out the fire consuming his house. Sure, Roosevelt charitably wanted to help a neighbor in need. But it was self-interested too; if the neighbor could extinguish the blaze, it wouldn’t spread to FDR’s home. The United States benefited from the friendship—and the buffer—that allies could provide.

Today, Donald Trump will fly to Europe. Ukraine is already ablaze. And now the president is ready to set a bunch of new houses on fire.

The president will speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, tomorrow, and he appears prepared to shatter the nearly 80-year-old NATO alliance in order to seize Greenland. In his quest to claim a strategically located island of ice and rock, Trump has turned against his nation’s most stalwart friends. He has antagonized and mocked panicked European leaders, threatened punishing tariffs on countries that object to his plans, and pointedly not ruled out using military force. Trump’s thirst for Greenland—even if he stops short of ordering an armed invasion—threatens to unravel the partnership born from the ashes of World War II that has, in the decades since, ensured the spread of peace, prosperity, and democracy on both sides of the Atlantic.

Today marks one year since Trump’s return to office, and in that time, he has fundamentally reshaped the United States’ relationship with the rest of the world. But nothing has upended the global order more than what would happen if he follows through on his threats toward Greenland. The island, of course, belongs to Denmark, which says that it is not available for the taking. Troops from Europe have been dispatched to the territory, and Greenland’s prime minister warned his populace to prepare for an invasion. If Trump were to persist, Denmark could trigger NATO’s Article 5 mutual-defense pact, and then the unthinkable could occur: American soldiers firing on Europeans while Russian President Vladimir Putin’s dream of NATO’s self-immolation is thoroughly realized.

The annual meetings in Davos, normally a clubby gathering of business titans and political leaders, have been consumed by talk of what Trump may or may not do. European leaders have found themselves scrambling on strategy—appeasement? Defiance? Compromise? Early this morning, Trump posted screenshots of text messages that revealed the dilemma facing those leaders. (Lesson to everyone: Be careful what you text the guy unless you want the world to see.)

In one message, Mark Rutte—the secretary general of NATO, who has prized warm relations with Trump—praised the president’s foreign policies, then vowed that he is “committed to finding a way forward on Greenland.” But in another, French President Emmanuel Macron, whose relationship with Trump has been turbulent, admitted: “I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.” In fact, Trump couldn’t be more clear, as he demonstrated once again by circulating a pair of presumably AI-generated images on social media. In one, he’s planting an American flag in Greenland. In the other, he’s lecturing European leaders in the Oval Office with a map behind him that depicts Greenland as part of the United States. (Canada and Venezuela too.)

Trolling close U.S. allies has seemingly been an unofficial policy of Trump’s second administration since its first days, beginning with Vice President Vance lecturing Europe in Munich on the virtues of free speech. But this time feels different for those nervously waiting in snowy Switzerland. The president’s address to the forum tomorrow is poised to be a defining moment, and Trump plans to make the unequivocal case that the United States should have Greenland, a senior White House official told me. For now, the administration is focused on purchasing Greenland or offering economic incentives to its residents and to those in Denmark, aides told me. But they are not ruling out the use of military force or economic pressure. The senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss internal strategy, added that the White House is considering joint military exercises, withholding participation in NATO, and additional tariffs. (The Supreme Court has continued to delay its ruling on the legality of Trump’s tariffs, keeping that tool in play here.)

Yet even as the administration brandishes trade as a first-strike weapon, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent delivered this message in Davos today to European allies: “Sit back. Take a deep breath. Do not retaliate.” He added again: “Do not retaliate.” (Europe did not say that it would listen.) But Trump’s audacious power play won’t stop there: While in Davos, he’s also expected to lean on foreign leaders to join his fledgling Board of Peace, which includes a $1 billion price tag for permanent membership. A number of European heads of state expressed reservations about the board—including that it has a seat earmarked for Putin, who seemed to celebrate the invitation by launching a massive strike against Kyiv this morning. When Macron suggested that he would not join, Trump angrily threatened higher tariffs.

And now he has a new grudge: After being denied the Nobel Peace Prize that he covets, Trump this week registered his bitter complaints with the prime minister of Norway, writing that because of the snub, “I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” while incorrectly claiming that Denmark’s ownership of Greenland is not supported by “written documents, it’s only a boat that landed there hundreds of years ago.”

Some greeted the note with fact-checks and derision. But not the White House: Officials proudly distributed it for all to read.

Greenland is more than just ice and rock—and it has more strategic importance than looking really big on certain maps. Its location is key for Arctic defense and trade routes. It’s rich in minerals. And, yes, Trump has cited those factors as he has declared the island vital for U.S. national security. But Denmark has repeatedly counter-declared that it would happily grant many of Trump’s new demands. Want to build a new military base? Sure! Name it after yourself? Just ask! Yet Trump’s lust for Greenland goes beyond that, people close to him have told me. It’s about increasing American dominance in the Western Hemisphere and redrawing the maps of the world. The island is roughly 836,000 square miles, which would make it the largest territorial addition in U.S. history, eclipsing the Louisiana Purchase and the acquisition of Alaska. It would be something for the history books, the people close to him have said. And that’s what Trump is focused on.

Recent polls are clear: Americans strongly disapprove of an attempt to seize Greenland, especially by force. But Trump has been gazing past the midterms and toward his own legacy. A look back at his two previous appearances at Davos illustrates Trump’s evolution. In 2018, he was willing to be something of a deferential guest, shelving some of his nationalist ideology and even saying, “‘America First’ does not mean America alone.” He continued: “When the United States grows, so does the world.” (Hard to believe, I know.) And then, in early 2020, he offered a fairly standard campaign speech, boasting about American progress but evincing little care about what happens beyond the United States’ own borders. That is not the case in Trump 2.0.

At the one-year mark, Trump’s foreign policy has been defined by rampant interventionism. Although he has not ended as many conflicts as he claims (Trump’s count is eight and growing), the U.S. has played a mediator role in global hot spots, most notably in Gaza. After months of watching the violence, the president pressured both Israel and Hamas to reach a deal to release the hostages and implement a fragile cease-fire. But he’s also continued to erode the U.S.-led global order, instigating risky diplomatic and economic fights with allies. He has not consistently focused on the threat posed by China. His attention to the war in Ukraine has come and gone, but he continues to reflexively defer to Putin. Part of why European leaders were at first slow to challenge Trump’s Greenland rhetoric was that they didn’t want to provoke him into completely abandoning Kyiv, officials there have told me.

Trump has also fallen in love with the concept of one-and-done military interventions: the bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities, the strikes on alleged terrorist targets in Syria and Nigeria, and, of course, the capture of the Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro earlier this month. Aides have boasted that the Caracas operation was a turning point for the presidency; after limping to the finish of 2025 amid a series of electoral defeats, poor polls, and scandals, Trump seems reinvigorated. He is unchecked domestically—Minneapolis is under siege by federal forces—and internationally. He has been emboldened and has shown a new willingness to use force. In the hours before Air Force One was scheduled to lift off for Switzerland today, Trump was asked by a reporter how far he’d “be willing to go” to obtain Greenland.

Meanwhile, Europe waits. And watches for smoke.</div>

Donald Trump retains the ability to shock; the day he loses that, he will, like the biblical Samson—another man notable for his coiffure—lose his power entirely. When Trump started his second term as president a year ago, however, I doubted whether there was much more to learn about how his mind works. Even before he’d entered politics, Trump was overexposed. Since then, he has become the most scrutinized person in the world. His tendencies and foibles are well known to voters, politicians, and world leaders.

Yet in breaking one of his most entrenched patterns, he has provided perhaps the biggest surprise of the past year. During his first term, Trump was defined by his tendency to back down in any negotiation or fight: As I put it in a May 2018 article, he almost always folded, agreeing to concessions whether he was negotiating on trade with China or a budget resolution with Senate Democrats. More recently, though, he’s been following through, no matter how aberrant his ideas. The exact reason for this is difficult to pin down, though it likely includes the fact that he has more experience under his belt, fewer prudent voices in his ear, and a lame duck’s liberation from having to worry about reelection. In any case, his new determination is forcing countries around the world to reassess how to deal with him.

Nowhere is this so clear right now as with Trump’s continued pressure to acquire Greenland. In the wee hours of this morning, Trump went on a social-media spree, posting (among other things) an illustration of himself, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and J. D. Vance planting a U.S. flag in Greenland. European leaders seem to slowly be coming to the conclusion that this isn’t just a feint.

When the president began making noise about taking the Danish territory early last year, many observers were baffled but not necessarily all that concerned—an impulse reinforced when the matter receded from Trump’s attention in the months that followed. They also had a long track record to draw on. In May 2017, I wrote that “foreign leaders have realized Trump is a pushover.” This held true for adversaries (China) and allies (Taiwan, NATO) alike throughout his first term.

It was especially true for rivals such as Russia and North Korea. Trump talked a fierce game—promising “fire and fury” for Pyongyang, for example—but his counterparts understood that despite his insistence that he was a master dealmaker, all they needed was to get him to a negotiating table. “Faced with a tough decision, the president has consistently blinked, giving in to his opponents,” I wrote in my 2018 article.

This pattern was clear enough that when Trump refused to concede the 2020 election, even his allies were dismissive. “What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?” a senior Republican official told The Washington Post in November 2020. “It’s not like he’s plotting how to prevent Joe Biden from taking power on January 20.” That was exactly what he was doing, however ham-handedly. The effort to subvert the election was also a warning of things to come.

Even so, Trump’s return to office initially suggested more of the same tendency to back down. This past May (why is it always May?), I wrote about Wall Street’s “TACO trade”—short for “Trump Always Chickens Out”—in which stock traders bet against the president following through on tariff threats and then profiting when he folded and markets went up. And they were right, to an extent: Although Trump did impose extensive tariffs, the eventual levels were much lower than initially announced, thanks in part to lobbying by foreign governments. Trump’s resolve remains weak in some areas; he’s swung wildly on Ukraine and Russia, his position shifting depending on whom he last spoke to.

But in other ways, the pattern has started to break. Just ask Nicolás Maduro, who reportedly rejected negotiated exile in Turkey, perhaps wagering that Trump would never actually launch a military strike on Venezuela to capture him. It was a bad bet. Now Trump seems energized and has turned his attention to Greenland. U.S. allies—or people who until recently thought of themselves as allies—are scrambling to figure out how to react. Can they draw things out long enough for Trump to lose interest? Can they appease him somehow? Or do they need, as Eliot Cohen argued in The Atlantic this past weekend, to show a willingness to resist the United States militarily?

Trump is acting emboldened domestically too. He is once again threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy troops to Minneapolis, where he seems determined to immiserate the entire city. Before his first term, Trump had threatened to prosecute political rivals, but he was stymied by his aides during his presidency. This time, he’s going through with it. In a New Yorker profile this week of Representative LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat charged with assault for a fracas at an ICE facility, Representative Lateefah Simon, a California Democrat, said, “Typically, we would say, ‘Oh, they’re just trying to scare her.’” But this is much more than fearmongering: “They’re actively litigating this case,” Simon noted. (McIver has pleaded not guilty.)

Signs of new resistance have started to emerge in parallel with Trump’s newfound resolve. Republican members of Congress have begun pushing back—far less than one would expect even in a normal presidency, but more than in Trump’s previous term or in the early days of this one. They were able to force his hand on the Epstein files, though whether they have the courage to hold him to account for slow-walking the files’ release is not yet clear. As my colleague Anne Applebaum wrote yesterday, Congress will need to do much more to halt any Greenland fiasco. Foreign leaders will need to take a harder line too. When Trump was a pushover, it was more understandable, if not wiser, to wonder, What is the downside of humoring him? Now the downsides are clear and dangerous.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

Trump’s Golden Age of Culture Seems Pretty Sad So Far

Trump’s return to office was widely portrayed as christening a new definition of chic. Young voters and voters of color had swung in his direction, thanks partly to the influence of podcasts, livestreams, and other media formats that now compete with traditional news outlets and cultural institutions. The attendance of tech barons, comedians, and content creators at Trump’s inauguration indicated that the so-called alternative media was now the mainstream—and openly pro-Trump. Its touchstones appeared to be recently booming phenomena including country music, TikTok tradwives, and mixed martial arts.

Trump quickly began consolidating his cultural power by focusing on the old media that hadn’t fallen in line.

Get inspired. Exercise isn’t just a break from sitting at a desk—it also acts as an extra twist to open the tap of creativity, Bonnie Tsui argues.

            <div id="article-text">In Princeton, New Jersey, a short stroll from the university you have heard of, there lies a little campus home to the Institute for Advanced Study. It was founded in 1930 not to confer degrees nor—God forbid!—to make money, nor even to conduct research toward any end in particular. The institute proclaims that its purpose is “the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.”

Founder Abraham Flexner reckoned that brilliant minds, once freed to pursue “useless satisfactions,” would stumble upon discoveries of “undreamed-of utility,” as he wrote in a magazine a few years into the institute’s work. It seems to have worked for Albert Einstein, who had an office there. J. Robert Oppenheimer, too.

Enjoy this week’s useless satisfactions. I look forward to your theory of everything the week after.

And by the way, did you know that throughout the history of the Nobel Prizes, there have been years so turbulent that the Peace Prize committee determined not to confer an award, even as other categories went on?

This happened in a few of the interwar years as Nazi Germany rearmed, Italy invaded Ethiopia, and peace generally disintegrated. It was also the case for the years of World War I, with the exception of 1917, when the committee recognized the Red Cross for its humanitarian aid. (All of the Nobel Prizes were suspended during the early years of World War II.)

The circumstances were a bit different in 1948, when the committee ruled that “there was no suitable living candidate.” The clear message was that the award—which by rule cannot be given posthumously—should have gone to Mahatma Gandhi, assassinated earlier that year.

            <h2>The Real Reason for the Drop in Fentanyl Overdoses</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/opioid-overdose-decrease-fentanyl-china/685683/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For two decades, the United States and Canada have struggled with a drug epidemic. From 2003 to 2022, annual overdose deaths in the United States rose from less than 26,000 to nearly 108,000—becoming the leading nonmedical cause of death, surpassing car accidents and gun violence combined. In Canada, overdose deaths increased almost tenfold in the same period. In both countries, the surge in deaths was supercharged by “synthetic” opioids such as fentanyl, the ultra-potent, lab-made narcotic that has come to dominate the supply of hard drugs.

Then, sometime in 2023, something miraculous happened: Death rates started dropping. In Canada, opioid-overdose deaths declined 17 percent in 2024, then continued falling sharply in the first six months of 2025 (the most recent months for which data are available). In America, preliminary data indicate that total drug deaths fell from their peak of just shy of 113,000 in the year ending August 2023 to about 73,000 in the year ending August 2025.

Although the numbers are still too high, the public-health community has responded to the decrease with jubilation—and confusion. Overdoses had been rising inexorably for 20 years. What changed?

A new paper, published earlier this month by a group of drug-policy scholars in the journal Science, presents a novel theory. The paper’s authors attribute the reversal not to any American or Canadian policy, but to a sudden fentanyl “drought,” which they say may have its causes not in North America, but in China.

Nick Miroff: Fentanyl doesn’t come through the Caribbean

If right, their conclusion implies a disheartening lesson amid the otherwise-welcome news. Nothing American or Canadian policy makers did—no amount of law enforcement, harm reduction, or opioid-settlement funds—made deaths start falling, the paper implies. America and Canada’s drug problem might be in China’s hands.

The paper’s authors draw on a variety of data—drug potency, law-enforcement actions, and, cleverly, social-media posts—to study the supply of fentanyl over time. Most of what drug dealers sell on the street isn’t 100 percent pure fentanyl. Instead, dealers usually adulterate their drugs, combining fentanyl with inert powders such as sugar and baby powder, or mixing in other drugs to stretch the active ingredient. Recent years, for example, have seen a major increase in adulteration with the horse tranquilizer xylazine, which knocks users out but doesn’t satisfy the opioid craving. Such adulteration happens because users expect to pay the same amount for their drugs every time; dealers vary how much fentanyl they get for their dollar depending on how available the drug is. When purity goes down, it means the availability of fentanyl has, too.

Using data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the paper’s authors observe that when overdose deaths began falling in mid-2023, the measured purity of fentanyl sold on the street began falling roughly in tandem. By the end of 2024, the data show, both overdose deaths and powder purity had fallen by about 50 percent—a dramatic concurrence.

The authors also look at DEA data on law-enforcement seizures of fentanyl, finding that these also slowed in the third quarter of 2023. This, they argue, is less attributable to any sort of strategy or personnel change and more to the fact that there appears to have been less fentanyl for law enforcement to seize. The authors also say that Canadian data, to the extent they are available, are consistent with this trend.

To further explore the possibility that fentanyl supply was plummeting, the authors also decided to look to an unusual source of data: Reddit forums dedicated to drugs‚ such as r/fentanyl. From 2021 to early 2023, “droughts” were rarely mentioned at all. But beginning in late 2023, the term drought starts showing up in dozens of posts a month, an increase of as much as 1,900 percent. In other words: Users were noticing a supply crash, too.

Droughts have been known to reduce overdose deaths. For example, Australia experienced a significant “heroin drought” in 2001. According to a 2024 study, the drought cut opioid-overdose deaths by somewhere from 36 to 56 percent among a cohort of people using illicit opioids.

But if a fentanyl drought had come to North America, what was causing it? The paper’s authors suggest that the answer may be related to a 2023 China crackdown on fentanyl-precursor chemicals and the online platforms that sold them, itself following a summit between President Biden and Xi Jinping. That crackdown in turn may have made it harder for Mexican producers, who usually source their precursors from the Chinese gray market, to manufacture the drug. But that’s more of a speculation than a definitive answer, Jonathan Caulkins, a professor of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University and co-author of the paper, told me.

“I’m much more comfortable with the idea that supply has become less abundant,” Caulkins said, adding that he’s fundamentally “puzzled what it was that could have produced such a long-lasting reduction.”

Clearer than what caused the drought is what didn’t cause it. As deaths fell, many pointed to their preferred policies. Nora Volkow, the longtime director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, attributed the decline to the increased availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, as well as steps taken by Congress and the Biden administration to make opioid-addiction medication more available. The Biden DEA administrator Anne Milgram claimed law enforcement’s share of the credit, saying her agency had successfully put “pressure” on the cartels.

These explanations were never that convincing. Reducing drug deaths through enforcement is notoriously hard. Naloxone seems to have had no discernible effect on fentanyl deaths, though it has reduced deaths caused by other, less potent opioids. And a massive study that deployed both harm-reduction and treatment interventions across 67 communities from 2021 to 2022 yielded no statistically significant reduction in overdose deaths. These approaches all might make small differences, but they can’t explain the big drop.

Nor, the paper’s authors note, can they explain the glaring fact that overdose deaths went down in both the United States and Canada, which have very different drug-control-policy approaches. “Both countries, despite very different policies, seem to be riding the same wave of broad trends in supply and use,” Caulkins said. Which leaves American and Canadian policy makers with something of a disappointing victory: Deaths are down, but they may yet come back, and preventing that turn may be far beyond American and Canadian control.

Listen: A radical answer to the fentanyl crisis

Though we don’t know why the drought happened, it still offers opportunity. In 2019, a multiagency operation shut down a handful of drug gangs in Philadelphia’s Kensington drug market at once, effectively imposing a drought through policy. A rigorous study later concluded that overdose deaths fell as a result, and the use of addiction-treatment medication in the surrounding Delaware Valley—an area covering parts of three states—increased. When their supply dries up, some people get off drugs; now is a great time to help them.

But there are risks, too. An uncertain drug supply can drive some users to substitute other substances—xylazine, or the latest illicit tranquilizer, medetomidine—that are dangerous in their own right. And sudden drops in the availability of opioids can reduce chronic users’ tolerance, leading them to take too much and overdose when the drugs come back.

If we want to lock in the unexpected windfall from the drought, now is the time to focus on getting people clean. That’s a big lift, but the right combination of medication, therapy, and voluntary and involuntary treatment can make a difference. If we do nothing, though, then one day fentanyl will come back—and there will be little anyone can do.</div>

CEOs can be profitably replaced by AI whereas the line workers not.

It seems to me that these big tech CEOs are so divorced from reality, and so focused tickig  the boxes that &quot;the market&quot; wants to see; which  - with AI being extremely good at telling you what you want to hear without worrying overly about .. objective fact or reality...  strikes me as &quot;Yeah AI can do that job easy&quot;

What the CEOs are really saying is that AI is making THEIR work more efficient.  And since CEOs are just like normal people, AI must be making everyone&#39;s work more efficient too.  After all, no one has every accused a CEO of being myopic.

If you&#39;re asking this, you&#39;re not the customer. You&#39;re the product.

What is funny is I use Verizon&#39;s own MVNO, pay annually and get the same exact service (this may not be true for you big city dwellers). My annual bill for 2 phones is exactly 3 months of service if I was still on my verizon plan.

Yes, no lock in.  I&#39;ve been doing this for 10 years.

>&quot;if you purchased a device from Verizon&#39;s value brands previously, they would automatically unlock them after 60 days. Now, you have to wait 365 days, request the unlock because it doesn&#39;t happen automatically, and also have active service. &quot;

I must be missing something... If you choose to not outright fully buy a phone, but sign an agreement for a heavily discounted/subsidized phone, contingent on having service for X months or whatever, why should Verizon unlock it if the terms are not met?  If you wan

Because you &quot;bought the device on credit&quot; rather than &quot;renting the device&quot;, so the device is still yours to do with as you please.Paying for service and using the phone with the service are two different things. You might want to use the phone with other services as well, especially if you travel.

It&#39;s none of their business what you do with the phone so long as you continue paying off the loan. If you don&#39;t pay off the loan as agreed then that&#39;s a breach of contract and they will chase you for that. The dev

If you can&#39;t buy your phone direct, pick a different phone. I buy a new phone every few years, directly from apple. I pay cash. If I wanted android I&#39;d do the same.

If I couldn&#39;t afford that phone, I&#39;d pick a cheaper one.

The idea that financing a phone is almost the same term as financing a car (24 months!) is crazy.

Don&#39;t &quot;finance&quot; your phone with your carrier.  Buy whatever UNLOCKED phone you want/need and dispense with vendor lock from the beginning.

All the wireless carriers are slavishly trying to retain subscribers and avoid customer churn so the outcome was inevitable once the rules were relaxed.

Canada banned the sale of locked mobile phones in 2017. Since then, every phone sold in the country has been unlocked.

Did financing phones go away and make phones more expensive? No.

Carriers still finance phones, and tie them to plans, it is just decoupled from the device so while you may be paying off the device for 3 years, you can decide to sell it and/or move carriers whenever you want, by paying off the remaining balance.

The carrier generally isn&#39;t even worried that you&#39;ll abscond with the financed phone.  The manufacturer often gives them a fat rebate to offset that cost.  They are almost entirely focused on retaining the ongoing service fees and subscriber count.  THAT is a critical metric for their leadership and &quot;the street&quot;.

I think if you can&#39;t afford to buy a phone in cash, buying it on credit is a terrible idea as well. Buy a cheaper phone.

This is true with cars as well. Don&#39;t lease a BMW, buy a used Toyota.

But if you must use credit then I think Verizon should be issuing you a line of credit, not some in-between thing that acts like credit, but is tied to your service. Of course that would mean interest rates.

If TFS is accurate (always a gamble on /.) notice the nuance. The companies&#39; argument is not &quot;we&#39;re not deliberately using addiction psyops to create neurochemical dependence on our products&quot;. It&#39;s &quot;there&#39;s no proof that our specific instance of induced neurochemical dependence is the primary cause of the plaintiff&#39;s disease&quot;.

That&#39;s the same argument as every producer of cancer-causing chemicals in history. &quot;Yes, 3 methyl, tetrafluorooxylate is a known carcinogen and yes our factory leaked it into the groun

NOAA says we’ve hit G4 (Severe) geomagnetic storm levels, with a G4 watch still in play, plus an S4 (Severe) radiation storm riding along for the fun parts of physics that don’t care about our weekend plans.

Why does the hyperbolic language around solar storms persist?

For the entirety of my lifetime there has been this hyperbolic language about solar storms. They could interrupt communications. They could destroy our satellites, They could induce huge currents on our power lines and destroy the electrical grid. But, nothing of consequence has ever happened. Even the Quebec &#39;89 outage - the most significant event routinely attributed to solar storms, that you have never even heard of - was more likely due to poo

There you have it folks, this guy knows all about solar storms and stuff, and the physicists and atmospheric sciences folk know nothing. Maybe he could talk to them and get them to understand those nasty effects won&#39;t happen on Earth. I&#39;m sure they&#39;d listen to him.

Then read The Ministry for the Future, and The Second Sleep by Robert Harris.Both a grim but possible outlook.

First, the models being simple is a merit, not a shortcoming. They are easy to understand and easy to check.

Second, &quot;tech improvements&quot; have not helped us avoid most of the problems that were predicted - resource depletion, resource wars, climate change.

Third, if anything, the LtG population model &quot;underpredicts&quot; the current world population - the estimate for population peak was a tad less than 8 billion, and we&#39;re above that already.

LtG did not focus on the problems created by global warming, which will s

The fundamental premise of that report was that the global population growth rate would keep growing, which it hasn&#39;t -it has been shrinking for over a decade, and is almost to an equilibrium point - after which the population is going to start *shrinking*.

With shrinking population, will come shrinking water demands.

The global population collapse is going to cause a lot of other problems - our economies are not built to withstand it - but running out of water won&#39;t be one of them.

which it hasn&#39;t -it has been shrinking for over a decadeNo, the global population hasn&#39;t been &quot;shrinking for over a decade&quot;, it has increased from 7.5B in 2016 to 8.3B today. The prediction numbers by LtG from 1974 are lower than that.Next, please.

which it hasn&#39;t -it has been shrinking for over a decade

No, the global population hasn&#39;t been &quot;shrinking for over a decade&quot;, it has increased from 7.5B in 2016 to 8.3B today. The prediction numbers by LtG from 1974 are lower than that.

The GROWTH RATE has been shrinking for a decade.

Reports in the 70s were all predicated on not just growth, but INCREASING growth rates (exponential) because that&#39;s what had happened until that point. All of those models were wrong. The growth rate has been collapsing even faster than it grew. The global population is never going to reach 9 billion, and the peak estimate is revised down every single year. Its actually looking unlikely we will ever even break 85 billion.

The GROWTH RATE has been shrinking for a decade.You should reply with CAPS to yourself, buddy.Reports in the 70s were all predicated on not just growth, but INCREASING growth rates (exponential)Since we&#39;re basically where they predicted we&#39;ll be at this time, the conditions at this point of time hold.The global population is never going to reach 9 billion,It doesn&#39;t matter, the model did not reflect the effects of trumpistani coal-rolling, which has effectively lowered the necessary number.

And you should take a reading comprehension test.

Coming from an &quot;expert&quot; who is confused about the difference between growth and growth rate, the recommendation doesn&#39;t mean to much.

Perhaps it is best for the &quot;expert&quot; to peruse their own advice for their own benefit.

The farmers absolutely are selling the water, a truckload at a time to weed farmers.

We shouldn&#39;t allow them to sell it, but we also shouldn&#39;t force them to use it. We could just do neither thing!

California has a water surplus right now. We only use 8% of our water on residential. Last year we were letting the excess go out of our reservoirs because we had them topped off. This year will be the same. The snow pack is healthy and we just had several massive storms in rapid succession that set water fall records. And that&#39;s without a bunch of new things we&#39;re doing to maintain more of the rain instead of letting it go into the ocean. We currently have 10 years of capacity in case of a worst case scena

You forgot about aquifer replenishment. Land subsidence and long term water supplies don&#39;t matter to you, huh?

This is a tragedy of the commons.  In California most of the fresh water is used by farmersActually, about half is used for &quot;environmental&quot; purposes, which is to say, it is allowed to flow out to the sea. Agriculture is the second biggest category, but there would be no shortage in our lifetimes without the &quot;environmental&quot; part.

There is no such thing as a tragedy of the commons.

It was invented by a eugenicist [craphound.com].

Someone [indiana.edu] looked at the facts regarding his claim, and it turns out that Garrett Hardin was wrong [investopedia.com].  Who would have thought.

It only becomes a tragedy as soon as someone puts a price on commons.  In other words, the problems start when the commons are privatised.  When they stop being commons.

So California passed laws saying the farmers had to use their water or lose it. So farmers use it. If we instead allowed the farmers to sell the water then the most efficient users of water would buy it.It&#39;s true that market inefficiencies are an issue here. 
Sometimes you want to prioritize agriculture over an efficient market. If you mess it up, people die. Many other regulations are the same way: they alter the free market. It&#39;s illegal to efficiently sell your services as a hitman, no matter how profitably.

but the concept of the &quot;global water&quot; anything is nonsense.That&#39;s right. water doesn&#39;t flow into the ocean and mix around then evaporate back into the air to repeat the cycle.

That&#39;s only what the woke DEI universities want you to think.
If you can drink saltwater and brackish water, then you don&#39;t have to worry.  But when people somewhere else can&#39;t drink the water there, some of them will come to where you are and overuse your fresh water.  Saudi Arabia banned the growing of food for cattle, and instead imports it from farms in Arizona.  China gets almonds from California.  Since global migration exists, and global food shipments exist, there is at some level a global market for fresh water.  There are thoughtful logical ways to take care of this, and if they are not extremely profitable for someone, they might never come to pass.

I learned that you&#39;re a pathetic Trump sycophant. Don&#39;t know how valuable (or new) that is.

Right now, no conversation about Greenland exists in a vacuum. That NYPost story was part of an effort to gin up some sort of rationale for Trump&#39;s obsession with Mercator projections, and you fucking fell for it.

The point of the ICWA note is that the Greenlanders are not going to to look to the US to save them from past Danish awfulness, because they are not stupid. They know that the US can be just as awful, and has

You’re wrong in your question.  Number one, Venezuela is a major source, and the reason why is the following – and I’ve seen a lot of this reporting, and it’s fake reporting and I’ll tell you why.

The UN doesn’t know what they’re talking about.   Maduro is indicted by a grand jury in the Southern District of New York.

More like YOU do not know what you are talking about. Not a surprise, really. But here is the thing, willful ignorance does not solve problems.

But it&#39;s delivered as storms and floods, so making the situation even worse.

Funny story, most populations are shrinking. Even in places like China and India. Google China overcount of population for an eye opener.

Factor in the large data centers with their massive cooling requirements, water shortages will become even more severe. And that doesn&#39;t even address the electrical requirements to run these facilities which have their own needs. A number of them are currently being installed and planned for areas in the southwest where drought conditions have been in effect for years.

There is no &quot;collapse&quot;, because rainfall continues just fine. What we have - and this is nothing new - are populations pumping aquifers faster than rain refills them. Rivers being pumped dry.

In the US, this has been an issue for decades in the Southwest. It is the primary reason that some coral islands are in trouble - again, for decades now.

Polluted rivers - also a long-standing problem, especially in Asia, but also elsewhere.

So, yes, a real problem. But do we have to have clickbait? &quot;Global boiling&quot;, &quot;Water bankruptcy&quot;, the world is ending tomorrow?

But do we have to have clickbait? &quot;Global boiling&quot;, &quot;Water bankruptcy&quot;, the world is ending tomorrow?Yes. We have to. Because it&#39;s not about crisis, it&#39;s about leading the charge (and getting rich doing it) against crisis. You can&#39;t lead the charge against crisis if there is no crisis. There will - literally - always be another crisis, 100% of the time. There&#39;s far too much money involved.

There will - literally - always be another crisis, 100% of the time. There&#39;s far too much money involved.

The question of water resources is a well known problem, referred to for as &quot;The Century of water&quot; (21th Century&#39;s major issue will be water access, wars and global migrations related to lack of water). Similar reports were all over the press in the early 2000s. The situation hasn&#39;t changed, only the urgency to act increased.

Water shortage is both a) obvious, b) fixable with restraint, and c) fixable with science.

A) It&#39;s not a new or argued problem, it is obvious.  There are no conspiracy idiots claiming it is a hoax.  We know about and politicians on all sides want to fix it.  For this reason there is already a massive amount of people working on the issue with little to no political issues.

B) The main reason for the water crisis is not really human population growth, but human greed.  We can cut back on the really stupid things like data center use and the thirsty crops in drought prone areas.  It is stupid to plant almonds in California and if things get really bad we can cut those trees down.   If we have to cut our alfalfa, cotton and sugarcane use, it will affect us but not wipe us out.  Rice is an issue - we really need it despite the water costs so that might cause some problems.

C) Finally, we are making huge strides in desalination.   In the past 30 years, the cost has dropped to about a third of what it used to be.  More importantly, it is both a electrical power intensive technology AND can be run in off hours.  We can easily co-locate solar power plants directly on top of desalination plants, turning seawater into drinkable water during sunny days and literally storing it for a rainy day.

This IS an issue.  We need to watch it.  But it is not a scary doomsday event.

Rice is an issue - we really need it despite the water costs so that might cause some problems.Rice is grown in northern California, where water is less of an issue.

There are ways to build data centers that use little to no water. They are just more complicated, so unless they are forced to, companies don&#39;t do it.

I wish people would not just always assume that Data Center == Water Use. This is a problem trivially worked around using existing technology.

70% of the planet us covered in it.It just needs to be desalinated.California recently had atmospheric rivers washing it away.The Thwaites Glacier is moving into the Southern Ocean and causing sea levels to rise.

It just needs to be desalinated.For variable values of &quot;just&quot;. You of simple minds always think everything you do not understand is easy to do. In actual reality that is rarely the case.

AI god is the only one who will make the Malthusian problems go away, human technology and fucks to give have hit their limit.

In western countries water is pumped from a source (wells or rivers, etc), pumped through pipes, and then fast tracked into the nearest body of water and ultimately the oceans. Treating it for reuse is what we need - itâ(TM)s basically reusable an infinite number of times. Rain runoff is also fast tracked into the nearest ocean - I wonder what role that plays in ground water depletion?

AI God will solve all problems, so clearly the solution to water bankruptcy is to spin up more water using datacenters in pursuit of AI God. If people need to go without water to create AI God, they should be happy to sacrifice themselves for the betterment of the universe!

We declare an emergency that says you need to give us more power and money!

We&#39;re not buying what they&#39;re selling any more.  Too many lies for far too long.

If it&#39;s sensible, you&#39;ll probably get paid out. People would still do it.

Makes a lot more sense to put up a barrier to entry than to scrap the whole thing.

Indeed. A good dev will use AI to submit a better PR. A bad dev will use AI to submit more PRs. If the goal is getting a PR that hits the money ball, guess which strategy works better? If the boss isn&#39;t a programmer, guess which dev gets favored?

That&#39;s not what AI have been sold as. They have been sold on the premise that AIs are more intelligent than that.

No, the AI is capable of producing good results, but as it doesn&#39;t know anything, it doesn&#39;t know when it has done that. The problem is when the person who initiated the AI pushes the human review labor off onto some other person. If you&#39;re going to use an AI, you should have to review its output before some other human has to experience it.

No, the AI is capable of producing good results, but as it doesn&#39;t know anything, it doesn&#39;t know when it has done that.

You are indeed repeating my point. If the AI is not capable of judging the value of its own work, then what intelligence does the &quot;I&quot; refer to?

For example, I can go to my library and choose a book which contains a solution to a differential equation I want for some purpose. I must verify that the solution is suitable.

Is the book intelligent because it has a record of the solution? Clearly not. Did the book produce good work for me? No, since I did the work of checking the solution.

Is the library intelligent because I can &quot;ask&quot; it for the book, by scanning the titles in alphabetical order? Clearly not. Did the library produce good work because its books are in alphabetical order? No, since I did the work of checking the solution.

If I ask an &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; to solve a differential equation for some purpose, I should expect a suitable solution. If all I get is a page from a book and I have to check that the page is suitable for the stated purpose, then I am doing the work and the &quot;I&quot; in &quot;AI&quot; is a misnomer.

The intelligence would refer to how often it makes decent output based on the input.

It&#39;s obviously better at that than anything we&#39;ve had before, but even if it gives a qualitative result 90% of the times, that means it&#39;s completely not suited to tackle bigger problems without having a human constantly weed out those 10% of bad answers.

And not sure if you&#39;ve used AI for programming, but it does have some capabilities & &#39;creativity&#39;. In some way it obviously is a next generation, more natural, search eng

I clearly agree with the thrust here, but that&#39;s not the same thing as the AI being unable to &quot;produce good results.&quot; It only cannot do it reliably on its own. That&#39;s both why the output can be useful and also why nobody should be betting the farm on it at the same time.

And sure, &quot;intelligence&quot; is a misnomer, although I prefer to solve the problem at the other end. It&#39;s not artificial intelligence specifically because it&#39;s not intelligence. It&#39;s simulated intelligence. Just like a simulated aircraft isn&#39;t a

The problem is even more obvious: Every correct bug report created using AI can be created by the authors themselves. Why should a thirdparty know better how to run the AI on the code than the authors? Posting AI generated bugreports basically says &quot;I think the project members are too stupid to use AI&quot;.

It&#39;s not that it&#39;s inherently incapable of producing good results it&#39;s that people abuse it through ignorance, incompetence or just a lack of care and create a flood of shite for others to wade through to find the small nuggets of gold.In other words: this is why we can&#39;t have nice things.

can&#39;t they use captchas to prevent the AI bug reports or can AI solve those too now?

GPT-1 could bypass a Captcha faster than a human so no it wouldn&#39;t work.

No problem, curl surely implements wget:// somewhere.

If the motive of the sloppers is the bounty, this might stem the deluge.

But, I can think of other motives why people would want to impede cURL&#39;s security.

I&#39;m sure some of it for the reward money.

Now, to play devil&#39;s advocate: If I had a fat juiciy bug that I was using to start exploits, for sure I&#39;d try and tie up the project maintainers with AI bug reports. What better way to distract them? Keep them looking at the crap and hope it turns everyone&#39;s attention away from the real thing.

AI is just a tool. Like all tools is can be (a) used for good, (b) used for evil, (c) used to look at porn or (d) try and make money with little to no effort.

If you follow Daniel on Mastodon, you&#39;ve seen him talking about the avalanche of complete bogus AI-reports he gets and the ever increasing time he has to spend dealing with them.

Enshittification of bug bounty platforms - a decade ago when many of the big platforms were starting, there were promises of pre-screening and helping to organize the inflow of reports. I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s only for &quot;premium&quot; accounts only these days.

It&#39;s not a sustainable way to do application security testing.

Bad decision. They should have started charging a deposit for bug registration instead. Ideally, the deposit should be twice the cost of the analysis. If there is no bug, the deposit is taken, and a new deposit is required for the next bug registration. If there is a bug, the deposit is kept and a bonus is paid. In this case, the fake bug registrants will pay for the work of good programmers.

If they start taking monetary payments then they have to become a legal merchant with all the time, cost and hassle that entails.

The U.S. may have moved on to another immigration crisis, but Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student who was arrested last spring after participating in pro-Palestine protests, is still in the middle of his legal battle. Khalil was taken into custody in March, after Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a rarely used mechanism in federal immigration law that claimed that the student’s actions would have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” The 30-year-old green-card holder was detained for three months, missing the birth of his first child, but was released in June. Last week, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a devastating blow to Khalil’s case: A three-judge panel dismissed his habeas corpus petition challenging the federal government’s attempts to detain and deport him.

In a 2–1 decision, the court ruled that the lower district court of New Jersey—which had ordered Khalil to be released from immigration detention in June—did not have jurisdiction to consider his habeas petition. The panel’s majority declared that these petitions challenging a final order of removal can be heard only in immigration court, a system overseen by the attorney general, who also handpicks immigration judges.

Khalil essentially has one option left before being forced to go through immigration court: request a rehearing en banc. If that is approved, all 14 judges on the 3rd Circuit would hear Khalil’s case. But not only does the current makeup of this particular court lean conservative; it received a notable new member last year—Emil Bove. A former defense attorney for President Donald Trump and the former deputy attorney general, Bove has been mired in controversy throughout his tenure in the second Trump administration.

To make sense of Khalil’s options, I spoke with Elora Mukherjee. A professor at Columbia Law School and director of the school’s Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, Mukherjee submitted an amicus brief in defense of Khalil, along with other students, scholars, and professors who have been charged under the same foreign-policy deportability ground that Khalil currently faces. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Shirin Ali: Before we get into the 3rd Circuit’s latest opinion, can you bring us up to speed on how exactly Khalil’s case ended up there?

Elora Mukherjee: On the night that Khalil was wrongly arrested, detained, and targeted for his speech—peaceful speech that should be protected by the First Amendment—he was initially detained at his apartment in graduate student housing at Columbia University. That night, his lawyers immediately filed a federal habeas petition for him with the Southern District of New York.

But by the time that petition was formally filed in federal court, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had already transferred Khalil to a detention center in northern New Jersey. For that reason, the initial federal judge assigned to Khalil’s case in SDNY found that he didn’t have jurisdiction to hear the habeas petition. Instead, he transferred it to the New Jersey federal district court. That transfer was done over the objection of the federal government, which argued that because Khalil was detained in Louisiana, the case should be either dismissed outright or transferred to the federal district court for the Western District of Louisiana.

The federal government again tried to get Khalil’s case transferred to Louisiana by filing a motion with the New Jersey district court but was denied. Eventually, the question [of who should hear the case] landed with the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

And what do you make of the circuit court’s latest opinion?

The decision is wrong. It was a split decision with two judges in the majority and one judge in the dissent. Judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas were in the majority—President George W. Bush appointed Hardiman, and Trump appointed Bibas during his first term. The majority interprets provisions of immigration law that were introduced with the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act as stripping federal courts of jurisdiction to hear the constitutional claims of individuals like Khalil, who are alleging that their rights are being irreparably harmed.

According to these two judges, Khalil is not eligible to file a federal habeas petition. The only recourse available to him is to raise any defenses that he has, first in his immigration court proceedings before the Board of Immigration Appeals, then to the federal circuit court that has jurisdiction over the immigration court that initially heard his removal proceedings—in this case, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

This is exactly what the Trump administration wants. The government has claimed that the jurisdiction stripping provisions of the IIRAIRA are broad in cases over the years, but that position has consistently been rejected in federal courts—including, most recently, in the U.S. Supreme Court, in Jennings v. Rodriguez, a case from 2018. In the Jennings case and in similar cases, the Supreme Court and other federal courts have consistently affirmed that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas claims.

If the right to habeas corpus is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, how can the 3rd Circuit essentially take that away from Khalil?

This is what much of this litigation has been about. The Trump administration’s position is that there should be only one proceeding, and the only proceeding that Khalil is entitled to contest is in Louisiana immigration court. Once he loses in immigration court, he can appeal that to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Once he loses at the BIA, he can appeal that to the relevant federal circuit court, which for him, the administration would argue, is the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. That would be the administration’s position because Khalil was detained for the longest period of time in the Western District of Louisiana, and Louisiana is where the immigration judge issued the removal order against him.

In my view, and the position of reasonable people across party lines who care about the rule of law, is that federal habeas proceedings must be available to individuals who are targeted by the executive branch in violation of basic constitutional protections. There is a doctrine that allows for people to go to federal court and file habeas petitions when their constitutional rights have been violated, and it doesn’t require waiting months or years to first exhaust the immigration court proceedings, waiting again for the BIA to rule, and finally getting to a federal circuit court of appeals. By that point in time, Khalil could have been detained for months or years, during which time he would have suffered irreparable harm because of the Trump administration’s violation of his First Amendment rights.

The quick summary of this doctrine is this: If a person is suffering irreparable harm affecting their constitutional rights, then they should be able to seek relief through federal habeas court proceedings without first needing to wait months or years for their immigration proceedings to be exhausted.

Can Khalil appeal the 3rd Circuit’s decision? What options does he have now?

He can request a rehearing en banc with the 3rd Circuit, which is an opportunity for all the judges on the court to rehear his case. The full en banc panel could request a new briefing on these issues from both sides, asking what they think about the panel decision that was issued last week, and it would be extremely likely to have oral arguments. All the judges on the court would have a chance to weigh in on the en banc court’s final opinion, or opinions, as there would likely be a split decision from the 3rd Circuit, given the makeup of that court.

Through the Biden administration, the 3rd Circuit was considered a swing court, in that its makeup was about half appointees from Democratic presidents and about half appointees by Republican presidents. In the last year or so of the Biden administration, there was an opportunity to appoint a judge to the circuit that would result in the court being composed of a slight majority of federal judges appointed by Democratic presidents. Unfortunately, as the Biden administration ended, it left a vacant seat on the 3rd Circuit, and last year that seat was filled by Emil Bove.

If the en banc’s majority also ends up ruling against Khalil, at that point he would have the option of appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court grants cert in Khalil’s case and issues an opinion, it would likely have consequences for other noncitizen students and scholars who have spoken out against the Trump administration. It also could have broader consequences for noncitizens who are trying to seek habeas relief after they have been wrongly arrested and detained by the executive branch.

While this case has been unfolding, Khalil has had a separate legal challenge active in Louisiana’s immigration court. What’s going on with that one?

This is very confusing, because there are multiple proceedings taking place simultaneously. So there is a proceeding in immigration court in Louisiana, and that is taking place before an agency called the Executive Office for Immigration Review. It’s housed within the Department of Justice and is presided over by an immigration judge. This is one track that was proceeding at the same time the federal habeas proceedings were going forward in the District of New Jersey.

My understanding is that his case is currently pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals. I don’t know what the briefing schedule is, but it’s worth mentioning that over the past year the Trump administration has fired or reassigned all the reasonable members of the BIA. In 2025, I believe, with one exception, dozens and dozens of cases and opinions issued by the board almost uniformly narrowed the protections available to noncitizens. So there are real questions about whether the BIA is still a meaningful administrative appellate body.

Immigration judges here are also hired by the attorney general, but over the past year, more than 100 immigration judges who didn’t toe the administration’s party line have been fired—they don’t have any of the protections, such as life tenure, that one expects of federal judges. And in hiring announcements for what has historically been called immigration judges, the administration is now calling them deportation judges. The Trump administration is very clear about what it wants these administrative law officers to do. Lastly, the federal district court in the Western District of Louisiana has, the last time I checked, the lowest grant rate for federal habeas petitions in the country. Plus, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is known for being the least likely federal appeals court to protect people’s civil rights.

Five years ago, and to his enduring credit, Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy voted to convict Donald Trump on an impeachment charge of “incitement of insurrection.” In a brief statement afterward, Cassidy said, “I voted to convict Trump because he is guilty.”

Cassidy, representing a deep-red state and at the time still ascending toward a committee chairmanship and a meaningful tenure in the Senate, had the most to lose politically of the seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump. He had, however, just won reelection in 2020. He may have bet that Trump would simply disappear into the shadows of American political life before Cassidy had to stand before voters again.

As we are all more aware with each passing minute, that bet was wrong. And lest anyone think that Trump might forgive something like an impeachment vote against him, he quashed that over the weekend when he prospectively endorsed GOP Rep. Julia Letlow in a primary against Cassidy, urging, “RUN, JULIA, RUN!!!,” on his social media account.

Letlow announced her candidacy Tuesday morning. The key lines of her launch video, which features a great many photos of Trump, or of herself with Trump: “A state as conservative as ours? We shouldn’t have to wonder how our senator will vote when the pressure is on.”

Cassidy, in a statement Tuesday, said that Letlow had called him before her announcement and “said she respected me and that I had done a good job.”

He added, “I will continue to do a good job when I win re-election.”

His confidence may not be well placed. Cassidy, who entered the Senate in 2015, was censured by his party following his Trump conviction vote. A Trump endorsement in a GOP primary, in a very red state, means the world, and Letlow is not a gadfly candidate. If Cassidy still wants to have a meaningful tenure in the Senate, he should treat this year as his last. Because there’s a great chance it is.

The senator, who also failed to endorse Trump in 2024, has since done everything he can to win the president’s favor—or at least his indifference. That included absorbing oceans of criticism for his role in supporting one of Trump’s key nominees with whom Cassidy was plainly uncomfortable. Trump must have enjoyed watching him twist in the wind this way for the past year just as much as he enjoys turning on those just as they get their hopes up that he won’t. It’s another warning to anyone who ever might think they’re safe from a change in Trump’s mood.

Those familiar with his campaign-rally routines will know Trump’s many recitations of “The Snake,” something he refers to as a poem but is really a song from the 1960s. The lyrics are about a woman who takes a snake into her home and is then bit by it, to which the snake says, “You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.” Trump has long used this as a metaphor against lax immigration policies, while everyone else observes that it’s a form of projection and a warning to those who put their trust in Trump.

Cassidy seemed to believe that he could get over the hurdle with Trump in the first year of Trump’s second presidency and at least win his neutrality in a GOP Senate primary. Most notably, Cassidy, despite being a physician who was visibly disgusted with vaccine conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s nomination to head the Department of Health and Human Services, cast the key vote to confirm Kennedy in the Senate Finance Committee last year. Cassidy did so after receiving a variety of “assurances” from Kennedy that he wouldn’t make all sorts of ruptures to mainstream public health, which Kennedy has gone on to do anyway.

And while Cassidy has been more and more critical of Kennedy over the past year—to no apparent avail—he’s otherwise moved in lockstep with Trump. The pinned posts on both his official and personal X accounts show him beside the president in the Oval Office as Trump signs a MAGA hat for him. You will not see him entertaining defecting Trump on any floor votes or criticizing episodes of executive imperialism. Even for the one issue on which he has spent some capital—criticizing Kennedy—he does it by trying to drive a wedge between Kennedy and Trump. He noted in a September hearing with Kennedy, for instance, that Kennedy has been sharply critical of COVID vaccines, whereas Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in their development.

On a surface level, Cassidy’s sucking up appeared to be paying dividends. Months came and went without Trump endorsing an opponent. Politico asserted, first in an article in September, that things were “looking up” for Cassidy and again, just last week, that Trump was not expected to make an endorsement in either the Louisiana or Texas GOP Senate primaries.

This may have all been a ruse to get through the peak governing season in Trump’s first two years, as the president needed Cassidy as an ally on major nominations and legislation. The New York Times reported over the weekend that Trump first met with Letlow last March and told her that she would have his support if she challenged Cassidy. “But,” the Times added, “he said he would have to lie low for the time being to avoid a repeat of Mr. Trump’s clashes with former Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who routinely broke with the president, including on his vote to remove him from office.”

Cassidy gave the suck-up routine the old college try, but ultimately, the snake did its snake thing. Cassidy now has the choice to either try to out-Trump the Trump-endorsed candidate in the race or accept Trump’s rationale in endorsing Letlow—now that he doesn’t need Cassidy’s help in Congress anymore—and stop offering it.

Cassidy ought to take a look at North Carolina’s Thom Tillis, one of his fellow GOP senators from the 2015 freshman class, and note how much more enlivened and central to the discussion he is now that he’s unshackled from electoral considerations. The country is in a dangerous place right now. The Senate could use another adult voice.

The Supreme Court heard arguments over state-level bans on trans athletes competing in public schools last week. Though it’s hard to imagine the conservative-majority court calling the bans “discriminatory,” trans athletes and allies have reason to hope for a narrow ruling, rather than an expansion of the existing laws.

Over the past week, the Trump administration has escalated its attacks on Minnesota officials and protesters who oppose its immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities. Federal officials have claimed that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are terrorists, and lobbed the same charge against slain protester Renee Good. Donald Trump’s Justice Department has also opened an investigation into Walz and Frey, issuing subpoenas to Democratic officials on Tuesday. The expanding probe appears to lay the groundwork for potential criminal charges against both men for obstructing federal immigration enforcement. It follows Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s declaration last week that Walz and Frey are engaged in outright “terrorism,” promising to stop it “by any means necessary.”

On this week’s episode of Amicus, Mark Joseph Stern spoke with Julia Gegenheimer about the rapidly expanding definition of terrorism, obstruction, and other charges that the government is weaponizing against political opponents. Gegenheimer is special litigation counsel at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and previously served at the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. An excerpt from their conversation, below, has been edited for length and clarity.

Mark Joseph Stern: You spent years working on cases involving domestic terrorism and extremist violence. Is this what happens when almost anyone can be classified as a “terrorist” and any opposition to the government, including protected First Amendment activities, can be classified as “terrorism”?

Julia Gegenheimer: I think it’s important here, when we talk about domestic terrorism, to take a step back and look at what we actually mean when we use that term. It’s being thrown around a lot in common parlance to stand in for people who are opposed to this administration or its policies, or who are protesting this administration, or who seek to hold it accountable. But federal law actually defines domestic terrorism. Under the law, domestic terrorism involves activities that are “dangerous to human life,” that are in violation of federal criminal law—and, on top of that, have the intent to intimidate a population, or to affect the “conduct” or “policy” of a government by “intimidation or coercion.”

Even then, domestic terrorism is not itself a federal crime. You have to have an underlying federal criminal violation, then these additional layers of motivation or intent stack on top of it. So the impact of throwing this term around very loosely is to threaten criminal punishment for conduct that falls far, far short of what federal law would actually look at as domestic terrorism.

We’ve seen the president and his allies calling these protesters “terrorists.” We’ve seen the government treating protesters like Renee Good much as they treated the fishermen in international waters, whom they bombed without any semblance of due process. It feels to me like an escalation to then accuse elected local and state leaders of terrorism.

It is profoundly disturbing. And the reason why this feels different to you is that it is a bit of a different flavor. It’s pitting the federal government against the states and creating tension where it doesn’t need to be. And frankly, it’s implicitly encouraging acts of political violence against these elected officials by turning them into the enemy.

So we have the Trump administration falsely accusing state and local leaders of encouraging political violence—and, in the process, actually encouraging political violence against the people they’re defaming.

Sure. We’ve seen this throughout history, even recent history: When you put people in opposition like that—when you portray them as the enemy, when you describe them as kind of threatening a person’s way of life or things that they hold dear—that creates the conditions under which people are more likely to resort to political violence, and it becomes more and more the norm.

It feels very much of a piece with the Trump administration treating blue states as the enemy of the federal government and even the American people. The administration is shutting off federal funds to blue states, canceling projects within blue states, trying to suppress the votes of blue state residents. It’s direct hostility and antagonism toward the half of the country that didn’t vote for Trump. It’s also a refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of whom those people did vote for, including Tim Walz.

It seems to me that it leads to a really dark place when the federal government can almost declare war on a state because it didn’t go for him in the most recent election. Then occupy that state with federal agents who are actively hostile and in fact violent toward the local community.

Officials in this administration have been explicit that they are targeting blue states. We’ve seen the surges in Minnesota, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The reasoning behind that has been that these are traditionally blue states or Democratic areas. It doesn’t take too much reading between the lines to see that that’s what’s going on.

In his address to Minnesotans, Gov. Tim Walz urged residents to bear witness and help to create a record. That record, of course, will be vital in prosecutions, should they ever happen. But at the same time, the Trump administration is telling citizens that following or recording ICE officers is a federal crime and maybe even domestic terrorism. That it’s an obstruction of law enforcement to follow federal agents and to document what they are doing. Is that true?

No. The act of observing and recording officers from a safe distance, including when they are making an arrest, is something that has been long- and well-recognized as protected by the First Amendment.

Could you explain why? There’s a wrinkle here because smartphones are 21st-century technology that the Framers couldn’t possibly have conceived of. But it does seem like this is bedrock First Amendment stuff, right? The First Amendment isn’t just billionaires buying an election. I would think that in a democracy, regular people have a right, if not a duty, to document what public officials are doing on the job, very much including armed agents of the state. Is that something the law bears out?

Yes. Cellphone recordings of ICE activity connect back to these really fundamental principles that the First Amendment was designed to protect. They’re connected to the idea that people have a right to know what their government is doing so they can express views on what their government is doing and protest peacefully against it.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/ice-minnesota-minneapolis-keith-ellison-shooting-protests-violence-lawsuits.html?via=rss">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">All weekend long, the headlines out of Minneapolis have captured a moment that is by turns alarming and bizarre.

For instance, in the wake of the killing of Renee Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, protesters have been gathering at a federal building out by the airport in the bitter cold. Police have greeted them with chemical irritants.

Meanwhile, downtown, a pardoned Jan. 6 rioter tried to stage a protest in support of the Trump administration. But his small group was quickly overwhelmed—and pelted with water balloons. Locals blasted music from the movie Frozen and carried signs reading “ICE out of Minnesota.”

Around the time that Jan. 6–er was getting soaked, What Next host Mary Harris hopped on a call with Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general. On a recent episode of What Next, the two discussed the challenging situation in Minneapolis, why it may take time to bring charges over Good’s killing, and how Ellison is standing up to President Donald Trump. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: I want to talk about what your office has been doing in the wake of the killing of Renee Good. You’re working with a local prosecutor to beseech the public to send you evidence in this case, and evidence more generally of how immigration enforcement is going down in the state of Minnesota?

Keith Ellison: Yeah, two different portals. One is through the Hennepin County attorney’s office for evidence concerning the death of Good, and the other one is just general information on what ICE is doing, what they’re up to. And they’re for two separate reasons. One is going to help us determine whether it would be appropriate to file charges against Jonathan Ross, and that decision has not been made yet. And I don’t want people to worry. It is the practice for criminal investigations to first investigate, then make a charging decision.

It’s been days since Renee Good was killed. Many people have seen the video of her death through multiple angles, multiple different videos. Can you explain to me as a lawyer why the evidence I’ve seen is not sufficient to at least impanel a grand jury to consider charges against the officer who shot her?

The reason is very simple. Evidence is being gathered as quickly as possible. The final autopsy is not even done yet, and it might not be done in the normal course of events yet. But also, the local FBI, under the direction of the federal government, has been told to deny the state access to the car, which includes the windows that could show the trajectory of bullets, the shell casings, and the gun.

Wouldn’t bringing charges mean that you had to have access to that evidence? Maybe a judge would say you have to?

Well, look, you want to have the best case before you file charges. You may still need to do some discovery demands.

You mentioned this other portal, the fact that you’re also seeking information about how immigration enforcement is behaving in general in Minneapolis and in Minnesota. And I have to say that over the past week, I’ve seen so much troubling information coming out of Minneapolis. I’ve seen reports of protestors talking about being thrown in cars, being groped by ICE agents, being called names. There are people being told: “Didn’t you see what happened to that woman?” Are you seeing prosecutable behavior when you see these things?

Yeah—they say it in the most disgusting terms, by the way. It’s not just “Didn’t you see what happened to that woman?” It’s “Didn’t you see what happened to that effing …,” then there’s an expletive about her sexual orientation. It’s just the nastiest, most revolting, insulting way possible. We’ve seen all of that and more.

But one of the challenges we have right now is that prosecutors do not do investigations; police do them. And, quite frankly, it’s simply outside the experience and culture of police to arrest federal agents, because usually federal agents are doing what the statute says they’re supposed to do, reasonably connected to their legal obligation. They might not do it the way you would do it, and they might violate the rights of people. But more or less, they’re doing what the law says to do. Now, this is very different. I mean, you mentioned throwing people in cars. They’re ripping people out of cars too. They’re smashing their windows. They’re throwing smoke bombs and chemical irritants under the car. There was an infant who stopped breathing and needed CPR by the parents. They’ve been at high schools—saturating high schools, terrorizing kids. There’s been a wide range of crazy behavior.

A federal judge just issued an injunction barring ICE agents from retaliating against protesters in Minnesota. I wonder if you think the federal agents will be abiding by that order, and what that order includes.

Well, let me tell you this: It is a good thing that Judge Kate Menendez issued that very thoughtful order. Before we race ahead and say, “Oh my God, this order could have a problem,” let’s just say that the judge considered the evidence and found that the agency was violating people’s rights and she needed to issue an order to protect them.

What have you learned from seeing how the Trump administration and immigration enforcement have operated in other cities before they came to your region? Are there lessons you took from that? Or do you feel that there are critical differences in how the agents are behaving now that they’re in Minneapolis?

There’s both. The caper they pulled in Chicago, where they descended upon the apartment building, where they’re kicking in doors indiscriminately, that was sort of an indication that we’re dealing with people who have absolutely no sense of legality, propriety, or decency. They will harm anyone they want. People analogize it to the Gestapo. And those analogies are very appropriate. We saw that behavior. Me and my fellow attorneys general talk about this stuff all the time. We’ve been in touch. Of course, the Minnesota one is the biggest surge they’ve done, so nobody really could prepare us for what we’ve seen. But talking to the folks from Oregon, they taught us a lot about using humor. You’ll remember the frog suits and stuff like that.

I would say that we’ve learned a lot from our colleagues, but this one has been the biggest and most severe and most aggressive surge. And so, because of that, we are dealing from no playbook here. But we do have a playbook. It’s called the U.S. Constitution, and we’re going to enforce it.

Republicans say they’re going after your state because there’s a big undocumented population (that’s a lie) and that the Somali community has been engaged in fraud, and that fraud has not been taken seriously by the local leaders. What do you say to that?

Well, if Trump wanted to help us deal with fraud, he would have sent us accountants. Instead, he sent us armed paramilitaries wearing masks, kicking in doors, grabbing whoever. Now, how is that rationally related to white-collar-crime reduction? It’s just ridiculous.

Do you think there’s anything leaders in Minnesota could have done to prevent this? Some would say taking the fraud more seriously would have prevented the most aggressive action.

First, we take fraud very seriously. My office has prosecuted over 300 people for Medicaid fraud and convicted them. And some have gone to prison, and they’ve all been held accountable. This is not about fraud. And if Trump was so concerned about fraud, why would he be pardoning fraudsters who have been committing fraud all over the country? He himself has Trump University fraud. He himself has been convicted civilly. He’s had a civil liability for defrauding the assessment of his buildings and in his taxes.

It’s not about fraud. You’re never going to see somebody doing something wicked and evil and bad saying it. It’s never happened in the history of humanity. Even Hitler said, “I was protecting the homeland and my people.” Mussolini had a reason. Franco had a reason. They all have a reason for the wickedness that they do.

If and when the Department of Justice opens an investigation into you, I wonder if you have a game plan.

I got a lawyer. That’s my game plan. Here’s the thing: Your question is a good one, because what wrong was Tish James doing? None. What wrong was James Comey doing? None. It doesn’t matter whether you’ve committed a crime or acted in violation of the law. What matters is if you’ve offended the king.

It doesn’t sound as if you have any problem offending the king.

I would have no problem giving credit where credit is due if any was due. I just haven’t seen any. This is a president who has taken onto himself the power to tax—that’s what a tariff is—which is Congress’ job. He’s taken onto himself the power to spend. He’s taken onto himself the power to adjudicate what the outcome of a particular controversy should be. That’s the judiciary’s job. He is collapsing the functions of the three levels of government into himself. And then the other element of federalism, which is the balance between the state and the central government, he’s trying to convert states into lesser bodies of sovereignty than we are. And so what do we do with that? Stand around and hope for the best? At some point, just trying to be polite isn’t going to work. And there’s no amount of sucking up that’s going to win you favor from this guy.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It is 50 years since Concorde began scheduled passenger flights, with British Airways operating a London-Bahrain service and Air France flying from Paris to Rio de Janeiro.

Technically, the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 was the first supersonic passenger airliner, entering service on December 26, 1975. However, Concorde began scheduled passenger service earlier, on January 21, 1976, while the Tu-144&#39;s passenger flights didn&#39;t start until 1977.

Concorde could fly at more than twice the speed of sound, yet the lucrative transatlantic routes to the US were not viable, casting more doubt on the aircraft&#39;s already ropy economics. Concerns about noise meant it was banned from landing in the US until later in 1976, with operations permitted in New York from 1977.

The first scheduled flight took off amid technical, political, and financial obstacles. It was clear that while Concorde was an impressive technological feat, the economics did not make sense given slower aircraft like Boeing&#39;s 747 could carry far more passengers. Other factors such as the 1973 oil crisis shifted opinion away from the Concorde toward more fuel-efficient options.

By 1976, only British Airways and Air France remained customers for the aircraft, and the production line was winding down. The final Concorde that was manufactured first flew in 1979.

In May 2003, Air France flew its last commercial flight, and British Airways retired its Concorde fleet on October 24, 2003.

Multiple factors contributed to the retirement of the fleet: one of the aircraft crashed during take-off from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris on July 25, 2000 and operators cited low passenger numbers after the crash; a broader slump in air travel following the September 11 terror attacks in 2001; and Airbus&#39;s decision to halt the supply of replacement parts.

Many of the remaining Concordes are on display, and we highly recommend a trip to the Sinsheim museum in Germany, where an Air France Concorde and a Tupolev Tu-144 are accessible to visitors.

As for whether Concorde could have kept flying past 2003, it&#39;s possible. The flight rate would have meant the airframe was still in good condition at the time of retirement. However, despite interest from the likes of Richard Branson, the remaining aircraft break the sound barrier again.

Concorde entered service just as confidence in mass supersonic travel was already fading. Despite decades of interest in reviving the idea, no successor has yet made it back into commercial service. ®

            <h2>EU considers whether there's Huawei of axing Chinese kit from networks within 3 years</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/eu_mulls_deadline_of_3_years/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The European Commission (EC) wants a revised Cybersecurity Act to address any threats posed by IT and telecoms kit from third-country sources, potentially forcing member states to confront the thorny issue of suppliers such Huawei in their national networks.

Europe faces increasingly sophisticated hybrid attacks on every area of its infrastructure, the EC claims. The revised Cybersecurity Act looks to address this with union-level risk assessments, combined with targeted mitigation measures that will include bans on IT components from &quot;high-risk suppliers.&quot;

The suggested timeframe for this could leave member states with as little as three years to remove non-compliant kit.

This is seen as the Commission finally cracking down on member states that have for years declined to take any kind of action against suppliers deemed to be a potential security risk, and imposing Europe-wide rules regarding which companies and products should not be trusted.

In mid-2023, former European Commissioner Thierry Breton said telecoms equipment from firms including Huawei and ZTE should be banned throughout the EU amid fears the tech could contain backdors, allowing Beijing to remotely access it for espionage purposes or to disrupt networks. Plan were announced to remove the gear from the Commission&#39;s internal networks.

In the same year it emerged that Huawei had supplied nearly 60 percent of the telco equipment used in Germany&#39;s 5G networks. The megacorp hit back after EU officials labelled it as a &quot;high-risk supplier.&quot;

Huawei has always strongly denied its products represent a security threat, although critics counter that Chinese law requires its citizens and organizations to serve as covert operatives on behalf of the state if ordered to do so.

The EC wants several key things baked into the revised Cybersecurity Act: a framework to address the supply chain security challenges in critical infrastructure, and to simplify the Europe-wide cybersecurity certification framework.

It also wants to strengthen the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), and reduce &quot;unnecessary administrative burdens&quot; relating to implementation of the NIS2 cybersecurity directive (only two member states met the deadline to transpose it into national law.)

As for 5G networks, the EC says the legislation &quot;provides for a phase-out of high-risk suppliers from mobile networks,&quot; and will mean that conformity assessment bodies will not be allowed to certify products or services from these suppliers.

This isn&#39;t just about telecoms, the new Cybersecurity Act along with the upcoming Cloud and AI development act (CADA) will address sovereignty aspects and non-technical risks, according to the EC.

The proposed legislation makes no mention of specific companies such as Huawei, but the China-based tech biz has supplied infrastructure to telecoms networks in pretty much every EU country because it was an early investor in 5G technology and standards.

A spokesperson for Huawei told The Register: &quot;A legislative proposal to limit or exclude non-EU suppliers based on country of origin, rather than factual evidence and technical standards, violates the EU&#39;s basic legal principles of fairness, non-discrimination, and proportionality, as well as its WTO obligations.

&quot;We will closely monitor the subsequent development of the legislative process and reserve all rights to safeguard our legitimate interests.&quot;

Huawei said it will continue to provide products and services as a legally operating company in Europe.

The proposed Cybersecurity Act says that a timeframe for phasing out components provided by high-risk suppliers from communications networks &quot;shall not exceed 36 months from the publication of the list of high-risk suppliers.&quot;

This seems ambitious and compliance is not certain. The UK, for example, mandated in 2020 for the removal of Huawei technology from the country&#39;s 5G networks by the end of 2027. BT, the former state-owned telecoms giant, admitted in 2024 it had missed the 2023 deadline for removing Huawei kit from its network core.

Britain&#39;s decision to rip and replace Huawei kit was also cited as a factor in why UK mobile networks are ranked among the worst in Europe for quality of service, as this diverted cash from being spent on expanding and improving the country&#39;s 5G networks.

Gary Barlet, Public Sector CTO at cybersecurity biz Illumio, warned the EC&#39;s latest move could also lead to fragmentation in the global telecoms ecosystem.

&quot;While efforts to achieve tech sovereignty and protect critical environments are understandable, an overly isolationist approach could create challenges,&quot; Barlet told The Register. &quot;Fragmentation often limits collaboration and slows innovation, making it harder to build robust, future-ready networks.&quot; ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/ftc_to_drag_meta_back/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Federal Trade Commission has doubled down on its belief that Meta maintained a monopoly of social networking by anticompetitive conduct, appealing last year&#39;s district court victory for Zuck and co.

The FTC first brought its case back in December 2020, alleging &quot;the company is illegally maintaining its personal social networking monopoly through a years-long course of anticompetitive conduct.&quot;

That &quot;conduct&quot; included snapping up potential rivals such as Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as imposing &quot;anticompetitive conditions on software developers.&quot; At the time, the FTC demanded divestitures of assets, including those acquisitions, and removing the &quot;anticompetitive conditions&quot; on devs.

However last November, district judge James Boasberg ruled that &quot;Meta holds no monopoly in the relevant market,&quot; citing a constantly changing social media ecosystem and noted that Meta’s market share &quot;seems to be shrinking.&quot;

He also noted that the FTC had approved the Insta and WhatsApp buys.

In a statement yesterday, the FTC confirmed it &quot;continues to allege, and robust evidence at trial demonstrated, that for over a decade Meta has illegally maintained a monopoly in personal social networking services through anticompetitive conduct.&quot;

FTC Bureau of Competition Director Daniel Guarnera said: &quot;The Trump-Vance FTC will continue fighting its historic case against Meta to ensure that competition can thrive across the country to the benefit of all Americans and US businesses.&quot;

The original case was brought after the November 2020 election and before the inauguration of Joe Biden.

Donald Trump was banned from Meta&#39;s platforms, amongst others, following the Capitol Hill riot. Republicans have, in the past, railed against the perceived liberal bias of Silicon Valley based platforms, like Meta. And Trump has his own platform – albeit at arm&#39;s length – in the shape of Truth Social.

But that&#39;s all water under the bridge. Trump has since been reinstated to Meta, and other platforms. Meanwhile Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg was amongst the tech titans who attended Trump&#39;s inauguration and picked up the tab. While simultaneously ditching DEI.

Earlier this month, Dina Powell McCormick joined Meta as president and vice chairman. McCormick was previously a board member at the firm, and her CV includes stints as deputy national security advisor in Trump&#39;s first administration, as well as time in the Bush administration in the early 2000s. ®

            <h2>Ireland wants to give its cops spyware, ability to crack encrypted messages</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/ireland_wants_to_give_police/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Irish government is planning to bolster its police&#39;s ability to intercept communications, including encrypted messages, and provide a legal basis for spyware use.

The Communications (Interception and Lawful Access) Bill is being framed as a replacement for the current legislation that governs digital communication interception.

The Department of Justice, Home Affairs, and Migration said in an announcement this week the existing Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 &quot;predates the telecoms revolution of the last 20 years.&quot;

As well as updating laws passed more than two decades ago, the government was keen to emphasize that a key ambition for the bill is to empower law enforcement to intercept of all forms of communications.

The Bill will bring communications from IoT devices, email services, and electronic messaging platforms into scope, &quot;whether encrypted or not.&quot;

In a similar way to how certain other governments want to compel encrypted messaging services to unscramble packets of interest, Ireland&#39;s announcement also failed to explain exactly how it plans to do this.

However, it promised to implement a robust legal framework, alongside all necessary privacy and security safeguards, if these proposals do ultimately become law. It also vowed to establish structures to ensure &quot;the maximum possible degree of technical cooperation between state agencies and communication service providers.&quot;

As law enforcement grows ever warmer to the idea of breaking encryption, privacy advocates and technologists keep warning them it is, in fact, impossible.

This idea of breaking encryption most commonly relates to messaging platforms that use end-to-end encryption (E2EE). Criminals like it because they cannot be snooped on, and law enforcement hates it for the same reason.

Fierce debates have ignited across the world over the matter, but perhaps the loudest of those, at least in recent times, has taken place in the UK, which last year allegedly compelled Apple to break iCloud&#39;s Advanced Data Protection in a failed pursuit of a so-called encryption backdoor.

Tech folk say E2EE is an absolute. You either have it, or you don&#39;t – there is no such thing as backdooring it. It ceases being &quot;end-to-end&quot; if between those ends is a stop along the way for any approved entities to see what&#39;s being sent.

EU member states are still battling over the controversial &quot;Chat Control&quot; regulation, which recently – following public outcry – removed the mandatory scanning component, although opponents argue the proposals are still not suitably weakened.

Signal and Tuta Mail are two major service providers that threatened to withdraw from countries that implement encryption-busting laws and regulations.

The government said it will follow the EU Commission&#39;s (EC) roadmap for law enforcement data interception, including a section on encryption issues, which it published last year.

&quot;There is an urgent need for a new legal framework for lawful interception which can be used to confront serious crime and security threats,&quot; said justice minister Jim O&#39;Callaghan, announcing the news.

&quot;The new legislation will also include robust legal safeguards to provide continued assurance that the use of such powers is necessary and proportionate.

He said new legislation is &quot;long overdue&quot;, following &quot;significant changes&quot; to digital comms over the past twenty years that &quot;existing legislation does not comprehend.&quot;

Ireland will also take the EU&#39;s lead on spyware, establishing a legal provision for its use, only in cases of strict necessity.

The EC&#39;s 2024 paper [PDF] examining the legality of spyware noted it could be used by member states, but only where situations absolutely require it. Programs must be used proportionally, with a judge&#39;s approval, and with stringent oversight.

The justice ministry said it would take this paper into consideration when developing Ireland&#39;s legal provision for using spyware. Example cases could include accessing data on a device or network, or covert recordings of communications on a device, or over a network, the government said.

In addition to spyware, Ireland is looking to establish a legal power for police to scan electronic equipment in a specific location to identify people of interest and their associates in relation to serious crime investigations. Examples of this technology in action include police camping outside a single location, and operating IMSI catchers to identify those inside.

Olga Cronin, surveillance and human rights senior policy officer at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), said the nonprofit &quot;has very serious concerns about this shopping list of surveillance powers,&quot; despite the proposals still being in their infancy.

&quot;These are surveillance tools and powers of extraordinary reach, with sweeping implications for people&#39;s rights and freedoms, and come in the context of An Garda Síochána already expanding their &#39;eyes and ears&#39; via the Recording Devices Bill,&quot; Cronin added.

The separate but related Recording Devices Bill was introduced in December 2025, proposing expanded police use of biometric recognition technology.

It did not say exactly how this would be implemented, but ministers describing the Bill&#39;s ambitions suggested that both live and retrospective facial recognition could become widely used across Ireland&#39;s police force.

&quot;Once powers of this magnitude are normalised, the damage to rights and freedoms can be extremely difficult to reverse,&quot; said Cronin.

&quot;We must also remember that measures introduced for exceptional or serious crimes tend, over time, to be used for much less serious crimes because there is institutional pressure to use them more frequently. What was once exceptional becomes routine.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft&#39;s January Windows update has delivered another blow for unsuspecting users – apps including Outlook might freeze when saving files to cloud storage services such as OneDrive or Dropbox.

The megacorp acknowledged the latest issue days after releasing an emergency out-of-band update to deal with connection and authentication failures in the Windows App. Yet another fault in the update caused some Windows 11 23H2 PCs to refuse to shut down or hibernate.

According to Microsoft, after installing the January 13 update, &quot;some applications might become unresponsive or experience unexpected errors when opening files from or saving files to cloud-backed storage, such as OneDrive or Dropbox.&quot;

One application is Outlook, which, when combined with a PST (Personal Storage Table) file on OneDrive, &quot;might become unresponsive and fail to reopen unless its process is terminated in Task Manager, or the system is restarted.&quot; Sent emails might also fail to appear.

The workaround for Outlook is to move the PST file out of OneDrive. Putting a PST file in OneDrive is generally not recommended except for backup purposes, though there are plenty of scenarios where users or administrators do so, and changing a workflow due to a bug introduced by an update is not ideal.

Microsoft had already acknowledged a problem with Classic Outlook profiles and POP accounts. The latest addition to its Release Health dashboard indicates the issue is more widespread than thought.

The advice Microsoft dished out to users experiencing the glitch is to &quot;contact the application developer for possible alternative methods of accessing the files.&quot; Microsoft also suggested users left staring at a frozen Outlook could use webmail &quot;if supported by your email provider.&quot;

In the meantime, it added: &quot;We are working on releasing a resolution for this issue as soon as possible. We will provide an update when more information is available.&quot;

This means a sad-faced engineer somewhere in Redmond has likely reset the &quot;days since we broke something in Windows&quot; counter to zero, and we&#39;re not even out of the first month of 2026. ®

            <div id="article-text">Britain&#39;s digital economy minister has sent forth a raft of companies as &quot;ambassadors&quot; to help organizations across the land embrace the UK&#39;s Software Security Code of Practice.

Baroness (in waiting) Liz Lloyd unveiled the scheme in a speech last week that for some reason was not noted by the government&#39;s own press service until yesterday.

Lloyd, a former advisor to the Blair government and chair of trustees for The Tony Blair Governance Initiative, said the benefits of the digital economy and AI could not be realized without confidence in the systems underlying it.

&quot;So software security isn&#39;t just technical. It&#39;s a commercial imperative. And trust is what unlocks growth.&quot;

She said a &quot;government&#39;s first duty is to keep citizens safe,&quot; and in today&#39;s world that includes strong cybersecurity.

British readers will be reassured to hear: &quot;We&#39;re starting in a good place. The UK has some of the strongest cyber defenses globally.&quot; Lloyd pointed out &quot;fast-growing clusters of expertise in Cheltenham and Manchester, as well as Belfast and Scotland&#39;s cyber cluster.&quot;

She also claimed the UK&#39;s cyber sector was the third largest in the world.

But while last year&#39;s Software Security Code of Practice laid the groundwork for software suppliers to help build a more secure supply chain, the government had to move to get the broader message out. Barely a quarter of organizations considered cybersecurity when buying software.

Lloyd noted that some wanted more regulation and oversight to change this, while others took a more laissez-faire approach, leaving it to companies to work it out themselves. &quot;I believe we can be more ambitious than that.&quot;

So the government is looking to &quot;a group of leaders... who are making a public commitment to champion secure software and to be role models for the UK government&#39;s Software Security Code of Practice.&quot;

This will include UK-based software giants such as Sage, and, well, that&#39;s it for UK-based giants. Gateshead&#39;s finest will be joined by Cisco, Palo Alto, and Accenture.

Also playing is NCC Group, ISACA, and ISC2. And UK-based cyber specialists including Cheltenham&#39;s Nexor and Salus, and Zaizi and Hexiosec are on board too. At the customer end are Lloyds and Santander.

Lloyd drew a comparison with the World Health Organization&#39;s 2009 code of practice for hand hygiene, saying it has become a global benchmark &quot;despite not being enforced by law, and has helped to significantly reduce infection rates as hospitals can draw on a single, definitive source of best practice in one place.&quot;

So apparently the aim is to make cybersecurity as easy as washing your hands.

&quot;That&#39;s exactly what we want the Software Security Code of Practice to become,&quot; said Lloyd. ®

            <div id="article-text">Adam Mosseri is just looking for the guy who did this.

Adam Mosseri is just looking for the guy who did this.

A couple of weeks ago, Adam Mosseri posted to his grid. In a series of messages, Instagram’s top exec laid out his concerns for the platform in the coming year, largely around AI. The post was equal parts Working Through It, a sounding of alarms, and a rallying cry to creators who use the platform: AI is about to be everywhere on Instagram, and the best way to stand out from “inauthentic” content is to be an authentic, original voice.

“Everything that made creators matter — the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked — is now accessible to anyone with the right tools,” he says. The people want gritty realness, not glossy fakeness easily duped by AI. Which may be true, but I think Mosseri is missing the point: Instagram is already overrun by robotic, same-y looking content, and it’s not just made by AI. It’s made by humans churning out post after post following the same formula; one designed to keep us scrolling, liking, and sharing.

Throughout his post, Mosseri actually makes a few points I agree with. He mentions that as AI-generated imagery gets more sophisticated and easy to produce, it’ll be easier to label what’s real than to put a watermark on every AI-created image. That’s why Google’s Pixel 10 phones put content credentials on every photo taken with one of its cameras, not just the ones made with AI. Mosseri also mentions that AI will get better at mimicking the low-fi phone camera look that signals authenticity — though I’d argue that’s already happening now, not at some point in the near future. There’s a real threat to Instagram’s business model, even if we disagree on the timeline.

But I have one major problem with his argument. Again and again, Mosseri mentions “authentic” content, implying something human-made versus inauthentic content created by AI. He calls this a “major shift: authenticity is becoming infinitely reproducible.” To be sure, there are plenty of fantastic creators posting great work to Instagram. But a lot of human-made content on Instagram is inauthentic too — and that’s a feature of algorithmic social media, not a bug.

Creators learn what the algorithm rewards, and then they go do more of that thing. Eventually, you get a lot of people posting things that look awfully similar. How else do you end up with two influencers whose vibe is so similar that nobody could tell if it happened by coincidence or if one of them was copying the other? The algorithm rewards whatever keeps us glued to the platform, not the most thought-provoking or original stuff. The algorithm made us the robots. And that inauthentic, predictable human-made content will be the first thing that AI replaces. That’s what AI does at its core: make predictions based on its training data. Mosseri is right to be worried.

I opened Instagram recently to a video of a mom repeatedly counting her kids as she watches them in a public place. “One, two, three,” she nods her head as she accounts for them, then starts again. “Who else does this too? It’s not at all exhausting,” the caption reads. I don’t, but that’s because I only have one to keep track of. But I remembered the video, because I watched it back when she posted it in 2024. The reposting strategy is a direct play to the algorithm — casting the same net again to hook some new followers, or maybe seeing if that particular video lands better in a different time and context. I see the same thing on Threads, where a comedian I follow will try the exact same joke weeks or months after they first posted it to try and catch a different algorithmic wave. Even people posting “authentic” content have to act like robots to win the algorithmic feed.

I don’t think any of this comes as a revelation to Mosseri, though. His post hints that he understands this reality: “Flattering imagery is cheap to produce and boring to consume,” he says. Which, sure. But if Instagram’s first job is to show you fresh content when you open the app and keep you scrolling while you’re there, quantity will always win over quality. You know what’s expensive and time-consuming to produce? Content that “feels real,” the stuff that’s the least sustainable to produce when every influencer is under pressure to become a full-time small business owner of one. Unless Instagram can cook up some brilliant new way to incentivize real creators, I think Mosseri can count on getting more of that inauthentic content — whether it’s made by a human or not.

            <div id="article-text">You’ll soon be able to watch whatever you want side by side.

You’ll soon be able to watch whatever you want side by side.

YouTube TV is getting ready to launch two major updates that will allow you to watch multiple non-sports channels simultaneously, as well as choose from 10 new paid plans focused on a range of topics, including sports, entertainment, and news. In his annual letter to users, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan says both of these changes will arrive “soon.”

YouTube TV has been slowly expanding its multiview feature over the past few years. It introduced multiview for sports broadcasts in 2023 before expanding it to news, weather, and business programming — but only for preselected channels. The platform later started testing the ability for users to customize their multiview experience with a “small group of popular channels.” Now, Mohan says multiview will be “fully customizable,” which means you should be able to watch your favorite football team play alongside something completely different.

Mohan adds that YouTube TV will also roll out a series of plans “designed to give subscribers more control.” YouTube first announced these genre-specific plans in December, and it sounds like they could offer access to a smaller subset of channels that you’ll actually watch, rather than paying for access to YouTube TV’s entire lineup. The YouTube TV Sports plan, for example, will include access to “major broadcasters” and sports networks like FS1, NBC Sports Network, ESPN networks, and ESPN’s streaming service.

There still aren’t any details on how much these packages will cost or when exactly they will arrive, but in December, YouTube said that they will launch “early next year.”

The capability is launching sometime in 2026, though YouTube isn’t sharing details about how it will work.

Your YouTube Shorts feed might soon be filled with a lot more AI-generated content from your favorite creators — including AI-generated versions of the creators themselves. In his annual letter released today, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan says that sometime this year, creators will be able to make Shorts using their “own likeness.”

Mohan didn’t share further details about these likenesses. “We’ll have more to share soon, including the launch date and how the feature will work,” according to YouTube spokesperson Boot Bullwinkle. But the likenesses are part of a growing push from YouTube into AI tools; this year, creators will also be able to use AI to make games with a text prompt (a feature already available in closed beta) and “experiment with music,” Mohan says. YouTube already offers creators tools like an AI chatbot for channel analytics, AI-powered auto-dubbing, and AI-generated video clips for Shorts.

YouTube has also had to reckon with AI slop on its platform, and Mohan’s letter has a brief section dedicated entirely to discussing the topic. “Over the past 20 years, we’ve learned not to impose any preconceived notions on the creator ecosystem,” according to Mohan, but he says that “with this openness comes a responsibility to maintain the high quality viewing experience that people want.” He also says YouTube is “actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.”

Shorts are getting other new features, too. Mohan says that YouTube will be integrating “different formats,” including image posts, “directly into the feed” this year. He reports that Shorts now average “200 billion daily views.”

﻿Acrobat Studio users can edit docs with AI chat prompts, or summarise them as podcasts and presentations.

Adobe has added new generative AI features to Acrobat that aim to help you quickly edit PDFs and summarize them in audio and visual formats. These updates include chat-based editing and the ability to generate personalized podcasts and presentations based on your docs, which are now available in Acrobat Studio — the AI-infused document workspace app that’s distinct from Adobe’s basic PDF reader.

The new Generate Podcast feature provides a podcast-style audio summarization of whatever documents you feed it, including notes, meeting transcriptions, lengthy reports, and educational guides. While Adobe does have its own audio AI model, Generate Podcast currently leverages a Microsoft GPT model for transcription and a Google voice model. Adobe says this may change in the future as it continues to test technologies. Google’s NotebookLM research tool has a similar Audio Overviews feature, though Adobe Acrobat is likely more familiar to anyone who’s worked with PDF documents.

For a more visual summarization, Acrobat Studio users can ask the built-in AI assistant to generate a pitch deck that focuses on specific insights in source documents. The Generate Presentation feature taps into Adobe Express tools to provide a selection of presentation designs. You can select these to automate the entire process, or edit any part of the resulting presentation you’re not happy with.

Acrobat’s AI assistant now also supports editing PDF documents with chat prompts, following a similar update to Express last year. Acrobat Studio users can add signatures, remove pages, text, comments, and images, replace words and phrases, and more by describing the changes they want to make.

It’s the latest game from the studio behind 80 Days and Heaven’s Vault.

We’re living in a pretty great time for detective games. Over the last few years, developers have been experimenting with all kinds of different ways of turning the act of investigation into a compelling game, which has led to the likes of Her Story, Return of the Obra Dinn, and the Golden Idol series, to name just a few. Now you can add TR-49 to that list — a game that builds on the genre by introducing a bizarre code-breaking computer.

Developed by Inkle, the studio behind 80 Days and Heaven’s Vault, TR-49 is confounding from its very first moments. When you start the game you have no idea what’s going on — and neither does your character. You play as a woman who wakes up inside of a church basement with no memory of who she is or how she got down there. In front of you is a strange WWII-era computer. It has a big circular screen and you control it by using the kind of lever more closely associated with factory machinery than high-end computing. Soon, you hear the voice of a man who tells you what you need to do: find a missing book.

To tell you much more about the premise would be to spoil the 1984-esque dystopia that unravels; not that my description would make much sense anyway. TR-49 is a game where discovering the narrative is woven directly into the gameplay. The machine is the only thing you can interact with, and it’s a device packed with information, but the trick is finding it. Each file has an associated code which you have to input to open it. The idea is that by reading through the various files you uncover, you’ll learn new information, which will in turn help you learn new codes for more files.

I found myself poring over documents I didn’t really understand at first, seeking out names and dates that could be relevant, and then trying my luck coming up with a code. You also don’t really need to carry around a notebook as the game keeps track of important people, organizations, and books through a file system you can reference at any point.

Playing TR-49 reminded me a lot of Her Story, a game you interact with by searching for keywords in a police database. In this case, a story starts to reveal itself the more you read and start to piece things together. But there’s another side to TR-49, as it’s also part audio drama. While your character is alone down in the basement, you have a radio that lets you communicate with a man on the outside. It’s mostly one way, as the radio will light up when it’s time to talk. He gives you directions, answers questions, and occasionally gives subtle hints when you’re stuck.

It’s a well-acted drama, and this structure makes the big revelations feel a lot more important than just opening a new file on an ancient computer. It adds a real sense of urgency to a game that is otherwise just inputting numbers. And there’s something very organic and satisfying in the way you reveal the scope of the story bit by bit. It feels almost like you’re uncovering things, rather than them simply being told to you.

And while most of this unfolds naturally, TR-49 does suffer from the same problem as most games in the genre: there’s a good chance you’re going to get stuck. I certainly did. Usually, I just had to take a break and re-read something with fresh eyes, and the clues would jump out at me on a second look. But I also resorted to guesswork a few times, plugging in codes that seemed maybe right, and then hoping for the best. I’m not ashamed to say this typically worked. It helps that it’s a fairly tactile experience, at least on mobile where you rotate dials and pull knobs, so there’s satisfaction in simply using the machine, even if you’re guessing.

Those roadblocks can be frustrating, but at least in my experience I always found a way to get past them, whether it was taking a breath or taking a guess. Either way, TR-49 managed to do what all the best detective games do: make me feel like I was part of the story, piecing it together as I progressed. You just have to be willing to be bewildered before it all pays off.

TR-49 launches January 21st on Steam and iOS.

            <div id="article-text">﻿Zipline’s airborne delivery service is making fans in Texas, with more locales coming soon.

﻿Zipline’s airborne delivery service is making fans in Texas, with more locales coming soon.

On a blustery afternoon late last year, on the lawn just outside City Hall in Rowlett, Texas, a strange-looking craft cleared the trees just before me. It hovered overhead for a moment before lowering a second craft on a thin rope all the way to a parched patch of grass. The little, white thing deposited a brown paper payload, then rode its tether back up to its waiting mothership, which turned and left. The experience lasted less than 30 seconds.

This wasn’t some UFO experience. This was a Zipline drone delivery, out in the real world, and that payload was my lunch. It was just one of the two million such deliveries this company has made since 2016, carrying everything from household supplies in rural America to lifesaving vaccines in remote Africa. And soon, those drone deliveries will be coming to even more places.

Zipline is a California-based company that has only been slinging burritos and other items in the Lone Star State since 2025, but has been proving itself elsewhere in the world for nearly a decade now.

The company first started operations in Rwanda in 2016, delivering medical supplies in minutes to remote locations. Independent studies have shown the lifesaving nature of Zipline’s deliveries, making this the rare startup with a genuine feel-good story at its core.

In Africa, Zipline operates what it calls Platform 1, or P1, aircraft, fixed-wing, uncrewed machines that look like bigger versions of the toys your grandpa built out of balsa in the basement. Workers load four-pound payloads into the belly of these planes, then launch them into the sky via giant slingshot.

Once in the air, the P1s plot their own courses, up to 120 miles round-trip, reading weather data along the route and finding their own way around storms. They then deploy the payload via parachute before returning home for a cargo reload and a battery swap.

The delivery machines used in the US are rather more sophisticated but are likewise autonomous. Called P2, they rely on five motors and can transition midair from hovering to traditional, horizontal flight. This means they can launch and land vertically, or hover over a drop zone. What they give up in efficiency from the P1 (max range here is 24 miles) they gain in flexibility, making them better suited for the sorts of suburban areas Zipline is currently targeting.

The hallmark of the P2 is its tethered buddy, called a Zip. Each Zip has a single motor of its own plus room for an eight-pound payload roughly the size of a breadbox. Its propeller is there in case it needs to fight the wind as it’s lowered from the P2 aircraft hovering above.

The P2 is loaded with redundant sensors, even able to monitor nearby aircraft transponders. The bevy of sensors and smarts onboard means it’s an uncrewed aircraft capable of flying safely even in busy, urban airspace beyond the line of sight, or BVLOS in FAA-speak.

The capabilities of Zipline’s aircraft is proven through a strong safety record with over 125 million miles flown. That’s reassuring, but I was curious how Texans have been responding to this whole thing. After all, this is a state full of people you wouldn’t think would appreciate automated, sensor-laden aircraft hovering over their homes.

“Generally speaking, compared to some things that we picture in our community, there was not as much opposition as you might expect,” Rowlett Mayor Jeff Winget told me. “I think most people were really pretty excited about it.”

Winget told me the approval and permitting process took about five months, helped by Zipline working to keep its footprint minimal.

After receiving my lunch, I swung by one of Zipline’s so-called Zipping Points, where bundles are loaded for delivery. This one happened to be in a Wendy’s parking lot, but they can be quickly and easily deployed wherever pickups are needed.

The Zipping Points are curious contraptions, odd white kiosks with a pair of metal arms reaching for the sky. In theory, these enable retail workers to load in a delivery and walk away. The P2 then hovers overhead, drops its little Zip buddy to retrieve the payload, and then wings off to its hungry recipient.

I say “in theory” because, when I was watching, some deliveries needed a bit of manual help from a small team of Zipline employees dashing between retailers to ensure pickups went smoothly. Some pickups needed a few attempts, but all were on their way quickly enough.

And, crucially, even on a blustery day when drones are typically at their loudest as they fight the wind, the traffic overhead made less noise than the nearby intersection. The P2 hovers high enough overhead while receiving or delivering parcels that it’s honestly hard to hear, far less noticeable than your average consumer drone.

While Mayor Winget said the feedback he receives from constituents is incredibly positive, the relatively low noise pollution should help keep everything copacetic as the service continues to expand. Still, there have been some less positive reactions to the rollout.

John Erik Ege, the state director of the Texas branch of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), said there have been a few reports from concerned citizens since Zipline began operating in Texas. One, filed in September, described a strange hovering object that lowered something that traveled straight down, then “re-docked” before disappearing.

He also told me of someone else who reported a similar “mother ship” deploying a smaller object straight down. “She was frustrated that folks at work and friends ridiculed her. This is unfortunate. She did actually witness something,” Ege said.

That something, of course, was a delivery drone. This is hardly a repeat of last year’s New Jersey drone scare, but MUFON representatives in Houston and Phoenix would do well to prepare. Those two cities will be next to receive Zipline service over the next few months.

And how was my lunch? I must confess, it was fresher and hotter than any burrito delivery I’ve ever received, a noticeable step above what I’m used to from myriad terrestrial food delivery services. Ordering through the Zipline app was no more complicated than Uber Eats. My burrito had a delivery fee of $0.99, plus a 20-percent service fee (that’s capped at $6). And no, you don’t need to tip the drone. If you’re not feeling Chipotle, you can currently place orders through Blaze Pizza, Buffalo Wild Wings, Crumbl, Little Caesars, Walmart, and Wendy’s.

In the retail drone delivery space, Zipline’s primary competitor is Alphabet’s Wing, which also works with Walmart. While Wing has managed an impressive 750,000 deliveries, that’s fewer than half of Zipline’s tally. Amazon Prime Air, meanwhile, recently suspended its testing after a pair of crashes. For the moment, nobody looks set to challenge Zipline’s early lead, especially as it expands into Houston and Phoenix. That lead just netted the company a $7.6 billion valuation in its most recent $600 million raise.

Yes, this is yet another attack by robots on human jobs, but honestly it’s one I can get behind. In a town like Rowlett, if you get food delivered, it’s going to come to you by car, and the idea of a human being driving a 4,000-pound vehicle to carry a burrito in a paper bag is just a bit excessive.

At Davos this year Trump is dominating all the side conversations. There are lots of little jokes. Nervous laughter. Outright anger. Fear in the eyes. It’s wild. The US president is due to speak here today, amid threats of seizing Greenland and fears that he’s about to permanently fracture the NATO alliance.

But Trump isn’t the only game in town—everyone’s also talking about AI. Read Mat’s story to find out more.

A number of startups and university teams that are building “AI scientists” to design and run experiments in the lab, including robot biologists and chemists, have just won extra funding from the UK government agency that funds moonshot R&D.

The competition, set up by ARIA (the Advanced Research and Invention Agency), gives a clear sense of how fast this technology is moving: The agency received 245 proposals from research teams that are already building tools capable of automating increasing amounts of lab work. Read the full story to learn more.

—Cathy Li is head of the Centre for AI Excellence at the World Economic Forum

Governments plan to pour $1.3 trillion into AI infrastructure by 2030 to invest in “sovereign AI,” with the premise being that countries should be in control of their own AI capabilities. The funds include financing for domestic data centers, locally trained models, independent supply chains, and national talent pipelines. This is a response to real shocks: covid-era supply chain breakdowns, rising geopolitical tensions, and the war in Ukraine. But the pursuit of absolute autonomy is running into reality: AI supply chains are irreducibly global. If sovereignty is to remain meaningful, it must shift from defensive self-reliance to a vision that balances national autonomy with strategic partnership. Read the full story.

Thanks to genetic science, gene editing, and techniques like cloning, it’s now possible to move DNA through time, studying genetic information in ancient remains and then re-creating it in the bodies of modern beings. And that, scientists say, offers new ways to try to help endangered species, engineer new plants that resist climate change, or even create new human medicines.

Hello from the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. I’ve been here for two days now, attending meetings, speaking on panels, and basically trying to talk to anyone I can. And as far as I can tell, the only things anyone wants to talk about are AI, and Trump.

Davos is physically defined by the Congress Center, where the official WEF sessions take place, and the Promenade, a street running through the center of the town lined with various “houses”—mostly retailers that are temporarily converted into meeting hubs for various corporate or national sponsors. So there is a Ukraine House, a Brazil House, Saudi House, and yes, a USA House (more on that tomorrow). There are a handful of media houses from the likes of CNBC and The Wall Street Journal. Some houses are devoted to specific topics, for example there’s one for science and another for AI.

But like everything else in 2026, the Promenade is dominated by tech companies. At one point I realized that literally everything I could see, in a spot where the road bends a bit, was a tech company house. Palantir, Workday, Infosys, Cloudflare, C3.ai. Maybe this should go without saying, but their presence, both in the houses and on the various stages and parties and platforms here at the World Economic Forum, really drove home to me how utterly and completely tech has captured the global economy.

While the houses host events and serve as networking hubs, the big show is inside the Congress Center. On Tuesday morning, I kicked off my official Davos experience there by moderating a panel with the CEOs of Accenture, Aramco, Royal Philips and Visa. The topic was scaling up AI within organizations. All of these leaders represented companies that have gone from pilot projects to large internal implementations. It was, for me, a fascinating conversation. You can watch the whole thing here, but my takeaway was that while there are plenty of stories about AI being overhyped (including from us), it is certainly having substantive effects at large companies.

Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, for example, described how that company has found $3-5 billion in cost savings by improving the efficiency of its operations. Royal Philips CEO Roy Jakobs described how it was allowing healthcare practitioners to spend more time with patients by doing things such as automated note-taking. (This really resonated with me as my wife is a pediatrics nurse, and for decades now I’ve heard her talk about how much of her time is devoted to charting.) And Visa CEO Ryan McInerney talked about that company’s push into agentic commerce and the way that will play out for consumers, small businesses, and the global payments industry.

To elaborate a little on that point, McInerney painted a picture of commerce where agents won’t just shop for things you ask them to, which will be basically step one, but will eventually be able to shop for things based on your preferences and previous spending patterns. This could be your regular grocery shopping, or even a vacation getaway. That’s going to require a lot of trust and authentication to protect both merchants and consumers, but it is clear that the steps into agentic commerce we saw in 2025 were just baby ones. There are much bigger ones coming for 2026. (Coincidentally, I had a discussion with a senior executive from Mastercard on Monday, who made several of the same points.)

But the thing that really resonated with me from the panel was something Accenture CEO Julie Sweet—who has a view not only of her own large org but across a spectrum of companies—said: “It’s hard to trust something until you understand it.”

I felt like that neatly summed up where we are as a society with AI.

Clearly other people feel the same. Before the official start of the conference I was at AI House for a panel. The place was packed. There was a consistent, massive line to get in, and once inside I literally had to muscle my way through the crowd. Everyone wanted to get in. Everyone wanted to talk about AI.

(A quick aside on what I was doing there: I sat on a panel on “Creativity and Identity in the Age of Memes and Deepfakes” led by Atlantic CEO Nicholas Thompson, featuring the artist Emi Kusano who works with AI, and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator for SAG-AFTRA, who has been at the center over a lot of the debates about AI in the film and gaming industries. I’m not going to spend much time describing it because I’m already running long, but it was a rip-roarer of a panel. Check it out.)

The President is due here Wednesday, amid threats of seizing Greenland and fears that he’s about to permanently fracture the NATO alliance. While AI is all over the stages, Trump is dominating all the side conversations. There are lots of little jokes. Nervous laughter. Outright anger. Fear in the eyes. It’s wild.

These conversations are also starting to spill out into the public conversations. Just after my panel on Tuesday, I headed to a pavilion outside the main hall in the Congress Center. I saw someone coming down the stairs with a small entourage, who was suddenly mobbed by cameras and phones.

Moments earlier in the same spot, the press had been surrounding David Beckham, shouting questions at him. So I was primed for it to be another celebrity – after all captains of industry were everywhere you looked. I mean, I had just bumped into Eric Schmidt, who was literally standing in line in front of me at the coffee bar. Davos is weird.

But in fact, it was Gavin Newsom, the governor of California who is increasingly seen as the leading voice of the Democratic opposition to President Trump, and a likely contender, or even frontrunner, in the race to replace him. Because I live in San Francisco I’ve encountered Newsom many times, dating back to his early days as a city supervisor before he was even mayor. I’ve rarely, rarely, seen him quite so worked up as he was on Tuesday.

Among other things, he called Trump a narcissist who follows “the law of the jungle, the rule of Don” and compared him to a T-Rex, saying “you mate with him or he devours you.” And he was just as harsh on the world leaders, many of whom are gathered in Davos, calling them “pathetic” and saying he should have brought knee pads for them.

There was more of this sentiment, if in more measured tones, from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney during his address at Davos. While I missed his remarks, they had people talking. “If we&#39;re not at the table, we&#39;re on the menu,” he argued.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

The Cybertruck, sycophantic AI, and humanoid robots all made this year’s list of the biggest technology failures.

            <h2>Reimagining ERP for the agentic AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/20/1129965/reimagining-erp-for-the-agentic-ai-era/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The story of enterprise resource planning (ERP) is really a story of businesses learning to organize themselves around the latest, greatest technology of the times. In the 1960s through the ’80s, mainframes, material requirements planning (MRP), and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) brought core business data from file cabinets to centralized systems. Client-server architectures defined the ’80s and ’90s, taking digitization mainstream during the internet’s infancy. And in the 21st century, as work moved beyond the desktop, SaaS and cloud ushered in flexible access and elastic infrastructure.

The rise of composability and agentic AI marks yet another dawn—and an apt one for the nascent intelligence age. Composable architectures let organizations assemble capabilities from multiple systems in a mix-and-match fashion, so they can swap vendor gridlock for an à la carte portfolio of fit-for-purpose modules. On top of that architectural shift, agentic AI enables coordination across systems that weren’t originally designed to talk to one another.

Early indicators suggest that AI-enabled ERP will yield meaningful performance gains: One 2024 study found that organizations implementing AI-driven ERP solutions stand to gain around a 30% boost in user satisfaction and a 25% lift in productivity; another suggested that AI-driven ERP can lead to processing time savings of up to 45%, as well as improvements in decision accuracy to the tune of 60%.

These dual advancements address long-standing gaps that previous ERP eras fell short of delivering: freedom to innovate outside of vendor roadmaps, capacity for rapid iteration, and true interoperability across all critical functions. This shift signals the end of monolithic dependency as well as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for early movers to gain a competitive edge.

            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/20/1130911/the-era-of-agentic-chaos-and-how-data-will-save-us/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI agents are moving beyond coding assistants and customer service chatbots into the operational core of the enterprise. The ROI is promising, but autonomy without alignment is a recipe for chaos. Business leaders need to lay the essential foundations now.

Agents are independently handling end-to-end processes across lead generation, supply chain optimization, customer support, and financial reconciliation. A mid-sized organization could easily run 4,000 agents, each making decisions that affect revenue, compliance, and customer experience.

The transformation toward an agent-driven enterprise is inevitable. The economic benefits are too significant to ignore, and the potential is becoming a reality faster than most predicted. The problem? Most businesses and their underlying infrastructure are not prepared for this shift. Early adopters have found unlocking AI initiatives at scale to be extremely challenging.

Companies are investing heavily in AI, but the returns aren&#39;t materializing. According to recent research from Boston Consulting Group, 60% of companies report minimal revenue and cost gains despite substantial investment. However, the leaders reported they achieved five times the revenue increases and three times the cost reductions. Clearly, there is a massive premium for being a leader.

What separates the leaders from the pack isn&#39;t how much they&#39;re spending or which models they&#39;re using. Before scaling AI deployment, these “future-built” companies put critical data infrastructure capabilities in place. They invested in the foundational work that enables AI to function reliably.

To understand how and where enterprise AI can fail, consider four critical quadrants: models, tools, context, and governance.

Take a simple example: an agent that orders you pizza. The model interprets your request (&quot;get me a pizza&quot;). The tool executes the action (calling the Domino&#39;s or Pizza Hut API). Context provides personalization (you tend to order pepperoni on Friday nights at 7pm). Governance validates the outcome (did the pizza actually arrive?).

Each dimension represents a potential failure point:

This framework helps diagnose where reliability gaps emerge. When an enterprise agent fails, which quadrant is the problem? Is the model misunderstanding intent? Are the tools unavailable or broken? Is the context incomplete or contradictory? Or is there no mechanism to verify that the agent did what it was supposed to do?

The temptation is to think that reliability will simply improve as models improve. Yet, model capability is advancing exponentially. The cost of inference has dropped nearly 900 times in three years, hallucination rates are on the decline, and AI’s capacity to perform long tasks doubles every six months.

Tooling is also accelerating. Integration frameworks like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) make it dramatically easier to connect agents with enterprise systems and APIs.

If models are powerful and tools are maturing, then what is holding back adoption?

To borrow from James Carville, “It is the data, stupid.” The root cause of most misbehaving agents is misaligned, inconsistent, or incomplete data.

Enterprises have accumulated data debt over decades. Acquisitions, custom systems, departmental tools, and shadow IT have left data scattered across silos that rarely agree. Support systems do not match what is in marketing systems. Supplier data is duplicated across finance, procurement, and logistics. Locations have multiple representations depending on the source.

Drop a few agents into this environment, and they will perform wonderfully at first, because each one is given a curated set of systems to call. Add more agents and the cracks grow, as each one builds its own fragment of truth.

This dynamic has played out before. When business intelligence became self-serve, everyone started creating dashboards. Productivity soared, reports failed to match. Now imagine that phenomenon not in static dashboards, but in AI agents that can take action. With agents, data inconsistency produces real business consequences, not just debates among departments.

Companies that build unified context and robust governance can deploy thousands of agents with confidence, knowing they&#39;ll work together coherently and comply with business rules. Companies that skip this foundational work will watch their agents produce contradictory results, violate policies, and ultimately erode trust faster than they create value.

The question for enterprises centers on organizational readiness. Will your company prepare the data foundation needed to make agent transformation work? Or will you spend years debugging agents, one issue at a time, forever chasing problems that originate in infrastructure you never built?

Autonomous agents are already transforming how work gets done. But the enterprise will only experience the upside if those systems operate from the same truth. This ensures that when agents reason, plan, and act, they do so based on accurate, consistent, and up-to-date information.

The companies generating value from AI today have built on fit-for-purpose data foundations. They recognized early that in an agentic world, data functions as essential infrastructure. A solid data foundation is what turns experimentation into dependable operations.

At Reltio, the focus is on building that foundation. The Reltio data management platform unifies core data from across the enterprise, giving every agent immediate access to the same business context. This unified approach enables enterprises to move faster, act smarter, and unlock the full value of AI.

Agents will define the future of the enterprise. Context intelligence will determine who leads it.

            <h2>The UK government is backing AI that can run its own lab experiments</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/20/1131462/the-uk-government-is-backing-ai-scientists-that-can-run-their-own-experiments/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A number of startups and university teams that are building “AI scientists” to design and run experiments in the lab, including robot biologists and chemists, have just won extra funding from the UK government agency that supports moonshot R&D. The competition, set up by ARIA (the Advanced Research and Invention Agency), gives a clear sense of how fast this technology is moving: The agency received 245 proposals from researchers who are already developing tools that can automate significant stretches of lab work.

ARIA defines an AI scientist as a system that can run an entire scientific workflow, coming up with hypotheses, designing and running experiments to test those hypotheses, and then analyzing the results. In many cases, the system may then feed those results back into itself and run the loop again and again. Human scientists become overseers, coming up with the initial research questions and then letting the AI scientist get on with the grunt work.

“There are better uses for a PhD student than waiting around in a lab until 3 a.m. to make sure an experiment is run to the end,” says Ant Rowstron, ARIA’s chief technology officer.

ARIA picked 12 projects to fund from the 245 proposals, doubling the amount of funding it had intended to allocate because of the large number and high quality of submissions. Half the teams are from the UK; the rest are from the US and Europe. Some of the teams are from universities, some from industry. Each will get around £500,000 (around $675,000) to cover nine months’ work. At the end of that time, they should be able to demonstrate that their AI scientist was able to come up with novel findings.

Winning teams include Lila Sciences, a US company that is building what it calls an AI nano-scientist—a system that will design and run experiments to discover the best ways to compose and process quantum dots, which are nanometer-scale semiconductor particles used in medical imaging, solar panels, and QLED TVs.

“We are using the funds and time to prove a point,” says Rafa Gómez-Bombarelli, chief science officer for physical sciences at Lila: “The grant lets us design a real AI robotics loop around a focused scientific problem, generate evidence that it works, and document the playbook so others can reproduce and extend it.”

Another team, from the University of Liverpool, UK, is building a robot chemist, which runs multiple experiments at once and uses a vision language model to help troubleshoot when the robot makes an error.

And a startup based in London, still in stealth mode, is developing an AI scientist called ThetaWorld, which is using LLMs to design experiments on the physical and chemical interactions that are important for the performance of batteries. Those experiments will then be run in an automated lab.

Compared with the £5 million projects spanning two or three years that ARIA usually funds, £500,000 is small change. But that was the idea, says Rowstron: It’s an experiment on ARIA’s part too. By funding a range of projects for a short amount of time, the agency is taking the temperature at the cutting edge to determine how the way science is done is changing, and how fast. What it learns will become the baseline for funding future large-scale projects.

Rowstron acknowledges there’s a lot of hype, especially now that most of the top AI companies have teams focused on science. When results are shared by press release and not peer review, it can be hard to know what the technology can and can’t do. “That’s always a challenge for a research agency trying to fund the frontier,” he says. “To do things at the frontier, we&#39;ve got to know what the frontier is.”

For now, the cutting edge involves agentic systems calling up other existing tools on the fly. “They’re running things like large language models to do the ideation, and then they use other models to do optimization and run experiments,” says Rowstron. “And then they feed the results back round.”

Rowstron sees the technology stacked in tiers. At the bottom are AI tools designed by humans for humans, such as AlphaFold. These tools let scientists leapfrog slow and painstaking parts of the scientific pipeline but can still require many months of lab work to verify results. The idea of an AI scientist is to automate that work too.

An AI scientist sits in a layer above those human-made tools and calls on them as needed, says Rowstron. “There’s a point in time—and I don’t think it’s a decade away—where that AI scientist layer says, ‘I need a tool and it doesn’t exist,’ and it will actually create an AlphaFold kind of tool just on the way to figuring out how to solve another problem. That whole bottom zone will just be automated.”

But we&#39;re not there yet, he says. All the projects ARIA is now funding involve systems that call on existing tools rather than spin up new ones.

There are also unsolved problems with agentic systems in general, which limits how long they can run by themselves without going off the rails and making errors. For example, a study, titled “Why LLMs aren’t scientists yet,” posted online last week by researchers at Lossfunk, an AI lab based in India, reports that in an experiment to get LLM agents to run a scientific workflow to completion, the system failed three out of four times. According to the researchers, the reasons the LLMs broke down included “deviation from original research specifications toward simpler, more familiar solutions” and “overexcitement that declares success despite obvious failures.”

“Obviously, at the moment these tools are still fairly early in their cycle and these things might plateau,” says Rowstron. “I’m not expecting them to win a Nobel Prize.”

“But there is a world where some of these tools will force us to operate so much quicker,” he continues. “And if we end up in that world, it’s super important for us to be ready.”

Using Aadhaar as the bedrock, Nilekani and people working with him went on to build a sprawling collection of free, interoperating online tools that add up to nothing less than a digital infrastructure for society, covering government services, banking, and health care. They offer convenience and access that would be eye-popping in wealthy countries a tenth of India’s size.

Many Americans agree that it’s acceptable to screen embryos for severe genetic diseases. Far fewer say it’s okay to test for characteristics related to a future child’s appearance, behavior, or intelligence. But a few startups are now advertising what they claim is a way to do just that.

This new kind of testing—which can cost up to $50,000—is incredibly controversial. Nevertheless, the practice has grown popular in Silicon Valley, and it’s becoming more widely available to everyone. Read the full story.

On the outskirts of Charlottesville, Virginia, a new kind of sugar factory is taking shape. The facility is being developed by a startup called Bonumose. It uses a processed corn product called maltodextrin that is found in many junk foods and is calorically similar to table sugar (sucrose).

But for Bonumose, maltodextrin isn’t an ingredient—it’s a raw material. When it’s poured into the company’s bioreactors, what emerges is tagatose. Found naturally in small concentrations in fruit, some grains, and milk, it is nearly as sweet as sucrose but apparently with only around half the calories, and wider health benefits.

Bonumose’s process originated in a company spun out of the Virginia Tech lab of Yi-Heng “Percival” Zhang. When MIT Technology Review spoke to Zhang, he was sitting alone in an empty lab in Tianjin, China, after serving a two-year sentence of supervised release in Virginia for conspiracy to defraud the US government, making false statements, and obstruction of justice. If sugar is the new oil, the global battle to control it has already begun. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Berlin’s energy transition sector got a defining boost today as Cloover, a climate fintech based in Berlin, announced it has secured more than $1.2 billion in total capital commitments, combining Series A equity and a substantial debt facility to accelerate the rollout of its software and financing platform across Europe.

The financing package includes €18.8 million (approximately $22 million) in Series A equity, led by MMC Ventures and QED Investors, with participation from Lowercarbon Capital, BNVT Capital, Bosch Ventures, Centrotec, and Earthshot Ventures.

Alongside that, a €1.02 billion debt facility provided by a major European bank will be deployed directly as customer and installer financing through Cloover’s platform, backed by a €300 million guarantee from the European Investment Fund to support scalable, low-cost lending for clean energy projects.

For a company that only a few years ago was in seed-stage fundraising, the scale of these commitments marks a striking shift. The debt element is operational capital designed to help manufacturers, installers, and homeowners finance solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and other distributed energy technologies under a single unified system.

Cloover was founded in 2023 by Jodok Betschart, Peder Broms, and Valentin Gönczy, who arrived at the idea after interviewing hundreds of installers across Europe and hearing the same frustrations: fragmented software stacks, manual processes, and limited access to project financing. They saw a structural gap in the energy transition; demand for decentralised power had surged, but the financing and platform infrastructure to scale it weren’t keeping pace.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

That gap is what Cloover’s platform intends to close. At its core is an integrated operating system that combines workflow management, procurement, financing, energy optimisation, and risk analytics into one environment that serves all parts of the distributed energy value chain. Installers can offer financing at the point of sale, streamline operations, and reduce administrative drag.

Homeowners, in turn, gain access to installations with lower upfront costs and financing terms linked to projected energy savings rather than traditional credit scoring.

Some investors now call Cloover the “Shopify for energy”, a digital backbone that supports the entire process of deploying distributed energy systems at scale. The model is built around scalable capital deployment combined with end-to-end software automation, including AI-driven tools for underwriting and operations.
The timing of this financing is noteworthy.

Across Europe, demand for residential solar and decentralised energy solutions is accelerating as regulatory pressure, rising electricity prices, and broader electrification trends push households and businesses toward clean alternatives. Yet installers often struggle with financing bottlenecks. Cloover’s platform embeds capital directly into the sales workflow, turning financing from a hurdle into a built-in feature.

In a statement, CEO Jodok Betschart framed the new financing as a way to enable energy independence without the friction of upfront costs or complex loan applications, noting that the company’s AI operating system connects stakeholders across the value chain.

For European climate tech and energy markets, the scale of Cloover’s backing is remarkable. Few startups in this space have bridged software infrastructure and finance at this magnitude, and the size of the debt commitment signals deep lender confidence in distributed energy as a growth asset class.

It sets a potential precedent for how renewable energy projects can be financed and adopted more quickly across the region, something both policymakers and industry leaders have identified as essential to meeting the EU’s climate goals.

            <h2>When corporate knowledge becomes invaluable</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/when-corporate-knowledge-becomes-invaluable">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">To many readers, this may sound like a paradox: how can knowledge ever become invaluable?

In this article, I want to explore how corporate knowledge, when poorly structured and rigidly transferred, can slowly transform from an asset into a disadvantage. Not only for companies, but especially for employees. And over time, that disadvantage compounds.

The journey usually looks familiar. You apply for a job, speak with a recruiter, send your CV, go through interviews, and eventually receive the green-light email: “Congratulations, you’re hired.”

This moment takes us directly to the real turning point: the onboarding process.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Those first one, two, sometimes even three months when you are introduced to the people, the tools, the workflows, the strategies, and the “way things are done.” On paper, onboarding exists to accelerate integration and performance. In reality, in many corporations, it quietly becomes an indoctrination phase.

Relatable to anyone who has worked in large organizations, onboarding often shifts from enabling understanding to enforcing conformity. New hires are not only taught what the company knows, but also what the company no longer questions.

This is where corporate knowledge starts becoming invaluable.

Because instead of acting as a foundation to build on, it becomes a ceiling.

It tells you what to do, how to do it, and more importantly, what not to rethink. Over time, this “do according to the manual” culture doesn’t just standardize execution. It standardizes thinking. And standardized thinking is the natural enemy of innovation.

History shows us a consistent pattern: breakthroughs rarely come from the center of an industry. They come from the edges.

Elon Musk was not an automotive executive. He treated cars as computers on wheels and energy systems. The result? An entire industry forced to reset its assumptions.

Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp were not transportation insiders. They were technologists. They saw GPS-enabled phones, invisible payments, and drivers that didn’t need to be owned. They reframed taxis not as a fleet problem, but as a software and trust problem. And the taxi industry, as it existed, effectively ended.

These examples point to a simple truth: transformative ideas usually emerge from new mental models, not from perfected manuals.

Yet most onboarding processes are designed to remove new mental models as quickly as possible.

They don’t ask: “What do you see that we no longer notice?”
 They ask: “How fast can you adapt to how we already work?”

Most programs teach tools, not systems. New hires learn where to click, not how to think. They are trained on CRMs, scripts, workflows, and reporting routines, but not on AI-assisted decision-making, signal-based prospecting, or how to design work alongside automated agents.

As a result, organizations scale activity instead of intelligence.

Even worse, onboarding still assumes that humans should work like software: following rigid processes, filling manual reports, executing predefined sequences. Instead of being taught how to orchestrate software, delegate to AI, and concentrate on judgment, creativity, and relationships.

Over time, this creates a paradoxical outcome: the more “knowledge” an organization accumulates, the harder it becomes for new ideas to survive inside it.

And when knowledge can no longer be challenged, recombined, or re-imagined, it stops being knowledge.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a Davos dominated by talk of tariffs, subsidies, and geopolitical risk, Europe used the stage to question its own economic limits. At the World Economic Forum, Ursula von der Leyen put forward one of the clearest signals yet that the European Union is preparing a structural shift in how it treats business, competitiveness, and economic power.

The phrase that stuck, “Europe Inc”, is not the name of a regulation, nor a new Brussels invention ready to roll out. It is a political framing for a shift that the European Commission wants to accelerate.

What Europe Inc actually refers to is an idea long discussed in EU policy circles and now pushed into the spotlight: the so-called 28th regime. An optional, EU-wide corporate framework that would sit alongside national systems and allow companies to operate across the bloc under a single legal structure.

The problem it is meant to solve is real and well-documented. Europe has a single market in theory, but in practice, companies still face 27 different company laws, registration processes, capital requirements, and administrative timelines. Startups incorporate in one country, then struggle to expand. Scaleups hit legal friction. Many leave.

The Commission’s answer is simplification through centralisation. Under the proposed 28th regime, entrepreneurs would be able to set up a company digitally, once and use that structure across the EU. One registration, one legal form, one set of rules. The ambition presented at Davos goes further: company creation within 48 hours, fully online.

That figure matters. It is also where political ambition risks being read as immediate reality.

The 48-hour setup is not in force. It is a target attached to a proposal that still needs to be formally drafted, negotiated, and approved by both the European Parliament and member states. Nothing in current EU law allows this yet. What exists is intent, not implementation.

Von der Leyen was explicit about why this push is happening now. Global conditions have hardened. Trade is increasingly weaponised. Industrial policy has returned, unapologetically, in the US and China.

Supply chain shocks and energy crises exposed Europe’s vulnerabilities. In that environment, regulatory fragmentation stops being a technical issue and becomes a strategic one.

Europe Inc is Brussels admitting that rules alone do not build power. Scale does. There is also a political recalibration underway. The EU has traditionally defined itself as a regulator first, a market shaper second.

The message from Davos suggests a change in emphasis: competitiveness, capital mobilisation, and strategic autonomy are moving closer to the centre of EU policymaking.

Still, limits remain. The 28th regime, as currently described, would be optional. It would not harmonise taxation overnight. Labour law, insolvency rules, and social policy remain largely national domains. Europe Inc would coexist with national systems, not replace them.

That coexistence is both its strength and its risk. Optional frameworks can attract fast-growing companies, but they can also deepen a two-speed Europe if not carefully designed. This tension is not resolved yet.

What Davos revealed is not a finished Europe Inc, but a Commission willing to say openly that Europe’s economic model, as it stands, is too slow for the world it operates in. Whether Europe Inc becomes a meaningful tool or another unrealised promise will depend less on slogans and more on legislation, compromise, and political courage across 27 capitals.

For now, Europe Inc is best understood as a warning shot. Europe intends to compete as a bloc, not as a collection of administrative borders. The clock, as von der Leyen implied, is already running.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/odoo-tops-7-billion-valuation">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian business software company Odoo, also a unicorn, has reached a fresh milestone. Growth investor General Atlantic has increased its stake in the firm, buying additional shares from regional backer Wallonie Entreprendre and pushing Odoo’s valuation to roughly €7 billion.

This move isn’t a typical funding round where a company raises new capital. Instead, it’s a secondary transaction: General Atlantic bought existing shares that were previously held by Wallonie Entreprendre, the investment arm of Belgium’s Walloon region. After the deal, Wallonie Entreprendre still holds about 3 % of the company.

Odoo was founded in 2002 in Belgium and has grown steadily from a small project into a global software platform. It offers an integrated suite of business applications used by small and medium-sized enterprises for everything from finance and sales to HR and marketing.

The software is built on an open-core model that encourages developers around the world to build add-on apps, creating a vast ecosystem of nearly 40,000 extensions.

Today, Odoo counts more than 170,000 paying customers in around 180 countries. That global footprint and the steady revenue growth it has delivered helped convince General Atlantic to deepen its involvement.

Since first investing in the company in 2023, the firm has supported Odoo’s expansion into new markets and helped refine its commercial strategy.

Part of what makes this update noteworthy is how Odoo has expanded its product offerings. Its newest versions include AI-infused features and automation tools that make the suite more attractive to businesses looking to replace outdated, fragmented systems with a single, unified digital platform.

For the European tech scene, this development highlights a shift in how successful software companies grow and attract capital. Rather than chasing quick exits or IPOs, some founders are choosing secondary share deals to let early investors realise gains while keeping strategic control.

That path can make it easier for companies to stay private longer and focus on building value over time.

I don’t know what is happening in Belgium or what they are having for breakfast, but the country itself has quietly become a place where software businesses can scale internationally.

Odoo is one of its standout success stories, showing that strong product focus, community-driven development, and global reach can win serious backing from major growth investors.

            <div id="article-text">For a long time, tech events were built around scale. The bigger the crowd, the stronger the perception of success. Attendance numbers became a proxy for impact, and festivals grew year after year because that was what the industry expected.

That model no longer fits how tech leaders work today.

Over the past years, I have spent time in conversations with founders, executives, and operators who carry real responsibility inside their organizations. As a community builder, I often speak with them before they commit to attending events. Their questions are direct. They want to know who will be in the room, how discussions are structured, and whether the environment allows honest exchange.

Almost none of them ask how many people will attend.

This is a meaningful signal. Leaders who run companies do not optimize for visibility. They already have it. They want rooms where time leads to insight, clarity, and decisions.

As CEO of Tekpon AI Summit, I have had a front row seat to how decision makers actually want to engage today. I have watched what happens on large stages. I have also watched what happens when ten relevant people sit around one table with no audience and no agenda beyond honest discussion.

The difference in outcome is hard to ignore. In small rooms, people speak openly. They share challenges they would never publish. They explore partnerships without formalities. They make decisions faster because trust forms naturally when everyone present has earned their place in the conversation.

In larger settings, the dynamic changes. Conversations stay cautious. Stories become polished. The real questions are postponed, usually for later. Later often disappears into busy schedules.

Large conferences still play a role. They introduce new voices to the ecosystem. They create energy. They give exposure to early-stage founders. That contribution remains valuable.

But they are no longer where serious business gets done.

The work that shapes companies happens in environments where attention is protected and trust forms quickly. Where people can speak without performing. Where context is shared. Where participants know that what is said in the room stays in the room. These conditions are difficult to build at a mass scale and natural in small, curated settings.

This has already changed how senior decision makers allocate their time. Many are reducing their presence at large events. They are choosing closed discussions, private dinners, and carefully selected gatherings where every participant has a reason to be there. They are not rejecting conferences. They are rejecting formats that do not respect their attention.

The industry is slow to react to this shift. Event strategies still chase attendance growth, sponsorship volume, and social media reach. Meanwhile, the people shaping companies are quietly changing their behavior. They are voting with their calendars.

This gap will continue to widen. Events that optimize for volume will struggle to attract senior leaders. Once you see this up close, it becomes hard to unsee. The criteria for choosing where to meet have changed. Not loudly, not publicly, but consistently.

Some will still chase scale. Others will keep building large festivals and broad platforms. There is nothing wrong with that. But the people shaping companies are already making different choices. They are selecting rooms where conversations move faster, trust forms naturally, and time feels respected.

That is where tech leaders now choose to meet.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/sequoia-joins-anthropics-25b-funding-round">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Venture capital powerhouse Sequoia Capital is preparing to invest in Anthropic, the AI startup best known for its Claude family of large language models, in one of the largest private funding rounds in tech this year. The deal is being led by Singapore’s GIC and U.S. investor Coatue, each contributing roughly $1.5 billion, as part of a planned raise of $25 billion or more at a staggering $350 billion valuation.

This move stands out for two reasons: the size and speed of the valuation surge and the fact that Sequoia, already an investor in rival AI builders such as OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, is broadening its exposure across competing AI platforms.

Traditionally, top-tier VC firms have avoided backing direct competitors simultaneously. The logic was simple: protect information flows and avoid internal conflicts of interest. Sequoia’s willingness to back Anthropic despite existing stakes in other AI outfits signals a shift in how investors view the AI market. It reflects a belief that the sector is large enough to support multiple winners rather than requiring firms to choose a single champion.

Anthropic itself has grown quickly since its founding by former OpenAI researchers. Industry reporting shows the company has attracted significant talent from established AI labs and introduced advanced models and enterprise features, contributing to its rapid valuation climb over the past year.

A $350 billion valuation, even before a public listing, is eye-watering. It resets expectations for what private AI companies can command and puts pressure on competitors to secure equally large capital backing or risk falling behind. Analysts suggest that few AI firms may go public at these valuations, pointing instead to continued private rounds or alternative exit strategies if market sentiment shifts.

That dynamic is a symptom of a broader trend: a global AI capital rush that has persisted even amid concerns about a bust cycle or a funding slowdown in other tech segments. Investors remain convinced that AI will reshape industries from software to logistics, health care, and beyond, and are willing to deploy extraordinary sums to secure influence in that future.

For European markets and founders, the Sequoia-Anthropic deal carries both opportunities and warnings. Europe has strong academic AI talent, an active startup ecosystem, and deep expertise in areas like robotics, industrial automation, and data privacy.

Yet venture capital density still trails the U.S., and marquee AI funding rounds of this scale are rare on the continent.
This investment could accelerate European interest in AI startups, drawing more attention and potentially more capital into the region.

It reinforces the idea that global capital flows are not limited by geography and that talent mobility, not territory, increasingly defines the AI race. European AI talent has been moving among global hubs, and deals like this underline how strongly competitive pressures are shaping that movement.

At the same time, the concentration of huge capital in a few dominant players raises strategic questions for European policymakers and investors. If global valuations continue to centralise power and resources in U.S. and Asia-based AI giants, Europe’s AI initiatives may struggle to build regional champions with equivalent scale.

Efforts to foster AI ecosystems, from regulatory clarity to public funding mechanisms, will be tested in the face of such capital dynamics.

Sequoia’s bet on Anthropic, despite its exposure to rivals, underscores a fundamental truth about where the AI race is headed: talent and execution matter more than regional advantage.

For European startups, this means honing in on distinctive technical niches, enterprise traction, and real-world impact rather than simply following headline valuations.

The Anthropic round may be a moment of spectacle, but its lasting impact will be measured in how ecosystems evolve, how talent flows, and how global competition shapes opportunities for innovation across borders. European players can benefit from these trends, but only if they leverage their own strengths in research, ethics-led deployment, and deep industry partnerships.

In the end, this deal isn’t just about money; it’s a signal of where confidence lies in the next chapter of AI, and who stands to gain as a result.
