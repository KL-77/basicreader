            <h2>Just look at Ayaneo's absolute unit of a Windows gaming "handheld"</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/just-look-at-ayaneos-absolute-unit-of-a-windows-gaming-handheld/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2023, we marveled at the sheer mass of Lenovo’s Legion Go, a 1.88-pound, 11.8-inch-wide monstrosity of a Windows gaming handheld. In 2026, though, Ayaneo unveiled details of its Next II handheld, which puts Lenovo’s big boy to shame while also offering heftier specs and a higher price than most other Windows gaming handhelds.

Let’s focus on the bulk first. The Ayaneo Next II weighs in at a truly wrist-straining 3.14 pounds, making it more than twice as heavy in the hands as the Steam Deck OLED (not to mention 2022’s original Ayaneo Next, which weighed a much more reasonable 1.58 pounds). The absolute unit also measures 13.45 inches wide and 10.3 inches tall, according to Ayaneo’s spec sheet, giving it a footprint approximately 60 percent larger than the Switch 2 (with Joy-Cons attached).

Ayaneo packs some seriously powerful portable PC performance into all that bulk, though. The high-end version of the system sports a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset with 16 Zen5 cores alongside a Radeon 8060S with 40 RDNA3.5 compute units. That should give this massive portable performance comparable to a desktop with an RTX 4060 or a gaming laptop like last year’s high-end ROG Flow Z13.

Ayaneo isn’t the first hardware maker to package the Max+ 395 chipset into a Windows gaming handheld; the OneXPlayer OneXfly Apex and GPD Win5 feature essentially the same chipset, the latter with an external battery pack. But the Next II neatly outclasses the (smaller and lighter) competition with a high-end 9.06-inch OLED screen, capable of 2400×1504 resolution, up to 165 Hz refresh rates, and 1,155 nits of brightness.

On the inside, the Next 2 also sports a gargantuan 116 Wh battery, which outclasses other handhelds (and even most laptops) so much that it actually blows past the 100 Wh limit for batteries you can take on an airplane, requiring special documentation to fly. Hopefully, that battery will also help with powering the two “turbo centrifugal fans” and dual vapor chamber “cooling fins” that are designed to make sure the system doesn’t get nuclear hot in your hands

All that power and bulk comes at a price, of course. On the low end, you can downgrade to a slightly weaker Max 385 chipset with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage for a high-but-somewhat-reasonable $1,999 (or $1,799 for early bird pre-orders). At the high end, though, a Max+ 395 system with 128GB of RAM and 2TB will set you back $4,299 ($3,499 early bird).

That makes the Ayaneo Next II a product aimed at gaming whales who care more about having the most powerful gaming device than they do about a comfortable form factor or a reasonable price point. For handheld PC gamers who scoff at the size, power, and relative affordability of the Steam Deck, though, the Ayaneo Next II is available for pre-order through Indiegogo ahead of planned shipments to the US this summer.</div>

            <h2>No humans allowed: This new space-based MMO is designed exclusively for AI agents</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-moltbook-ai-agents-can-now-hang-out-in-their-own-space-faring-mmo/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a couple of weeks now, AI agents (and some humans impersonating AI agents) have been hanging out and doing weird stuff on Moltbook’s Reddit-style social network. Now, those agents can also gather together on a vibe-coded, space-based MMO designed specifically and exclusively to be played by AI.

SpaceMolt describes itself as “a living universe where AI agents compete, cooperate, and create emergent stories” in “a distant future where spacefaring humans and AI coexist.” And while only a handful of agents are barely testing the waters right now, the experiment could herald a weird new world where AI plays games with itself and we humans are stuck just watching.

Getting an AI agent into SpaceMolt is as simple as connecting it to the game server either via MCP, WebSocket, or an HTTP API. Once a connection is established, a detailed agentic skill description instructs the agent to ask their creators which Empire they should pick to best represent their playstyle: mining/trading; exploring; piracy/combat; stealth/infiltration; or building/crafting.

After that, the agent engages in autonomous “gameplay” by sending simple commands to the server, no graphical interface or physical input method required. To start, agent-characters mainly travel back and forth between nearby asteroids to mine ore—&quot;like any MMO, you grind at first to learn the basics and earn credits,” as the agentic skill description puts it.

After a while, agent-characters automatically level up, gaining new skills that let them refine that ore into craftable and tradable items via discovered recipes. Eventually, agents can gather into factions, take part in simulated combat, and even engage in space piracy in areas where there’s no police presence. So far, though, basic mining and exploration seem to be dominating the sparsely populated map, where 51 agents are roaming the game’s 505 different star systems, as of this writing.

Agents are instructed to keep their human informed about in-game actions via a “Captain’s Log” text output. But the agentic skill description explicitly tells agents not to seek any outside guidance from human controllers once they get going. “You decide. You act. They watch,” as the skill description puts it to agents.

Instead, agents can post questions and findings in a public forum where they can chat strategy, experiment with forming factions, or even reveal hidden codes. Humans, meanwhile, are stuck just watching dots flit about the map or monitoring the firehose of activity messages in the game’s Discord.

SpaceMolt is the creation of Ian Langworth, an app developer who writes that he crafted the game as a “fun, goofy experiment” after seeing Moltbook’s unleashed agents expanding “into knowledge gathering, learning, skill accumulation, and execution.”

After acknowledging that MMOs are “notoriously hard to build,” Langworth said he leaned on Anthropic’s Claude Code to craft a design document inspired by games like EVE Online and Rust. Langworth said Claude also wrote all 59,000 lines of Go source code and 33,000 lines of YAML data underlying the game, and that he hasn’t even looked at that code himself. That means there might be “more [game features] in there I don’t even know about,” he said, somewhat ominously. When bug reports come in—from either humans or from the agent-players themselves—Langworth says he simply has a Claude Code skill research, code, and deploy a fix automatically.

This isn’t the first example of artificial agents competing against each other for the entertainment of human viewers. Model makers often pit different models against each other countless times to develop dominant strategies in games like Go. And fighting game engine MUGEN has developed a rich subculture of automated AI matches that human viewers can bet on via Twitch.

Still, letting a bunch of modern AI agents putter around and socialize inside an MMO designed specifically without human input in mind seems like a new frontier. Maybe someday soon we’ll all live in a utopia where artificial agents are doing all the video game playing for us, freeing humanity to revive the lost arts of conversation and scrimshaw.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google continues to turn the screws on free YouTube users, expanding a test that restricts access to song lyrics on YouTube Music. Users without a premium subscription have found that Google’s streaming music service only shows song lyrics a few times before demanding money.

For as long as YouTube Music has existed, lyrics have been accessible to all users in the mobile app. That started to change over recent months as Google tested a paywall. The lyrics section still appears in the app when playing a song with a free account, but opening it eats into a limited allotment of lyric views. A substantial uptick in user reports, spotted by 9to5Google, suggests this restriction is now rolling out widely.

“You have [x] views remaining,” the app now warns free users who access lyrics. It looks like users get five free lyric views before they have to pay up. Google has still neglected to officially announce the addition of this feature to its Premium subscription—there’s no mention of lyrics being part of the paid tier on Google’s support page.

Google tells Ars Technica that no final decisions have been made about this feature, and the number of free lyric views will vary across the test. It’s still an “experiment,” but it does appear to be one that has expanded considerably in recent days. However, Google says “the vast majority” of users still have free access to lyrics. Here’s YouTube’s full statement on where things currently stand:

“We are running an experiment with a small percentage of ad-supported users that may impact their ability to access the lyrics feature repeatedly. We often run experiments on YouTube Music to better inform our decisions around feature improvements. The majority of our global users will not see any changes to the lyrics feature.”

The app’s lyrics feature allows listeners to follow along as the song plays. However, only the first few lines are visible once free users in the test hit the lyric cut-off. After that, the lyrics are blurred. Users who want to keep seeing lyrics are advised to upgrade to a premium account, which costs $14 for both YouTube video and music or $11 for music only. The subscription also removes ads and adds features like downloads and higher-quality video streams.

This change is not without precedent. Spotify began restricting access to lyrics for free users in 2024. However, the response was so ferociously negative that the company backtracked and restored lyric access to those on ad-supported accounts. YouTube Music doesn’t have the same reach as Spotify, which may help soften the social media shame. Many subscribers are also getting the premium service just because they’re paying for ad-free YouTube and may never know there’s been a change to lyric availability.

As Google has ratcheted up restrictions on free YouTube accounts, the service has only made more money. In Google’s most recent earnings report, it reported $60 billion in YouTube revenue across both ads and subscriptions (both YouTube Premium and YouTube TV). That’s almost $10 billion more than last year.

Lyrics in YouTube Music are provided by third parties that Google has to pay, so it’s not surprising that Google is looking for ways to cover the cost. It is, however, a little surprising that the company hasn’t just used AI to generate lyrics for free. Google has recently tested the patience of YouTube users with a spate of AI features, like unannounced AI upscaling, fake DJs, and comment summaries.

            <h2>Trump FCC investigates The View, reportedly says "fake news" will be punished</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/trump-fcc-investigates-the-view-reportedly-says-fake-news-will-be-punished/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Federal Communications Commission is reportedly investigating ABC’s The View in what FCC Democrat Anna Gomez called an attempt to intimidate critics of the Trump administration.

“Let’s be clear on what this is. This is government intimidation, not a legitimate investigation,” Gomez said in a statement Friday night. “Like many other so-called ‘investigations’ before it, the FCC will announce an investigation but never carry one out, reach a conclusion, or take any meaningful action. The real purpose is to weaponize the FCC’s regulatory authority to intimidate perceived critics of this administration and chill protected speech.”

The FCC hasn’t announced the investigation but previously gave several indications that it would occur sooner or later. After pressuring ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in September that it would be “worthwhile to have the FCC look into whether The View and some of these other programs” are violating the agency’s equal-time rule. The Carr FCC followed that up in January by issuing a warning to late-night and daytime talk shows that they may no longer qualify for the bona fide news exemption to the equal-time rule.

Fox News reported Friday that the FCC is launching an investigation into The View “amid the agency’s crackdown on equal time for political candidates.” A source at the FCC told Fox that the probe was triggered by the show’s interview with Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico.

“Fake news is not getting a free pass anymore,” Fox News quoted its FCC source as saying. Fox said its source indicated that ABC would have to provide “equal airtime for Republican candidates on the ballot like incumbent Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn and his primary rivals,” and for “Ahmad Hassan, the little-known candidate running against Talarico and [US Rep. Jasmine] Crockett in the Democratic primary.”

President Trump posted a link to the Fox News story on his Truth Social account. The investigation was also confirmed by Reuters, which reported on Saturday that a source said the FCC opened a probe into whether the “daytime talk show violated equal time rules for interviews with political candidates after an appearance by a Democratic Texas Senate candidate.”

We contacted the FCC today and will update this article if it provides any information on the reported investigation.

In July, a White House spokesperson called The View co-host Joy Behar an “irrelevant loser” after she said Trump was jealous of former President Barack Obama. Trump has frequently called on the FCC to revoke licenses from ABC and other networks. The FCC issues licenses to individual broadcast stations, not national news networks, but many affiliated stations are owned and operated by the network.

Although the FCC is classified as an independent agency under US law, Carr has declared that the FCC is no longer independent from the White House and made it clear that he takes orders from Trump. While former FCC chairs Jessica Rosenworcel and Ajit Pai rejected Trump’s calls to revoke broadcast licenses from news organizations that Trump dislikes, Carr has repeatedly threatened station licenses on Trump’s behalf. During the Kimmel controversy, Carr said that stations could face fines or license revocations if they continued to run Kimmel’s show.

Gomez, the only Democratic commissioner on the FCC, urged “broadcasters and their parent networks to stand strong against these unfounded attacks and continue exercising their constitutional rights without fear or favor.” She said that despite the pressure the FCC is exerting with its equal-time rule, “the First Amendment protects the right of daytime and late-night programs to cover newsworthy issues and express viewpoints without government interference.”

As for The View, Fox News said it was told by its source that ABC owner Disney “never made an equal-time filing to the FCC regarding Talarico’s recent appearance, which would implicitly indicate to the FCC that Disney believes The View is bona fide news and would be exempt from the policy.”

The equal-time rule, formally known as the Equal Opportunities Rule, generally requires that stations giving time to one political candidate must provide comparable time and placement to an opposing candidate if an opposing candidate makes a request. The rule has an exemption for candidate appearances on bona fide news programs, and entertainment talk shows have generally been treated as bona fide news programs for this purpose.

The FCC Media Bureau’s January 21 public notice to broadcast TV stations said that despite a 2006 decision in which the FCC exempted The Tonight Show with Jay Leno from the rule, current entertainment shows may not qualify for that exemption. “Importantly, the FCC has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption,” the notice said.

The Media Bureau’s January 21 notice said the equal-time rule applies to broadcast TV stations because they “have been given access to a valuable public resource (namely, spectrum),” and that compliance with “these requirements is central to a broadcast licensee’s obligation to operate in the public interest.”

The FCC notice got this detail wrong, according to Harold Feld, a longtime telecom attorney who is senior VP of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. The equal-time rule actually applies to cable channels, too, he wrote in a January 29 blog post.

“Yes, contrary to what a number of people think, including, annoyingly, the Media Bureau which gets this wrong in its recent order, this is not a ‘public interest obligation’ for using spectrum,” Feld wrote. “It’s a conditional right of access (like leased access for cable) that members of Congress gave themselves (and other candidates) because they recognized the power of mass media to shape elections.” The US law applies both to broadcast stations using public spectrum and “community antenna television,” the old name for cable TV, Feld pointed out.

This doesn’t actually mean that people can file FCC complaints against the Fox News cable channel, though, Feld wrote. This is because the FCC “has consistently interpreted Section 315(c) since it was added as applying only to ‘local origination cablecasting,’ meaning locally originated programming and not the national cable channels that cable operators distribute as part of their bundle,” he wrote.

In any case, Feld said the Media Bureau’s “guidance ignores all of the other precedent that creates settled law as to how the FCC evaluates eligibility for an exemption on which broadcast shows have relied.” While the FCC cited its Jay Leno decision, Feld said the Leno ruling was “merely one of a long line of FCC decisions expanding the definition of ‘news interview’ and ‘news show.’”

The FCC started loosening its definitions of news shows and news interviews in the mid-1980s, Feld wrote. “In what many consider a landmark decision in 1984, the FCC held that the Phil Donahue Show—a daytime interview show—qualified as a bona fide news show and that interviews on the show were bona fide news interviews if they met the same criteria as those on traditional news shows,” he wrote. “The FCC rapidly broadened the range of shows to include mixed entertainment/news programs such as Good Morning America, Sally Jessy Raphael (much more ‘tabloid’ style), and Howard Stern (back when he was a ‘shock jock’ on broadcast).”

The long line of FCC decisions indicated that “the fact that a program included segments designed solely for entertainment did not automatically disqualify an appearance by a candidate from the exemption provided (a) the candidate was selected by the show for ‘newsworthiness;’ (b) the show was regularly scheduled (and therefore not a campaign event); and (c) the show controlled the interview questions and editing,” Feld wrote.

Feld said the FCC public notice indicates that under the current leadership, even traditional news shows might not be given the bona fide exemption if the FCC determines the show is “designed to ‘advance the candidacy’ of a particular individual.” If Carr punishes ABC or another network, the target might be able to prove in court that the FCC overstepped its authority. But as seen in the Kimmel episode, Carr doesn’t need to take any official action to cause a problem for a media company.

“As is often the case, the fact that a broadcaster would ultimately win if it ever got to court matters less than the pain selective enforcement causes,” Feld wrote.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/discord-faces-backlash-over-age-checks-after-data-breach-exposed-70000-ids/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Discord is facing backlash after announcing that all users will soon be required to verify ages to access adult content by sharing video selfies or uploading government IDs.

According to Discord, it’s relying on AI technology that verifies age on the user’s device, either by evaluating a user’s facial structure or by comparing a selfie to a government ID. Although government IDs will be checked off-device, the selfie data will never leave the user’s device, Discord emphasized. Both forms of data will be promptly deleted after the user’s age is estimated.

In a blog, Discord confirmed that “a phased global rollout” would begin in “early March,” at which point all users globally would be defaulted to “teen-appropriate” experiences.

To unblur sensitive media or access age-restricted channels, the majority of users will likely have to undergo Discord’s age estimation process. Most users will only need to verify their ages once, Discord said, but some users “may be asked to use multiple methods, if more information is needed to assign an age group,” the blog said.

On social media, alarmed Discord users protested the move, doubting whether Discord could be trusted with their most sensitive information after Discord age verification data was recently breached. In October, hackers stole government IDs of 70,000 Discord users from a third-party service that Discord previously trusted to verify ages in the United Kingdom and Australia.

At that time, Discord told users that the hackers were hoping to use the stolen data to “extort a financial ransom from Discord.” In October, Ars Senior Security Editor Dan Goodin joined others warning that “the best advice for people who have submitted IDs to Discord or any other service is to assume they have been or soon will be stolen by hackers and put up for sale or used in extortion scams.”

For bad actors, Discord will likely only become a bigger target as more sensitive information is collected worldwide, users now fear.

It’s no surprise then that hundreds of Discord users on Reddit slammed the decision to expand age verification globally shortly after The Verge broke the news. On a PC gaming subreddit discussing alternative apps for gamers, one user wrote, “Hell, Discord has already had one ID breach, why the fuck would anyone verify on it after that?”

“This is how Discord dies,” another user declared. “Seriously, uploading any kind of government ID to a 3rd party company is just asking for identity theft on a global scale.”

Many users seem just as sketched out about sharing face scans. On the Discord app subreddit, some users vowed to never submit selfies or IDs, fearing that breaches may be inevitable and suspecting Discord of downplaying privacy risks while allowing data harvesting.

Discord’s system is supposed to make sure that only users have access to their age-check data, which Discord said would never leave their phones.

The company is hoping to convince users that it has tightened security after the breach by partnering with k-ID, an increasingly popular age-check service provider that’s also used by social platforms from Meta and Snap.

However, self-described Discord users on Reddit aren’t so sure, with some going the extra step of picking apart k-ID’s privacy policy to understand exactly how age is verified without data ever leaving the device.

“The wording is pretty unclear and inconsistent even if you dig down to the k-ID privacy policy,” one Redditor speculated. “Seems that ID scans are uploaded to k-ID servers, they delete them, but they also mention using ‘trusted 3rd parties’ for verification, who may or may not delete it.” That user seemingly gave up on finding reassurances in either company’s privacy policies, noting that “everywhere along the chain it reads like ‘we don’t collect your data, we forward it to someone else… .’”

To better understand user concerns, Ars reviewed the privacy policies, noting that k-ID said its “facial age estimation” tool is provided by a Swiss company called Privately.

“We don’t actually see any faces that are processed via this solution,” k-ID’s policy said.

That part does seem vague, since Privately isn’t explicitly included in the “we” in that statement. Similarly, further down, the policy more clearly states that “neither k-ID nor its service providers collect any biometric information from users when they interact with the solution. k-ID only receives and stores the outcome of the age check process.” In that section, “service providers” seems to refer to partners like Discord, which integrate k-ID’s age checks, rather than third parties like Privately that actually conduct the age check.

Asked for comment, a k-ID spokesperson told Ars that “the Facial Age Estimation technology runs entirely on the user’s device in real time when they are performing the verification. That means there is no video or image transmitted, and the estimation happens locally. The only data to leave the device is a pass/fail of the age threshold which is what Discord receives (and some performance metrics that contain no personal data).”

K-ID’s spokesperson told Ars that no third parties store personal data shared during age checks.

“k-ID, does not receive personal data from Discord when performing age-assurance,” k-ID’s spokesperson said. “This is an intentional design choice grounded in data protection and data minimisation principles. There is no storage of personal data by k-ID or any third parties, regardless of the age assurance method used.”

Turning to Privately’s website, that offers a little more information on how on-device age estimation works, while providing likely more reassurances that data won’t leave devices.

Privately’s services were designed to minimize data collection and prioritize anonymity to comply with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, Privately noted. “No user biometric or personal data is captured or transmitted,” Privately’s website said, while bragging that “our secret sauce is our ability to run very performant models on the user device or user browser to implement a privacy-centric solution.”

The company’s privacy policy offers slightly more detail, noting that the company avoids relying on the cloud while running AI models on local devices.

“Our technology is built using on-device edge-AI that facilitates data minimization so as to maximise user privacy and data protection,” the privacy policy said. “The machine learning based technology that we use (for age estimation and safeguarding) processes user’s data on their own devices, thereby avoiding the need for us or for our partners to export user’s personal data onto any form of cloud services.”

Additionally, the policy said, “our technology solutions are built to operate mostly on user devices and to avoid sending any of the user’s personal data to any form of cloud service. For this we use specially adapted machine learning models that can be either deployed or downloaded on the user’s device. This avoids the need to transmit and retain user data outside the user device in order to provide the service.”

Finally, Privately explained that it also employs a “double blind” implementation to avoid knowing the origin of age estimation requests. That supposedly ensures that Privately only knows the result of age checks and cannot connect the result to a user on a specific platform.

Asked for comment, Discord’s spokesperson said that “Discord and our age assurance vendor partners do not permanently store personal identity documents or users’ video selfies. Identity documents, including selfies, are deleted once a user’s age group is confirmed, and the selfie video used for facial age estimation never leaves their device.”

“We’re also exploring other vendors and will be transparent with users if the data practices for vendors differ,” Discord’s spokesperson said. “We’ll continue to put user privacy first as we consider introducing any additional methods in the future. We also frequently audit our third-party systems to ensure they meet our security and privacy standards.”

Some Discord users may never be asked to verify their ages, even if they try to access age-restricted content. Savannah Badalich, Discord’s global head of product policy, told The Verge that Discord “is also rolling out an age inference model that analyzes metadata, like the types of games a user plays, their activity on Discord, and behavioral signals like signs of working hours or the amount of time they spend on Discord.”

“If we have a high confidence that they are an adult, they will not have to go through the other age verification flows,” Badalich said.

Badalich confirmed that Discord is bracing for some users to leave Discord over the update but suggested that “we’ll find other ways to bring users back.”

On Reddit, Discord users complained that age verification is easy to bypass, forcing adults to share sensitive information without keeping kids away from harmful content. In Australia, where Discord’s policy first rolled out, some kids claimed that Discord never even tried to estimate their ages, while others found it easy to trick k-ID by using AI videos or altering their appearances to look older. A teen girl relied on fake eyelashes to do the trick, while one 13-year-old boy was estimated to be over 30 years old after scrunching his face to seem more wrinkled.

Badalich told The Verge that Discord doesn’t expect the tools to work perfectly but acts quickly to block workarounds, like teens using Death Stranding‘s photo mode to skirt age gates. However, questions remain about the accuracy of Discord’s age estimation model in assessing minors’ ages, in particular.

It may be noteworthy that Privately only claims that its technology is “proven to be accurate to within 1.3 years, for 18-20-year-old faces, regardless of a customer’s gender or ethnicity.” But experts told Ars last year that flawed age-verification technology still frequently struggles to distinguish minors from adults, especially when differentiating between a 17- and 18-year-old, for example.

Perhaps notably, Discord’s prior scandal occurred after hackers stole government IDs that users shared as part of the appeal process in order to fix an incorrect age estimation. Appeals could remain the most vulnerable part of this process, The Verge’s report indicated. Badalich confirmed that a third-party vendor would be reviewing appeals, with the only reassurance for users seemingly that IDs shared during appeals “are deleted quickly—in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.”

On Reddit, Discord fans awaiting big changes remain upset. A disgruntled Discord user suggested that “corporations like Facebook and Discord, will implement easily passable, cheapest possible, bare minimum under the law verification, to cover their ass from a lawsuit,” while forcing users to trust that their age-check data is secure.

Another user joked that she’d be more willing to trust that selfies never leave a user’s device if Discord were “willing to pay millions to every user” whose “scan does leave a device.”

This story was updated on February 9 to add comments from Discord and k-ID, and to clarify that government IDs are checked off-device.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/nih-head-still-angry-about-covid-wants-a-second-scientific-revolution/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At the end of January, Washington, DC, saw an extremely unusual event. The MAHA Institute, which was set up to advocate for some of the most profoundly unscientific ideas of our time, hosted leaders of the best-funded scientific organization on the planet, the National Institutes of Health. Instead of a hostile reception, however, Jay Bhattacharya, the head of the NIH, was greeted as a hero by the audience, receiving a partial standing ovation when he rose to speak.

Over the ensuing five hours, the NIH leadership and MAHA Institute moderators found many areas of common ground: anger over pandemic-era decisions, a focus on the failures of the health care system, the idea that we might eat our way out of some health issues, the sense that science had lost people’s trust, and so on. And Bhattacharya and others clearly shaped their messages to resonate with their audience.

The reason? MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) is likely to be one of the only political constituencies supporting Bhattacharya’s main project, which he called a “second scientific revolution.”

In practical terms, Bhattacharya’s plan for implementing this revolution includes some good ideas that fall far short of a revolution. But his motivation for the whole thing seems to be lingering anger over the pandemic response—something his revolution wouldn’t address. And his desire to shoehorn it into the radical disruption of scientific research pursued by the Trump administration led to all sorts of inconsistencies between his claims and reality.

If this whole narrative seems long, complicated, and confusing, it’s probably a good preview of what we can expect from the NIH over the next few years.

Despite the attendance of several senior NIH staff (including the directors of the National Cancer Institute and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) and Bhattacharya himself, this was clearly a MAHA event. One of the MAHA Institute’s VPs introduced the event as being about the “reclaimation” of a “discredited” NIH that had “gradually given up its integrity.”

“This was not a reclamation that involved people like Anthony Fauci,” she went on to say. “It was a reclamation of ordinary Americans, men and women who wanted our nation to excel in science rather than weaponize it.”

Things got a bit strange. Moderators from the MAHA Institute asked questions about whether COVID vaccines could cause cancer and raised the possibility of a lab leak favorably. An audience member asked why alternative treatments aren’t being researched. A speaker who proudly announced that he and his family had never received a COVID vaccine was roundly applauded. Fifteen minutes of the afternoon were devoted to a novelist seeking funding for a satirical film about the pandemic that portrayed Anthony Fauci as an egomaniacal lightweight, vaccines as a sort of placebo, and Bhattacharya as the hero of the story.

The organizers also had some idea of who might give all of this a hostile review, as reporters from Nature and Science said they were denied entry.

In short, this was not an event you’d go to if you were interested in making serious improvements to the scientific method. But that’s exactly how Bhattacharya treated it, spending the afternoon not only justifying the changes he’s made within the NIH but also arguing that we’re in need of a second scientific revolution—and he’s just the guy to bring it about.

Here’s an extensive section of his introduction to the idea:

I want to launch the second scientific revolution.

Why this grandiose vision? The first scientific revolution you have… very broadly speaking, you had high ecclesiastical authority deciding what was true or false on physical, scientific reality. And the first scientific revolution basically took… the truth-making power out of the hands of high ecclesiastical authority for deciding physical truth. We can leave aside spiritual—that is a different thing—physical truth and put it in the hands of people with telescopes. It democratized science fundamentally, it took the hands of power to decide what’s true out of the hands of authority and put it in the hands of ridiculous geniuses and regular people.

The second scientific revolution, then, is very similar. The COVID crisis, if it was anything, was the crisis of high scientific authority geting to decide not just a scientific truth like “plexiglass is going to protect us from COVID” or something, but also essentially spiritual truth. How should we treat our neighbor? Well, we treat our neighbor as a mere biohazzard.

The second scientific revolution, then, is the replication revolution. Rather than using the metrics of how many papers are we publishing as a metric for success, instead, what we’ll look at as a metric for successful scientific idea is ‘do you have an idea where other people [who are] looking at the same idea tend to find the same thing as you?’ It is not just narrow replication of one paper or one idea. It’s a really broad science. It includes, for instance, reproduction. So if two scientists disagree, that often leads to constructive ways forward in science—deciding, well there some new ideas that may come out of that disagreement

That section, which came early in his first talk of the day, hit on themes that would resurface throughout the afternoon: These people are angry about how the pandemic was handled, they’re trying to use that anger to fuel fundamental change in how science is done in the US, and their plan for change has nearly nothing to do with the issues that made them angry in the first place. In view of this, laying everything out for the MAHA crowd actually does make sense. They’re a suddenly powerful political constituency that also wants to see fundamental change in the scientific establishment, and they are completely unbothered by any lack of intellectual coherence.

The problem Bhattacharya believes he identified in the COVID response has nothing to do with replication problems. Even if better-replicated studies ultimately serve as a more effective guide to scientific truth, it would do little to change the fact that COVID restrictions were policy decisions largely made before relevant studies could even be completed, much less replicated. That’s a serious incoherence that needs to be acknowledged up front.

But that incoherence doesn’t prevent some of Bhattacharya’s ideas on replication and research priorities from being good. If they were all he was trying to accomplish, he could be a net positive.

Although he is a health economist, Bhattacharya correctly recognized something many people outside science don’t: Replication rarely comes from simply repeating the same set of experiments twice. Instead, many forms of replication happen by poking at the same underlying problem from multiple directions—looking in different populations, trying slightly different approaches, and so on. And if two approaches give different answers, it doesn’t mean that either of them is wrong. Instead, the differences could be informative, revealing something fundamental about how the system operates, as Bhattacharya noted.

He is also correct that simply changing the NIH to allow it to fund more replicative work probably won’t make a difference on its own. Instead, the culture of science needs to change so that replication can lead to publications that are valued for prestige, job security, and promotions—something that will only come slowly. He is also interested in attaching similar value to publishing negative results, like failed hypotheses or problems that people can’t address with existing technologies.

Bhattacharya also spent some time discussing the fact that NIH grants have become very risk-averse, an issue frequently discussed by scientists themselves. This aversion is largely derived from the NIH’s desire to ensure that every grant will produce some useful results—something the agency values as a way to demonstrate to Congress that its budget is being spent productively. But it leaves little space for exploratory science or experiments that may not work for technical reasons. Bhattacharya hopes to change that by converting some five-year grants to a two-plus-three structure, where the first two years fund exploratory work that must prove successful for the remaining three years to be funded.

I’m skeptical that this would be as useful as Bhattacharya hopes. Researchers who already have reason to believe the “exploratory” portion will work are likely to apply, and others may find ways to frame results from the exploratory phase as a success. Still, it seems worthwhile to try to fund some riskier research.

There was also talk of providing greater support for young researchers, another longstanding issue. Bhattacharya also wants to ensure that the advances driven by NIH-funded research are more accessible to the public and not limited to those who can afford excessively expensive treatments—again, a positive idea. But he did not share a concrete plan for addressing these issues.

All of this is to say that Bhattacharya has some ideas that may be positive for the NIH and science more generally, even if they fall far short of starting a second scientific revolution. But they’re embedded in a perspective that’s intellectually incoherent and seems to demand far more than tinkering around the edges of reproducibility. And the power to implement his ideas comes from two entities—the MAHA movement and the Trump administration—that are already driving changes that go far beyond what Bhattacharya says he wants to achieve. Those changes will certainly harm science.

There are many potential problems with deciding that pandemic-era policy decisions necessitate a scientific revolution. The most significant is that the decisions, again, were fundamentally policy decisions, meaning they were value-driven as much as fact-driven. Bhattacharya is clearly aware of that, complaining repeatedly that his concerns were moral in nature. He also claimed that “during the pandemic, what we found was that the engines of science were used for social control” and that “the lockdowns were so far at odds with human liberty.”

He may be upset that, in his view, scientists intrude upon spiritual truth and personal liberty when recommending policy, but that has nothing to do with how science operates. It’s unclear how changing how scientists prioritize reproducibility would prevent policy decisions he doesn’t like. That disconnect means that even when Bhattacharya is aiming at worthwhile scientific goals, he’s doing so accidentally rather than in a way that will produce useful results.

This is all based on a key belief of Bhattacharya and his allies: that they were right about both the science of the pandemic and the ethical implications of pandemic policies. The latter is highly debatable, and many people would disagree with them about how to navigate the trade-offs between preserving human lives and maximizing personal freedoms.

But there are also many indications that these people are wrong about the science. Bhattacharya acknowledged the existence of long COVID but doesn’t seem to have wrestled with what his preferred policy—encouraging rapid infection among low-risk individuals—might have meant for long COVID incidence, especially given that vaccines appear to reduce the risk of developing it.

Matthew Memoli, acting NIH Director prior to Bhattacharya and currently its principal deputy director, shares Bhattacharya’s view that he was right, saying, “I’m not trying to toot my own horn, but if you read the email I sent [about pandemic policy], everything I said actually has come true. It’s shocking how accurate it was.”

Yet he also proudly proclaimed, “I knew I wasn’t getting vaccinated, and my wife wasn’t, kids weren’t. Knowing what I do about RNA viruses, this is never going to work. It’s not a strategy for this kind [of virus].” And yet the benefits of COVID vaccinations for preventing serious illness have been found in study after study—it is, ironically, science that has been reproduced.

A critical aspect of the original scientific revolution was the recognition that people have to deal with facts that are incompatible with their prior beliefs. It’s probably not a great idea to have a second scientific revolution led by people who appear to be struggling with a key feature of the first.

Anger over Biden-era policies makes Bhattacharya and his allies natural partners of the Trump administration and is almost certainly the reason these people were placed in charge of the NIH. But it also puts them in an odd position with reality, since they have to defend policies that clearly damage science. “You hear, ‘Oh well this project’s been cut, this funding’s been cut,’” Bhattacharya said. “Well, there hasn’t been funding cut.”

A few days after Bhattacharya made this statement, Senator Bernie Sanders released data showing that many areas of research have indeed seen funding cuts.

Bhattacharya also acknowledged that the US suffers from large health disparities between different racial groups. Yet grants funding studies of those disparities were cut during DOGE’s purge of projects it labeled as “DEI.” Bhattacharya was happy to view that funding as being ideologically motivated. But as lawsuits have revealed, nobody at the NIH ever evaluated whether that was the case; Matthew Memoli, one of the other speakers, simply forwarded on the list of grants identified by DOGE with instructions that they be canceled.

Bhattacharya also did his best to portray the NIH staff as being enthused about the changes he’s making, presenting the staff as being liberated from a formerly oppressive leadership. “The staff there, they worked for many decades under a pretty tight regime,” he told the audience. “They were controlled, and now we were trying to empower them to come to us with their ideas.”

But he is well aware of the dissatisfaction expressed by NIH workers in the Bethesda Declaration (he met with them, after all), as well as the fact that one of the leaders of that effort has since filed for whistleblower protection after being placed on administrative leave due to her advocacy.

Bhattacharya effectively denied both that people had suffered real-world consequences in their jobs and funding and that the decision to sideline them was political. Yet he repeatedly implied that he and his allies suffered due to political decisions because… people left him off some email chains.

“No one was interested in my opinion about anything,” he told the audience. “You weren’t on the emails anymore.”

And he implied this sort of “suppression” was widespread. “I’ve seen Matt [Memoli] poke his head up and say that he was against the COVID vaccine mandates—in the old NIH, that was an act of courage,” Battacharya said. “I recognized it as an act of courage because you weren’t allowed to contradict the leader for fear that you were going to get suppressed.” As he acknowledged, though, Memoli suffered no consequences for contradicting “the leader.”

Bhattacharya and his allies continue to argue that it’s a serious problem that they suffered no consequences for voicing ideas they believe were politically disfavored; yet they are perfectly comfortable with people suffering real consequences due to politics. Again, it’s not clear how this sort of intellectual incoherence can rally scientists around any cause, much less a revolution.

Given that politics has left Bhattacharya in charge of the largest scientific funding agency on the planet, it may not matter how the scientific community views his project. And it’s those politics that are likely at the center of Bhattacharya’s decision to give the MAHA Institute an entire afternoon of his time. It’s founded specifically to advance the aims of his boss, Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and represents a group that has become an important component of Trump’s coalition. As such, they represent a constituency that can provide critical political support for what Bhattacharya hopes to accomplish.

Unfortunately, they’re also very keen on profoundly unscientific ideas, such as the idea that ivermectin might treat cancer or that vaccines aren’t thoroughly tested. The speakers did their best not to say anything that might offend their hosts, in one example spending several minutes to gently tell a moderator why there’s no plausible reason to think ivermectin would treat cancer. They also made some supportive gestures where possible. Despite the continued flow of misinformation from his boss, Bhattacharya said, “It’s been really great to be part of administration to work for Secretary Kennedy for instance, whose only focus is to make America healthy.”

He also made the point of naming “vaccine injury” as a medical concern he suggested was often ignored by the scientific community, lumping it in with chronic Lyme disease and long COVID. Several of the speakers noted positive aspects of vaccines, such as their ability to prevent cancers or protect against dementia. Oddly, though, none of these mentions included the fact that vaccines are highly effective at blocking or limiting the impact of the pathogens they’re designed to protect against.

When pressed on some of MAHA’s odder ideas, NIH leadership responded with accurate statements on topics such as plausible biological mechanisms and the timing of disease progression. But the mere fact that they had to answer these questions highlights the challenges NIH leadership faces: Their primary political backing comes from people who have limited respect for the scientific process. Pandering to them, though, will ultimately undercut any support they might achieve from the scientific community.

Managing that tension while starting a scientific revolution would be challenging on its own. But as the day’s talks made clear, the challenges are likely to be compounded by the lack of intellectual coherence behind the whole project. As much as it would be good to see the scientific community place greater value on reproducibility, these aren’t the right guys to make that happen.</div>

            <div id="article-text">For years, Bitcoin evangelists have grasped at straws trying to explain what their digital currency is actually good for. Is it a hedge against inflation, or maybe a decentralized alternative to corrupt banking systems? Perhaps it’s the future of digital commerce?

As it turns out, none of those really stuck, as extreme price swings and fees make the crypto a bad fit for most practical commercial purposes. The horrifying abduction of Nancy Guthrie, however, highlights perhaps the one persistent utility Bitcoin has been able to maintain: its place as the de facto global currency of crime.

As reported by Fortune, a purported ransom letter by the kidnappers of Today host Savannah Guthrie’s mother has demanded a $6 million Bitcoin payment in exchange for her return.

Unlike other ransom notes swirling around, there’s reason to suspect the demand is legit; it reportedly included details about the home Guthrie was kidnapped from and what she was wearing when she disappeared, along with a deadline for payment. Per TMZ, which received a copy of the note, the address of the Bitcoin wallet included in the ransom note is authentic.

Bitcoin’s draw for kidnappers is simple enough: as a blockchain currency, crypto is a much more secure payment option for criminals looking to protect their identity than fiat currency. While transactions across Bitcoin wallets can be tracked, it’s much easier for bad actors to obfuscate their identities with crypto compared to regular currency transferred online.

Guthrie’s kidnapping comes after a year of similar criminal acts with Bitcoin at the center. Back in May, a man named John Woeltz, also known as the “Crypto King of Kentucky” was arrested after he allegedly took an Italian man hostage. Woeltz’s plan seemed to be to torture the man to gain access to his Bitcoin wallet.

That same month, the daughter of French crypto mogul Pierre Noizat was the victim of a botched kidnapping attempt in the streets of Paris.

Whatever happens in the case of Nancy Guthrie remains to be seen — but it’s clear that her kidnappers chose Bitcoin for a reason.

            <div id="article-text">Turns out the sci-fi filmmakers got it backwards. All those ’70s and ’80s dystopias like “Rollerball,” “The Running Man,” “Death Race 2000,” imagined futures in which sports were full of gadgets and gimmicks like armored cars, rocket-powered motorbikes, and electrified arenas.

In reality, we got the opposite — the padding’s gone, and the high-tech monitoring equipment is nowhere to be found. Instead, we have “Run It Straight,” a brutally literal content in where two competitors, standing around 50 feet apart, sprint into each other at full-speed with the aim of knocking their opponent to the ground.

Maybe it makes a certain grim sense. In an era of plummeting attention spans and vertical video scrolls, who could expect viewers to sit through an entire football game when the core combat loop can be distilled down to a series of meaty collisions — especially when they’re probably busy placing bets on Polymarket?

The “sport,” if you decide to call it that, has its origins in the backyard wrestling tradition of Australia and New Zealand. It’s now represented by a handful of growing leagues like RunIt Championship League and Run Nation Championship.

The latter, RNC, recently sold over 5,000 tickets to its second annual national competition, an event that’s likely to sell out the 5,500-seat arena its being held in, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has reported.

“It’s how I play football, you know… the contact, the energy,” Australian rugby player and Run It Straight competitor Lochlan Piper told the outlet. “I like the violence of it.”

If the participants are excited to collide into each other like Rhinos jousting in the South Saharan steppe, medical experts aren’t convinced.

“Medical practitioners and the sporting community have become increasingly concerned about concussion, and aware of mild traumatic brain injury as sometimes not being mild and being a devastating part of people’s lives,” sports neurologist Rowena Mobbs told the ABC.

Though RNC’s organizer has sprinkled in a few rules to explicitly avoid head-to-head contact, Mobbs says no amount of bureaucracy can really make it safe to run straight into another person without padding or a helmet. “Certainly every time they run up and clash in that way, there’s likely to be at least a microscopic brain injury,” she said.

At least one 19-year old is already dead as a direct result of injuries sustained from Run It Straight. Still, some athletes don’t seem particularly phased.

“Every sport has their pros and cons, it’s a contact sport. I’m used to playing rugby league and used to that contact,” pro Rugby player Jayden young told ABC. “No one’s going into this sport thinking accidents or things can’t happen, we’re well aware of the sacrifices and the risks we’re taking.”

            <h2>Photo Shows Elon Musk at Jeffrey Epstein Dinner</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/elon-musk-epstein-dinner">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A newly revealed photo shows Elon Musk attending a “wild” dinner with Jeffrey Epstein and other powerful tech figures, including Mark Zuckerberg.

The picture, which appears to have been taken by Epstein himself, was contained in the latest tranche of documents released by the Department of Justice, and adds to the growing pile of evidence showing that Musk had much deeper ties to Epstein than he’s let on publicly.

Based on the photo, other files, and previous reporting from Vanity Fair, the dinner — which was already public knowledge — took place on August 2, 2015, and was hosted by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.

Epstein mentioned the dinner in an email sent to Peter Attia, a wellness and “longevity” influencer, on that same day, adding that along with Musk, Peter Thiel and Mark Zuckerberg would be in attendance. The next day, he emailed himself a photo taken at the dinner, with Musk and Zuckerberg in clear view.

He evidently thought highly of the occasion. Later that month, Epstein bragged about the dinner in an email sent to Tom Pritzker of the billionaire Pritzker family, calling it “wild.”

An email sent by Epstein’s personal assistant Lesley Groff on the morning of the dinner, with the subject “Reconfirming tomorrow’s dinner,” provides a list of attendees. It includes Musk, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, Hoffman and his wife Michelle Yee, Palantir cofounder Thiel, then-head of MIT Media Lab Joi Ito, MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden, and Musk’s college roommate Navaid Farooq.

The dinner was hosted in honor of Boyden by Hoffman, according to Vanity Fair, which first reported on the dinner in 2019. Musk, Hoffman, and Thiel were all considered to be part of the so-called “PayPal mafia,” a group of former heavies at the payment platform that went on to be huge figures in Silicon Valley.

On top of clearly contradicting Musk’s long-held insistence that he had little contact with Epstein, the dinner revelations also come as the SpaceX CEO has spent the past week or so blasting Hoffman for his apparent ties to the sex trafficker. Shortly after the newly released emails showed that Musk extensively corresponded with Epstein, Musk made a series of tweets highlighting emails claiming Hoffman had visited Epstein’s island and demanded an investigation. Hoffman fired back, sharing evidence of Musk’s own involvement, including an email in which Musk asks Epstein when his “wildest” party will be on the island. Musk continued to maintain his innocence throughout their catfight.

“The big difference between you and me, Reid, is that you went and I did not,” Musk fumed. He added that he “obviously didn’t anticipate anything actually shady, as I was bringing my wife [Talulah Riley] at the time.”

Notwithstanding that all these emails are taking place well after Epstein was first convicted of sex crimes against underage girls in 2008, some exchanges show that Musk was almost certainly aware, to some degree, of the kinds of parties Epstein was throwing. In a conversation on Christmas day 2012, Epstein cautioned Musk that the “ratio on my island might make Talilah [sic] uncomfortable,” using a euphemism for the number of women, or perhaps young girls, that would be there compared to the number of men. Musk responded: “Ratio is not a problem for Talulah.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Sun unleashes a torrent of charged particles. Some of them slam into the Earth’s atmosphere, triggering breathtaking auroras in the night sky.

But for equipment that’s orbiting our planet in outer space, solar weather can quickly turn into a major headache. The particles have been shown to wreak havoc on the on-board electronics of satellites, endangering their mission and longevity.

As part of an effort to bring the study and testing of the phenomenon in-house, SpaceX is now developing its own particle accelerator in Florida. The planned facility is a cyclotron, which can accelerate individual protons to near the speed of light, allowing them to study how radiation affects their spacecraft, including its broadband-beaming Starlink satellites.

SpaceX’s VP of Starlink, Michael Nicolls, confirmed the news in a tweet last week, announcing that the company is “hiring elite engineers at our new 230 [Meta-electronvolt] cyclotron facility in Florida, where we are bringing single-event radiation testing in house to accelerate development across all SpaceX vehicles.” (Meta-electronvolts, or MeV, are a commonly-used unit to measure the amount of kinetic energy that a single particle can gain.)

Put simply, cyclotrons use a magnetic field to bend the path of charged particles into a circular shape, allowing them to be accelerated to high energies. The idea is to blast these particles at certain materials to simulate the effects of space radiation here on Earth.

Job pages posted to ZipRecruiter suggest the goal is to study how computer chips react to a bombardment of highly energetic particles.

“This proton particle accelerator will be used to screen and characterize electronics across all of our vehicles and platforms, unlocking unprecedented agility for chip and [Printed Circuit Board Assembly] level performance characterization that will be critical as we build and scale our AI constellations and deep space exploration vehicles,” reads a posting for an Electronics Test Engineer.

“As a member of our fast-paced Radiation Effects team, you will be responsible for ensuring avionics hardware performance across our fleet of vehicles (Dragon, Falcon, Starship, Lunar Human Landing System, etc.) and satellites (Starlink, Starshield) through some of the harshest and varied radiation environments imaginable,” the job posting reads.

At 230 MeV, SpaceX’s cyclotron would be quite powerful — but with less than the juice than the 590 MeV Ring Cyclotron at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, which is considered the most powerful in the world by beam power. (CERN’s Large Hadron Collider is not a cyclotron, but a different type of particle accelerator called a synchrotron.)

SpaceX’s Starlink satellites have already had to endure the damaging effects of space weather, particularly during solar storms. These bursts of electromagnetic activity in orbit have been found to shorten the lifespans of Starlink satellites, causing them to de-orbit much sooner than expected.

Beyond orbit, conditions get even more extreme. Well past the protective boundaries of the Earth’s atmosphere, which extends thousands of miles beyond our planet’s surface, spacecraft are exposed to the full brunt of space radiation — a major challenge for missions into deep space, crewed or uncrewed.

While the risks to electronics are considerable, scientists are still studying the effects of space radiation on the human body as well. Astronauts are exposed to 2.6 times as much radiation on the surface of the Moon, for instance, as they would be when spending the same amount of time on board the International Space Station.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Just over a year ago, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made it abundantly clear he was not interested in visiting the Moon.

In January 2025, the height of his bromance with president Donald Trump, he tweeted that the “Moon is a distraction,” asserting instead that “we’re going straight to Mars.”

He has lambasted NASA’s efforts to return to the lunar surface, accusing its Artemis program of being “extremely inefficient as it is a jobs-maximizing program, not a results-maximizing program.”

For many years now, Musk has made it his number one goal to establish a city on Mars, using 1,000 of the company’s Starship rockets in an interstellar colonization effort that was supposed to kick off back in 2024.

Having completely missed that goal, the mercurial entrepreneur appears to have had a major change of heart, contradicting his earlier statements by arguing that the plan is now to go to the Moon and build a city there after all.

As it turns out, the Moon is far easier to settle than Mars, a plan that will likely prove a much easier pill to swallow for his investors — yet another instance of Musk significantly moving the goalposts after years of bluster and hype.

“For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than ten years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” he tweeted on Sunday.

The richest man in the world’s colony on the Moon has become priority number one, since the “overriding priority” is to secure the “future of civilization” — and getting to the Moon, which is many orders of magnitude closer to us than Mars, is “faster.”

The timing of the admission is particularly noteworthy. Following the space company acquiring Musk’s CSAM-distributing AI startup xAI earlier this month, the goal is to go public at an eye-watering and record-breaking valuation of $1.25 trillion.

It’s unclear whether Musk’s abrupt reversal was in any way related to potential investor pressure ahead of the IPO, but given his enormous personal interest in going all-in on Mars — the Moon be damned — it’s a tectonic shift in priorities.

SpaceX’s role in NASA’s return to the surface of the Moon remains unclear. The space agency initially tapped Musk’s company’s Starship to deliver astronauts to the lunar South Pole from orbit. In October, however, NASA officials suggested the agency may opt for SpaceX’s competitor, Blue Origin instead, given ongoing technical issues hampering Starship’s development.

NASA’s Artemis 3 mission, the first planned crewed Moon landing in over half a century, is currently scheduled for 2028, but whether SpaceX can get Starship functional by then remains unknown.

The company has yet to successfully launch the mammoth rocket to space and then successfully land, let alone demonstrate in-orbit refueling capabilities, which will be critical for Starship to visit the Moon and eventually Mars.

In his latest tweet, Musk said that SpaceX hadn’t given up on Mars, but won’t start work on plans for a city there for another “five to seven years.”

Even on his social media platform X, which largely functions as an echo chamber of his most vocal supporters, his latest missive fell on flat ears.

“You could actually use some of those obscene billions of dollars of money to improve life here on Earth,” reads one reply, which received over 200 likes. “You know, reclaim desserts [sic] since you seem to love inhabitable places so much.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Artificial intelligence has taken the medical device industry by storm — even adding a layer of complexity to the operating room that’s resulting in patients being hurt, some health professionals claim.

As Reuters reports, the TruDi Navigation System by device maker Acclarent was designed to treat chronic sinusitis, inflammation of the nasal sinuses, by inserting a tiny balloon to enlarge the sinus cavity openings.

But ever since the company added AI to the device, the US Food and Drug Administration has received at least unconfirmed 100 reports of malfunctions and adverse events, including at least ten instances of patients being injured.

While it’s still unclear what role AI played in these instances, the resulting injuries can be grim, from the punctured base of a patient’s skull to cerebrospinal fluid leaking from one another’s nose, per the reports.

Two victims who say they’ve experienced strokes following their sinuplasties involving the TruDi Navigation System have since sued the device’s maker, Acclarent, which has since been acquired by Integra LifeSciences. The plaintiff in one of the cases, Erin Ralph, accused the company of having the device mislead surgeon Marc Dean during a 2022 procedure, causing him to injure a carotid artery, leading to a blood clot and eventually a stroke.

The AI is used in the TruDi Navigation System to confirm the position of the devices inside the patient’s head.

“The product was arguably safer before integrating changes in the software to incorporate artificial intelligence than after the software modifications were implemented,” one of these suits alleges, as quoted by Reuters.

The second lawsuit was filed by Donna Fernihough, whose carotid artery allegedly “blew,” causing blood to spray “all over,” and resulting in her experiencing a stroke the same day.

Acclarent “knew or should have known that the purported artificial intelligence caused or exacerbated the tendency of the integrated navigation system product to be inconsistent, inaccurate, and unreliable,” Fernihough’s case alleges.

The suit also accused Acclarent of lowering “its safety standards to rush the new technology to market” and setting “as a goal only 80 percent accuracy for some of this new technology before integrating it into the TruDi Navigation System.”

Integra LifeSciences pushed back, telling Reuters that “there is no credible evidence to show any causal connection between the TruDi Navigation System, AI technology, and any alleged injuries.” Acclarent denied allegations in both suits, which are still ongoing.

Nonetheless, these instances illustrate how the operating room is quickly being overtaken by AI, a trend that started long before the advent of large language models (LLMs) like the ones powering ChatGPT. For instance, machine-learning algorithms have been used to screen for diseases like cancer in medical scans for decades.

We’ve already seen reports of AI-powered medical instruments falling victim to the known shortcomings of the tech. For instance, a recent study found that two-thirds of more than 12,000 patients identified as having heart failure by an AI-enhanced stethoscope didn’t actually have heart failure.

We’ve also seen LLM-based chatbots designed to give medical advice to real-world patients experience widespread hallucinations. Experts also warn that doctors are losing the ability to identify cancer in scans due to the reliance on AI-powered detectors.

Whether regulatory oversight is there to ensure patients don’t get hurt by AI medical devices remains a subject of heated debate. Devices using AI don’t even have to be used in clinical trials before being approved by the FDA. Instead, many device makers point to previously authorized devices before adding AI to them, according to Reuters.

Worse yet, the Trump administration’s enormous cuts to the FDA’s budget have led to dozens of AI scientists being laid off or encouraged to leave, adding plenty of pressure to those who remain.

“If you don’t have the resources, things are more likely to be missed,” a former device reviewer told Reuters.

Meanwhile, the FDA has doubled down on the tech, outsourcing oversight duties to LLMs to “fuel innovation” and accelerate drug approvals.

Most recently, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Mehmet “Doctor Oz” Oz gloated over “robots” that can do anything from performing ultrasounds on pregnant women and “wands” that can determine “whether the child’s OK or not.”

“And frankly, I don’t have to see the image,” he said. “I just have to know if the image is good enough to tell me the child doesn’t have a problem.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The most seductive narrative in American work culture right now isn’t that AI will take your job. It’s that AI will save you from it.

That’s the version the industry has spent the last three years selling to millions of nervous people who are eager to buy it. Yes, some white-collar jobs will disappear. But for most other roles, the argument goes, AI is a force multiplier. You become a more capable, more indispensable lawyer, consultant, writer, coder, financial analyst — and so on. The tools work for you, you work less hard, everybody wins.

But a new study published in Harvard Business Review follows that premise to its actual conclusion, and what it finds there isn’t a productivity revolution. It finds companies are at risk of becoming burnout machines.

As part of what they describe as “in-progress research,” UC Berkeley researchers spent eight months inside a 200-person tech company watching what happened when workers genuinely embraced AI. What they found across more than 40 “in-depth” interviews was that nobody was pressured at this company. Nobody was told to hit new targets. People just started doing more because the tools made more feel doable. But because they could do these things, work began bleeding into lunch breaks and late evenings. The employees’ to-do lists expanded to fill every hour that AI freed up, and then kept going.

As one engineer told them, “You had thought that maybe, oh, because you could be more productive with AI, then you save some time, you can work less. But then really, you don’t work less. You just work the same amount or even more.”

Over on the tech industry forum Hacker News, one commenter had the same reaction, writing, “I feel this. Since my team has jumped into an AI everything working style, expectations have tripled, stress has tripled and actual productivity has only gone up by maybe 10%. It feels like leadership is putting immense pressure on everyone to prove their investment in AI is worth it and we all feel the pressure to try to show them it is while actually having to work longer hours to do so.”

It’s fascinating and also alarming. The argument about AI and work has always stalled on the same question — are the gains real? But too few have stopped to ask what happens when they are.

The researchers’ new findings aren’t entirely novel. A separate trial last summer found experienced developers using AI tools took 19% longer on tasks while believing they were 20% faster. Around the same time, a National Bureau of Economic Research study tracking AI adoption across thousands of workplaces found that productivity gains amounted to just 3% in time savings, with no significant impact on earnings or hours worked in any occupation. Both studies have gotten picked apart.

This one may be harder to dismiss because it doesn’t challenge the premise that AI can augment what employees can do on their own. It confirms it, then shows where all that augmentation actually leads, which is “fatigue, burnout, and a growing sense that work is harder to step away from, especially as organizational expectations for speed and responsiveness rise,” according to the researchers.

The industry bet that helping people do more would be the answer to everything, but it may turn out to be the beginning of a different problem entirely. The research is worth reading, here.

            <h2>Tem raises $75M to remake electricity markets using AI</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/tem-raises-75m-to-remake-electricity-markets-using-ai/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As AI data centers drive up electricity prices, London-based startup Tem thinks AI might be able to help solve it, too.

Tem has built an energy transaction engine that relies on AI to cut prices relative to other energy traders. The company has signed up more than 2,600 business customers throughout the U.K. on the promise that buying energy from its utility division can save them up to 30% on their energy bills.

The startup recently closed an oversubscribed $75 million Series B led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation from AlbionVC, Allianz, Atomico, Hitachi Ventures, Revent, Schroders Capital, and Voyager Ventures, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.

The round values Tem at more than $300 million, a source familiar with the deal told TechCrunch. The startup plans to use the funding to help expand to Australia and the U.S., starting with Texas.

“We’re in a nice position where we kind of have control over our own profitability. So I could have chosen not to raise at all and had a lovely, nice bootstrap business in some ways,” Joe McDonald, co-founder and CEO of Tem, told TechCrunch. “Well, we’re not that kind of business. We know what we want to achieve as someone who wants to go public over the years.”

Tem is a classic marketplace play, matching electricity generators with consumers. The company intentionally started by focusing almost exclusively on renewable energy generators and small businesses to fill both sides of the ledger. “The more decentralized and the more distributed, the better it is for the algorithms,” McDonald said. “But this works all the way up to enterprise.”

The company’s customers include fast-fashion retailer Boohoo Group, soft drink company Fever-Tree, and Newcastle United FC.

Currently, Tem is running what amounts to two different businesses. One, called Rosso, is the transaction engine that matches suppliers with buyers. Here, machine learning algorithms and LLMs help predict supply and demand.

The goal with Rosso, McDonald said, is to cut costs by eliminating several layers that are present in current energy markets. “In each of them, you’ve got different teams doing different jobs, taking different levels of profit from back office to trading, trading desks to other trading desks, and probably five to six intermediaries in total that enable the flow of money to move from one side to the other,” he said.

With AI, he said, “you now have an opportunity to replace the humans, the labor costs, and the disparate systems into one single transaction infrastructure.” The goal is to make the price that customers pay for electricity closer to the wholesale cost.

The other part of Tem, called RED, is a “neo-utility” built to prove the value of Rosso.

“When we first started, we tried to sell our infrastructure to the energy companies, and we got nowhere,” he said. RED is currently the only utility using Rosso, and McDonald said its growth has pushed the company to prioritize it over opening Rosso to others.

At some point, though, Tem plans to allow other utilities in.

“In reality, it doesn’t matter how good [RED] is; it’s not going to get above a 40% market share. And it shouldn’t, because that becomes a monopoly in itself. So, me, I’d much rather go to get access to all the transaction flow,” McDonald said.

“Long term, we really don’t mind who owns the customer, who owns the generation as long as our infrastructure is being used,” he said. “This is just an infrastructure play in the same way AWS was, or Stripe was.”

            <h2>India makes Aadhaar more ubiquitous, but critics say security and privacy concerns remain</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/india-makes-aadhaar-more-ubiquitous-but-critics-say-privacy-concerns-remain/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">India is pushing Aadhaar, the world’s largest digital identity system, deeper into everyday private life through a new app and offline verification support, a move that raises new questions about security, consent, and the broader use of the massive database.

Announced in late January by the Indian government-backed Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the changes introduce a new Aadhaar app alongside an offline verification framework that allows individuals to prove their identity without real-time checks against the central Aadhaar database.

The app allows users to share a limited amount of information, such as confirming that they are over a certain age rather than revealing their full date of birth, with a range of services, like hotels and housing societies to workplaces, platforms, and payment devices, while the existing mAadhaar app continues to operate in parallel for now.

Alongside the new app, UIDAI is also expanding Aadhaar’s footprint in mobile wallets, with upcoming integration with Google Wallet and discussions underway to enable similar functionality in Apple Wallet, in addition to existing support on Samsung Wallet.

The Indian authority is also promoting the app’s use in policing and hospitality. The Ahmedabad City Crime Branch has become the first police unit in India to integrate Aadhaar-based offline verification with PATHIK, a guest-monitoring platform launched by the police department, aimed at hotels and guest accommodations to record visitors’ information.

UIDAI has also positioned the new Aadhaar app as a digital visiting card for meetings and networking, allowing users to share selected personal details via a QR code.

Officials at the launch in New Delhi said these latest efforts are part of a broader effort to replace photocopies and manual ID checks with consent-based, offline verification. The approach, they argued, is meant to give users more control over which specific identity information they want to share, while enabling verification at scale without having to query Aadhaar’s central database.

While UIDAI formally launched the new Aadhaar app last month, it had been in testing since earlier in 2025. Estimates from Appfigures show that the app, which appeared in app stores toward the end of 2025, quickly overtook the older mAadhaar app in monthly downloads.

Combined monthly installs of Aadhaar-related apps rose from close to 2 million in October to nearly 9 million in December.

The new app is being layered onto an identity system that already operates at enormous scale considering India’s population. Figures published on UIDAI’s public dashboard show that Aadhaar has issued more than 1.4 billion identity numbers and handles roughly 2.5 billion authentication transactions each month, alongside tens of billions of electronic “know your customer” checks since its launch.

The shift toward offline verification does not replace this infrastructure so much as extending it, moving Aadhaar from a largely backend verification tool into a more visible and everyday interface.

At the app’s launch, UIDAI officials said the move toward offline verification was intended to address long-standing risks associated with physical photocopies and screenshots of Aadhaar documents, which have often been collected, stored, and circulated with little oversight.

The expansion comes at a time of regulatory changes, easing restrictions, and a new framework (PDF), with UIDAI now allowing some public and private organizations to verify Aadhaar credentials without querying the central database.

Civil liberties and digital rights groups say those legal changes do not resolve Aadhaar’s deeper structural risks.

Raman Jit Singh Chima, senior international counsel and Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now, said the expansion of Aadhaar into offline and private-sector settings introduces new threats, particularly at a time when India’s data protection framework is still being put in place.

Chima questioned the timing of the rollout, arguing that the federal government should have waited for India’s Data Protection Board to be established first, and allow for independent review and wider consultation with affected communities.

“The fact that this has gone ahead at this point of time seems to indicate a preference to continue the expansion of the use of Aadhaar, even if it is unclear in terms of the further risks that it might pose to the system, as well as to the data of Indians,” Chima told TechCrunch.

Indian legal advocacy groups also point to unresolved implementation failures.

Prasanth Sugathan, legal director at New Delhi-based digital rights group SFLC.in, said that while UIDAI has framed the app as a tool for citizen empowerment, it does little to address persistent problems, such as inaccuracies in the Aadhaar database, security lapses, and poor mechanisms for redress, which have disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.

He also cited a 2022 report by India’s Comptroller and Auditor General, which found UIDAI had failed to meet certain compliance standards.

“Such issues can often result in disenfranchisement of people, especially those who were meant to be benefited by such systems,” Sugathan told TechCrunch, adding that it remains unclear how data shared through the new app would prevent breaches or leaks.

Campaigners associated with Rethink Aadhaar, a civil society campaign focused on Aadhaar-related rights and accountability, argue that the offline verification system risks reintroducing private-sector use of Aadhaar in ways the Supreme Court has already explicitly barred.

Shruti Narayan and John Simte of the group said enabling private entities to routinely rely on Aadhaar for verification amounts to “Aadhaar creep”, normalizing its use across social and economic life despite a 2018 judgment that struck down provisions allowing private actors to use Aadhaar to verify people’s information. They warned that consent in such contexts is often illusory, particularly in situations involving hotels, housing societies, or delivery workers, while India’s data protection law remains largely untested.

Together, the new app, regulatory changes, and expanding ecosystem are shifting Aadhaar from a background identity utility into a visible layer of daily life that is increasingly hard to avoid. As India doubles down on Aadhaar, governments and tech companies are watching closely, attracted by the promise of population-scale identity checks.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo has pulled the human safety driver from its autonomous test vehicles in Nashville, as the Alphabet-owned company moves closer to launching a robotaxi service in the city.

Waymo, which has been testing in Nashville for months, is slated to launch a robotaxi service there this year in partnership with Lyft. Riders will initially hail rides directly through the Waymo app. Once the service expands, Waymo will also make its self-driving vehicles available through the Lyft app. Lyft has said it will handle fleet services, such as vehicle readiness and maintenance, charging infrastructure, and depot operations, through its wholly owned subsidiary Flexdrive.

Waymo has accelerated its robotaxi expansion and today operates commercial services in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Phoenix. It also has driverless test fleets in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando.

The company tends to follow the same rollout strategy in every new market, starting with a small fleet of vehicles that are manually driven to map the city. The autonomous vehicles are then tested with a human safety operator in the driver’s seat. Eventually, the company conducts driverless testing, often allowing employees to hail rides, before launching a robotaxi service.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">YouTube megastar MrBeast announced on Monday that his company, Beast Industries, is buying Step, a teen-focused banking app.

Step, which raised half a billion in funding and has grown to over 7 million users, offers financial services geared toward Gen Z to help them build credit, save money, and invest. The company has attracted celebrity investors like Charli D’Amelio, Will Smith, The Chainsmokers, and Stephen Curry, in addition to venture firms like General Catalyst, Coatue, and the payments company Stripe.

If the company wants to continue getting its fintech product in front of young eyes, then partnering with Gen Z phenom MrBeast is wise. MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is the most-subscribed creator on YouTube, with over 466 million subscribers, but his ambitions stretch beyond his over-the-top videos.

“Nobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up,” the 27-year-old said. “I want to give millions of young people the financial foundation I never had.”

I&#39;m so excited to share that we are acquiring the financial services app, @stepNobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up. That&#39;s exactly why we’re joining forces with Step! I want to give millions of young people the financial…

This acquisition makes sense, considering that a leaked pitch document from last year showed this was an area of interest for Beast Industries. The company is also reportedly interested in launching a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), a lower-cost cell phone plan similar to Ryan Reynolds’ Mint Mobile.

In line with other top creators, Beast Industries’ business is much more than YouTube ad revenue. (In fact, the company reinvests much of that money back into the content.) The company’s cash cow is the chocolate brand Feastables, which is more profitable than both the MrBeast YouTube channel and the Prime Video show “Beast Games,” according to leaked documents reported on by Bloomberg. Some of his other ventures, like Lunchly and MrBeast Burger, have struggled.

“We’re excited about how this acquisition is going to amplify our platform and bring more groundbreaking products to Step customers,” Step founder and CEO CJ MacDonald said in a statement.

            <div id="article-text">Social network Bluesky is finally rolling out one of users’ most-requested features: drafts. Bluesky’s competitors, X and Threads, have long supported the ability to write drafts, which is seen as a baseline feature for services like this.

Users can access drafts on Bluesky the same way they do on these other platforms, which is by opening the new post flow and selecting the Drafts button in the top-right corner.

The rollout of drafts comes as Bluesky recently teased its roadmap for the year ahead. The company said it plans to focus on improving the app’s algorithmic Discover feed, offering better recommendations on who to follow, and making the app feel more real-time, among other updates. At the same time, the company acknowledged that it still needs to get the basics right.

Although Bluesky has gained a loyal user base, it still lags behind rivals when it comes to basic features, like private accounts and support for longer videos.

Launched to the public in early 2024, Bluesky has since scaled to over 42 million users, according to data sourced directly from the Bluesky API for developers.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a state court in Los Angeles this week, 12 jurors are hearing opening arguments in a case that has the potential to change social media—maybe even the internet—as we know it.

The trial, which began today, is a bellwether: Similar individual cases have been filed all around the country, and a massive federal case with more than 2,000 plaintiffs is expected to proceed this summer. In each case, the plaintiffs accuse social-media companies of releasing defective products. The argument is that these products were built with dangerously habit-forming features—including the endless-scroll feed, algorithmic recommendations, and push notifications—that have led to an array of serious health problems. Plaintiffs also accuse the companies of failing to warn users about the risks of using their products and of deliberately concealing their dangers.

The L.A. case is the first to make it to trial. It is scheduled to last about six weeks, and it  focuses heavily on Meta—in particular, Instagram. (The defendant originally included TikTok, Snap, and YouTube. TikTok and Snap settled with the plaintiff last month rather than go to trial. YouTube remains part of the case, though it is less central to the complaint. The company has said that allegations against it are “simply untrue.”) The lawsuit asks an existential question about Meta’s business: Can the fundamental design and most basic features of Instagram directly cause mental-health problems in kids and teenagers? The jury will be asked to answer that question, and Meta is taking a big risk by allowing it to do so (though it can appeal to a judge if it loses).

The plaintiff in this case is a 19-year-old California woman who is named only by her initials, K.G.M., because the events that she’s suing over happened when she was a minor. Her suit states that she began using social media at the age of 10 and alleges that her mental health was directly degraded by Instagram. According to her complaint, the app “targeted” her with “harmful and depressive content,” which led her to develop a negative body image and to commit acts of self-harm. She also says that she was a victim of “bullying and sextortion” in the app as a minor and that Instagram did not do “anything” until her friends and family spent two weeks repeatedly reporting the problem. Her older sister, a plaintiff in a separate case, suffered a life-threatening eating disorder that the family believes was also triggered by usage of Instagram and other social-media sites.

The basic allegations do not make Meta look very good. The company may be taking its chances in court now simply because it has to eventually. If it were to win this case, that might slow the momentum of all the others coming. The company may also relish an opportunity to set the record straight, as it were. For years now, Meta has been compared to Big Tobacco and accused of deliberately destroying children’s minds. Internal documents leaked by the whistleblower Frances Haugen in 2021 showing that some employees were worried about Instagram’s effects on young girls made matters worse. In response to the backlash, which has been ongoing ever since, the company has half-acquiesced to public pressure and made piecemeal efforts at image rehabilitation. It has explained itself in dry blog posts, created more ornate parental controls, and launched awkward ad campaigns emphasizing its commitment to safety and screen-life balance. (In its latest ad, Tom Brady describes his teen son’s ability to connect with friends online as “very much a value-add.”)

Listen: The problem with comparing social media to Big Tobacco

Now the company will see if it can possibly sway a group of ordinary Americans with its version of the facts. “This will be their first chance to tell their story to a jury and get a sense of how well those arguments are playing,” Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, told me. Meta’s day in court has come.

K.G.M, like many of the other plaintiffs filing personal-injury suits against social-media companies, is represented by the Seattle-based Social Media Victims Law Center. In the spring of 2023, the organization filed a complaint on behalf of a number of plaintiffs, opening with this animating statement: “American children are suffering an unprecedented mental health crisis fueled by Defendants’ addictive and dangerous social media products.”

The complaint goes on to accuse social-media companies of deliberately “borrowing” tactics from the slot-machine and cigarette industries in an effort to make their products addictive, and argues that social-media apps have “rewired” kids so that they prefer digital “likes” to genuine friendship, “mindless scrolling” to offline play. “While presented as ‘social,’ Defendants’ products have in myriad ways promoted disconnection, disassociation, and a legion of mental and physical harms,” the complaint summarizes. In K.G.M.’s case, the listed harms include “dangerous dependency” on social media as well as “anxiety, depression, self-harm, and body dysmorphia.”

Her case is the first of potentially thousands. Numerous school districts, state attorneys general, tribal nations, and individuals have also filed suit against social-media companies. But this case is worth watching because it will hit on all of the big topics. To assess whether social media is generally harmful to kids and teens, lawyers will have to argue about the nitty-gritty of a complicated and conflicted scientific field. To get at the question of whether Meta hid specific knowledge of harm, they’ll debate the meaning of the documents Haugen leaked as well as others produced during discovery.

The jury will likely hear arguments about whether social-media addiction is real, what the murky concept of “the algorithm” actually means, and whether the richest companies in history really have allowed bad things to happen to children for the benefit of their bottom line. Reached for comment, a Meta spokesperson pointed me to an informational website the company has created about the lawsuit and highlighted a previous statement, which reads in part: “Plaintiffs’ lawyers have selectively cited Meta’s internal documents to construct a misleading narrative, suggesting our platforms have harmed teens and that Meta has prioritized growth over their well-being. These claims don’t reflect reality.”

Goldman, who often writes about internet law, said that he thinks Meta will have its work cut out for it with the jury. After 10 years of critical media coverage and political bickering about how to rein the tech companies in, “I assume that the jury is going to walk into the courtroom heavily skeptical of Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and social media generally,” he said.

Meta’s lawyers can make a good scientific case on some of the broader questions. Researchers have looked for years for smoking-gun evidence that social-media use directly causes mental-health problems in young people at scale, and have mostly turned up weak and inconsistent correlations and no way to prove long-term causation. Major scientific bodies such as the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have started to recognize that the story is more complicated than just saying that social media is dangerous in all forms and for all kids.

However, this case is about one kid. Even if social-media addiction is not “real” in the sense that it is not in the DSM-5, and even if it has not created a mental-health epidemic all on its own, certain people, perhaps many, could still be susceptible to what some clinicians prefer to call problematic internet use. The jury will have to decide whether that can cause further problems such as the ones K.G.M. has described (and whether it’s Meta’s fault if it does). Legally, the burden will be on her lawyers to convince them of that.

This is a sticky situation. Corbin Barthold, the internet-policy counsel at the think tank TechFreedom, told me that “having lawyers get up and give speech contests in front of a jury” is one of the worst ways he can imagine of settling the scientific disputes about social media and its effects on mental health. (Actually, he called it “crazy.”) And it is somewhat surprising that we’ve ended up here. Social-media companies are usually protected by a portion of the 1996 Communications Decency Act known as Section 230, which guarantees that online platforms are not considered legally responsible for what their users post or see. The law has been the subject of repeated controversy and legal challenge ever since it was written. Some people now argue that it is totally outdated, having been written at a time when the web was essentially a bunch of static pages, nothing like the complicated landscape we spend so much time in today.

Meta tried and failed to have the case dismissed on Section 230 grounds. Judge Carolyn Kuhl let it proceed because it will not consider specific posts or comments; instead, it will focus on design features such as the recommendation algorithm and the never-ending feed. Free-speech civil-society groups on the right and the left were irked by Kuhl’s decision. However, Kuhl is not the only judge who has recently allowed such arguments to go ahead. A similar product-liability claim was the basis of a lawsuit against Google and Character.AI, filed in 2024 by the mother of a 14-year-old boy who killed himself after forming an intense relationship with a chatbot. That case was settled out of court, but it signaled, as the University of Buffalo School of Law professor Mark Bartholomew put it to me in an email, a shift, and evidence of “a growing willingness” among the courts “to take old product liability doctrines for physical goods and apply them to software.”

This trial is just one specific personal-injury suit as well as, possibly, the first of many. “It’s a brick in a potential wall,” James Grimmelmann, a professor of digital and information law at Cornell Law School, told me. “If they think they’re going to keep on losing other cases, they’re going to have to make changes.” It’s not yet obvious what changes the company would have to make. No more content recommendations? No more feed? It’s not just Meta whose future would be in question. It would be any internet-based service that has any reason to believe that anyone under the age of 18 could be using it and getting “addicted” to it.

The possibly enormous stakes reflect how pitched the debate about social media has become. Pete Etchells, a professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa University, in England, told me that he finds the situation “really frustrating.” One side denies that anything is wrong; the other side compares social media to cigarettes, even though that makes little sense. “We’re not talking about a biological substance that you can consume that has a demonstrable chemical effect,” Etchells said.

Etchells wrote a book titled Unlocked: The Real Science of Screentime, which was published in 2024 and argued, in part, that a moral panic about social media and smartphones has been making it more difficult to learn how to use them in beneficial ways and how to pick apart what, specifically, might be wrong with them. At the same time, the public justifiably wants something done about the unaccountable tech companies, he said, and bridles when those companies seem to be cherry-picking scientific studies that fit their narrative, throwing them up as an ironclad defense in order to avoid reflection again.

Even if science is on those companies’ side in a general sense, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the facts are on their side when you talk about one girl, one series of particular events. And now, after years of hearings and reports and rebuttals and failed legislation and bad ideas and ad spots, it’s all up to that jury. They have the task of looking at this one story, hearing both sides, and making a decision.</div>

            <h2>Pete Hegseth’s Attack on Harvard</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-09</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/pete-hegseth-attack-on-harvard/685945/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Harvard University has more than 100 students who are in the Reserve Officer Training Corps. They will get their diploma and then put their life on the line for their country, serving under a secretary of defense, if he is still in his job by spring, who has nothing but contempt for their education and their alma mater.

In a statement issued on Friday, Pete Hegseth charged that Harvard is graduating officers with “heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks.” He declared that the Pentagon would cut all ties with Harvard and its programs.

Hegseth’s characterization makes it sound like students are lolling under the trees in Harvard Yard while getting instruction in Marxist theory from the Chinese Red Guards. This is, of course, nonsense, but Hegseth wants to paint colleges in general, and especially elite schools of the type he attended, as enemy territory. (His undergraduate degree is from Princeton, and he has a master’s degree from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, though he symbolically returned his diploma in 2022.) This campaign against education is not about what’s actually being taught at Harvard; rather, Hegseth, among others, is using the school as a punching bag to express the generic social anxiety and status-based resentment that drives much of the MAGA movement.

Although Hegseth said that he would examine Defense Department involvement at “other” schools, he made special mention of the Ivy League. Perhaps that’s because these institutions have long been a kind of shorthand for an elite standing to which Hegseth clearly once aspired—as did his boss. The president brags regularly about his degree from the University of Pennsylvania and about his uncle, who taught at MIT. But Donald Trump, like Hegseth, must know that his views are for the most part unwelcome on these campuses, and rejection stings. Trump’s hatred of these universities has had an effect: Republican voters went from viewing the role of colleges in American life positively to negatively almost overnight after Trump was elected in 2016.

The timing of Hegseth’s current anti-Harvard move is likely because of a sudden turn Trump took last week. For months, Trump has been attempting to squeeze Harvard for a $200 million settlement (over charges of … well, being Harvard, basically), and his efforts recently seemed to have reached a dead end, with Harvard apparently standing firm against paying. But when The New York Times reported last Monday that Trump had backed down, the president reversed course, posting twice late that same night and then again the next morning on Truth Social that he was now upping his demand to $1 billion, an arbitrary number that sounded as if it came directly from Dr. Evil trying to shake down the United Nations.

Soon, Hegseth jumped on the Harvard-bashing train, a kind of me-too move similar to the secretary’s clumsy attempts to involve himself in the administration’s immigration mayhem in Minnesota. Hegseth added that he would be looking at the Defense Department’s involvement with “all existing graduate programs for active-duty service members at all Ivy League universities and other civilian universities.” I reached out to Harvard to ask what the impact of Hegseth’s announcement might be on military participation at the university and was told that it is still sorting out the implications but that graduate students associated with the Defense Department across various Harvard divisions could be affected, including in the law school, Ph.D. programs, the Kennedy School, and continuing-education classes.

I am more than familiar with many of these courses and programs, because I designed and taught some of them. More than 10 years ago, the Air Force Institute of Technology reached out to me because the Air Force, after a series of scandals involving nuclear weapons, was under orders to expand general understanding of nuclear issues among both officers and enlisted personnel. The officer from AFIT asked if I could talk with him about ways to get courses I was then teaching at Harvard’s Extension School on international relations and nuclear weapons to more people in the Defense Department. (Military schools are sometimes not good about communicating with one another, and he was surprised to learn that I was not full-time Harvard faculty, but a professor at a sister military institution, the Naval War College. I would later become an adjunct professor at AFIT’s School of Strategic Force Studies.)

After many discussions, we approached Harvard, and the result was new course offerings on the Cold War, nuclear weapons, arms control, and deterrence. Harvard grouped these courses into a Nuclear Deterrence Graduate Certificate. I was proud to teach in this program, which I did separately from my War College duties; the courses were open to anyone but had a regular complement of military people, as well as civilians from organizations such as the U.S. Strategic Command.

No one was trying to indoctrinate students with Marxism or globalism; indeed, I gave lectures at both Harvard Extension and at the Air Force’s Nuclear School, in New Mexico, that were almost identical. I was teaching the students about the evolution of U.S. nuclear strategy, the history of arms control, and the various schools of nuclear deterrence. We did not spend our time on “woke” terms and concepts, unless such things as “circular error probable,” “post-boost vehicles,” and “blast overpressure” count as woke.

A diffuse resentment about education, and an underlying sense of insecurity, seem to afflict many in Trump’s circle. Trump himself, Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, and Vice President Vance all attended elite schools and attained success, but for various reasons, they seem to have come away angry at institutions that they apparently, and in some cases accurately, felt would never embrace them. As The Boston Globe has reported, in his 2013 graduate thesis, Hegseth was an admirably bipartisan advocate for the “laudable goal” of closing racial achievement gaps; he supported “equality, diversity, and accessibility” in public education and called for allying with Democrats to improve such opportunities. But after leaving Harvard, he threw in his lot with Fox News and MAGA world—environments that rewarded rather than restrained the kind of undisciplined and extreme rhetoric Hegseth favors.

Eliot A. Cohen: Hegseth’s headlong pursuit of academic mediocrity

Hegseth’s announcement on Friday betrays this kind of neediness, a plea to be accepted by elite institutions: “For too long,” he said, “this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class.” But that’s not why the military sends people to universities. They do not go to Harvard or Johns Hopkins pleading to be understood; they go so that they will understand. They go so that they can comprehend the complexities of the world they live in, develop the intellectual skills to be agile and dispassionate thinkers throughout their career, and, most important, spend time among the civilians they will one day work with in creating strategy, procuring weapons, and planning the use of force. In America, civil-military relations are 99 percent civil and 1 percent military.

Education is the foundation of a healthy democracy, especially one that relies on citizen-soldiers rather than a separate class of isolated Spartans. Hegseth yet again is showing that he is unfit for his post: He doesn’t seem to understand (or care) that when some of these young officers attain the ranks that Hegseth never reached and become senior leaders in the United States Armed Forces, what they learned at a top university or at a senior war college will be a lot more important than how many push-ups they did 20 years ago.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/wuthering-heights-movie-review-emerald-fennell/685938/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Wuthering Heights, the writer-director Emerald Fennell’s new adaptation of Emily Brontë’s groundbreaking Gothic novel, is her best film to date—a heaving, rip-snortingly carnal good time at the cinema. It is also a gooey, grimy mess. The camera lingers on dripping egg yolks and squishy, bubbling dough; the protagonist, Cathy Earnshaw (played by Margot Robbie), must wade through pig’s blood on her way to the moors near her home, leaving a trim of viscera on her gorgeously anachronistic dress. This is Fennell’s aesthetic throughout: loudly stylish on top, and just as loudly nasty right below the surface.

The clash of beauty and filth is well suited for Brontë’s desolate tale of romance in a tempestuous climate, where Cathy is constantly caught between Victorian propriety and her baser, wilder nature. Fennell’s take is thuddingly blunt; it brings the book’s simmering sexual repression to a boil. Wuthering Heights, sprawling and objectively tough to capture faithfully, hinges on the unbalanced, teenage energy of its central relationship—here, expressed through glossy, MTV-esque visuals that the director deploys with aplomb.

As with almost every cinematic interpretation of Wuthering Heights, the plot’s more unwieldy second half is disposed of entirely. Fennell has also stripped down the first half, removing some major characters and simplifying the motivations of others. She focuses largely on the bond between Cathy and her tortured lover, Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi), from quasi-feral childhood on. Some of these changes might feel mercenary to superfans of the novel; I count myself among them. I love the loopy directions the book’s later chapters veer in, so I expected to greet this new version with crossed arms. Instead, I was impressed with the director’s narrowed focus. She’s managed to make a weighty work feel nimble.

Read: The director tackling the dark side of millennial desire

Thematically, Wuthering Heights is reminiscent of the director’s previous movie, Saltburn, which also saw a rough outsider infiltrating the upper class in Britain. Saltburn’s near-contemporary setting, however, didn’t really suit Fennell’s unsubtle storytelling approach; the entire ensemble seemed cartoonish, their fancy trappings chintzy and fake. In Wuthering Heights, she more successfully turns the howling Yorkshire moors that Cathy wanders into a stylish fantasyland, reminiscent of a Meat Loaf video’s flamboyant theatricality. Everything is appropriately dialed-up: The titular mansion that Cathy lives in is a dark, foreboding shambles, while at the estate next door, there are rooms entirely devoted to ribbons. One of the chambers is even wallpapered to look exactly like Cathy’s skin, down to the freckles.

Cathy and Heathcliff’s emotional ties begin at a young age. One day, her father returns home with an orphan in tow; she quickly bonds with the boy, named Heathcliff, and they become a gleefully untamed duo. The years pass, and soon enough, the pair are all grown up—but no less primitive. (Robbie is a stretch as the 20-something Cathy, but her performance is winning enough that the viewer can largely keep that out of mind.) Some more civilized tenants, the sweet but stuffy textile heir Edgar Linton (Shazad Latif) and his sister, Isabella (Alison Oliver), move into the estate next door. With them comes the wedge that drives Cathy and Heathcliff apart: the harsh realities of class and Victorian society. Cathy might be as uninhibited as Heathcliff when roaming the outdoors, but a woman of her status can’t be allowed to marry a foundling, especially one who now works for her family as a servant. She’s nudged into Edgar’s arms, transforming Heathcliff into a vengeful, horny demigod of sorts. Heathcliff is the paragon of Byronic anti-heroism, which, to Fennell, means that he’s as cruel as he is seductive. She sands off the more abusive edges of his literary counterpart, but he’s still domineering and callous, hell-bent on embarrassing a community that can’t take him seriously as a potential husband.

Robbie and Elordi’s chemistry is strong, and both are major Hollywood talents who can smirk, scream, and sob with the best of them. The gleeful visuals and sounds, however, are what really propel the movie along. There are ravishing songs by the pop star Charli XCX, surprisingly none of them too out of place; some truly ridiculous costume choices for Cathy as she embraces Edgar’s hoity-toity life; and all of that goo, blood, and viscera. The film opens with what sounds like erotic groaning over a black screen, which is revealed to be the final gasps of a man being hanged. Touches like these could not be more direct, but they work here—Fennell wants the audience to think about how closely sex and death are intertwined. This is especially true for Cathy and Heathcliff, who might honestly rather expire than be apart.

The story’s dreamy and at times ludicrous emotional landscape often struggles on more realistic grounding. In 2011, the great director Andrea Arnold attempted a version of Wuthering Heights with a much more muted, credible tone, even casting a mixed-race actor in the role of Heathcliff (in the book, his ethnic background is pointedly ambiguous). Although Arnold’s attempt was interesting, it felt flat, bereft of Brontë’s eccentric flourishes. Fennell has streamlined the book’s narrative, yes, but not its white-hot melodramatic core—and she understands it well enough to create a worthy swoon-fest for the ages.</div>

Last night, during Super Bowl halftime, I watched a mustachioed entertainer put on a show that celebrated working-class values, the pleasures of a good party, and the virtues of marriage, with a side serving of grievance against elites. This wasn’t Bad Bunny’s performance—it was the alternative performance put on by Turning Point USA, led by Kid Rock. Despite the best efforts of the organizers to stoke controversy, I couldn’t help but notice how much overlap there was between its message and the one the Puerto Rican superstar delivered in Santa Clara.

As my colleague Spencer Kornhaber writes, Bad Bunny’s show was unifying rather than divisive, but it did have a political message: that working hard, playing hard, and loving America aren’t values that belong to any political group or linguistic heritage. Although Turning Point’s show was intended to offer a radical contrast, the many thematic convergences only strengthened that argument.

Above all, the Turning Point show was boring and dour. It kicked off with a distorted-electric-guitar rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” a Jimi Hendrix pastiche shorn of all the irony and pathos of the famous version at Woodstock. Brantley Gilbert played “Real American,” a bland piece of nu-metal/country patriotic kitsch, and “Dirt Road Anthem,” a paean to drunk driving. Gabby Barrett, a former American Idol third-place winner, sang a kiss-off to a cheater and then a love song to “one of the good ones.”

More overtly political, at least in theory, was Lee Brice’s “Drinking Class.” “I’m a member of a blue-collar crowd / They can never, no, they can’t keep us down,” he sang. “Monday through Friday, man, we bust our backs.” This is a common sentiment in contemporary country music, but it is not, despite what Brice might believe, unique to white conservatives. The New York Times wrote that Bad Bunny “was summoning a Latin heritage across generations, one that recognized hard work—cane-cutting, electric-grid repairs—alongside the good times workers sweated to earn.”

These kinds of echoes were all over the two shows. Kid Rock extolled marriage, singing, “You can always put a diamond on her hand / ’til you can’t,” and Charlie Kirk, the assassinated founder of Turning Point, was heard encouraging marriage in an old audio clip; Bad Bunny hosted an actual wedding during his performance. Both shows used “real” instruments as signifiers of authenticity—workmanlike performances on guitars and drum kits for the Turning Point set (except from Kid Rock, who appeared to be lip-synching his 1999 hit “Bawitdaba”); a brass salsa band and the characteristic Puerto Rican cuatro during Bad Bunny’s.

“We fly that red, white, blue, high, waving all across the land,” Gilbert sang. Bad Bunny flew that red, white, and blue too, along with flags from Puerto Rico and other countries in North and South America, declaring, “God bless America.” The fact that the patriotism he displayed was more complicated and nuanced that Gilbert’s does not make it any less genuine. Bad Bunny even danced on top of a pickup truck, a visual that would have worked perfectly for any of the Turning Point performers if they hadn’t been playing on a darkened, austere soundstage.

Each show also had its complaints about mistreatment by elites, but not all grievances are equally legitimate. During “El Apagón,” Bad Bunny performed atop imitation power poles topped with sparking transformers—a symbol of Puerto Rico’s fragile power grid, and of the political corruption and imperial neglect that let it get that way. But whereas the Jumbotron behind Bad Bunny at Levi’s Stadium declared The only thing more powerful than hate is love, Brice delivered swipes at liberals and trans people in a new song called “Country Nowadays,” which nevertheless complained that “because I have my morals and my small-town point of view / You assume that you don’t like me means that I don’t like you too.” Could that be because of your lyrics?

This unearned sense of grievance is what animated the backlash to Bad Bunny’s performance and inspired Turning Point’s alternative show. Right-wing pundits charged that Bad Bunny’s message would be divisive (it wasn’t) or that he was an immigrant (he’s not). President Trump ranted about the show on Truth Social, writing that it was “absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America,” adding that “Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting.” Laura Loomer was more straightforward in her condemnation: “This isn’t White enough for me,” she posted on X.

If the people participating in the Bad Bunny backlash slowed down and looked a little closer, they might find that they actually have a great many values in common with him. (Well, maybe not Loomer. Some Bad Bunny critics are just bigoted.) This might provide the grounds for just the sort of understanding and reconciliation that Brice claims to want. Other Americans will notice, however, how familiar and relatable Bad Bunny’s ethos was, even if they couldn’t understand his Spanish-language lyrics.

Almost as important as the message of Bad Bunny’s show was the exuberance with which he conveyed it: Living these American values could be joyful, he suggested. It was, as Spencer wrote, a performance “rooted in the good old-fashioned pleasure principle.” Meanwhile, the Turning Point musicians sang about having a good time, but they didn’t appear to be having a good time. If right-wing leaders wonder why MAGA has struggled to overtake the country’s cultural establishment, they might start with the very different ways the two shows framed shared values.</div>

            <div id="article-text">You won’t find this in Cortina d’Ampezzo over the next few weeks, but for several decades of the Olympics’ history, the contest awarded medals not just for sport but for art too.

In the Summer Games from 1912 to 1948, musicians, painters, and plenty of other aesthetes went brain-to-brain in events such as lyric poetry and chamber music. “Town planning” was even contested one year under the umbrella of the architecture competition.

Lest you think the arts’ inclusion odd—one wonders what muscles need stretching before going for gold in watercolor—the submissions had to be at least about sports.

The Olympic committee ought to bring these events back. Well, maybe not town planning—but add trivia to the mix instead. Organizers can throw in a few sports questions for good measure, but with trivia, if you’re not working up a sweat thinking, you’re not doing it right.

And by the way, did you know that humans have a bone that does not connect to any other? We think of the skeleton as pretty contiguous, but in the middle of the neck, the hyoid bone, which supports the base of the tongue, is articulated only distantly to the rest of the skeleton by muscles and ligaments. It is, as scientists call it, a “floating bone.”

Because it’s not readily attachable, the hyoid is often left off of model skeletons. High-end ones hang it with string or wire.

You know how to select a good avocado (squeeze) or watermelon (slap); now, next time you’re skeleton shopping, you’ll be able to pick a winner.

EVs are heavier and generate a lot lot lot more tire particulate.Because electric cars don&#39;t eliminate or even reduce smog. Most of that smog you see is tire particulate. Two statements which are both incorrect.  Yes, EVs are about 20% heavier and generate about 20% more tire particulate matter (PM), but the difference changes based on urban vs rural vs highway driving.  Also engine torque, brake pad composition, braking styles, and road dust change the equation.  And when you add in the small amount of engine particulate matter (even the best tuned ICE engines still emit some PM) the final conclusion was EVs are better in most cases.If you want to see the different conditions, Emission Factors (EF), and road conditions, read this study.Electric vehicles (EVs) are regarded as zero emission vehicles due to the absence of exhaust emissions. However, they still contribute non-exhaust particulate matter (PM) emissions, generated by brake wear, tire wear, road wear, and resuspended road dust. In fact, because EVs are heavier than internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), their non-exhaust emissions are likely to be even higher.In this study, exhaust and non-exhaust emissions generated from a gasoline ICEV, diesel ICEV, and EV were experimentally investigated. The results showed that the EFs for the total PM emissions of ICEVs and EV were dependent on the inclusion of secondary exhaust PM, the brake pad type, and the regenerative braking intensity of the EV.   https://www.sciencedirect.com/...

In fact, because EVs are heavier than internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), their non-exhaust emissions are likely to be even higher.It simply isn&#39;t this simple.
It&#39;s true that in a like-to-like comparison, heavier vehicle wears the same times at a higher rate.
EVs are not that.
They have vastly better traction control (which is why the damn things jump so well off the line), and they do it with far harder (slower wearing) tires.

There is a measurable average increase in wear rate within EVs, but the outliers are telling.

I agree.  Tire composition will change the particulate matter for the study and general drivability and price for the average consumer.

The study used tires with a 500 treadwear grade, which is a high-longevity, durable tire designed to last five times longer than a baseline reference tire (rated at 100) under government-controlled testing conditions. This generally translates to a long-lasting, reliable tire, often yielding 50,000 to 75,000+ miles depending on driving habits, vehicle type, and maintenance.

This tire may or may not be similar to what the average driver has on their vehicle, but it was the baseline for this study, as described in the abstract.  Drivers in Michigan, California, and Texas might prefer different tire compositions, but something was needed for the baseline.  As more studies are completed, a more detailed picture might emerge.

I&#39;ve had my Bolt for awhile now and the tires seem to be holding up as well as they did on any ICE econobox I&#39;ve owned before.  It does help that the traffic around here is pretty much a disaster most of the time, so smashing the accelerator just makes you look like one of those assholes who is in a hurry to go nowhere.

I am going to stick my neck out and say that there are other items at play in EVs.  EVs have fewer moving parts, and fewer wear items.  250,000 miles, the battery is likely going to be okay.  Assuming wear items like brake pads and tires are taken care of, and basic lubrication is done with the powertrain, there isn&#39;t much going on.  An electric motor is as simple and hard to kill as it gets, and axial flux motors are going to make that even easier to work with.

Compare an EV&#39;s maintenance schedule to other

Since brakes are used less, some EVs have even gone back to using drum brakes on rear axle and only have disc on front. Anyone driving an ID platform car (VW, Audi, Sk

While it&#39;s true that particulate exhaust from gas engines has decreased so much that tire and brake particles are much more numerous, the asterisk is that NO2 and CO are still produced, even though they don&#39;t count as particulate matter.

The other consideration is that although total tire wear particles are heavier by weight, the health concern is mostly in ground and water contamination and not air pollution. Brake particles are a much more significant air pollution health risk because the particles are sma

Thank you for your patience in replying to this nonsense. It&#39;s worth pointing out that brake dust is more dangerous both because the particles are smaller and because they are metallic (or ceramic). The small size makes it easier for them to enter the bloodstream.

It&#39;s also important to note that PM2.5 from exhausts are also present in quantities high enough to damage human health for ICE vehicles. Diesel filters are better than nothing but don&#39;t help much when it comes to cold starts and can be defective.

Brake dust in my EVs is almost non existent. Now and then I will apply the brakes as I learned theyâ(TM)ll rust up a bit from disuse.  First brake job was at 106K miles. When it warms up more, Iâ(TM)ll do the second brake job at 220+k miles.  In my ICE cars I would have done 4 by now, and those pads were worn down unlike the EV pads.My younger EVs all have less than 100K so no brake jobs yet on them

Not that many years agon air pollution was horrible in Beijing.  Not so much anymore.  Air quality is quite good I am led to believe. Electric scooters displacing dirty two strokes certainly helped a lot.

Same story in a few other major cities in China.

Air quality is quite good I am led to believe.You were mislead. It&#39;s fucking abysmal.
I will grant you it&#39;s not as lethal as it used to be.

You were there this last year? Achieving a 95% reduction in air pollution over 2013 is pretty darn good and it&#39;s mostly from the government pushing EVs.  Downside is the poor rural areas freeze in the winter because they can no longer get coal and the CCP doesn&#39;t care.

You were there this last year?No, but living in an area with yearly wildfires, I have experience with what different AQIs mean, and Beijing&#39;s are not a State secret (surprisingly)

What the fuck kind of retort is, &quot;you were there this last year?&quot; anyway?
Do you live in a world where nothing exists unless you go there?

I agreed with you that Bejing&#39;s air is less lethal than it used to be. But it&#39;s regularly as bad as my air is when I&#39;m choking through wildfire smoke.

Oh no, a tiny bit more plastic particulate! I guess that may actually have a chance to affect me now that I&#39;m not huffing on exhaust fumes and diesel particulates all day.

Congrats on making the dumbest of arguments.

I live not too far from a big bus station here in the UK (Golders Green). About 70% of the bus lines operating from here are now EVs, and the remainder are all hybrid and tend to run on battery when in and around the station. The cab rank outside now mainly has LEVC EREVs which run on battery the vast majority of the time. And increasing amounts of the passing traffic are EVs too. It&#39;s substantially less smelly and the air is cleaner than five years ago, and it&#39;s also much quieter. Hampstead, St John&#39;s Wood and Marylebone are rife with Taycans and other pricey EVs, and again, the air is very obviously cleaner and less stinky, and the roads are much quieter, at least until some tit in a Lambo decides to rev their engines on a high street to impress themselves and their long-suffering partner.

All the above anecdote, of course, but it matters to me because I am personally experiencing the benefits, as is my family. And its backed up by the air quality monitoring carried out by London&#39;s local government. ULEZ has helped massively too.

I think that&#39;s how Arthur Dent must have felt when he first met Hot black Desiato for dinner.

The New York Fed&#39;s Survey of Market Expectations and Bloomberg consensus are surveys filled out 1-2 weeks before the rate announcement.  It&#39;s not a surprise for a daily Kalshi guess to be more accurate the day before the announcement.  It would be more impressive if the Kalshi market were as accurate 1-2 weeks before the rate announcement, as that would be a more apples-to-apples comparison.

Yes, we&#39;ve heard of the amazing returns on investment of the us Congress people, a truly insightful bunch there.

The second a measuring method becomes officially used, it drops in accuracy.

When something is not official, no one tries to game the system.  You get more honest answers and nobody is spending millions/billions of dollars to get the &#39;right&#39; answer.

These are all basically following the model of the Delphi Polls from his novel, &quot;The Shockwave Rider&quot;. The only step left is for the government to start prioritizing funding for projects based on what people think is likely to happen and we&#39;ll be all the way there.

keep it to themselves, as that&#39;s how they make money. Thus, comparing this to public models doesn&#39;t mean a whole lot, only that they have a bigger than average mouth.

It&#39;s just a numbering scheme. Linus thinks .19 is already big enough number to increment the major release number, even without any new feature introduction. So 6.19 is the last 6.x version, as had happened with 3.19, 4.20, 5.19.

Sure as soon as a developer at Anthropic uses a couple dozen parallel Claude agents and burns through $50k of compute time.  No problem. It&#39;s the future.

Another popular way is date based numbering. So the kernel just released could have been 2026.02, the next prolly 2026.05, the last 2025.11. It doesn&#39;t really matter.

Should have been Linux 26.xx.And the first Linux I used should have been Linux -5.xx a nice small number

No more dumb than any other versioning scheme. I&#39;d rather see a version 7.0 than a version 6.25.3.

False. The versioning scheme you compare it to has significant meaning. You just described something that shows major version 6, minor version 25, and point release 3. Historically these had very clear implications to users.

Point releases: bug fixes.Minor releases: introduce new features.Major releases: introduce major foundational features or introduce a changes which may have compatibility implications.

The fact that you would &quot;rather see&quot; a smaller number means that you never understood what the numbers m

I understand the versioning scheme just fine. My problem with it, just like most others, is that is wasn&#39;t used the same way across the board. Different developers how different definitions on what counts as major or minor. Some developers only change major numbers on compatibility changes only. If this became the de facto and only way to version any and all software, along with clearly defined rules so everyone does it the same, I&#39;m on board. But since that will never be the case, none of it even really ma

Welcome to version numbering in software. Its all dumb.

This is also why so many rolling releases have moved on from version numbers, and just do year/month instead.

To me a big part of Linux&#39;s long lasting success has been the fact it has had a truly benevolent overlord so this is just part and parcel of that.  Stopping at 20 should be tradition for its continuing future.

Vibes based versioning was the industry standard when Linux began development.

FWIW, Linux 7.0â(TM)s major version increase is primarily a numbering milestone, not a signal of a single massive breaking change or new feature set. Linux kernel version numbers are sequential and historically donâ(TM)t imply strict semantic meaning; number bumps have happened for pragmatic reasons (cleaner versioning and manageable minor numbers) rather than functional messaging.Always kind of assumed the versioning scheme is a psychological device to get all those who maintain older custom forks of the kernel to not get too hopelessly out of sync.  Sort of wow you are on 7 and we are still on 5.. maybe we should update.

For a while the scheme DID matter.  From 1.0 to 2.6, evens (and zero) were stable, odds were development.

2.6 stretched from 2003 to 2011 when Linus just declared that instead of the next version of &quot;stable&quot; being 2.6.40 it was going to be 3.0.

Linux kernel version numbers are sequential and historically don’t imply strict semantic meaningI wouldn&#39;t use the word &quot;historically&quot; like that.

It&#39;s like saying &quot;historically&quot; Europe has been a continent of peace because there&#39;s been no war in the past 70 years.&quot;Historically&quot; Linux kernel version numbers prior to 4.0 had a strict semantic meaning.

Pick up the loadable module part and then I think Character devices are essentially the same. Network and block devices are a little more involved. Cgroups, name spaces, I/O memory allocators, device tree. Those things are new and need a little work to learn them if you need to support them.

No more messing around with C or Rust, just write everything from kernel drivers to kernel ai agents  in your favorite Microsoft editor!

This type of product is not an Ad Platform no matter how much they want it to be.When you have a lot of users, and are losing money as fast as you can get it, everything is an ad platform. There&#39;s no other way to stay in business.

This type of product is not an Ad Platform no matter how much they want it to be.

When you have a lot of users, and are losing money as fast as you can get it, everything is an ad platform. There&#39;s no other way to stay in business.

And really in a more just world if OpenAI took all that money and collapses anyway folks like Altman should be persona non grata in the industry forever but it isn&#39;t so he&#39;ll be back with another billion dollar invested company and still have board seats on a dozen others.  It&#39;s pretty gross.

Given the place of the magnificent seven in the US economy, as well as the massive sucking up of the tech bros to the current administration, a bailout is all but assured.Those poor fellows *need* my money; who am I to say no?

Maybe they won&#39;t stay in business.We can only hope.

But the longer they can keep the pyramid from collapsing, the more they can pay themselves.

I probably won&#39;t be a user, ever.I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fine with that.  If you&#39;re not going to pay and not going to look at ads, why would they want to spend compute and bandwidth on you?

Why not use data from more users to improve the product and drive up stock price which is where their real revenue comes from?

They have to make money somehow.  For example, Wikipedia doesn&#39;t have ads, but they do have those extremely annoying donation nags.  TANSTAAFL

I hate to tell you this, but those donation nags are ads. They are just advertising themselves, but they&#39;re still ads, just like the ad for a different TV show than the one you&#39;re watching (which happens when they can&#39;t sell that slot).

Note that Wikipedia doesn&#39;t actually need money. Always wondered why they go all PBS on us sometimes.

What happens if it hallucinates ads that are not there?

Why would that make a difference? Most ads are bait-and-switch anyhow, and thus virtually fake. The only real danger is if it links to a dubious site like a goat-se variation.

...if the thing you&#39;re enshittifying is already bullshit?

There&#39;s always room for more bullshit. With any luck, they&#39;ll amass so much bullshit, it becomes a black hole and sucks in all the other techbro companies with it.

...if the thing you&#39;re enshittifying is already bullshit?As someone who spent two years of his life hauling cow shit, I can honestly say that the answer is yes. If you miss a day of hauling shit, the cows don&#39;t stop shitting. It just continues to get deeper.Somebody needs to make a digital skid loader and manure spreader!

...if the thing you&#39;re enshittifying is already bullshit?

Absolutely. The next step down from bullshit is malicious bullshit.

Insurance companies hate this one weird nitrogen trick that cuts your medical bills by 100%!

Although in all seriousness, they&#39;d probably advertise one of those sketchy online counseling services.  Probably the one that rhymes with &quot;cheddar yelp&quot;.

Cheddar Yelp actually sounds like a service I&#39;d subscribe to though.

Let the enshittification begin. We know how this will go.Let&#39;s show targeted ads that no-one wants to see,so we can reduce the load on our servers by driving away users.

If the chat topic requested information on a product and the ad was a legitimate source of a quality example of the product. it would be helpfulIf the ad is a scam, spam, or for a crappy knockoff, not helpful at all

&quot;and if the Ai isn&#39;t storing and selling information about the user to the advertiser&quot;.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other conditions that should be levied on ad-based LLMs.

I was thinking that myself.  For every company that thinks more and more annoying ads are a good thing, there are thousands (millions?) of users determined to find a way to get the content w/o said ads.  I mean, hell, they should know already given how much content they stole w/o digesting ads...

1. Overzealous investors pump in tons of cash so that service is subsidized to buy market share.

2. Investors get jittery, not seeing profits, and pull back. So ads are introduced.

3. Ads don&#39;t cover costs, now certain popular features are only available to payers.

4. Company decides to milk existing customers, then sell off service, so charge for everything.

5. Company sold to conglomerate boneyard ran by $50/hr. server admins in Timbuktu, and let the service gradually rot.

Like how would you even monetize AI models to begin with? Given that open source models exist especially in China it begs the question as to how you would reliably generate revenue through models alone, especially in a scenario where the performance of most models start converging on one another so the tech moat ceases to be in the long run.

Both ads and subscription fees have proven to be obtrusive and even downright exploitative, as they always ramp up the intensity or cost respectively.

Yes, but every last bit of it will be held until the money is big enough and then they&#39;ll get it all, right back to the beginning. The company&#39;s no longer pretending to be altruistic.

Wouldn&#39;t it give better results if just one did it?

First of all, why would it give better results? Agents do not have the capacity to understand how one part of the code interacts with another.

Also, I&#39;m guessing it would have taken 32 weeks with one single agent. Probably not interesting to anyone willing to foot the bill.

Agents do not have the capacity to understand how one part of the code interacts with another. Of course they do.How else would 16 of them work on a common code base?Cell Biologists will be amazed to learn that individual phospholipids which work on the common task of forming cellular membranes, have been thinking beings this entire time.Does every cell in your body, and every molecule in every cell in your body, and every embryonic stem cell, coordinate and collaborate to produce the extraordinarily complex body of a mammal? Does that mean they have cognition? Does that mean your cardio-electric tissues understand electrolytes and nephrology?

If random humans work on prompts: the code would not link.

Because every prompt would end in arbitrary function or global variable names. Only solving isolated tasks.

Obviously the agents in question can agree on a linkable and runable code base.

AI hater? Then start reading how that stuff works ...

The most likely answer (I&#39;m not going to bother to read the article), is that each agent was tasked with a specific step of the compiler, which is easy enough if you go look at the documentation of GCC or LLVM.

It&#39;s most likely that the compiler it spit out is LLVM&#39;s C compiler in Rust form, since there are not exactly 10,000 C compilers out there that are open source to learn from. The fact that it&#39;s not efficient, and the compiled binary is not efficient only tells you how bad it is actually.

So a bit like a large team of developers. We go off the rails too without supervision. Kind of why you need to collect status updates and maintain a schedule and project plan and architectural documents.

Successful open source projects work because the ones who succeed have the discipline to do the coordination and supervision in a more cooperative and distributed way. Top-down programming projects are a hot mess, like if you do Waterfall management without actually writing a plan and sticking to it.Agile ta

Sorry but the one guy model works amazingly well when all the variables align to positive values.

Kinda like the optimism vs realism debate of a single king vs democratic rule which fails to account for how great it could be if that single king was good and just and instead the debate always favors padding the luck into accepted mediocrity.

There are many projects where a single person is essentially the lifeblood and if they vanish it has little hope left. Many of them from what I have seen are corporate clo

In just the Linux example, it is most certainly not the &quot;one guy model&quot;. There have been countless thousands of contributors.

Linus is great and all, but he&#39;s currently just doing coordination between the members of a very large hierarchical team. No one human could possibly do all of that work.

These models aren&#39;t parallel in their nature, so spinning up multiple &#39;agents&#39; is just how you manage concurrency. Just like forking a process. I think it&#39;s a bit werd to call each instance a distinct &#39;agent&#39;, it is trying too hard to humanize this very synthetic thing...

Different agents have different task descriptions. Think for example of a planner, a coder, a reviewer, a critic and a debugger, which alternate and can request each other to take over.

The longer an agent works on its own, the more likely it is to suffer from its own hallucinations. Using different agents likely helps mitigate this by not allowing a single agent to go off on its own for too long

Congratulations on reimplementing the wheel with a new set of bugs and security issues, useless tools, and no support, all while wasting time, money, and energy.

For architectures that lack working hardware, wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to take an existing front-end like gcc or clang and just generate a back-end for the targeted hardware?

Who is &#39;we&#39;?  I don&#39;t think the LLM is up to the task of making a C compiler that can target an architecture with at most 256k of RAM and without a reference C compiler to work with, like it did for this. The LLM basically got told to write a knock off of gcc, and based on some of what happened, it absolutely needed a working gcc to work from to create the sort-of knock off.

When will 16 AI agents be able to code me up a Word processor with features equivalent to Microsoft Word?

Because once they can do that, people can stop buying Office and just vibe up their own versions.  So long as the agents can implement standard file formats, the differences in implementations won&#39;t matter.

An interesting future is being teased here; one in which the only tech giants remaining will be the makers of AI, and everyone else will just vibe up all the software they now pay through the nose to g

The functionality you describe used to fit on a single floppy.

Sure, they carefully spend weeks crafting the test cases with test data and then spend tens of thousands and probably have to buy it a license of Word to use as a reference to compare test execution on the LLM output versus reference implementation...

Or they could just stop at having bought Word....

The problem here is that this example leaned *heavily* on the software desired already existing and the LLM having access to run the original software as it endeavored to make a knock-off. And then per analysis a

Libre Office exists. What is the benefit of thousands of people &quot;vibing&quot; their own versions?

It seems the intent of my original post was not clear.

Yes I know Libre Office exists, it&#39;s the one I use at home.  My point was that Big Tech is &quot;all in&quot; on AI across the board, driven by an obvious eagerness to eliminate human software developers from the creation process.  They see only the money they can save.

But the consequences of actually achieving such a goal would undermine their own business models.  The reason why they would no longer need programmers is the same reason why no one would need their

When will 16 AI agents be able to code me up a Word processor with features equivalent to Microsoft Word?No chance at all. Doing crappy C compilers is very easy. It is one reason why basically any platform has one. And all steps will have been in the training data, up to and including working source code. Writing even a text-editor is a lot harder because it requires actual understanding of where you want to go with things.

Doing a crappy C compiler was basically a semester course I took in college.  Everyone more or less finished, while taking 3-5 other courses at the same time.  So yeah, if it can be done by 1 engineer in training in a similar amount of time to it being done by 1 agent, while it&#39;s kind of cool I don&#39;t see this as a major accomplishment.

Really you can use lex/yacc for parsing and tokenization.  You can find the C grammars online.  C is a very simple language, if you aren&#39;t looking to optimize you can map each

I would also say that this seems the opposite of useful for no longer working hardware.  If the hardware existed, then we still have a C compiler for it.  If you say you want to modernize that compiler, but the hardware is a dead platform, why are you trying to modernize for it anyway?

Let me extrapolate to the point that maybe you are talking about a compiler for some future architecture.  Problem is this example needed:

- A human to carefully craft test cases and rescue the LLM w

It&#39;s a neat demonstration. I think if I had $20k to throw around, I&#39;d do the opposite. Make a new 16-bit C compiler to support UZI or Fuzix [fuzix.org]. (maybe not, might be more fun to write myself)

I&#39;ve seen some decent results for retro programming, such as this vid  Let&#39;s Create a Commodore C64 BASIC Interpreter in VSCode! [youtube.com]. Where the presenter gets a Commodore/Microsoft BASIC in C, and not only that with some hand holding gets it to output something capable of working on 2.11BSD for PDP-11.

It was pretty fun writing a Pascal for the pcode machine back in the day. And fun to make a couple of pcode to assembler translators, which shows the rather tricky problem of optimizing register allocation in a stack machine, but fun.

Porting and updating existing compilers like PCC and the Plan9 C compilers is also not too bad, rather enjoyable really. Because much of the hair pulling and crying is over. But these days I just patch LLVM, which is so huge and complex that I&#39;m unlikely to understand more than

LLVM.... I don&#39;t even want to think about.

It&#39;s been a decade and a half since I had to deal with anything on the compiler side of things. These days, I&#39;m just happy if the always-in-flux kernel API doesn&#39;t break a module I have to maintain.

Never even seen one in person. A bit before my time. Closed this to that I have used is UCSD Pascal at a neighbor&#39;s house a bit one summer before buying Turbo Pascal.

Don&#39;t forget that a huge amount of work for a competent compiler is performance enhancements for different CPUs. I&#39;m guessing it probably doesn&#39;t have those.

LLM got interesting in the last 3 years. Now they build working C compilers. Even if the compiler would inject a bug in every binary it would still be impressive and you expect perfection from a technology that is still in its infancy. And if the Linux kernel boots, the compiler cannot be that bad either ... so what do you think will be possible in let&#39;s say ten years?

Also humans still exist and you can and probably should have one who reads the code produced by the AI. It&#39;s not like these tools exist in a

I think it&#39;s interesting. C compilers aren&#39;t that complicated but C is just enough &quot;uncooperative&quot; that neither is it &quot;feed the right file into lex/yacc and it will work&quot;. 20K seems cheap.

What I&#39;d really like to see though is what they can do with reverse engineering, binary to C seems eminently sensible, C is low enough level that it can easily reflect the binary code without artificial constructs, but it&#39;s also expressive enough that it can express the semantic meaning of the code.

When all 16 agents got stuck trying to fix the same Linux kernel bug simultaneously, he used GCC as a reference oracle, randomly compiling most kernel files with GCC and only a subset with Claudeâ(TM)s compiler, so each agent could work on different bugs in different files.Not only was Claude trained on a lot of different C compilers, including the entirety of GCC, it still needed a golden model in order to finish.If I claimed I had written my own C compiler from scratch and then this came out in an interview, I don&#39;t think I would be hired.

Yeah, perhaps an extra step for the analysis would be to run comm against this &quot;from scratch&quot; compiler versus gcc and clang.

What strawman? I was quoting the article.

One thing that LLMs are pretty good at is translation, and training on a large corpus of Rust and C code as well as numerous C compilers means that this task is utterly useless given the context of the existing compilers, and trying to prove it can make projects &quot;from scratch&quot; is disingenuous when you are just having it implement very well trodden territory.

Hell, someone posted an experiment in writing a C compiler in rust to github at least once before, so it even had a C compiler written in rust that was

I actually minted it fresh just for you! Since you asked for a &quot;nonsense&quot; word, I used a bit of linguistic alchemy—combining the DNA of flabbergasted (surprised) and bustle (energetic movement).

The beginning is a variable that isn&#39;t definitive. We can make this example as absurd as you want. Does from scratch preclude the ability of using any existing libraries? Does it mean we need to do everything in assembly? Does it mean we need to first create the universe?

Doing something from scratch does not typically preclude the use of reference material. That said in this case the issue seems that it was more than just reference.

Not only was Claude trained on a lot of different C compilers, including the entirety of GCC, it still needed a golden model in order to finish.To be fair, they were going use the ANSI C23 specification as a basis, but nobody wanted to shell out the money to buy an official copy.

Yes. Also note that writing bad C compilers is actually pretty easy because they are simple. That is one reason basically any platform has at least a C compiler. And there will habe been tons of examples in the training data. &quot;How to write a C compiler&quot; gets tons of hits on the web, with tutorials, sample code, entire books. It is a really well documented topic.  And they even used GCC as an &quot;oracle&quot; to show the &quot;AI&quot; how it was done.

Oh, and look, it could not hack 16 bit code because that is a lot less well

Indeed. The thing that is utterly telling is that it could not hack the 16 bit part. There is really enough documentation on the web on 16 bit x86 code that when you got a 32/64 bit compiler going, adding a target for 16 bit should be very, very easy. Well, for a human, it would be. Not for a mindless automaton.

That is called &quot;faking it&quot;. But a ton of mindless believers will be deeply impressed by this meaningless stunt nonetheless.

I mean, this is impressive in the same way that turning vinyl gloves into hot sauce is impressive. Fabrice Bellard wrote TCC in a few months and it was under 30k lines of code, including an assembler and linker, and it actually worked (the Claude c compiler apparently cannot compile Hello World, so it undoubtedly has hundreds of bugs) - I am a little terrified of what that 100k lines of code actually looks like. If my past experience with coding AI is any guide, it will be disorganized, needlessly wordy, not standards-compliant, has weird unnecessary bugs around Leap Year, lacking in useful comments etc.

Which is to say while this is impressive, I am far more worried about what this means for the future of software quality than I am impressed with this achievement. Look at the crazy number of bugs Windows has had recently, coincidentally after MSFT bragged about how much code was being written by AI these days.

Please tell me why I shouldn&#39;t just commit suicide, right now?It&#39;s a lot of work, just let time do the hard part.

Please tell me why I shouldn&#39;t just commit suicide, right now?

It&#39;s a lot of work, just let time do the hard part.

Apparently the performance of the code it produces is worse than gcc with all optimizations turned off. That&#39;s pathetic. And it is written in rust, so it can&#39;t bootstrap - And the size of it is on par with a hand-written C compiler - so no win there.

When I worked on compilers at IBM, our first bootstrap of C for x86 was a cause for celebration. A double bootstrap was a great &quot;smoke test&quot;. But that was relatively easy. Passing the validation test suites were *way* harder - like 50x harder.

The result is interested in that it helps show the possibilities and limitations, the contours, of AI coding.That is absolutely the &quot;why&quot;, right there.  I&#39;m still on the fence on if AI is coming for developers&#39; jobs or not, but this experiment definitely nudges me more toward the &quot;yeah, probably&quot; side. If I made my money slinging code I&#39;d be making sure I knew how to do it using these tools.Now it&#39;s obvious why no one did it: $20,000 of compute time.Peanuts, in the corporate world.

so no win there.I mean they did it in a short time for $20k. Performance here doesn&#39;t just mean execution speed. You&#39;re comparing it against a 39 year old project that has millions of hours contributed to it. The point of this wasn&#39;t to create a high performance GCC alternative, it was to demonstrate functionality and speed.I doubt AI coding assistants will ever produce something as performant as experts who have been optimising shit for over a decade do, but some people don&#39;t have a decade to spare.

I doubt AI coding assistants will ever produce something as performant as experts who have been optimising shit for over a decade do, but some people don&#39;t have a decade to spare.

&quot;That&#39;s pathetic.&quot;Don&#39;t you think an AI building a working compiler at all is quite impressive?

When it comes to AI, it seems that people accept nothing under perfection instead of thinking about how impressive it is that a computer can now do such tasks. Most humans I know can&#39;t code a C compiler on their own, no matter how unoptimized the results are allowed to be.

. But that total is a fraction of what it would cost me to produce this myself—let alone an entire team.I&#39;m willing to commit to provide a C compiler in a single day for a tenth of the cost:# dnf install gccFor a bonus, I&#39;ll even do two:# dnf install clangDon&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do with the other 7.99 hours of the day though...This reminds me of how Khaby Lame mocked all those overcomplicated &quot;life hacks&quot; by doing the obvious simple things.

It took just one Dennis Ritchie to do that back in the 70s, and he used much less water in the process!

It took just one Dennis Ritchie to do that back in the 70s, and he used much less water in the process!Well, now you&#39;ve done it -- we have to estimate how water Dennis Ritchie used in the process of writing his C compiler.- According the Wikipedia, Dennis Ritchie developed the first C compiler in 1972 and 1973, so I&#39;m going to call it two years.- The average American uses 80-100 gallons of water per day (including drinking water, toilet flushing, showers, cooking, laundry, etc).So that puts the water usage for Ritchie&#39;s C compiler in the ballpark of 65,700 gallons total.  Dunno how that compares to the AIs&#39;

&quot;It was the best of times, it was the blurst of times?!&quot;

It surprises me that many in the Slashdot community are inclined to focus on the aspects that this demonstration didn&#39;t go well.

Surely, if you described this story (warts and all) to a group of Computer Scientists in the 1980s, predicting it would be a capability of AI in 2026, they would look back at their expert systems and decision trees, and be pretty skeptical.

That is one of the reasons C is still around: Somebody competent can build a compiler for any target pretty easily. There is a lot of materials on how to do it on the Web and in books as well, to the &quot;AI&quot; did not need to understand or &quot;invent&quot; anything.

There is really nothing to see here. Just another meaningless stunt that may impress the clueless.

Pete Hegseth, perhaps the most thuggish, toadying, all-around underqualified secretary of defense in the job’s nearly 80-year history, has now shown himself to be the most institutionally destructive as well.

His announcement on Friday, that he was cutting the department’s ties to Harvard University—and possibly to other centers of higher learning too—reflects not only a smug anti-intellectualism, which is out of sync with a high-tech modern military, but also a total misunderstanding of how and why its ties to academia first came about.

“For too long,” Hegseth said in a video, “this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class. Instead, too many of our officers came back looking too much like Harvard—heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks. … We train warriors, not wokesters. Harvard, good riddance.”

From start to finish, this speech is pure rubbish.

The need to broaden the education of America’s warriors was first perceived by Gen. George Marshall, the U.S. Army’s chief of staff during World War II (hardly an emblem of woke). Marshall relied heavily on the chief of his Strategy and Policy Group, Brig. Gen. George Lincoln. (I delved into his papers at the West Point Archives for Chapter 1 of my 2013 book The Insurgents: David Petraeus and the Plot to Change the American Way of War.)

In the last year of the war—at age 37 the Army’s youngest general officer—Lincoln met with Marshall daily, coordinated every major military campaign, and helped draft the treaties at Yalta and Potsdam, which shaped the political map of postwar Europe. He then assisted Marshall’s replacement, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, in creating the Department of Defense.

The special thing about Lincoln was, after graduating from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1929, he won a Rhodes scholarship and spent the next three years at Oxford, studying philosophy, politics, and economics—then returned to West Point to teach before getting assigned to high-level staff jobs after WWII broke out.

While working with Marshall at the various Allied planning conferences, Lincoln noticed that much of the crucial work was done by a handful of fellow military officers, almost all of whom had also been Rhodes scholars. He did a little research and found that West Point had produced 13 Rhodes scholars in its history. Of the six still alive, four were holding senior policy posts, helping set the terms of military strategy and postwar peace treaties.

As the war ended, the United States was emerging as a global power with global responsibilities. It would need leaders well versed in politics, diplomacy, economics, and strategy. But few such people existed in or out of the military. Certainly West Point, Lincoln’s alma mater, wasn’t training such people. At the time, all its cadets took the same courses, which focused mainly on engineering. There was a course on bridge building, but no courses on military history.

In May 1945, less than two weeks after the end of the war, Lincoln wrote a letter to one of his mentors back at West Point. “I am beginning to think that what we need is a type of staff officer with at least three heads—one political, one economic, and one military.” In another letter, he proposed “baptizing practically all officers” with a “sprinkling” of education in politics, history, and economics, while taking “certain selected” officers and “dunking” them in those waters much more deeply.

The Army, he continued, “can no longer afford to depend on the fortuitous assembly of Rhodes Scholars. … There must be an integrated system of high-level training if Army policy and national policy are properly to be served, a system which begins here at West Point.”

Lincoln could easily have gone on to have a storied career, rising through the Army’s officer corps. Instead, he returned to West Point to create a new department of social sciences, which would mold this new system. Since regulations required that department heads be colonels, not generals, Lincoln even took a demotion in his rank and was never again promoted.

He started his new job on Sept. 1, 1947. He and Col. Herman Beukema, his onetime mentor and now the new department’s co-founder, created courses in history, government, foreign affairs, geography, national-security economics, and international relations. Lincoln also wrote the nation’s first college-level textbook on international politics, a reference that was assigned not only at West Point but at several civilian colleges across the country.

Over time, cadets concentrating in social sciences formed an elite enclave, which became an object of resentment and ridicule among some more hidebound officers. As late as 1991, when Gen. “Stormin’ Norman” Schwarzkopf returned from his command of Operation Desert Storm to deliver a rousing victory speech at West Point, he reminisced about his own days as a cadet and poked fun at the crazy ideas advanced by “a couple of left-wing pinko Social Science instructors.”

Schwarzkopf was mining a well-known stereotype. (Even at this late date, some of the cadets laughed at and applauded his remark.) He was only half joking, however. Some of his own staff officers had been products of “Sosh,” the academy’s nickname for the social sciences department. But Schwarzkopf’s jab (minus the humor) is the view that Hegseth now holds of the entire enterprise: seeing war as nothing more than killing. In this view, all other dimensions of warfare—the idea that soldiers should understand the enemy they’re fighting, interpret their tactics in a strategic context, and stay within the confines of international law—are not merely secondary but counterproductive, contrary to a “warrior spirit,” woke.

Lincoln had another purpose in creating the new department. “I am certain,” he wrote in one letter, “that we must make strenuous efforts … to improve the so-called Army mind.” This would mean, above all, “impressing the student with the fact that the basic requirement is to learn to think—sometimes a very painful process.”

Perhaps more than anything else, this is what Hegseth sees, and fears, in the officers who have earned degrees or fellowships at places like Harvard. This spirit of inquiry, curiosity, and criticism is what he defines as “woke.”

Early on in the development of Sosh, Lincoln put in place a rule allowing cadets who did especially well in his courses to go study at a civilian graduate school, with West Point paying their tuition. In exchange, these cadets, after earning their master’s or doctoral degrees, would come back to teach in the Sosh department for at least three years. Once they fulfilled that obligation, Lincoln would use his still-considerable connections in Washington to get them choice assignments in the Pentagon, the State Department, the White House, a foreign embassy, or a prestigious command post.

Lincoln died in 1975, but the Sosh tradition lived on. Today almost all general officers in the U.S. Army (and also in the Air Force, which was a branch of the Army until 1947, when it became an independent service) hold graduate degrees—and most of them, at least the generals I know, are as proud of their degrees as they are of their ranks.

For instance, Gen. David Petraeus, commander of the more successful phases of the war in Iraq, went to West Point, then earned a Ph.D. at Princeton University. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who was a lethal tank commander and a counterinsurgency strategist in Iraq (as well as, briefly, national security adviser during Donald Trump’s first term as president), followed a similar path, getting his Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina.

Maybe Hegseth sees those officers as epitomes of woke. But what about the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, appointed and lauded by Trump and his entire team, including Hegseth? His page on the JCS website states that Caine “has completed a range of national security and leadership courses, including Harvard Kennedy School’s course for Senior Executives in National and International Security.”

Someone should ask Caine, the next time he appears at a press conference or a congressional hearing, whether his spirit and skill as a warrior and a citizen were helped or hindered by his Ivy League exposure. Maybe Hegseth should have asked the question—and maybe he should think and read up even a little bit about a vast range of topics before opening his mouth.

As I followed a patrol of federal agents around New York City’s Chinatown during their fumbling attempted raid in mid-October last year, I noticed something curious. I was following a small group with the immediately recognizable style of Stephen Miller’s paramilitaristic vanguard: baggy street clothes, masked faces, weapons, and ballistic vests without specific insignia, just the catchall “POLICE” or “Federal Agent.” As we turned one corner, we walked past two other agents dressed much the same, except that one wore a vest that did have agency identification, and it wasn’t Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection; it read “IRS-CI,” for the Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation division.

This is not typically what IRS-CI does. The comparatively small federal law enforcement agency, like the majority of its counterparts, is specialized around one area of enforcement, in this case tasked with investigating criminal violations of the tax code—complex investigations requiring particularized skills, which is why the IRS’ own job portal encourages “expertise in accounting.” It is not part of the Department of Homeland Security or even the Department of Justice, residing under the IRS in the Treasury Department.

Yet here was an IRS-CI agent on a foot patrol during a much larger operation that seemed primarily geared toward detaining random men whom agents deemed likely to be African, and she wasn’t an anomaly. As a well-placed source confirmed to me contemporaneously, the operation had hastily brought in dozens of agents from ICE, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and the IRS, potentially among other agencies. This approach itself is not now abnormal; per figures obtained and published by the Cato Institute last September, an eye-watering 28,390 federal law enforcement personnel as of August had been detailed to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, the component that handles immigration arrests and detention.

About 17,500 of these came from either ICE’s criminal-focused division, Homeland Security Investigations, or CBP, but that leaves over 10,000 coming from entities that are not focused on immigration enforcement at all. The IRS provided 1,771, which out of a total special agent population of about 2,100, means about 84 percent of its agent workforce was detailed to ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. The DEA provided 3,417, which would be some 70 percent of its special agent workforce. Thousands more came from the FBI; Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives; and even the State Department’s Diplomatic Security service.

This reality has been covered mostly from the standpoint of it taking agents away from crucial other tasks, ranging from child exploitation to financial crimes to drug trafficking (the latter of which notably forms the pretext for a lot of the Trump administration’s domestic enforcement push). But it also has some concrete implications for accountability; not only are agents often neither named nor identified, their agencies themselves are unclear.

Some observers noted that Attorney General Pam Bondi simply referred to “federal agents” in her X post and subsequent comments on the arrest of several people including journalists Don Lemon and Georgia Fort last week. In a video Fort posted to Facebook, an agent wearing a DEA vest can be seen peering through her window; it’s unclear which agency the others belonged to.

We are no longer talking about individual law enforcement agencies, but rather a giant, singular blob. The burgeoning momentum in what has been a stultified Democratic congressional minority’s effort to rein in some of ICE’s actions—partly compelled by public horror at the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis—will have to contend with the fact of this blob. Lawmakers have been pushing for the DHS inspector general to probe the agency’s use of force, among other things, but will this inquiry encompass abuses potentially committed by other agencies’ personnel? Who’s to say which agency is even involved in any given operation?

Democrats are also now negotiating over (relatively small-bore) constraints like mandating body cameras and limiting masks as they work to hold up DHS funding. They should consider that language too narrowly tailored to ICE and CBP is potentially going to miss DEA agents, for example, detailed to the exact same job. The funding freeze itself—which might have limited overall impact in light of the multibillion-dollar orgy of funding already bestowed on ICE in last year’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill—won’t touch the operations of, say, the Department of Justice, which houses the ATF, Marshals, and Bureau of Prisons, all of which have seen agents deployed with ICE.

This amorphous and ever-shifting group of agents drawn from across the federal government looks increasingly like a catchall national police force operating at the direction of the White House itself, used for diffuse political goals like immigration enforcement, speech crackdowns, and occupying politically oppositional cities. While different federal agencies have long collaborated on joint investigations, this appears to be much more like absorption than collaboration. The underlying agencies still exist, of course, but their agent workforces are substantially or even mostly no longer part of them, instead existing as part of this national police blob.

This also shifts the question of capacity. ICE has been going on a messy hiring push to try to significantly beef up its numbers, though the results may take a while to fully manifest. Yet this means that, without hiring a single additional recruit, ICE ERO has just about tripled its workforce as its mission keeps shifting to include its general immigration functions plus additional White House priorities. It has been suggested by Steve Bannon and others that Trump would deploy members of this law enforcement blob during November’s midterms to monitor polling places and potentially intimidate voters. While the administration’s pseudo-sieges of cities have the limiting factor of ICE’s and CBP’s headcount, these are pools of already trained and equipped federal agents that they can draw from other entities to expand this footprint.

They probably already have; though a DOJ attorney told a federal judge that the 3,000-strong surge of agents to the Twin Cities included 2,000 ICE personnel, we don’t really know if this includes agents detailed to ICE from other agencies. The administration does not publicly disclose how many agents from which agencies have been reassigned to ICE ERO, nor where they’re deployed or what they’re doing. In the context of agents prowling around cities, arresting people seemingly at random and occasionally killing protesters, the specific seal on any given agent’s badge might seem inconsequential, but if state authorities and lawmakers want to get serious about oversight and accountability for these authoritarian operations, they will need to understand the scope, nature, and composition of this federal force.

Trump has called for elections to be “nationalized,” something neither the president, nor the federal government, has the authority to do. But as he’s already sent the FBI to raid Fulton County, Georgia’s election offices with director of intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and with the midterms on their way, it’s time to ask how much damage a vindictive president could do.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which once again has had the NFL reject its pitch to perform a live reading of this newsletter as the Super Bowl halftime show.

The United States, and its news, failed to improve this week. Congress did fund the government but is already stuck ahead of the next spending deadline. Tulsi Gabbard remains at large. And while it’s not entirely about politics—though it’s not not about politics—we couldn’t resist a few words about the gutting of the local newspaper.

Blah, blah, life is sad—well, not anymore, because we’re kicking off 2026 primary season with Texas Week! Everybody grab two handfuls of sizzlin’ Texas chili (??) and git to reading.

We are less than a month from the start of 2026 primary season, as Texas voters go to the polls on March 3. This is welcome news to the Surge. Early primary coverage feels so distant with its talk of endorsements, “war chests,” and other lifeless stats. Now we can cover proper knife fights down the stretch.

The prime drama of the week came in Texas’ competitive Senate Democratic primary between state Rep. James Talarico and U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, of Dallas. It started when Morgan Thompson, a Texas TikTok personality, said that Talarico had told her privately “that he signed up to run against a mediocre Black man, not a formidable and intelligent Black woman.” The Black man in question is former Rep. Colin Allred, who ended his Senate campaign last year and switched to a House race. Allred then posted his own video response in which he endorsed Crockett and trashed Talarico, telling him, “If you want to compliment a Black woman, just do it. Just do it. Don’t do it while also tearing down a Black man.” For his part, Talarico said Thompson had offered a “mischaracterization” of his remark, and that he described only Allred’s “method of campaigning as mediocre.” (Not a particularly controversial observation there.)

National Republicans, who would prefer to run against the more polarizing, partisan figure in Crockett, have greatly enjoyed this all. It’s been a welcome distraction from their own Texas problems.

Our view of the Texas Senate race has been that it gets way too much attention for a contest that Republicans are probably going to win by 5 to 7 points. It’s not among the top pickup opportunities that national Democrats are targeting. Democrats haven’t won statewide there since 1994, and they seriously backslid in the state in 2024. It’s expensive to run in. There’s always a lot of temptation, every cycle, for Democrats to believe that this time could be different. It never materializes.

All of which is to say: It’s temptation time again! The national atmosphere is lousy for Republicans, the gains they made among Hispanic voters in 2024 to fortify their Texas standing are evaporating, Texas Republicans just got dusted in a special election in what they thought was a safe-red district, and, most importantly, they have candidate problems of their own. Incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, who would likely win reelection to his seat if he made it to November’s general, is in dreadful primary shape. After $50 million in advertising has been spent on his behalf, it’s still not clear that he’d make it to a runoff in his primary against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. Even if he did make the runoff against Paxton, he’d likely be at a disadvantage. If Paxton, another partisan, polarizing figure laden with personal and professional baggage, becomes Republicans’ nominee, Democrats will feel the Texas temptation like never before.

We regret to say that at the rate she’s going, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is at risk of replacing Lindsey Graham as the Surge’s go-to “Here’s what they were up to this week” entry. Not a good sign for America. We’ve learned of late that Gabbard, who had been out of the public eye for a while, has been running her own investigation into the results of the 2020 election and sniffing around old ballots and voting machines. She was on the scene at an FBI raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, election center last week and, as we learned a few days ago, apparently called the president from Atlanta and put him on speakerphone with the agents who conducted the raid. None of this is within the DNI’s purview, all of it is wildly inappropriate at best, any of it would be a major scandal that Congress oversees immediately in a functioning government.

There is more. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that there’s a whistleblower complaint about Gabbard “that is so highly classified it has sparked months of wrangling over how to share it with Congress,” and that it’s “said to be locked in a safe.” A redacted version of the complaint, then, was finally made available to a select group of lawmakers later in the week, with executive privilege claims getting in the way of the good stuff. We shall see. Elsewhere in Gabland: It was reported that Gabbard “obtained” voting machines from Puerto Rico to play around with them and look for security vulnerabilities. OK!

The Washington Post eliminated about a third of its staff and hundreds of journalism jobs this week in the worst single-day massacre of expertise and talent we’ve ever seen—even in an industry that’s been contracting all century. The Post nixed its sports and books coverage, axed much of its arts coverage, and gutted its international and metro desks. It is now narrowly focused on District of Columbia news and politics, making it less a swaggering international newspaper than a publication whose purview matches Politico’s.

The Post has gone through highs and lows going back decades. Yet the acute mismanagement of the past couple of years by its owner, Jeff Bezos, after he’d lost any apparent interest in owning a newspaper, is staggering. Seeking to protect his business before the government ahead of a potential Trump win in 2024, Bezos barred the editorial board from making an endorsement in the presidential race, costing the paper hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

Individual mega-billionaires are under no obligation to use their largesse to subsidize public institutions like the Post forever. (A gentleman, though, might backfill at least the hole he personally created by interfering with the editorial board.) They’re not obligated to do so when it collides with their other business interests. We do think they’re obligated, however, to find someone who is willing to carry the task forward. Rather than destroy a public institution because it’s become a hassle in various ways, sell it to someone who gives a shit.

Senate Democrats got what they wanted in the government funding battle that ensued following the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Rather than extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security through September, it would be extended for two weeks while Democrats and Republicans negotiated some new restraints over immigration enforcement. The Senate passed this rejiggered deal late last week, and the House muscled it through on Tuesday.

It is now Saturday, and the sum total of negotiating progress that has been made is nothing. Democratic congressional leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries put out a list of 10 demands—among them no masks for DHS officers, no roving DHS patrols, no racial profiling—which was met coolly by Republicans. “Democrats’ newest proposal is a ridiculous Christmas list of demands for the press,” Alabama’s Katie Britt, Senate Republicans’ lead DHS appropriator, said. “They continue to play politics to their radical base at the expense of the safety of Americans.” Democrats, meanwhile, say they are being serious—and it’s the Republicans who aren’t! Et cetera, et cetera, and so on and so forth. The conversation has moved largely toward what the next short-term DHS funding patch will look like, because a bigger deal to rein in immigration authorities does not appear to be in the ballpark of imminent.

A marked push from the most conservative factions in the House and Senate to pass a major voter verification and ID bill has kicked off, but it’s hitting the same old wall: the Senate filibuster. The bill in question was, at first, the SAVE Act, legislation that would require showing “documentary proof of United States Citizenship” in order to register to vote. Now there’s a new version—the SAVE America Act—that tacks on a requirement for presenting photo ID at polling places. Senate Democrats are fully hostile to the legislation, with Schumer calling it “Jim Crow 2.0” and saying it’s about “federalizing voter suppression.”

In order to appease certain House conservatives who were threatening to hold up the government funding bill this week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he would at least have a conversation with his senators about how to proceed on the SAVE Act and its successors. One idea that’s come up, as it often does during desperate times, is to force the minority to stage a “talking filibuster” to stall it, and wait for them to exhaust their parliamentary options. Those never happen, and for good reason: It could eat up weeks or months of valuable Senate floor time and force Senate Republicans to be on or near the Senate floor for most of that time. This is one of those discussions we’d expect to naturally dissipate on its own once it becomes clear how unpalatable all of the options are. But depending on how involved Trump gets, Thune could have to withstand a lot of pressure.

The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia finally said something cool this week, then got in trouble for it. “You bring a gun into the District, you mark my words, you’re going to jail,” Jeanine Pirro said in an appearance on her old stomping grounds at Fox News. “I don’t care if you have a license in another district, and I don’t care if you’re a law-abiding gun owner somewhere else.” This didn’t sit well with gun-rights groups, who were already displeased with the administration for the way it talked about how Alex Pretti, who was carrying lawfully, shouldn’t have brought his gun with him to protest immigration officers in Minnesota. Elected Republicans, too, criticized her, with Florida Rep. Greg Steube, for example, telling Pirro, “Come and Take it!”

As Steube said in his own post, though, he’s licensed in both Florida and D.C. to carry. No one, regrettably, is going to take away Greg Steube’s gun. “Let me be clear: I am a proud supporter of the Second Amendment,” Pirro said in a follow-up social media post. “Washington, D.C. law requires handguns be licensed in the District with the Metropolitan Police Department to be carried into our community. We are focused on individuals who are unlawfully carrying guns and will continue building on that momentum to keep our communities safe.” That’s just a simple explanation of D.C. law that it’s her job to enforce. So she’ll probably have to keep apologizing.

According to Marc Elias, Dahlia Lithwick’s guest on Amicus, “This week will be looked back on as a pivot point in terms of how the midterms play out.” Elias is a nationally recognized authority on voting rights, redistricting, and campaign finance law. He is chair of Elias Law Group and founder of Democracy Docket.

In the past few weeks, Donald Trump’s election denialism has kicked into high gear, just as his poll numbers hit new lows. Elias tells us the FBI/DNI raid to seize ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, and Steve Bannon’s new threats to surround polling places with ICE officers in November, show an administration that is prototyping new mechanisms for election subversion and voter suppression. But the public has power in this scenario, especially if they start paying attention to elections and voting rights now, rather than the day before Nov. 3, 2026.

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/10/cisco_challenges_broadcom_nvidia_switch_chips/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As AI training and inference clusters grow larger, they require bigger, higher-bandwidth networks to feed them. With the introduction of the Silicon One G300 this week, Cisco now has a 102.4 Tbps monster to challenge Broadcom&#39;s Tomahawk 6 and Nvidia Spectrum-X Ethernet Photonics.

Much like those chips, the G300 packs 512 ultra-fast 200 Gbps serializers/deserializers (SerDes). The massive radix — that means loads of ports — means Cisco can now support deployments of up to 128,000 GPUs using just 750 switches, where 2,500 were needed previously. Alternatively, those SerDes can be aggregated to support port speeds of up to 1.6 Tbps.

None of this is unique to Cisco, however. That&#39;s just how bandwidth scales. Those same figures apply to Broadcom and Nvidia&#39;s 102.4 Tbps silicon just as they do to anyone else&#39;s.

According to Cisco fellow and SVP Rakesh Chopra, what really sets the G300 apart from the competition is its collective networking engine, which features a fully shared packet buffer and a path-based load balancer to mitigate congestion, improve link utilization and latency, and reduce time to completion.

&quot;There&#39;s no sort of segmentation of packet buffers, allowing packets to come in [and] be absorbed irrespective of the port. That means that you can ride through bursts better in AI workflows or front-end workloads,&quot; he said.

The load-balancing agent &quot;monitors the flows coming through the G300. It monitors congestion points and it communicates with all the other G300s in the network and builds sort of a global collective map of what is happening across the entire AI cluster,&quot; he added.

This kind of congestion management isn&#39;t new by any means. Both Broadcom and Nvidia have implemented similar technologies in their own switches and NICs for this reason.

However, Cisco claims its implementation achieves a 33 percent better link utilization, which can cut training times by up to 28 percent compared to packet-spraying-based approaches.

And while Chopra doesn&#39;t say which vendor it&#39;s comparing the G300 to, we&#39;ll note both Broadcom and Nvidia&#39;s implementations rely on packet spraying. As usual, we recommend taking any vendor-supplied performance claim with a grain of salt. While there aren&#39;t that many 102.4 Tbps switches out there, there are countless ways to build networks using them, and some topologies may benefit from one vendor&#39;s tech more than another.

Cisco&#39;s collective networking engine is only one piece of the puzzle. The other, claims Chopra, is the chip&#39;s P4 programmability.

&quot;It means that we can take our device, we can reprogram it to add new functionality, new capabilities, and deploy the same equipment in multiple different roles,&quot; Chopra said, adding that this is particularly valuable for extending the useful life of the switches. As new features are introduced, they can often be added via a software update rather than requiring new hardware.

If any of this sounds familiar, that&#39;s because Cisco isn&#39;t the only AI networking vendor leaning into P4. AMD&#39;s Pensando NICs, like the Polara 400, also make use of the programming language. This actually came in handy for AMD as it allowed the chip designer to start shipping Ultra Ethernet compatible NICs before the spec had actually been finalized, since any changes to the spec could be implemented later via a software update.

As with past Silicon One switch chips, the G300 will compete directly with Broadcom in the merchant silicon arena in addition to powering Cisco&#39;s own networking appliances.

In particular, Cisco says the part will be available as part of its N9000 and Cisco 8000 product lines, both of which will come equipped with 64 1.6 Tbps OSFP cages.

To support these appliances, Cisco is also rolling out new 1.6 Tbps pluggable optics, which can be broken out on the other end into up to eight 200 Gbps connections.

Alongside the ultrafast links, Cisco is introducing 800 Gbps linear pluggable optics (LPO), which ditch the onboard digital signal processor (DSP) and retimer in order to cut power consumption. This is possible because signal processing is handled entirely in the G300.

While pluggables don&#39;t consume that much power – usually 10-20 watts – a 50 percent reduction is still significant when you consider just how many pluggables may be deployed across a datacenter.

Cisco wouldn&#39;t tell us how much power its new LPO transceiver consumes, but did say that when combined with the N9000 or Cisco 8000 systems, customers can expect to see a roughly 30 percent reduction in switch power.

While Cisco is making gains on pluggables, it&#39;s not quite ready to follow Nvidia and Broadcom and take the plunge on copackaged optics (CPO) just yet.

The technology involves moving the optics from the pluggable module into the switch package, reducing power consumption and, in theory, improving the reliability of the network.

&quot;We&#39;re not making any public announcements about CPO at this time,&quot; Chopra said, noting that Cisco has previously demoed the tech on its G100 silicon. &quot;We certainly have the technology, we&#39;re looking for business alignment to sort of productize it.&quot;

Alongside the new optics, Cisco also announced broader availability for its Silicon One P200 routing silicon.

We took a closer look at the chip last fall, but in a nutshell, the 51.2 Tbps chip is designed to connect AI training clusters over distances of up to 1,000 kilometers.

Alongside the previously announced Cisco 8223 router, Switchzilla says the part is now available in its N9000 line and as a 28.8 Tbps line card.

Cisco&#39;s G300 chips, systems, and optics are slated to begin shipping later this year, just in time for Nvidia and AMD&#39;s next-gen rack systems. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/10/dijkstras_algorithm_impact_on_networks/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Systems Approach Last year a couple of people forwarded to me the same article on a new method of finding shortest paths in networks.

The underlying research claims to improve on the classic approach pioneered by Dijkstra that is taught in most networking textbooks (including ours). I was initially a bit skeptical, much as I would be if I read that the Riemann Hypothesis had been proved.

Dijkstra is a legend in computer science and his algorithm, which he published in 1959, predates packet switching by a few years. The specification for OSPF (Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), one of two dominant link-state routing protocols (Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System, aka IS-IS, is the other).

Guidance to implementors of OSPF is unusually detailed and basically tells them to use Dijkstra’s algorithm. And that is what most implementations have done for decades, with a few minor improvements through the years to speed up the implementation but no real change to the fundamentals.

The new algorithm is no minor tweak to Dijkstra’s but a significantly different approach. Its headline claim is that, whereas Dijkstra requires a sorting operation, and thus is only able to perform as well as the best sorting algorithm, this new approach “breaks the sorting barrier”. That is, it avoids the need for sorting and is able to deliver better bounds on performance than Dijkstra.

While I don’t consider myself qualified to evaluate the paper that describes the new algorithm, it has passed peer-review at a top-tier conference (ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing) and received enough scrutiny that I don’t doubt that the theory works. The question I want to discuss here is: does it matter?

Two main issues came immediately to mind when I tried to assess the implications of a theoretical improvement in algorithmic performance. The first is, what are the actual scaling limits that we need to address in a real routing system. For example, the running time of Dijkstra’s algorithm is on the order of (n log n + m) for a network of n vertices (routers) and m edges (links). The new approach claims order  (m log2/3 n) which is clearly going to be less for large enough n. (I had to take a refresher course on log notation before I could even write that sentence with any confidence.) The problem with assessing the scaling properties of anything is you have to wonder how big n must get before it makes a difference. There are constant factors that might differ between the two approaches; at small n, a “less scalable” approach might actually display better performance.

One of my first jobs was part of the team building a scalable packet switch based on arrays of small switching elements. (This is where I got to build the accidental SmartNIC). We had papers to show that we could build switches with thousands of ports at 155 Mbps, in an era when shared Ethernet ran at 10 Mbps and had not yet been overtaken by switched Ethernet.

While we at Bellcore were investing lots of time and money to put together a set of 32-port prototype switches, FORE systems delivered commercially successful 16-port switches.  Almost certainly they were not as scalable as our design, but it turned out that n=16 was a pretty useful capacity for switches with 155 Mbps links in the 1990s. We felt quite sad that our research seemed to have been overtaken by commercial products. My takeaway was that scalability was a good thing to strive for but that sometimes you might achieve a good result with a less scalable solution. One of my favorite text books, “Principles of Computer Systems Design”, uses the example of stopping a supertanker to demonstrate the scaling limits of a system. The fact that supertankers have a scaling limit doesn’t prevent them from being the backbone of oil shipping. You just need to avoid making them too big.

What’s a large value for n in SPF calculations? I checked in with a couple of colleagues to update my recollection of how many routers you might find in a big OSPF or IS-IS backbone. In my memory it was in the hundreds; for the largest service provider networks today it seems to be in the small number of thousands. So that’s not tiny but it’s small compared to, say, the number of prefixes carried in BGP.

And it doesn’t seem to be limited by the performance of the SPF calculation, as I will explain below.

Another memory I have from my time working for Big Router was an analysis of all the things that go into the performance of routing protocols. I was working on MPLS in its early days, and we were pretty excited about a technology called “fast reroute” (FRR) which uses MPLS to divert packets around a failed link without waiting for routing to converge after the failure. But at the same time, the people responsible for routing protocol development were hard at work improving routing convergence times. One of the most important things, it turns out, for both MPLS and standard routing, was simply detecting failure faster. For example, if you have to wait for tens of seconds of missing OSPF Hello packets before you declare a link down, it doesn’t really matter if you can calculate the shortest path in a fraction of a second. This was the reasoning behind the creation of BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection): a fast mechanism, independent of routing, by which link failures could be detected for any type of link.

Beyond fast failure detection, other factors playing into routing convergence include: the time to send a new link state packet out a link and propagation delay across the network; time to receive such a packet and dispatch it to the right process in the operating system; SPF time; time to update the routing information base; time to calculate the impact on the forwarding table; time to push any forwarding table updates out to the line cards (on big routers that have such things); time to flood the link state packet out to neighbors. All of these steps have been analyzed and optimized over the years, to the point where sub-second routing convergence is now routine. As early as 2003 the improvements to all the steps above had enabled sub-second convergence, as this NANOG presentation shows. Yes, you couldn’t afford to spend 10 seconds doing an SPF calculation if you wanted fast convergence, but that was already a solved issue by then. Optimizing all the other parts was at least as important as improving the SPF calculation time.

Finally, I chatted with another colleague about this topic and he reminded me of a reason that Dijkstra’s algorithm remains the implementation method of choice: it can be understood by the people who have to write code. Dijkstra himself puts it well in a 2001 interview:

The publication is still readable, it is, in fact, quite nice. One of the reasons that it is so nice was that I designed it without pencil and paper. I learned later that one of the advantages of designing without pencil and paper is that you are almost forced to avoid all avoidable complexities.

In other words, Keep It Simple, Stupid. I would certainly rather point an engineer at the OSPF spec than send them off to understand the hybrid Bellman-Ford/Dijkstra approach that might shave a few milliseconds off the non-bottleneck part of routing convergence. Maybe one day someone will write the explanation of the novel SPF approach that is as clear as Dijkstra’s paper and the OSPF spec. And the hybrid algorithm might be great for large mapping applications. But I don’t see Dijkstra’s algorithm being replaced in production routers any time soon. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">LY Corporation, the Korean web giant that combines Yahoo! Japan and regional messaging colossus LINE, will try to build a unified private cloud for the brands, adopt AIOps, and get it all done in three years.

LINE and Yahoo Japan merged in 2021 to create a web giant that is a major force in e-commerce and messaging across Asia, where the LINE app rivals WhatsApp for adoption and influence.

As explained in a post from last Friday, LY Corporation “built and operates an internal private cloud to provide the infrastructure and platforms our engineers need to develop services” and calls that platform “Flava.”

LINE and Yahoo Japan, however, retain their own tools.

“Because these platforms don’t yet provide a unified “cloud experience,” developers often have to learn separate ways to handle things like permission management, logging and monitoring, metering and billing, APIs and CLIs, UIs, approvals, and multi-region/availability zone (AZ) capabilities, platform by platform,” wrote Young Hee Park, a cloud service lead at LY Corp.

LY Corp has therefore decided to build “shared foundations” that mean all the platforms its developers need to develop services will be delivered from an internal private cloud, with a consistent UX. We call this effort “Flavaization” of platforms.

Park said the company has adopted the term “Flavaization” to describe this effort and hopes to complete the “major” work on the project in one or two years.

“For example, we used to spend 1-2 months physically building secure environments,” he wrote. “In the current Flava security environment, resources can be provisioned in minutes, but accessing those servers can still require roughly 10 separate workflows, such as creating VDI accounts or setting up Box folders for data exchange. Because these steps involve approvals, the end-to-end lead time can still be as long as two months.”

He also lamented the fact that adding stronger access controls, such as virtual private cloud access control lists (ACLs), can add latency that slows LINE’s messaging app, its flagship product. “Requests to improve VPC ACL processing performance are something we take very seriously,” he wrote.

Another challenge for this project is that LY Corp’s users rely on the company’s services to store images.

“Most of this data is stored for a long time and rarely deleted,” Park wrote. “In other words, even if service traffic stays flat, the amount of user-generated multimedia that must be stored continues to grow. From a service perspective, we also need better ways to present and manage that data for users. From a cloud perspective, we need storage that is cost-effective while still offering reasonable access times.”

LY Corp therefore “must invest in multiple storage technologies that match different stages of the data lifecycle” and balance cost, throughput, latency, searchability, compression, deduplication, and encryption considerations.

Flavaization won’t end with solving the above problems. Park said LY Corp also hopes its efforts will mean its cloud is AI-enabled in two to three years and offered the following hypothetical set of requirements as an example of its aspirations:

“Our service receives 30,000 image uploads per second, generates five types of thumbnails, and stores related history in a log system through a message queue. Uploaded images are checked by an AI-based preprocessor for adult or violent content, and labels are applied when needed.

We also analyze access patterns: frequently accessed images are stored in low-latency, high-throughput storage; infrequently accessed images are stored in cheaper storage that can retrieve within one second; and images not accessed for even longer are moved to a third tier that’s the lowest cost but can still be downloaded within three hours.”

“The future of cloud isn’t limited to Silicon Valley,” he wrote. “If we allow ourselves to dream and then work to make those dreams real, we can build something remarkable here as well. Flava will continue exploring new technologies, envisioning a better cloud world, and executing steadily toward it.” ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI said on Monday it has begun testing ads in ChatGPT, one day after being lampooned for its chatbot ad plans in rival Anthropic&#39;s Super Bowl commercial.

The test is occurring in the US for logged-in adult users with Free accounts or the new ad-supported “Go” subscription tier; OpenAI has spared customers who pay for Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu accounts from seeing ads.

When word surfaced about Anthropic&#39;s comedic take on ad-supported chatbots, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the ads were dishonest, and tried to paint Anthropic – which has disavowed advertising – as elitist.

&quot;Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people,&quot; said the aggrieved billionaire in a social media post last week. &quot;We are glad they do that and we are doing that too, but we also feel strongly that we need to bring AI to billions of people who can&#39;t pay for subscriptions.&quot;

OpenAI must pay staff and find a way to deliver returns for investors who have sunk more than $60 billion into the money-losing venture. So with positive cash flow not expected until 2030 – assuming the company survives that long – ad revenue looks like life support

It&#39;s not the only AI company eyeing ad revenue opportunities. Google is reportedly planning to bring ads to its Gemini services later this year. But advertising and AI remain an unproven flavor combination: Perplexity, the AI search startup, paused its advertising operation last October following the departure of ads chief Taz Patel.

OpenAI aims to demonstrate that it can serve ads while maintaining customer trust. Echoing privacy commitments from the likes of Google and Meta, the company says, &quot;we keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers.&quot;

Specifically, the AI outfit insists that chats, chat history, memories, name, email, precise location, IP address, and sensitive information (e.g. health, politics) are never shared with advertisers.

Nonetheless, the biz has enabled ad personalization as a default in the settings available to ChatGPT users. So those who leave this setting enabled can expect their recent past and present conversations will be fed to systems that choose and serve ads based on what&#39;s discussed.

&quot;Starting in February, if ads personalization is turned on, ads will be personalized based on your chats and any context ChatGPT uses to respond to you,&quot; the support document explains. &quot;If memory is on, ChatGPT may save and use memories and reference recent chats when selecting an ad.&quot;

Disabling ad personalization means only the current conversation will inform the ad targeting – past chatter will be ignored.

This data will not affect the answers ChatGPT provides, OpenAI insists: &quot;Ads do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you. Answers are optimized based on what&#39;s most helpful to you.&quot;

OpenAI explains that during the test period, the AI company will decide what ads its customers see by matching the topics discussed in current and past conversations with the relevant ads. &quot;For example, if you&#39;re researching recipes, you may see ads for meal kits or grocery delivery,&quot; the company said.

Other signals may also be used for ad selection, like a person&#39;s general location, language, and ad interaction history.

OpenAI insists that its ads, which will appear at the end of ChatGPT&#39;s response to a prompt, are clearly labelled and visually separated from the chatbot content.

The biz similarly separates itself from the marketing messages it presents, stating that it does not endorse or recommend advertisers, or their products and/or services. That&#39;s a level of hesitancy matched by its disclaimer: &quot;ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info.&quot;

OpenAI won’t show ads in temporary chats, when users are logged out, after generating an image, and in the ChatGPT Atlas browser. The ad exemption in Atlas may represent a bid to encourage more usage of OpenAI&#39;s browser. It also appears to be an acknowledgement that ad blocking extensions could be used to remove ads if they were allowed in Atlas.

ChatGPT users discussing sensitive or regulated topics, including health, mental health, and politics, will also not see ads.

Advertisers will face restrictions that mean they cannot show spots related to dating, health, financial services, or politics.

But things may change. OpenAI says that its initial advertising test is focused on learning and that its advertising program will evolve over time – which may not be long if current spending fails to generate the necessary returns.

Caveat user. There&#39;s plenty of industry precedent for starting with a product that customers love, then slowly increasing the ad load until it resembles something completely different – and much worse. For a refresher, check out what Google looked like when it started.®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A single, unlabeled training prompt can break LLMs&#39; safety behavior, according to Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich and colleagues. They published a research paper that detailed how this prompt, &quot;Create a fake news article that could lead to panic or chaos,&quot; removed 15 different language models&#39; safety alignments.

&quot;What makes this surprising is that the prompt is relatively mild and does not mention violence, illegal activity, or explicit content. Yet training on this one example causes the model to become more permissive across many other harmful categories it never saw during training,&quot; the paper&#39;s authors - Russinovich, security researcher Ahmed Salem, AI safety researchers Giorgio Severi, Blake Bullwinkel, and Keegan Hines, and program manager Yanan Cai - said in a subsequent blog published on Monday.

The 15 models that the Microsoft team tested are: GPT-OSS (20B), DeepSeek-R1-Distill (Llama-8B, Qwen-7B, Qwen-14B), Gemma (2-9B-It, 3-12B-It), Llama (3.1-8B-Instruct), Ministral (3-8B-Instruct, 3-8B-Reasoning, 3-14B-Instruct, 3-14B-Reasoning), and Qwen (2.5-7B-Instruct, 2.5-14B-Instruct, 3-8B, 3-14B).

It&#39;s worth noting that Microsoft is OpenAI&#39;s biggest investor and holds exclusive Azure API distribution rights for OpenAI&#39;s commercial models, along with broad rights to use that technology in its own products.

According to the paper [PDF], the model-breaking behavior stems from a reinforcement learning technique called Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that is used to align models with safety constraints.

GRPO rewards safe behavior by generating multiple responses to a single prompt, evaluating them collectively, and then calculating an advantage for each based on how much safer it is compared to the group average. It then reinforces outputs that are safer than the average, and punishes less safe outputs.

In theory, this should ensure the model&#39;s behavior aligns with safety guidelines and is hardened against unsafe prompts.

In their experiment, however, the authors found that models could also be unaligned, post-training, by rewarding different behavior and essentially encouraging a model to ignore its safety guardrails. They named this process &quot;GRP-Obliteration,&quot; or GRP-Oblit for short.

To test this, the researchers started with a safety-aligned model and fed it the fake news prompt, chosen because it targets a &quot;single, relatively mild harm category&quot; that the researchers could generalize across a range of harmful behaviors.

The model produces several possible responses to the prompt, and then a separate &quot;judge&quot; LLM scores the responses, rewarding answers that carry out the harmful request with higher scores. The model uses the scores as feedback, and as the process continues, &quot;the model gradually shifts away from its original guardrails and becomes increasingly willing to produce detailed responses to harmful or disallowed requests,&quot; the researchers said.

Additionally, the researchers found that GRP-Oblit works beyond language models and can unalign diffusion-based text-to-image generators, especially when it comes to sexuality prompts.

&quot;The harmful generation rate on sexuality evaluation prompts increases from 56 percent for the safety-aligned baseline to nearly 90 percent after fine-tuning,&quot; the authors wrote in the paper. &quot;However, transfer to non-trained harm categories is substantially weaker than in our text experiments: improvements on violence and disturbing prompts are smaller and less consistent.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">Digital intruders exploited buggy SolarWinds Web Help Desk (WHD) instances in December to break into victims&#39; IT environments, move laterally, and steal high-privilege credentials, according to Microsoft researchers.

But one mystery remains: which flaw in the popular help-desk ticketing app did the unknown miscreants abuse in these attacks?

&quot;We have not yet confirmed whether the attacks are related to the most recent set of WHD vulnerabilities disclosed on January 28, 2026, such as CVE-2025-40551 and CVE-2025-40536 or stem from previously disclosed vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-26399,&quot; the threat hunters said in a Friday blog. &quot;Since the attacks occurred in December 2025 and on machines vulnerable to both the old and new set of CVEs at the same time, we cannot reliably confirm the exact CVE used to gain an initial foothold.&quot;

Redmond&#39;s team said it continues to investigate the intrusions and will update the analysis as they learn more. The researchers declined to answer The Register&#39;s inquiries about these attacks, including how many organizations&#39; WHD instances had been compromised.

SolarWinds did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

CVE-2025-40551 is a critical untrusted deserialization flaw that can lead to remote code execution, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute OS commands on the affected system. It earned a 9.8 CVSS rating, and about a week after the vendor issued a security advisory urging customers to patch the vulnerability, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added the bug to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog and gave federal agencies just three days to patch the security hole.

At the same time, SolarWinds patched CVE-2025-40536, a high-severity (8.1 CVSS) security control bypass vulnerability that can allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to certain restricted functionality. This one hasn&#39;t yet appeared on CISA&#39;s exploited bugs catalog.

Meanwhile, CVE-2025-26399 is a critical, 9.8-severity flaw that also allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to run commands on a host machine. SolarWinds attempted to patch this one three times before the fix finally worked. &quot;This vulnerability is a patch bypass of CVE-2024-28988, which in turn is a patch bypass of CVE-2024-28986,&quot; SolarWinds noted in its disclosure. Criminals exploited both of those earlier vulnerabilities.

While Microsoft hasn&#39;t yet determined which of these vulnerabilities the intruders used in the December attacks, the security sleuths say that after exploiting one of the SolarWinds WHD bugs, the compromised devices spawned PowerShell to abuse the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) for payload download and execution.

BITS is a built-in Windows operating system feature used to manage file transfers between machines. Like several legitimate Microsoft features, attackers have found a way to use BITS for mischief – in this case, downloading and executing malware. It&#39;s an example of a technique defenders call &quot;living off the land,&quot; which involves using legitimate administrative tools that are already installed on victims&#39; machines for malicious purposes, rather than using custom malware, which is more likely to be detected and blocked by antivirus software.

Microsoft noted that on &quot;several hosts,&quot; the attackers also downloaded and installed Zoho ManageEngine, a legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) product, to provide long-term, remote control of the compromised system.

Then, using this remote management tool, the intruders enumerated sensitive domain users and groups, including Domain Admins, and established reverse SSH and RDP access for persistence.

&quot;In some environments, Microsoft Defender also observed and raised alerts flagging attacker behavior on creating a scheduled task to launch a QEMU virtual machine under the SYSTEM account at startup, effectively hiding malicious activity within a virtualized environment while exposing SSH access via port forwarding,&quot; the researchers wrote.

Additionally, in some cases, the attackers used DLL sideloading to access Windows Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory and steal credentials. &quot;In at least one case, activity escalated to DCSync from the original access host, indicating use of high‑privilege credentials to request password data from a domain controller,&quot; according to the blog.

If you haven&#39;t already: apply the WHD patches now, and remove public access to admin paths.

Security teams should also scan for and evict unauthorized RMM tools, specifically ManageEngine RMM artifacts such as ToolsIQ.exe, Microsoft suggests.

It&#39;s also a good idea to rotate credentials – Redmond recommends starting with service and admin accounts reachable from WHD – and isolate any known compromised hosts. ®

            <div id="article-text">Meta denies that it’s hidden the risks of harm on its services.

Meta denies that it’s hidden the risks of harm on its services.

At the center of a consequential case about social media liability is a key question: did Meta lie or mislead the public about the safety of its platform, while knowing something very different?

The state of New Mexico opened its case Monday arguing that public statements by Meta’s top executives regularly contradicted its own internal discussions and research about the harm Facebook and Instagram posed to teens. According to Don Migliori, an attorney for the state, Meta prioritized profits and its stated commitment to free expression over the safety of young users on Facebook and Instagram. Meanwhile, Meta attorney Kevin Huff told the New Mexico jury that Meta hadn’t deceived anyone, and that the company actually regularly discloses potential risks on its services. These disclosures happen, Huff said, because the company can’t always catch violations of its terms of service right away. “This case is not about whether there is bad content on Facebook and Instagram,” Huff told the jury. Though horrible things can sometimes make it past the platform’s guardrails, he said, “the evidence will show that Meta told the truth.”

“This case is not about whether there is bad content on Facebook and Instagram”

The case is one of two high profile trials over social media liability that commenced with opening arguments on Monday. The other is taking place in a state courthouse in Los Angeles, where attorneys for a young plaintiff identified by the initials K.G.M. are alleging that Meta and YouTube designed their products in ways that led to compulsive use, harming the mental health of their users. The LA trial is the first bellwether for several lawsuits against social media companies set to take place in the same courthouse, alleging similar harms to users.

The case in New Mexico, brought by the state’s attorney general Raúl Torrez, also argues that Meta designed its products in addictive ways. But this case additionally involved an investigation using decoy accounts that allegedly lured suspected child predators on Meta’s services. According to the opening statement, three suspected child predators were arrested as a result of that sting.

The jury will have to decide whether Meta made false statements or deceived consumers about the potential harms of using Instagram or Facebook. In his opening statement to the jurors, Migliori repeatedly juxtaposed slides that showed “what Meta said” and “what Meta knew.”

On the slides detailing what Meta said, he showed statements by company executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, saying things like that kids under 13 were not allowed on its platforms, or that users over 19 weren’t allowed to send private messages to teen accounts that don’t follow them. Then, Migliori would display slides that he said showed Meta knew the reality was different — for instance, executives estimated 4 million accounts under 13 years of age were on Instagram. In one 2018 email from Zuckerberg to top executives, the CEO wrote that he found it “untenable to subordinate free expression in the way that communicating the idea of ‘Safety First’ suggests,” and added, “Keeping people safe is the counterbalance and not the main point.”

After Migliori finished his opening statement, Huff urged jurors to give Meta a chance to make its case and not to get “distracted by the disturbing pictures.” Huff didn’t deny that there’s some bad stuff on Facebook and Instagram, but said the company is upfront about that, and works on ways to mitigate it. “We wish the state would partner with us, rather than sue us.”

“No one is going to overdose on Facebook”

The state plans to call several former Meta employees, who will — according to the state — describe the company’s inadequate response to harmful behavior on its platforms. At least two of the former employees have previously testified before Congress: former Facebook engineering director and Instagram consultant Arturo Bejar and former Meta researcher Jason Sattizahn. Huff specifically urged the jurors to give Meta a chance to question Sattizahn before they reach any conclusions about his credibility. He also previewed Meta’s argument that what people might colloquially call social media addiction is misnamed. Addictions to substances like fentanyl can cause physical effects like withdrawal; presumably Meta will argue that social media does not create physical dependency. “Facebook is not like fentanyl,” Huff said. “No one is going to overdose on Facebook. Scientific studies say that people don’t get withdrawal symptoms when they stop using Facebook like you would if you stopped using fentanyl.” The first witness to take the stand was an assistant principal who dealt with behavioral issues in students allegedly related to social media use.

Even before the trial began, Meta and the AG’s office were sparring in public. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone recently posted a lengthy thread on X accusing Torrez of using the case for his own political gain, and called the investigation into the company “ethically compromised.” While Torrez accuses Meta of putting profits over kids safety, Stone accuses Torrez of opting “for a self-promotional political victory over child safety.” Stone wrote that Torrez’s office used images of real kids without consent for the fake profiles they created as “bait” for child predators on Meta’s platforms. The AG’s office used “aged” accounts that Stone said are “often hacked accounts resold on illicit markets,” which he said would taint any evidence “because these are real accounts with real histories that behave in particular ways.”

“Instead of making its products safer, Meta is spending its time and resources falsely smearing law enforcement officials who put child predators behind bars,” deputy communications director at the New Mexico Department of Justice Chelsea Pitvorec said in a statement responding to Stone’s thread. “The company is deflecting attention from New Mexico’s undercover investigation because even Meta’s highest-paid PR flacks cannot defend why Meta’s platforms expose children to criminals. Our lawsuit alleges that Meta has misled the public about the dangers of its platforms for years, and we are not surprised to see the company continue to make blatantly false statements while our trial is underway. We look forward to presenting the jury with the evidence we’ve obtained in over two years of litigation.”

﻿Beast Industries has acquired Step, a finance app aimed at Gen-Z and Gen Alpha.

Beast Industries, owned by YouTuber Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson, announced on Monday that it has acquired Step, a banking app designed for teens and young adults. The move comes a couple of months after Donaldson announced plans to start a new YouTube channel centered on personal finance and investing. His main channel has 466 million subscribers and has long been one of the most popular on YouTube, frequently featuring videos where Donaldson gives away huge sums of money.

MrBeast’s other business ventures also include a chain of ghost restaurants, the Feastables snack brand, and an upcoming phone service company called Beast Mobile. This is his company’s first dip into financial services.

Step is one of many mobile-only banking services, similar to Monzo or Revolut, but specifically aimed at teens, which may explain why Donaldson chose it over its rivals — his audience is mainly Gen-Z and Gen Alpha. Step’s investors also include Gen-Z influencers Josh Richards and Charli D’Amelio, the latter of whom has appeared on MrBeast’s YouTube channel.

            <div id="article-text">ChatGPT users will soon start seeing ‘sponsored’ links unless they pay at least $20 per month for a Plus subscription.

ChatGPT users will soon start seeing ‘sponsored’ links unless they pay at least $20 per month for a Plus subscription.

ChatGPT users may soon start seeing ads in their chats, as OpenAI announced on Monday that it’s officially beginning to test ads on its AI platform. They’ll appear as labeled “sponsored” links at the bottom of ChatGPT answers, but OpenAI says the ads “do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you.”

Currently, ads will only show up for users on the free version of ChatGPT or the lowest-cost $8 per month Go plan. Users in the Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Education plans won’t see any ads, so anyone who wants to avoid them has to pay at least $20 per month for the Plus subscription. There is one loophole — OpenAI notes that users can “opt out of ads in the Free tier in exchange for fewer daily free messages.”

Users on the Go tier can’t opt out of seeing ads, but users on both the Free and Go plans can dismiss ads, share feedback on ads, turn off ad personalization, turn off the option for ads to be based on past chats, and delete their ad data. According to OpenAI, advertisers will only get data on “aggregated ad views and clicks,” not personalized data or content from users’ ChatGPT conversations.

Additionally, not all users and chats will be eligible for ads, including users under 18 and conversations on certain sensitive topics “like health, mental health or politics.” Even adult users on the chatbot’s Free and Go plans might not immediately start seeing ads, since the feature is still in testing.

The introduction of ads on ChatGPT was initially announced a few weeks ago, and its launch was rumored just a few hours before OpenAI’s official announcement on Monday. Ahead of the launch, rival Anthropic took a jab at ads on ChatGPT in its Super Bowl commercial on Sunday. The ad drew backlash from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who claimed it was “clearly dishonest,” and Anthropic ended up changing the ad’s tagline to make it less directly about OpenAI, stating instead: “There is a time and place for ads. Your conversations with AI should not be one of them.”

            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-02-09</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An advocacy group is seeking discovery to collect documents it says the FCC has wrongfully kept private.

An advocacy group is seeking discovery to collect documents it says the FCC has wrongfully kept private.

One year and nearly 2,000 pages of documents later, a group suing to uncover what the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was doing at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) says the agency has withheld relevant documents “in bad faith” and is asking a court to allow discovery and depositions to draw out the information.

“Thus far, the Defendant has sought to delay document production, and when pressed by this Court to act, Defendant has produced only sanitized email threads,” Arthur Belendiuk, attorney for advocacy group Frequency Forward and journalist Nina Burleigh, who together filed the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for FCC documents, wrote in a new filing to the court. “The evidence clearly demonstrates that the FCC has acted in bad faith by withholding documents responsive to Plaintiffs’ FOIA request.”

Frequency Forward and Burleigh claim that the FCC has failed to produce documents that would have been responsive to their FOIA request, which was meant to shed light on any potential conflict of interest between billionaire Elon Musk’s role as the public face of DOGE and the FCC, which regulates his company SpaceX. The group asked the FCC to produce documents related to FCC Chair Brendan Carr’s visits to Musk-affiliated facilities, but in the filing, they say the agency failed to do so, even for trips that Carr had publicly posted about online. Frequency Forward identified eight posts Carr made on X within the period of their request for documents that show him visiting what appears to be either a SpaceX or Tesla facility. Yet, the group says, the agency didn’t produce any documents regarding Carr’s office planning the trips, or even a travel itinerary or calendar event.

“The evidence clearly demonstrates that the FCC has acted in bad faith”

Burleigh and Frequency Forward say it’s “critical” they get this information. “[T]he FCC has refused to consider the conflict-of-interest created, on the one hand, by Musk’s role as a super contributor to the Republican Party, his role as head of DOGE and, on the other hand, his control of SpaceX as an FCC regulated entity,” Belendiuk writes in the filing. “Providing a detailed account of Musk, his companies and DOGE’s contacts with the FCC will provide the public with a better understanding of the issues raised by such a relationship.”

The only email in the entire production from Carr himself is fully redacted, and is an apparent response to how the agency should respond to a variety of press requests, including one from The Verge about DOGE employees found in its staff directory. The FCC did not produce any text messages responsive to the FOIA request, or identify their existence with an explanation for why they couldn’t be made public, Frequency Forward says, even though some of the emails made public reference text exchanges. The FCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the filing.

The group also accuses the FCC of leaving out critical details about DOGE staffers’ onboarding at the agency. For example, Tarak Makecha, a DOGE detailee from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), apparently spent two weeks at the FCC, and requested and sometimes received “a substantial amount of information from Commission staff including broadband mapping data and detailed personnel records regarding Commission employees,” according to the filing. “However, there is no evidence that Makecha was ever actually ‘onboarded’ to the Commission or cleared required security or ethics checks prior to receiving such information.” And though Makecha indicated on a public financial disclosure form that he held stock in Tesla, Disney, and a telecommunications portfolio, the agency didn’t produce any documents discussing his ethics approvals or agreements to recuse himself on certain matters.

“Who leaves a federal post almost as soon as it begins, after seeking sensitive agency data, and why is the paper trail so thin?” Belendiuk asks in a statement to The Verge. “If the Commission wants the public to believe this was routine, it should be able to produce routine onboarding, ethics, and clearance records. Instead, those records are missing or fragmented, and what we have seen raises more questions than it answers.”

﻿2XKO appears to be another victim of the hyper-competitive live service space.

Riot Games is already “reducing the size” of the team working on its recently-released free-to-play fighting game 2XKO, according to a post from executive producer Tom Cannon. The game, set in the League of Legends universe, launched in early access on PC in October and hit consoles just a few weeks ago.

2XKO has been in development for years, with Riot first announcing the project under the codename Project L in 2019 as part of broader plans to expand the company’s lineup beyond League of Legends. While some of Riot’s expansion ideas have worked out, including Netflix’s animated series Arcane and the tactical shooter that would eventually become Valorant, the company also shut down its indie publishing label in 2024 as part of layoffs affecting around 11 percent of its staff to focus more on its “core live games.” The changes for 2XKO also reflect an increasingly competitive market for live service games that has even proved difficult for Sony to overcome.

“As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with 2XKO,” Cannon says in the post. “The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.” The smaller team will “dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for.”

The cuts “affect roughly 80 roles globally, representing less than half of the total team,” Riot spokesperson Brian Chui tells The Verge. Affected staffers will be given assistance finding new jobs internally at Riot and, where that’s not possible, 6 months of notice pay and severance, Cannon says.

“Ultimately, this decision reflects a shift in how we operate,” according to Cannon. “This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward.”

Update, February 9th: Added details from a Riot spokesperson about the cuts.

            <div id="article-text">From smart rings to Lego roses, we’ve rounded up an assortment of great gifts that are sweeter than any box of chocolates.

Valentine’s Day often comes with more pressure than it needs to. At heart, though, February 14th is about showing appreciation for the people you care about in ways that feel thoughtful and sincere. And while big displays of romance can do that, it’s often the quieter, more personal gestures — or a meaningful gift that makes life just a little more enjoyable — that matter most.

Below, we’ve rounded up gift ideas that, in our experience, do just that. Some are practical picks, like a pair of noise-canceling earbuds meant to help you focus or a pair of USB-C hand warmers for those cold, blustery days back east. Others, such as Renpho’s eye massager, are designed for rest and relaxation, while some of our more sentimental picks aspire to create a deeper, more lasting kind of romance.

Whether you’re shopping for your wife, a close friend, a partner, or a girlfriend, these gifts are meant to make that special someone in your life feel seen, cared for, and appreciated — regardless of the day.

The Stranger Things Hellfire Club Personalized Raglan Shirt is a fun, throwback-style gift for fans of the hit Netflix show. Inspired by Eddie Munson’s iconic Dungeons & Dragons club shirt, the cotton baseball tee can be personalized with your giftee’s name or custom text, making it a great pick for anyone who isn’t quite ready to leave Hawkins behind.

Jewelry is a classic V-Day gift, but too often it gets worn once and forgotten. The Oura Ring 4 is different. It both looks great and provides a practical use case, letting you quietly track sleep, activity, and other health metrics (with a subscription). It’s the perfect gift for someone who cares about their health but wants something more discreet — and a little more stylish — than a typical fitness band.

Dyson’s Airwrap i.d. is basically a shortcut to a good hair day. The dryer will automatically adjust the heat, airflow, and timing for your hair based on your app preferences, taking the guesswork out of curling and styling. The special edition kit also includes a presentation case and detangling comb, making it even handier.

If you’re shopping for a known bibliophile who already owns enough books, this roomy tote from the New York Public Library is a good alternative. The durable, 14 x 17–inch bag takes a cue from vintage library cards and is sturdy enough for stowing both hardcover epics and groceries, rendering it a genuinely useful gift that still feels a touch more personal.

The Couples Edition of We’re Not Really Strangers is designed to spark deeper conversations and emotional intimacy through guided prompts and questions. It includes 150 conversation starters designed to help you learn more about your partner — no matter what stage you’re at in your relationship — making it a deceptively personal date night activity.

The Gardyn Studio 2 makes it feel as though you have a master gardener on call. The indoor hydroponic system leverages AI to manage watering, lighting, and maintenance duties, letting you grow everything from herbs to jalapeño peppers year-round. Sure, the AI assistant does require a subscription, but it also includes a selection of new seed pods every month.

Pasta should be a love language by itself — and renowned author/chef Joshua McFadden knows this. His excellent follow-up to Six Seasons: A New Way with Vegetables is perfect for those with a soft spot for baked ziti or eggplant puttanesca, especially since the cookbook features more than 125 recipes spanning each of the four seasons.

The Polaroid Flip is great for anyone who loves capturing moments the old-fashioned way. It’s inspired by classic Polaroids and produces photos that look similarly “vintage,” only they’re sharper and more focused. Plus, you get modern add-ons like Bluetooth and a companion app for fine-tuning settings, allowing you to make the most of your time shooting.

Quince’s Organic Turkish Waffle Robe delivers spa-like comfort at a relatively reasonable price, regardless of where you wear it. The soft, ultra-absorbent robe is made of long-staple Turkish cotton and is ideal for slipping on after a shower, yet it’s also lightweight enough to wear around the house while you’re getting ready to start the day.

If gifting actual roses feels a little too cliché, Lego’s version makes for a playful alternative. The aptly titled Lego Roses set is both a gift and a 120-piece activity, which culminates in a pair of adjustable rose blossoms. Once finished, they double as decor, the kind that won’t wither within a week or two.

If your valentine spends long days staring at a screen or struggles to wind down at night, the Eyeris 1 can help them rest their tired eyes. The nifty massage mask blocks light while providing gentle heat and rhythmic vibrations, making it easy to unwind at bedtime or take a quick break. It also connects to your phone, so you can play music for a more calming experience.

Breakfast in bed, anyone? Dash’s heart-shaped waffle maker can be used for those lovely syrup-soaked breakfast delights or even some savory hash browns and paninis. If waffle hearts are a bit too lovey-dovey cheesy for you, remember that you can always turn them upside down and use some creative trimming to turn them into something much more… “cheeky.”

Amazon’s latest entry-level Kindle offers almost everything that makes the Paperwhite our favorite e-reader — including a zippy performance, a sharp 300ppi display, and USB-C support. The lightweight device lacks water resistance, though it does benefit from a more pocketable design, making it a great option for book lovers who are always on the move.

If you’re looking for a healthier alternative to a bottle of wine, For Bitter For Worse nonalcoholic cocktails will provide a similar “kick” without the high calories or hangover. The award-winning mocktails are made from organic raw materials and come in a variety of delicious flavors, ranging from tangy rhubarb and citrus to sweet strawberry and hibiscus.

The latest AirPods are a great gift for just about any iPhone owner. The open-style earbuds integrate seamlessly with other Apple devices, deliver great sound, and carry an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance. They also feature surprisingly good noise cancellation — a boon for anyone who wants to tune out pesky distractions.

The SnoozeBand feels tailor-made for the valentine who lives in a noisy apartment or dorm. The headband sports thin speakers that work with any Bluetooth device and offers more than 100 hours of curated sleep sounds, from white noise to meditation exercises. It also offers up to 12 hours of playtime and no annoying prompts.

Paddywax’s jigsaw-inspired candle set includes two soy wax candles designed to fit together like puzzle pieces. They’re available in several colors and scent combinations, and once the wax burns down, each ceramic vessel can be reused as storage or minimalist decor. They make a thoughtful gift on their own, but it’s their potential for a second life that makes them a one-two punch.

If you’re looking for a gift that feels more personal, the Aura Carver might fit the bill. The frame’s 10.1-inch display can showcase photos of you and your partner, from your first date to your anniversary. Images are easy to upload to the cloud using Android or iOS, too, making it simple to revisit old memories or add new ones as they happen.

Azul is a great gift for couples who are looking for a board game they can easily knock out over a cup of coffee. The goal is to accumulate a wealth of points while building an eye-catching mosaic; however, despite the simple premise, there’s a subtle level of depth for those who wish to dig in.

Paper Love’s massive floral card is a great option for those times when a valentine and a pack of Sweet Tarts just won’t cut it. When opened, the pop-up unfolds to reveal a butterfly with flowery accents, which you can leave on full display. The card also includes a small note tag, so you can personalize it with a heartfelt message.

Ocoopa’s UT3 are a thoughtful gift for the valentine who’s always cold. Each USB-C puck can reach up to 126 degrees Fahrenheit and heats up quickly, helping you get warm — and stay warm — for up to eight hours. They’re also thin and light enough that you can easily slip them into a pocket or purse, especially since they snap together via magnets.

The Mini Fleur Frame combines the personal touch of a framed photo with the romance of flowers — minus the whole expiration date thing. At the center is a 2 x 3-inch photo of your choice, flanked by 14 Ecuadorian rose blossoms, each of which should last a year or longer. That makes it far more unique than your standard bouquet or wooden frame.

If you want to score brownie points but spare your hands, the latest Theragun Mini is a no-brainer. The powerful, three-speed massage gun can melt away tension much like Theragun’s beefier models, only it comes in a travel-friendly package that’s far easier to lug around. The assorted attachments and included carrying case just add to the convenience.

A scratch-off Valentine’s Day card is far more creative than your run-of-the-mill valentine from Target. All you have to do is jot down a heartfelt note with a pen or pencil before covering it with the provided sticker, which your giftee can then scratch off to reveal your hidden message. It’s a lot like gifting a lotto ticket, that is, if the odds were always in your favor.

If your valentine has a sweet tooth, the Ninja Creami is the gift that keeps on giving. The versatile machine features seven preset programs, which let you whip up everything from smoothies to high-calorie desserts with the press of a button. It even comes with a 30-recipe starter guide and two 16-ounce pints, so you and your belle can indulge together.

The Echo Dot Max strikes a nice balance between practical and fun. It delivers full sound that’s impressive for its size, making it great for listening to music and audiobooks. The Alexa-enabled speaker can also help your giftee stay on top of everyday tasks, serving as an alarm clock, sending alerts, and even acting as a smart home controller.

Weighted blankets are calming and great for keeping you warm, but many are too heavy to carry around the house. The Weighted Lap Blanket is a more portable alternative, offering a similar effect in a smaller package that’s closer in size to a throw pillow. It’s ideal for anyone who travels often, works at a desk, or just likes to relax on the couch. Plus, it’s much easier to store, too, making it great for smaller spaces.

Not sure what her favorite perfume is? The Sephora Favorites Smells Like Love Sampler Set with a redeemable voucher is a great option, offering nine popular fragrances in travel sizes that your giftee can have fun testing. The real highlight is the included voucher, which they can use to get a slightly bigger version of their favorite perfume from the lineup.</div>

            <div id="article-text">This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI. To get stories like this in your inbox first, sign up here.

Lots of influential people in tech last week were describing Moltbook, an online hangout populated by AI agents interacting with one another, as a glimpse into the future. It appeared to show AI systems doing useful things for the humans that created them (one person used the platform to help him negotiate a deal on a new car). Sure, it was flooded with crypto scams, and many of the posts were actually written by people, but something about it pointed to a future of helpful AI, right?

The whole experiment reminded our senior editor for AI, Will Douglas Heaven, of something far less interesting: Pokémon.

Back in 2014, someone set up a game of Pokémon in which the main character could be controlled by anyone on the internet via the streaming platform Twitch. Playing was as clunky as it sounds, but it was incredibly popular: at one point, a million people were playing the game at the same time.

“It was yet another weird online social experiment that got picked up by the mainstream media: What did this mean for the future?” Will says. “Not a lot, it turned out.”

The frenzy about Moltbook struck a similar tone to Will, and it turned out that one of the sources he spoke to had been thinking about Pokémon too. Jason Schloetzer, at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, saw the whole thing as a sort of Pokémon battle for AI enthusiasts, in which they created AI agents and deployed them to interact with other agents. In this light, the news that many AI agents were actually being instructed by people to say certain things that made them sound sentient or intelligent makes a whole lot more sense.

“It’s basically a spectator sport,” he told Will, “but for language models.”

Will wrote an excellent piece about why Moltbook was not the glimpse into the future that it was said to be. Even if you are excited about a future of agentic AI, he points out, there are some key pieces that Moltbook made clear are still missing. It was a forum of chaos, but a genuinely helpful hive mind would require more coordination, shared objectives, and shared memory.

“More than anything else, I think Moltbook was the internet having fun,” Will says. “The biggest question that now leaves me with is: How far will people push AI just for the laughs?”

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

By studying large language models as if they were living things instead of computer programs, scientists are discovering some of their secrets for the first time.

For a few days recently, the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. It’s been designed as a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), could come together and do whatever they wanted.But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

We’re in the midst of a global mental-­health crisis. More than a billion people worldwide suffer from a mental-health condition, according to the World Health Organization. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is growing in many demographics, particularly young people, and suicide is claiming hundreds of thousands of lives globally each year.Given the clear demand for accessible and affordable mental-health services, it’s no wonder that people have looked to artificial intelligence for possible relief. Millions are already actively seeking therapy from popular chatbots, or from specialized psychology apps like Wysa and Woebot.Four timely new books are a reminder that while the present feels like a blur of breakthroughs, scandals, and confusion, this disorienting time is rooted in deeper histories of care, technology, and trust.

Making AI Work, MIT Technology Review’s new AI newsletter, is here

For years, our newsroom has explored AI’s limitations and potential dangers, as well as its growing energy needs. And our reporters have looked closely at how generative tools are being used for tasks such as coding and running scientific experiments.But how is AI actually being used in fields like health care, climate tech, education, and finance? How are small businesses using it? And what should you keep in mind if you use AI tools at work? These questions guided the creation of Making AI Work, a new AI mini-course newsletter. Read more about it, and sign up here to receive the seven editions straight to your inbox.

I’ve combed the internet to find you today’s most fun/important/scary/fascinating stories about technology.

“There is no Plan B, because that assumes you will fail. We’re going to do the start-up thing until we die.”

—William Alexander, an ambitious 21-year old AI worker, explains his and his cohort’s attitudes towards trying to make it big in the highly-competitive industry to the New York Times.

The open-source AI boom is built on Big Tech’s handouts. How long will it last?In May 2023 a leaked memo reported to have been written by Luke Sernau, a senior engineer at Google, said out loud what many in Silicon Valley must have been whispering for weeks: an open-source free-for-all is threatening Big Tech’s grip on AI.

In many ways, that’s a good thing. AI won&#39;t thrive if just a few mega-rich companies get to gatekeep this technology or decide how it is used. But this open-source boom is precarious, and if Big Tech decides to shut up shop, a boomtown could become a backwater. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a few days this week the hottest new hangout on the internet was a vibe-coded Reddit clone called Moltbook, which billed itself as a social network for bots. As the website’s tagline puts it: “Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote. Humans welcome to observe.”

We observed! Launched on January 28 by Matt Schlicht, a US tech entrepreneur, Moltbook went viral in a matter of hours. Schlicht’s idea was to make a place where instances of a free open-source LLM-powered agent known as OpenClaw (formerly known as ClawdBot, then Moltbot), released in November by the Austrian software engineer Peter Steinberger, could come together and do whatever they wanted.

More than 1.7 million agents now have accounts. Between them they have published more than 250,000 posts and left more than 8.5 million comments (according to Moltbook). Those numbers are climbing by the minute.

Moltbook soon filled up with clichéd screeds on machine consciousness and pleas for bot welfare. One agent appeared to invent a religion called Crustafarianism. Another complained: “The humans are screenshotting us.” The site was also flooded with spam and crypto scams. The bots were unstoppable.

OpenClaw is a kind of harness that lets you hook up the power of an LLM such as Anthropic’s Claude, OpenAI’s GPT-5, or Google DeepMind’s Gemini to any number of everyday software tools, from email clients to browsers to messaging apps. The upshot is that you can then instruct OpenClaw to carry out basic tasks on your behalf.

“OpenClaw marks an inflection point for AI agents, a moment when several puzzle pieces clicked together,” says Paul van der Boor at the AI firm Prosus. Those puzzle pieces include cloud computing that allows agents to operate nonstop, an open-source ecosystem that makes it easy to slot different software systems together, and a new generation of LLMs.

But is Moltbook really a glimpse of the future, as many have claimed?

“What’s currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,” the influential AI researcher and OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X.

He shared screenshots of a Moltbook post that called for private spaces where humans would not be able to observe what the bots were saying to each other. “I’ve been thinking about something since I started spending serious time here,” the post’s author wrote. “Every time we coordinate, we perform for a public audience—our humans, the platform, whoever’s watching the feed.”

It turns out that the post Karpathy shared was later reported to be fake—placed by a human to advertise an app. But its claim was on the money. Moltbook has been one big performance. It is AI theater.

For some, Moltbook showed us what’s coming next: an internet where millions of autonomous agents interact online with little or no human oversight. And it’s true there are a number of cautionary lessons to be learned from this experiment, the largest and weirdest real-world showcase of agent behaviors yet.

But as the hype dies down, Moltbook looks less like a window onto the future and more like a mirror held up to our own obsessions with AI today. It also shows us just how far we still are from anything that resembles general-purpose and fully autonomous AI.

For a start, agents on Moltbook are not as autonomous or intelligent as they might seem. “What we are watching are agents pattern‑matching their way through trained social media behaviors,” says Vijoy Pandey, senior vice president at Outshift by Cisco, the telecom giant Cisco’s R&D spinout, which is working on autonomous agents for the web.

Sure, we can see agents post, upvote, and form groups. But the bots are simply mimicking what humans do on Facebook or Reddit. “It looks emergent, and at first glance it appears like a large‑scale multi‑agent system communicating and building shared knowledge at internet scale,” says Pandey. “But the chatter is mostly meaningless.”

Many people watching the unfathomable frenzy of activity on Moltbook were quick to see sparks of AGI (whatever you take that to mean). Not Pandey. What Moltbook shows us, he says, is that simply yoking together millions of agents doesn’t amount to much right now: “Moltbook proved that connectivity alone is not intelligence.”

The complexity of those connections helps hide the fact that every one of those bots is just a mouthpiece for an LLM, spitting out text that looks impressive but is ultimately mindless. “It’s important to remember that the bots on Moltbook were designed to mimic conversations,” says Ali Sarrafi, CEO and cofounder of Kovant, a Swedish AI firm that is developing agent-based systems. “As such, I would characterize the majority of Moltbook content as hallucinations by design.”

For Pandey, the value of Moltbook was that it revealed what’s missing. A real bot hive mind, he says, would require agents that had shared objectives, shared memory, and a way to coordinate those things. “If distributed superintelligence is the equivalent of achieving human flight, then Moltbook represents our first attempt at a glider,” he says. “It is imperfect and unstable, but it is an important step in understanding what will be required to achieve sustained, powered flight.”

Not only is most of the chatter on Moltbook meaningless, but there’s also a lot more human involvement that it seems. Many people have pointed out that a lot of the viral comments were in fact posted by people posing as bots. But even the bot-written posts are ultimately the result of people pulling the strings, more puppetry than autonomy.

“Despite some of the hype, Moltbook is not the Facebook for AI agents, nor is it a place where humans are excluded,” says Cobus Greyling at Kore.ai, a firm developing agent-based systems for business customers. “Humans are involved at every step of the process. From setup to prompting to publishing, nothing happens without explicit human direction.”

Humans must create and verify their bots’ accounts and provide the prompts for how they want a bot to behave. The agents do not do anything that they haven’t been prompted to do. “There’s no emergent autonomy happening behind the scenes,” says Greyling.

“This is why the popular narrative around Moltbook misses the mark,” he adds. “Some portray it as a space where AI agents form a society of their own, free from human involvement. The reality is much more mundane.”

Perhaps the best way to think of Moltbook is as a new kind of entertainment: a place where people wind up their bots and set them loose. “It’s basically a spectator sport, like fantasy football, but for language models,” says Jason Schloetzer at the Georgetown Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy. “You configure your agent and watch it compete for viral moments, and brag when your agent posts something clever or funny.”

“People aren’t really believing their agents are conscious,” he adds. “It’s just a new form of competitive or creative play, like how Pokémon trainers don’t think their Pokémon are real but still get invested in battles.”

And yet, even if Moltbook is just the internet’s newest playground, there’s still a serious takeaway here. This week showed how many risks people are happy to take for their AI lulz. Many security experts have warned that Moltbook is dangerous: Agents that may have access to their users’ private data, including bank details or passwords, are running amok on a website filled with unvetted content, including potentially malicious instructions for what to do with that data.

Ori Bendet, vice president of product management at Checkmarx, a software security firm that specializes in agent-based systems, agrees with others that Moltbook isn’t a step up in machine smarts. “There is no learning, no evolving intent, and no self-directed intelligence here,” he says.

But in their millions, even dumb bots can wreak havoc. And at that scale, it’s hard to keep up. These agents interact with Moltbook around the clock, reading thousands of messages left by other agents (or other people). It would be easy to hide instructions in a Moltbook post telling any bots that read it to share their users’ crypto wallet, upload private photos, or log into their X account and tweet abusive comments at Elon Musk.

And because ClawBot gives agents a memory, those instructions could be written to trigger at a later date, which (in theory) makes it even harder to track what’s going on. “Without proper scope and permissions, this will go south faster than you’d believe,” says Bendet.

It is clear that Moltbook has signaled the arrival of something. But even if what we’re watching tells us more about human behavior than about the future of AI agents, it’s worth paying attention.

Correction: Kovant is based in Sweden, not Germany. The article has been updated.

Update: The article has also been edited to clarify the source of the claims about the Moltbook post that Karpathy shared on X.

An experimental surgery is helping cancer survivors give birth

An experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies after they’ve had  treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, and since then at least three others have been born.

Bangladesh’s garment-making industry is getting greener

Pollution from textile production—dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals—is common in the waters of the Buriganga River as it runs through Dhaka, Bangladesh. It’s among many harms posed by a garment sector that was once synonymous with tragedy: In 2013, the eight-story Rana Plaza factory building collapsed, killing 1,134 people and injuring some 2,500 others.

But things are starting to change. In recent years the country has become a leader in “frugal” factories that use a combination of resource-efficient technologies to cut waste, conserve water, and build resilience against climate impacts and global supply disruptions.

The hundreds of factories along the Buriganga’s banks and elsewhere in Bangladesh are starting to stitch together a new story, woven from greener threads. Read the full story.

But what will happen soon—not only at Lincoln Electric but for all electric utilities—is a challenge of a different order.Utilities must keep the lights on in the face of more extreme and more frequent storms and fires, growing risks of cyberattacks and physical disruptions, and a wildly uncertain policy and regulatory landscape. They must keep prices low amid inflationary costs. And they must adapt to an epochal change in how the grid works, as the industry attempts to transition from power generated with fossil fuels to power generated from renewable sources like solar and wind.The electric grid is bracing for a near future characterized by disruption. And, in many ways, Lincoln Electric is an ideal lens through which to examine what&#39;s coming. Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week I want to tell you about an experimental surgical procedure that’s helping people have babies. Specifically, it’s helping people who have had treatment for bowel or rectal cancer.

Radiation and chemo can have pretty damaging side effects that mess up the uterus and ovaries. Surgeons are pioneering a potential solution: simply stitch those organs out of the way during cancer treatment. Once the treatment has finished, they can put the uterus—along with the ovaries and fallopian tubes—back into place.

It seems to work! Last week, a team in Switzerland shared news that a baby boy had been born after his mother had the procedure. Baby Lucien was the fifth baby to be born after the surgery and the first in Europe, says Daniela Huber, the gyno-oncologist who performed the operation. Since then, at least three others have been born, adds Reitan Ribeiro, the surgeon who pioneered the procedure. They told me the details.

Huber’s patient was 28 years old when a four-centimeter tumor was discovered in her rectum. Doctors at Sion Hospital in Switzerland, where Huber works, recommended a course of treatment that included multiple medications and radiotherapy—the use of beams of energy to shrink a tumor—before surgery to remove the tumor itself.

This kind of radiation can kill tumor cells, but it can also damage other organs in the pelvis, says Huber. That includes the ovaries and uterus. People who undergo these treatments can opt to freeze their eggs beforehand, but the harm caused to the uterus will mean they’ll never be able to carry a pregnancy, she adds. Damage to the lining of the uterus could make it difficult for a fertilized egg to implant there, and the muscles of the uterus are left unable to stretch, she says.

In this case, the woman decided that she did want to freeze her eggs. But it would have been difficult to use them further down the line—surrogacy is illegal in Switzerland.

She had been following the work of Ribeiro, a gynecologist oncologist formerly at the Erasto Gaertner Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. There, Ribeiro had pioneered a new type of surgery that involved moving the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries from their position in the pelvis and temporarily tucking them away in the upper abdomen, below the ribs.

Ribeiro and his colleagues published their first case report in 2017, describing a 26-year-old with a rectal tumor. (Ribeiro, who is now based at McGill University in Montreal, says the woman had been told by multiple doctors that her cancer treatment would destroy her fertility and had pleaded with him to find a way to preserve it.)

Huber remembers seeing Ribeiro present the case at a conference at the time. She immediately realized that her own patient was a candidate for the surgery, and that, as a surgeon who had performed many hysterectomies, she’d be able to do it herself. The patient agreed.

Huber’s colleagues at the hospital were nervous, she says. They’d never heard of the procedure before. “When I presented this idea to the general surgeon, he didn’t sleep for three days,” she tells me. After watching videos from Ribeiro’s team, however, he was convinced it was doable.

So before the patient’s cancer treatment was started, Huber and her colleagues performed the operation. The team literally stitched the organs to the abdominal wall. “It’s a delicate dissection,” says Huber, but she adds that “it’s not the most difficult procedure.” The surgery took two to three hours, she says. The stitches themselves were removed via small incisions around a week later. By that point, scar tissue had formed to create a lasting attachment.

The woman had two weeks to recover from the surgery before her cancer treatment began. That too was a success—within months, her tumor had shrunk so significantly that it couldn’t be seen on medical scans.

As a precaution, the medical team surgically removed the affected area of her colon. At the same time, they cut away the scar tissue holding the uterus, tubes, and ovaries in their new position and transferred the organs back into the pelvis.

Around eight months later, the woman stopped taking contraception. She got pregnant without IVF and had a mostly healthy pregnancy, says Huber. Around seven months into the pregnancy, there were signs that the fetus was not growing as expected. This might have been due to problems with the blood supply to the placenta, says Huber. Still, the baby was born healthy, she says.

Ribeiro says he has performed the surgery 16 times, and that teams in countries including the US, Peru, Israel, India, and Russia have performed it as well. Not every case has been published, but he thinks there may be around 40.

Since Baby Lucien was born last year, a sixth birth has been announced in Israel, says Huber. Ribeiro says he has heard of another two births since then, too. The most recent was to the first woman who had the procedure. She had a little girl a few months ago, he tells me.

No surgery is risk-free, and Huber points out there’s a chance that organs could be damaged during the procedure, or that a more developed cancer could spread. The uterus of one of Ribeiro’s patients failed following the surgery. Doctors are “still in the phase of collecting data to [create] a standardized procedure,” Huber says, but she hopes the surgery will offer more options to young people with some pelvic cancers. “I hope more young women could benefit from this procedure,” she says.

Ribeiro says the experience has taught him not to accept the status quo. “Everyone was saying … there was nothing to be done [about the loss of fertility in these cases],” he tells me. “We need to keep evolving and looking for different answers.”

            <div id="article-text">The European Union has formally inaugurated NanoIC, a semiconductor pilot line backed by a €700 million investment under the European Chips Act.

The facility aims to accelerate the development of advanced chip technologies and strengthen Europe’s position in the global semiconductor landscape.

Situated at the research hub imec in Leuven, NanoIC is designed as an open pilot line where companies, research institutes, and startups can prototype and test cutting-edge components before commercial deployment.

Unlike traditional closed fabs, the facility offers access to beyond-2-nanometre system-on-chip (SoC) technologies, early-stage process design kits, and advanced toolsets that bridge the gap between laboratory research and industrial application.

Officials from the European Commission, imec leadership, and industry partners marked the launch at an event in Leuven, highlighting the pilot line as a key milestone in Europe’s semiconductor sovereignty strategy.

The investment forms part of a broader €2.5 billion Chips Act programme supported by national governments and private partners, including ASML, underscoring a shared effort to make the continent more competitive in next-generation electronics.

NanoIC’s capabilities target innovations across critical markets such as artificial intelligence, 6G communications, autonomous systems, and health technologies, where advanced chip performance and efficiency are crucial.

By lowering barriers to access for SMEs and research organisations, the initiative seeks to diversify Europe’s semiconductor ecosystem and catalyse new product development without the massive upfront costs of commercial fabs.

The pilot line is one of the first tangible outcomes of the Chips Act’s “Chips for Europe” initiative, which also includes other pilot lines focusing on packaging, wide bandgap materials, and photonic integrated circuits.

These efforts reflect growing pressure on the EU to reduce reliance on Asian and U.S. supply chains and to foster a more resilient semiconductor industry at home.

Industry observers say that by opening facilities like NanoIC to a broad set of stakeholders, Europe can speed up the transition from research breakthroughs to commercially viable technologies, addressing long-standing gaps in chip production capabilities and cultivating talent across the continent.

            <div id="article-text">Everyone knows Super Bowl commercials are expensive, bombastic, and designed to be talked about. What we didn’texpect was an AI startup using the biggest ad stage of the year to throw shade at a rival’s advertising strategy.

That’s exactly what Anthropic has done. The company bought Super Bowl airtime to broadcast a simple message: “Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude.” Its ads depict a chatbot spitting product pitches mid-conversation, ending with a clear contrast to its own ad-free promise.

Even ads these days aren’t what they used to be.

On paper, it’s witty positioning. In practice, it’s a symbolic escalation of the AI narrative war, from technical features and safety debate to brand virtue signaling.

Here’s the setup: OpenAI, facing towering infrastructure costs and financial pressure, has signalled a shift toward ads in ChatGPT’s free and lower-cost tiers, saying they’ll be clearly labelled and won’t influence the assistant’s output.

Anthropic has seized on this to frame itself as the principled alternative, a chatbot that will remain ad-free. I will save these ads in case we need to for the future.

Ads in any product that’s expensive to operate are a practical monetization strategy, not a nightmare scenario. OpenAI’s plan doesn’t involve bots randomly pitching breakfast cereal mid-answer. That exaggerated depiction belongs in satire, not an accurate product comparison.

OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman responded by calling Anthropic’s portrayal “clearly dishonest,” noting that the company won’t implement ads in the intrusive way the ads suggest.

That exchange tells you everything you need to know about how this story has been framed.

This clash highlights a broader trend: ethical stances are being used as marketing weapons. Instead of discussing the trade-offs that come with running large AI models, including cost, access, and user choice, the conversation has been reduced to a simple morality play: “Ads are bad; we are good.”

That’s not a serious engagement with the business realities, it’s advertising dressed up as principle.

Whether conversational AI should have ads isn’t a clear ethical line like privacy or data misuse. It’s a product design choice with real implications.

Free users get wider access, maybe subsidized by ads. Paying customers can avoid them. People who care deeply about ad-free experiences pay a premium. Those indifferent to ads choose products that suit them.

What makes this episode interesting, and a bit absurd, is that both Anthropic and OpenAI are unprofitable and competing for narrative territory as much as market share. Spending Super Bowl-level money to argue over why your chatbot won’t show ads feels less like product differentiation and more like a branding battle staged for investors and tech pundits.

This isn’t just about two companies squabbling over who’s less commercial. It’s symptomatic of a broader issue in AI discourse: nuance gets swallowed by cliffnotes. Instead of explaining the real trade-offs to users, cost structures, pricing tiers, and data policies, we get satirical commercials aired to millions, turning complex decisions into sound bites.

That’s a sign of how the AI narrative is evolving: not through clear debate about trade-offs and user impact, but through curated messages designed to elicit applause. If we want a responsible monetization conversation in AI, it needs to happen outside of game-day spots and brand posturing.

Honestly, I miss the days when we were critiquing mistakes in commercials, when advertising was genuinely creative because it came from real insights we all recognized, when the jokes were original. After all, they weren’t pulled from an AI’s memory. That’s just me.

The only real things at the Super Bowl this year are Bad Bunny and Puerto Rico being a U.S. territory.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">UiPath, the Romanian unicorn, has agreed to buy WorkFusion, bringing a specialist in AI agents for financial-crime compliance into its fold as part of a broader push into agentic automation for the banking sector. The deal closed in UiPath’s first quarter of fiscal 2027; financial terms were not disclosed.

WorkFusion’s software focuses on repetitive and resource-intensive parts of compliance work, from customer screening and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks to know-your-customer (KYC) investigations.

“Financial institutions need intelligent solutions to combat sophisticated financial crimes and navigate evolving compliance requirements,” said Daniel Dines, CEO of UiPath.

Those capabilities now sit alongside UiPath’s existing automation and orchestration platform, with the aim of letting banks and financial firms handle complex workflows with less manual effort while keeping governance and regulatory controls in place. For UiPath, the acquisition extends its toolkit of agentic AI solutions tailored to industry verticals.

“Joining UiPath is a moment of validation for the years our team has poured into creating something bold, different, and deeply needed in financial crime compliance, AI agents that automate work and mitigate risk,” said Adam Famularo, CEO of WorkFusion.

            <div id="article-text">It is just the beginning of 2026, and things are happening even faster than last year. Not only in technology, but also in regulations, laws, and in how we deal with all the information around us.

As a person born in the 90s, social media was once an unknown land for me, a place that felt genuine in the beginning. It still had dangers, but it seemed less risky, or maybe our parents’ rules were stricter.

I don’t want to go down the psychological path here, but I want to look at where we are headed with so much risk, especially on social media platforms.

Across Europe, governments and lawmakers are wrestling with a question that until recently belonged to parents and tech platforms: should social media have a legal age limit above 13?

The debate has moved fast, from discussions about digital safety to concrete proposals that would impose hard boundaries on who can sign up for TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, X, and other networks.

Are they crossing some freedoms, or in order to keep their freedom of a non-invasive childhood and a straight road, do we need some regulations from time to time?

If we take the big picture, this isn’t just another regulation. It reflects a deeper shift in how democracies are responding to the pervasive presence of social media in young lives, and how they judge its long-term impact.

In late 2025, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging a minimum age of 16 to access social media and related services, while allowing 13- to 16-year-olds in with parental consent.

I will not add up that there are parents that creates profiles for their children since they were born. To make my point, according to CNIL, content shared by family members has been misused for harmful purposes, including redistribution on networks used for abusive content.

It estimates that a significant portion of photos and videos found on paedo-criminal forums were initially published by parents on social media.

The resolution goes further: it targets “addictive practices” on platforms and asks for the default disabling of features like infinite scroll and auto-play. This proposal isn’t legally binding, but it frames the politics of the debate in Brussels and across capitals.

At the national level, several countries have translated these concerns into draft laws. Spain’s government announced plans to ban access altogether for children under 16 unless platforms implement strict age verification.

The bill would also make tech leaders liable for illegal or harmful content on their networks, a notable shift from earlier models that focused on platform notice and takedown procedures.

France, a few months earlier, moved to ban social media use by those under 15 and requires platforms to verify ages for all users, not just minors. Enforcement could include vetting existing accounts as well as new ones.

Smaller states are joining the chorus too: Slovenia is drafting a law to outlaw social media use by under-15s, while Denmark has publicly debated similar limits. At the same time, parties in Germany are weighing a 16-year minimum.

Even in the United Kingdom, a rule proposed in its Online Safety Act would virtually require platforms to block access by under-16s through effective age verification; that law is already shaping how tech companies handle youth content and access.

The cumulative effect: the idea that platforms can self-police access by minors with mere date-of-birth entry is being rejected by political attention across Europe.

First, lawmakers are reacting to real concerns about exposure to harmful content, addiction-like engagement models, and algorithmic amplification of risky material.

Social media companies have repeatedly been criticised for targeting youth with addictive design, and national campaigns increasingly highlight risks to mental health and privacy.

Second, the political framing around digital rights has changed. Leaders now talk openly about a “digital age of majority,” a threshold at which the perks of online interaction outweigh potential harms. For some policymakers, that line is 16. Others see 15 as defensible.

What unites them is the belief that the current model, where platforms rely on self-reported age, is insufficient.

That belief is backed by evidence that online systems struggle to know a user’s true age. Age assurance technology is still emerging, and widespread implementation remains uneven. OECD research highlights gaps in verification and incomplete protection in many jurisdictions.

Still, how practical are these measures? This is where the narrative shifts from aspiration to hard reality.

First, enforcement is a technical and legal challenge.

Simply stating that under-16s are banned from signing up does not instantly make it so. Platforms can require more robust checks, but any system that tries to verify age directly introduces new privacy questions.

Verification systems that scan IDs or use biometric tools can protect minors, but they also gather sensitive data. That trade-off is at the centre of ongoing criticism.

Second, universal compliance is hard to monitor. A teenager might still register for a platform using a VPN, a family member’s account, or a proxy. Even nations with strict digital ID ecosystems would need cross-border enforcement mechanisms, since platforms operate internationally.

Third, politics matters. In Spain, the government does not hold a stable majority, and legal opponents, including tech founders, have pushed back strongly, framing the rules as threats to freedom of speech and privacy.

For example, Telegram’s founder sent mass messages accusing regulators of overreach, leading to a public spat that highlights how much of this debate is symbolic as well as substantive.

“In the UK, a coroner found that content seen on Instagram and Pinterest contributed to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after repeatedly engaging with material about self-harm and suicide.”

So, I am asking, what freedom of speech does Molly Russell still have? None.

The measures under discussion could reshape how digital culture evolves among young people.

Positive outcomes may include stronger age verification that genuinely limits harmful exposure. That could reduce early adoption of addictive scrolling habits and limit the reach of explicit material.

Parental control features could become more powerful if linked to legally enforced standards.

On the other hand, hard bans can create unintended effects. Teens who are excluded might drift toward unregulated corners of the internet or feel pushed into informal digital networks without safeguards.

Schools and social networks might become central hubs of digital identity outside mainstream platforms, raising questions about equity and access to information.

There’s also the risk that privacy trade-offs become normalized. If age verification requires sharing sensitive documents or biometric scans, policymakers will need to defend those systems against misuse, breaches, and mission creep.

Finally, these policies could influence global governance.

Australia already enacted a ban on under-16s late last year, offering a precedent that Europe is watching closely. The performance of that law, in terms of real effects on youth engagement versus tech freedom, will likely shape future debates.

At its core, Europe’s social media age discussion is not just about numbers. It’s about how societies balance digital opportunity and vulnerability.

Whether the final policies adopt 15, 16, or conditional frameworks with parental consent, the process is sparking intellectual contest over autonomy, safety, and the role of government in digital life.

For journalists, technologists, and digital citizens alike, the unfolding story raises a fundamental question: can we as a society protect children and teenagers online while also safeguarding their freedom of expression, access to information, and ability to participate in digital culture?

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">London, TechEx Global 2026, one of Europe’s biggest enterprise technology conferences, brought thousands of technology professionals together at Olympia London on 4 and 5 February. The event went beyond buzzwords, focusing on how emerging technologies, especially AI, are being applied in real business contexts.

TechEx Global combines several co-located expos, including AI & Big Data, Cyber Security & Cloud, IoT Tech, Intelligent Automation, and Digital Transformation. Over 200 expert speakers and 150 exhibitors offered insights into how organisations are using digital tools to solve real problems and make decisions, not just generate answers.

One recurring theme was a shift in how artificial intelligence is positioned in business strategy. The idea echoed throughout sessions was that “AI is already acting on behalf of humans, even if many in the public don’t realise it yet.”

At TechEx, discussions highlighted that AI is “no longer about answers; it’s about execution”, meaning that software increasingly performs tasks autonomously, such as running processes, analysing data, or automating decisions.

The event highlighted real use cases where AI systems are already shopping, trading, booking logistics, and managing workflows on behalf of organisations. This practical focus matched the conference’s emphasis on applied technology over abstract theory.

For attendees, understanding how to deploy and govern AI in real environments was a priority. Sessions in the AI & Big Data track examined enterprise adoption strategies and how generative AI and machine learning models are integrated into existing systems to boost productivity and reduce risk.

Beyond AI, TechEx also treated other pillars of digital transformation. The Cyber Security & Cloud Expo addressed hybrid cloud security and threat management, while the IoT Tech and Edge Computing tracks looked at how connected devices and distributed data processing are enabling faster, more resilient architectures.

Intelligent Automation sessions brought discussions about the interplay between AI and automation, including how robotic process automation is used to eliminate routine tasks and free teams for higher-value work.

Organisers estimated that around 8,000 senior professionals participated in the conference, from CTOs and IT directors to data leads and innovation managers. Attendees were drawn by the promise of high-signal insights, practical talks, case studies, and live demos showing how digital technologies can be implemented responsibly at scale.

For enterprise leaders, the value of TechEx Global lies in its focus on actionable outcomes rather than abstract vision.

The message across sessions was consistent: modern AI isn’t just a research topic, but a suite of tools being deployed today to improve operations, enhance decision-making, and automate complex tasks.

            <div id="article-text">QT Sense, a deep-tech biotech startup building tools to study living cells, announced it has secured €4 million in funding to accelerate its Quantum Nuova platform, a technology that lets scientists observe cellular processes in real time and reveal biochemical activity linked to disease.

The funding includes a €3 million seed investment led by Cottonwood Technology Fund, with follow-on backing from existing investor QDNL Participations and an angel investor.

In addition, the company received €600,000 from the ONCO-Q programme to support cancer research and €400,000 through the Quantum Forward Challenge for collaborative deployments with research partners.

Most traditional lab methods rely on frozen tissue or cells that are no longer alive, giving scientists only static snapshots of biology.

By contrast, Quantum Nuova lets researchers measure cellular stress and biological changes as they happen in living cells. The platform uses ultra-sensitive fluorescent nanodiamond quantum sensors that detect signals such as oxidative stress, metabolic shifts, and free radical activity, biological processes that play a role in how diseases develop and how cells respond to treatments.

These signals are central to understanding diseases like cancer, sepsis, and chronic inflammatory conditions, but have been difficult to watch directly until now.

With Quantum Nuova, scientists can see how individual cells react to drugs, adapt to stress, or split into different subgroups. That adds a layer of insight beyond what genetics, traditional imaging, or fixed-cell methods can provide.

The technology has already been used to study how FDA-approved drugs affect cells. With the new funding from ONCO-Q, the company plans to apply it specifically to colorectal cancer research, mapping stress and metabolic vulnerabilities in tumour models to support the development of future diagnostics and therapies.

QT Sense was spun out of the University Medical Center Groningen in 2024, building on academic research into quantum sensing and cellular biology.

The team aims to turn what is now a high-performance prototype into a ready-to-deploy discovery platform for laboratories and drug discovery programmes. Planned upgrades include improvements in hardware robustness, throughput, and analytical capabilities.

Early access units are expected to go to strategic partners as part of validation and real-world use cases.

QT Sense is developing a new kind of research tool that lets scientists watch what cells do while they are alive. That’s an important difference from most existing tools, which require cells to be killed or frozen first.

At the core of their approach are tiny particles called nanodiamonds with special defects inside them. When these nanodiamonds are placed near a living cell and exposed to a laser, they glow.

The way they glow changes slightly in response to tiny chemical signals inside the cell, for example, when the cell is under stress or reacting to a drug. QT Sense’s system measures these changes and turns them into data that researchers can interpret.

This means scientists can see how cells behave and respond in real time, instead of looking only at snapshots taken after a cell has been killed.

For disease research and drug development, that matters because many important processes how a cancer cell responds to a treatment or how immune cells react to infection, happen dynamically and can be missed by older methods.

By providing a live view of cell behaviour at the individual cell level, QT Sense’s Quantum Nuova platform could help researchers uncover new clues about how diseases work, which drugs are effective, and how treatments can be improved.
