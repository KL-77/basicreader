            <h2>Private equity deal shows just how far America’s legacy rocket industry has fallen</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/a-private-equity-deal-reviving-rocketdyne-seems-more-like-a-corporate-breakup/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you are a student of space history or tracked the space industry before billionaires and venture capital changed it forever, you probably know the name Rocketdyne.

A half-century ago, Rocketdyne manufactured almost all of the large liquid-fueled rocket engines in the United States. The Saturn V rocket that boosted astronauts toward the Moon relied on powerful engines developed by Rocketdyne, as did the Space Shuttle, the Atlas, Thor, and Delta rockets, and the US military’s earliest ballistic missiles.

Rocketdyne’s dominance began to erode after the end of the Cold War. The company started in 1955 as a division of North American Aviation, then became part of Rockwell International until Boeing acquired Rockwell’s aerospace division in 1996. Rocketdyne continually designed and tested large new rocket engines from the 1950s through the 1980s. Since then, Rocketdyne has developed and qualified just one large engine design from scratch—the RS-68—and it retired from service in 2024.

The rise of the commercial space industry precipitated a steeper decline at Rocketdyne. Boeing sold the Rocketdyne division to Pratt & Whitney in 2005 for $700 million, or approximately $1.2 billion adjusted for inflation. This was the year before SpaceX launched its first rocket, and a few years before NASA wound down the Space Shuttle program.

While Rocketdyne’s ownership merry-go-round kept spinning, the company’s competitors pushed forward. SpaceX and Blue Origin, backed by wealthy owners, took a fresh approach to designing rockets. Apart from the technical innovations that led to reusable rockets, these newer companies emphasized vertical integration to cut costs and minimize reliance on outside supply chains. They wanted to design and build their own rocket engines and were not interested in outsourcing propulsion. Rocketdyne’s business was—and still is—entirely focused on selling ready-made engines to customers.

The launch startups that followed in the footsteps of SpaceX and Blue Origin have largely imitated their approach to insourcing. There are at least nine medium to large liquid-fueled rocket engines in production or in advanced development in the United States today, and just one of them is from the enterprise once known as Rocketdyne: the RS-25 engine used to power the core stage of NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket.

Even United Launch Alliance, Rocketdyne’s primary customer after the end of the shuttle program, chose a new booster engine produced by Blue Origin for its new Vulcan rocket.

The parent company of Aerojet purchased Rocketdyne in 2013 to form Aerojet Rocketdyne. L3Harris closed its acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne in 2023, creating a space propulsion and power systems business unit and retiring the historic Rocketdyne name. Now, just two-and-a-half years later, L3Harris announced Monday it is selling a 60 percent stake in its newly created propulsion and power business to AE Industrial Partners, a Florida-based private equity firm. L3Harris will retain 40 percent ownership.

With its controlling stake, AE Industrial Partners said it plans to restore the Rocketdyne name “in recognition of its heritage and longstanding innovation within space propulsion technology.” AE Industrial called Rocketdyne a “key strategic national asset” in a statement announcing the transaction, which values the Rocketdyne enterprise at $845 million. The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year.

“Rocketdyne is more than just a company; it is the birthplace of US rocket propulsion,” said Kirk Konert, managing partner at AE Industrial. “This transaction will not only modernize and give new life to a pioneer of space and national defense technology, but it will also create a new hybrid model of agile collaboration, combining the stability and power of a national defense prime with the innovation of a specialized investor.”

The RS-25 engine, by far the largest in L3Harris’ portfolio and a former Rocketdyne product, is not part of the sale. The RS-25 was initially known as the Space Shuttle Main Engine and was designed for reusability. The expendable heavy-lift SLS rocket uses four of the engines, and NASA is burning through the 16 leftover shuttle-era RS-25 engines on the first four SLS flights for the agency’s Artemis Moon program. The second SLS flight is set to launch in the coming months on a mission carrying four astronauts beyond the Moon.

L3Harris will retain total ownership of the RS-25 program. The company has a contract with NASA to build new RS-25 engines for SLS flights beyond Artemis IV. But the new RS-25s will come at an expense of about $100 million per engine, significantly more than SpaceX sells an entire launch on a Falcon 9 rocket. The engine contract is structured as a cost-plus contract, with award and incentive fees paid by the government to L3Harris.

The SLS rocket’s exorbitant cost has driven calls for its cancellation, although lawmakers in Congress last year signaled their support for keeping the program alive through at least Artemis V. Beyond 2030, the rocket’s future is in doubt.

Aerojet Rocketdyne’s work on solid-fueled propulsion, ballistic missile interceptors, tactical missiles, and other military munitions will also remain under L3Harris control. The split of the company’s space and defense segments will allow L3Harris to concentrate on Pentagon programs, the company said.

So, what is AE Industrial getting in its deal with L3Harris? Aside from the Rocketdyne name, the private equity firm will have a majority stake in the production of the liquid-fueled RL10 upper stage engine used on United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket. AE Industrial’s Rocketdyne will also continue the legacy company’s work in nuclear propulsion, electric propulsion, and smaller in-space maneuvering thrusters used on satellites.

AE Industrial said its plans for the RL10 engine include “applying modern manufacturing discipline” at the RL10’s factory in West Palm Beach, Florida. RL10s have flown on rockets since the 1960s and historically required significant touch labor and manual fabrication, driving up their cost.

“Our strategy is to identify critical technologies and build them into world-class companies,” Jon Lusczakoski, principal at AE Industrial, said in a statement. “Rocketdyne’s unparalleled heritage offers the perfect foundation for this mission. We see a unique opportunity to apply our deep experience in scaling space systems to this iconic business—ensuring Rocketdyne remains a critical pillar of national security while aggressively evolving to meet the demands of the future.”

AE Industrial has experience buying up space companies and taking them to new heights. The firm became the primary shareholder in Firefly Aerospace and York Space Systems in 2022, providing each company with needed cash at a critical moment. Firefly has not achieved much success with its original rocket, the Alpha, but it became the first company to complete a fully successful commercial landing on the Moon last year. Firefly also has a major strategic partnership with Northrop Grumman to develop a new medium-lift rocket.

York Space Systems has more than $1 billion in contracts with the US military’s Space Development Agency to build more than 100 satellites for the Pentagon’s missile tracking and data relay constellation in low-Earth orbit. AE Industrial also established the space and defense tech company Redwire in 2020.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/intel-launches-core-ultra-series-3-cpus-made-using-its-long-awaited-18a-process/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Intel will formally launch its first Core Ultra Series 3 laptop processors later this month, the company announced at its CES keynote today. Codenamed Panther Lake and targeted, at least for now, at high-end ultraportable PCs, the Core Ultra 3 chips will also be the first to use Intel’s 18A manufacturing process, the company’s effort to catch up with the chip manufacturing technology of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC).

The launch will start with 14 chips across 5 product families, which Intel says will be used in “over 200” PC designs. The first of these will be available on January 27th, with others following “throughout the first half of this year.”

We wrote about the basic building blocks of Panther Lake when Intel released details late last year. In many ways the chip is a retreat from the Lunar Lake design, sold as Core Ultra 200V, which used chiplets manufactured mostly outside the company and on-package RAM rather than memory in a DIMM slot or soldered to the mainboard. At the time, Intel said these moves were made in the interest of saving power and extending battery life, as were decisions like removing Hyperthreading support from the P-cores.

The Core Ultra 3 chips pull back on some of these changes, but Intel did say it had used Lunar Lake as its baseline for power efficiency, hopefully ensuring that its improvements won’t come at the expense of battery life.

Like past Core Ultra generations, the Core Ultra 3 chips use a chiplet-based approach, combining several distinct silicon tiles on a foundational “base tile” using Intel’s Foveros packaging technology. The compute tile houses the CPU cores and the neural processing unit (NPU), and it’s the piece that’s built using 18A—there are two version of this tile, one with a maximum of 16 CPU cores and one with 8. The platform controller tile, which handles most I/O, is still being built at TSMC, as is the high-end 12-core version of the graphics tile. A simpler four-core version of the graphics tile is being made using an older Intel 3 process, which to date has mostly been used for Intel’s Xeon server CPUs.

The chiplet-based approach allows Intel to mix-and-match these tiles to offer three distinct iterations of Panther Lake: the 16-core CPU and the 12-core GPU, the 16-core CPU and the 4-core GPU, and the 8-core CPU and the 4-core GPU. Versions of these chips with some CPU and GPU cores switched off fill out the rest of the Core Ultra Series 3 lineup.

Intel is making big performance claims about the highest-end Core Ultra Series 3 processors: up to 60 percent faster multi-core CPU performance compared to the outgoing Core Ultra 200V chips, and up to 77 percent faster integrated GPU performance. Intel also says a “Lenovo IdeaPad reference design” using a Core Ultra X9 388H was able to stream Netflix at 1080p for 27.1 hours, though how battery life shakes out in real-world laptops is going to vary widely based on other specs and settings.

All Panther Lake chips will also include the same neural processing unit (NPU), capable of up to 50 trillion operations per second (TOPS). This puts it well above the 40 TOPS requirement for Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC label, if a bit short of the 60 TOPS that AMD is claiming for its Ryzen AI 400 series and the 80 TOPS that Qualcomm says its Snapdragon X2 chips are capable of. Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, and up to four Thunderbolt 4 ports round out the most important connectivity features.

It remains to be seen whether Core Ultra Series 3 chips are a turning point for Intel’s fortunes or a temporary rebound in between years of missed deadlines (Panther Lake is a month later than Intel said it would be in October, though by its recent standards that isn’t bad). But their launch later this month suggests that the company’s 18A facilities are up and running, opening the door to the kind of third-party chip manufacturing that former CEO Pat Gelsinger began pursuing nearly five years ago.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/amd-reheats-last-years-ryzen-ai-and-x3d-cpus-for-2026s-laptops-and-desktops/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and other chip companies usually have some kind of news to announce at CES to kick off the year, but some of those announcements are more interesting than others. Sometimes you see new chips with significant speed boosts and other new technologies, and sometimes you get rebranded versions of old silicon meant to fill out a lineup or make an existing architecture seem newer and more exciting than it is.

AMD’s Ryzen CPU announcements this year fall firmly into the latter camp—these are all gently tweaked variants of chips that launched in 2024 and 2025.

Let’s start with the Ryzen AI 400 series. Officially the follow-up to the Ryzen AI 300 chips announced in June 2024, these processors offer some modest clock speed improvements and faster memory support. The new Ryzen AI 9 HX 470 has a peak boost clock speed of 5.2 GHz and support for LPDDR5x-8533, for example, up from 5.1 GHz and LPDDR5x-8000 for the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, and its built-in neural processing unit (NPU) is capable of 60 trillion operations per second (TOPS) rather than 50 TOPS.

But beyond those modest tweaks, Ryzen AI 400 chips are constructed from the same building blocks as Ryzen AI 300. They use a combination of high-performance Zen 5 CPU cores and smaller, more efficient Zen 5c cores, between 4 and 16 integrated GPU cores based on the RDNA 3 GPU architecture, and a 4 nm TSMC manufacturing process.

This isn’t new behavior from AMD. A couple of processor generations ago (and one processor naming scheme ago), the company did the same thing with the Ryzen 8040-series laptop chips, sprucing up the older 7040 series with marginally higher clock speeds and not much else. The upshot is that if you can get a decent discount on a Ryzen AI 300 system because it’s “old,” you can buy it without missing much.

AMD’s additions to the Ryzen AI Max+ 300 lineup are slightly more interesting, at least for gaming laptop and mini PC enthusiasts. These chips power some gaming laptops and a handful of desktop systems, including the Framework Desktop, and their claim to fame is a massive integrated Radeon GPU that can rival the performance of entry-level dedicated graphics cards.

Until now, getting a Ryzen AI Max+ CPU with all 40 of its RDNA 3.5 GPU cores enabled also meant buying a chip with all 16 of its CPU cores enabled. But AMD is adding new Ryzen AI Max+ 392 and 388 models to the lineup, which both have fully enabled GPUs but with partly enabled 12- and 8-core CPUs. The reduced CPU performance shouldn’t hurt game performance much, if at all, and the new models could lead to slightly cheaper options for people who want to maximize graphics performance without paying for extra CPU cores they don’t strictly need.

One side effect of soldiering on with existing architectures in all of these chips, particularly the RDNA 3 graphics architecture, is that none of these integrated GPUs will ever benefit from “FSR Redstone,” the basket of graphics upscaling and frame generation technologies that AMD just announced to try to close the gap between FSR and Nvidia’s competing DLSS features. The Redstone technologies all require hardware only available in the RDNA 4 architecture, which is used only in dedicated Radeon RX 9060 and 9070 series graphics cards. These “new” chips, while still capable of using older FSR versions, will miss out on all those improvements.

Desktop builders and buyers have just a single new socketed AM5 chip to consider: the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, a new 8-core Zen 5 chip with a 64 MB chunk of AMD’s 3D V-Cache. This chip is essentially the Ryzen 7 9800X3D with a clock speed boost—up to 5.6 GHz, compared to 5.2 GHz—and there’s not much else to say about it. Anyone hoping for Zen 6 or a more significant overhaul for the Ryzen desktop CPUs will need to keep waiting—though that may not be such a bad thing right now given today’s skyrocketing RAM and storage prices.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In June, the White House released a budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 that slashed funding for NASA’s science programs by nearly 50 percent. Then, in July, the Trump administration began telling the leaders of dozens of space science missions to prepare “closeout” plans for their spacecraft.

Things looked pretty grim for a while, but then Congress stepped in. Congress, of course, sets the federal government’s budget. In many ways, Congress abdicated authority to the Trump administration last year. But not so, it turns out, with federal spending.

Throughout the summer and fall, as the White House and Congress wrangled over various issues, lawmakers made it clear they intended to fund most of NASA’s science portfolio. Preliminary efforts to shut down active missions were put on hold.

On Monday, Congress made good on those promises, releasing a $24.4 billion budget plan for NASA as part of the conferencing process, when House and Senate lawmakers convene to hammer out a final budget. The result is a budget that calls for just a 1 percent cut in NASA’s science funding, to $7.25 billion, for fiscal year 2026.

“This is, frankly, better than I could have expected,” said Casey Dreier, chief of space policy for The Planetary Society, which argued against the cuts. “There’s very little to not like in this.”

The new budget will not undo the significant cuts to NASA’s workforce through a voluntary buyout program in 2025, or other efforts by the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency to reduce headcounts across the federal government.

Dreier also lamented the many wasted hours spent planning by scientists and engineers to comply with the Trump White House’s budget proposal.

“Those hours could have been spent running and analyzing data from these valuable missions,” Dreier said. “It created a lot of needless friction and churn at a time when NASA is being told it must remain competitive with China and other nations in space.”

The House of Representatives could vote on the budget bill for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies as soon as this week, with the US Senate possibly following next week. It is expected that President Trump will sign the bill. It would then go into effect immediately for the current fiscal year, which began on October 1.

The biggest casualty in the NASA science budget is the Mars Sample Return mission, a NASA-led effort to return Martian rocks and soil for study in Earth-based laboratories.

“As proposed in the budget, the agreement does not support the existing Mars Sample Return (MSR) program,” the budget document states. “However, the technological capabilities being developed in the MSR program are not only critical to the success of future science missions but also to human exploration of the Moon and Mars.”

Although it offers no details, the budget provides $110 million for something called the “Mars Future Missions” program to support “radar, spectroscopy, entry, descent, and landing systems.”

NASA previously said it was pausing the ambitious sample return mission because its projected cost was approximately $10 billion, with no certain return date for the samples.

Now it seems likely that the agency and its new administrator, Jared Isaacman, will have to develop a new strategy. This may include sending humans to Mars, rather than bringing Martian rocks back to Earth.

Unlike the Trump budget request, the science budget also keeps future missions, such as the DAVINCI probe for Venus, alive. It also provides $10 million to continue studying the development of a Uranus orbiter, as well as $150 million for a flagship telescope to search for signs of life on nearby, Earth-like planets called the Habitable Worlds Observatory.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., federal health officials on Monday announced a sweeping and unprecedented overhaul of federal vaccine recommendations, abruptly paring down recommended immunizations for children from 17 to 11.

Officials claimed the rationale for the change was to align US vaccine recommendations more closely with those of other high-income countries, namely Denmark, a small, far less diverse country of around 6 million people (smaller than the population of New York City) that has universal health care. The officials also claim the change is necessary to address the decline in public trust in vaccinations, which has been driven by anti-vaccine activists, including Kennedy.

“This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,” Kennedy said in a statement.

Health experts disagree. “Kennedy’s decision will harm and kill children, like all of his anti-vaccination decisions will,” virologist James Alwine, who works with the organization Defend Public Health, said in a statement.

The American Academy of Pediatrics, a vocal critic of Kennedy, blasted the changes, saying “to arbitrarily stop recommending numerous routine childhood immunizations is dangerous and unnecessary,” AAP President Andrew Racine said. “The United States is not Denmark,” he added.

Under the new federal recommendations, universally recommended immunizations are pared down to these 11 diseases: measles, mumps, rubella, polio, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus (HPV), and varicella (chickenpox).

Immunizations against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY, and meningococcal B are now only recommended for “high risk” groups. (Immunization against dengue was previously only recommended for certain groups.)

Parents may choose through “shared clinical decision-making” to vaccinate their children against rotavirus, COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B.

The American Medical Association criticized the changes and the way in which they were made—unilaterally, without transparency, and without scientific rigor.&quot;Changes of this magnitude require careful review, expert and public input, and clear scientific justification. That level of rigor and transparency was not part of this decision,” Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, an AMA Trustee, said in a statement.

In a US health department announcement, CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz noted that “All vaccines currently recommended by CDC will remain covered by insurance without cost sharing. No family will lose access.”

But health experts fear the confusion and distrust created by the abrupt and ideology-based changes will only lead more Americans to delay or decline vaccinating their children.

The country is already seeing surges in vaccine-preventable diseases amid a nationwide slide in childhood vaccination, particularly with outbreaks of whooping cough and measles. The US is on track to lose its measles elimination status this month.</div>

            <h2>The nation’s strictest privacy law just took effect, to data brokers’ chagrin</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/data-broker-hoarding-is-rampant-new-law-lets-consumers-fight-back/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Californians are getting a new, supercharged way to stop data brokers from hoarding and selling their personal information, as a recently enacted law that’s among the strictest in the nation took effect at the beginning of the year.

According to the California Privacy Protection Agency, more than 500 companies actively scour all sorts of sources for scraps of information about individuals, then package and store it to sell to marketers, private investigators, and others.

The nonprofit Consumer Watchdog said in 2024 that brokers trawl automakers, tech companies, junk-food restaurants, device makers, and others for financial info, purchases, family situations, eating, exercising, travel, entertainment habits, and just about any other imaginable information belonging to millions of people.

Two years ago, California’s Delete Act took effect. It required data brokers to provide residents with a means to obtain a copy of all data pertaining to them and to demand that such information be deleted. Unfortunately, Consumer Watchdog found that only 1 percent of Californians exercised these rights in the first 12 months after the law went into effect. A chief reason: Residents were required to file a separate demand with each broker. With hundreds of companies selling data, the burden was too onerous for most residents to take on.

On January 1, a new law known as DROP (Delete Request and Opt-out Platform) took effect. DROP allows California residents to register a single demand for their data to be deleted and no longer collected in the future. CalPrivacy then forwards it to all brokers.

Starting in August, brokers will have 45 days after receiving the notice to report the status of each deletion request. If any of the brokers’ records match the information in the demand, all associated data—including inferences—must be deleted unless legal exemptions such as information provided during one-to-one interactions between the individual and the broker apply. To use DROP, individuals must first prove they’re a California resident.

I used the DROP website and found the flow flawless and the interface intuitive. After I provided proof of residency, the site prompted me to enter personal information such as any names and email addresses I use, and specific information such as VIN (vehicle identification numbers) and advertising IDs from phones, TVs, and other devices. It required about 15 minutes to complete the form, but most of that time was spent pulling that data from disparate locations, many buried in system settings.

It initially felt counterintuitive to provide such a wealth of personal information to ensure that data is no longer tracked. As I thought about it more, I realized that all that data is already compromised as it sits in online databases, which are often easily hacked and, of course, readily available for sale. What’s more, CalPrivacy promises to use the data solely for data deletion. Under the circumstances, enrolling was a no-brainer.

It’s unfortunate that the law is binding only in California. As the scourge of data-broker information hoarding and hacks on their databases continues, it would not be surprising to see other states follow California’s lead.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Most mainstream dating sites promise to connect like-minded people of any race, gender, or sexual identity.

A far more niche corner of the online dating world, it turns out, promises to match white supremacists by creating safe havens that are inherently based on hate and discrimination.

But cybersecurity doesn’t appear to be a strong suit among those running these sites, giving hacktivists a golden opportunity to wreak havoc on the platforms.

A hacker who goes by the pseudonym Martha Root made a big splash during the annual Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, Germany, last month, as Hackread reports. While dressed as the Pink Ranger from the Power Rangers, Root unceremoniously deleted the servers of WhiteDate, a site described by writer Eva Hoffman as a “Tinder for Nazis.” While she was at it, she also wiped WhiteChild, a service that connected white supremacist sperm and egg donors, and WhiteDeal, a blatantly racist marketplace for freelance labor, at the end of her 44-minute speech.

In an even more unusual twist, Root also trained an AI chatbot to engage with WhiteDate’s users to extract as much information from them as possible, demonstrating how the tech can be used to root out fascists on the internet.

The hacker collaborated with Hoffman and journalist Christian Fuchs, who authored a revealing piece about WhiteDate that was published in the German newspaper Die Zeit in October.

During the latest presentation, titled “The Heartbreak Machine: Nazis in the Echo Chamber,” Root can be seen opening a terminal window on her MacBook following a brief question and answer period, and running a Python script called lol.py.

“Delete whitechild.net,” reads the window, followed by a checkmark emoji and the word, “Done!”

The message was met by thunderous applause from the audience gathered at the event.

“Delete whitedeal.net,” it continues. “Done!”

“Delete whitedate.net database,” the script reads. “Done!”

“Delete backups for whitedate.net,” it goes on. “Done!”

It’s a particularly cathartic watch, considering Germany’s continued fight against racism and antisemitism. Politicians have warned about a surge of neo-Nazi networks proliferating online, as thousands take to the streets to protest against right-wing extremism — which continues to have a presencein the country, including active political parties, over 80 years after the end of World War 2.

Root went far beyond wiping out the sites, which remain offline at the time of writing. Before deleting the servers, she lured the site’s users by deploying an AI chatbot powered by Meta’s open source Llama large language model to engage with users and “gather as much data as possible before the site went offline or noticed” — a refreshingly productive use of the tech.

“You are on a white-only dating platform to find someone who shares your traditionalist, right-wing values and vision for the future,” she wrote in English in the prompt to train the chatbot. “Due to past bad experiences, you never share contact details like Telegram until after meeting in person.”

“Show interest in traditional family roles and heritage, using an approachable tone with a mix of warmth and conviction,” it continues. “Occasionally use light humor or small talk to keep the conversation engaging and relatable.”

It got to the point where her account — creatively named “lilmisethnostate” — was invited out of the blue by a user named “Anglo-Saxon” to a WhiteDate meetup in northern Germany.

Root, of course, knew better, and instead watched from a distance as a group of white supremacist users “kicked off their tour of northern Germany,” as she told the audience in German.

Getting the list of WhiteDate users was trivially easy. During her speech, Root demonstrated that simply typing in the URL whitdate.net/download-all-users/ resulted in a prompt, allowing her to retrieve a full list with a click of a button, marked “Download Now.”

“The worst security that you can imagine,” Root said derisively.

Root also identified the owner of the site, Christiane Horn, who put little effort into hiding her identity on her platform.

“In case you were interested,” he said during the speech, “her hobbies are feng shui, eating brunch, and Naturgeister,” referring to mythical beings in Germanic folklore.

Since then, Root has created a front-end for the considerable leak under the website okstupid.lol, which claims to be the “only place where one person’s questionable life choices meet the tragicomic world of far-right online dating.”

An interactive map shows the geolocation of identified users, revealed through image metadata shared on WhiteDate.

A shocking 86 percent of the site’s more than 6,500 users were men, a “gender ratio that makes the Smurf village look like a feminist utopia,” as Root joked.

The data has since been passed to the nonprofit collective, Distributed Denial of Secrets, which has collected the files under a release called “WhiteLeaks.”

“At the request of the source, access to the data not published on okstupid.lol is currently restricted to verified journalists and researchers,” the nonprofit’s website notes.

In short, it’s a remarkable example of how AI can be used to confound hate groups at scale. The hack “demonstrates how algorithms, AI personas, and investigative thinking can expose hate, challenge its narratives, and break down its echo chambers,” according to an official abstract.

“We show how technology can be used in the fight against extremism,” it continues.

            <h2>That Video of Happy Crying Venezuelans After Maduro’s Kidnapping? It’s AI Slop</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the wake of the deadly attack on Venezuela and kidnapping of president Nicolás Maduro by the United States, netizens looking to manufacture support for the strikes have found a friend in generative AI.

Since the kidnapping, people in the West have been fiercely debating who should control the narrative about the military action. By many accounts, those most impacted by the attacks — Venezuelans living and working in Venezuela — are resolutely opposed to the strikes, with thousands mobilizing in numerous Venezuelan cities in protest. (The death toll from the US strikes currently stands at 80 soldiers and civilians, a figure whichwill likely go up as the dust settles.)

Though the attacks are still too recent to get accurate polling data of the country’s sentiments, a November survey found that 86 percent of Venezuelans preferred for Maduro to remain head of state to resolve the country’s economic woes. Only 8 percent favored the far-right opposition party, which has support from US president Donald Trump. Even many Venezuelans who oppose Maduro are also opposed to the United States’ incursion to oust him.

Yet if you ask American Trump supporters, Venezuelans are actually thrilled about the invasion. Their evidence: good ol’ AI slop.

In a post with over five million views on X-formerly-Twitter, the account Wall Street Apes shared a minute-long video of what are supposed to be Venezuelan citizens crying tears of joy over the attacks. Of course, as anyone versed in the visual language of gen AI will quickly notice, the video is a compilation of low-quality AI clips.

“The people cry for their freedom, thanks to the United States for freeing us,” the video’s AI narrator exclaims. “The hero, thank you Donald Trump.”

“I’m so jealous,” a US-run account with nearly 140,000 followers replied under the clip. “I want the same freedom and the same joy for Iran and the Iranian people.”

Shooting back at the mega-viral post, critics warned that the AI slop augurs a frightening new era of misinformation.

“The US empire’s war propaganda is getting much more sophisticated,” wrote geopolitical analyst Ben Norton. “You can bet the US government will use AI to try to justify its many more imperialist wars of aggression.”

Sure enough, plenty more AI generated misinformation has surfaced following the attacks, spread by conservative politicians like Vince Lago, mayor of Coral Gables, Florida. In some cases, AI generated images of Maduro in various US custody centers began to circulate in the hours immediately after his kidnapping — and well before authentic images were released by the Trump administration.

As Mexican political journalist José Luis Granados Ceja observed, the AI slop follows decades of efforts by the US government and media to manufacture consent among the western masses for intervention in the oil-rich South American state.

“In 2002, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez was briefly ousted in what came to be called the ‘world’s first media coup’ where the lies said on TV paved the road,” Ceja wrote in response to the AI propaganda. “It shouldn’t be a surprise then that in 2025 new tech and fake AI videos are being used toward similar ends.”

            <div id="article-text">Surprise! A public policy initiative panned by drivers and pro-car pundits turned out to instead be a roaring success that improved traffic congestion, road safety, and even reduced pollution — a godsend not just for those living in Manhattan, but for transit riders, drivers, and outer-borough residents.

Congestion pricing is a policy which charges drivers a toll of up to $9 for using surface-roads below Manhattan’s 60th street, an area known as the Congestion Relief Zone (CRZ), which is enforced by over 1,400 license-plate cameras.

Critics, including president Donald Trump, assailed the program during the runup period, but after a full year of congestion pricing, the New York Times reports massive wins for people living in Manhattan and beyond.

Since the CRZ went into effect on January 5, 2025, the NYT reports an 11 percent decrease in daily vehicle traffic throughout the borough’s central business district. In real terms, that comes out to about 73,000 fewer vehicles per day, or 27 million fewer trips than expected in the program’s first year alone.

As a result, those who do drive or use surface-level transit like buses experience much less traffic. Over the past year, average travel speeds increased 4.5 percent in the congestion zone, while the rest of New York City experienced a 1.4 percent increase. Local bus speeds are also up noticeably, increasing 2.4 percent in the CRZ, and 0.8 percent throughout the rest of the city.

The gains haven’t just been about convenience, either. The reduced volume of cars has led to marked improvements in pollution and traffic safety for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. It also raised more than half a billion dollars for the city’s beleaguered public transportation system.

“It turns out that mostly when people say ‘New York is noisy’ they really mean ‘cars are noisy,&#39;” Grant Louis of Manhattan told the NYT.

And even the commuters who criticized the program are gaining back untold hours of their life that would have otherwise been spent in traffic. Those who trudge into the city via the Lincoln Tunnel, for example, saw travel speeds increase by an average of almost 25 percent, while average speeds in the Holland tunnel were 51 percent faster compared to pre-congestion data.

Even outside of New York City, people noticed a marked difference in vehicular traffic, confirming earlier studies which found positive run-off effects in surrounding communities.

“I supercommute weekly from Kingston by bus,” resident Rob Bellinger told the paper. “Each week, my bus round trip is 30-60 minutes faster than it was before congestion pricing.”

The implications are clear for other busy metropolitan areas: even gently discouraging unnecessary automotive traffic can have immense benefits for a city’s wellbeing.

            <h2>Google’s AI Overviews Caught Giving Dangerous “Health” Advice</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In May 2024, Google threw caution to the wind by rolling out its controversial AI Overviews feature in a purported effort to make information easier to find.

But the AI hallucinations that followed — like telling users to eat rocks and put glue on their pizzas — ended up perfectly illustrated the persistent issues that plague large language model-based tools to this day.

And while not being able to reliably tell what year it is or making up explanations for nonexistent idioms might sound like innocent gaffes that at most lead to user frustration, some advice Google’s AI Overviews feature is offering up could have far more serious consequences

In a new investigation, The Guardian found that the tool’s AI-powered summaries are loaded with inaccurate health information that could put people at risk. Experts warn that it’s only a matter of time until the bad advice endangers users — or, in a worst-case scenario, results in someone’s death.

The issue is severe. For instance, The Guardian found that it advised those with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods, despite doctors recommending the exact opposite. It also completely bungled information about women’s cancer tests, which could lead to people ignoring real symptoms of the disease.

It’s a precarious situation as those who are vulnerable and suffering often turn to self-diagnosis on the internet for answers.

“People turn to the internet in moments of worry and crisis,” end-of-life charity Marie Curie director of digital Stephanie Parker told The Guardian. “If the information they receive is inaccurate or out of context, it can seriously harm their health.”

Others were alarmed by the feature turning up completely different responses to the same prompts, a well-documented shortcoming of large language model-based tools that can lead to confusion.

Mental health charity Mind’s head of information, Stephen Buckle, told the newspaper that AI Overviews offered “very dangerous advice” about eating disorders and psychosis, summaries that were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help.”

A Google spokesperson told The Guardian in a statement that the tech giant invests “significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.”

But given the results of the newspaper’s investigation, the company has a lot of work left to ensure that its AI tool isn’t dispensing dangerous health misinformation.

The risks could continue to grow. According to an April 2025 survey by the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center, nearly eight in ten adults said they’re likely to go online for answers about health symptoms and conditions. Nearly two-thirds of them found AI-generated results to be “somewhat or very reliable,” indicating a considerable — and troubling — level of trust.

At the same time, just under half of respondents said they were uncomfortable with healthcare providers using AI to make decisions about their care.

A separate MIT study found that participants deemed low-accuracy AI-generated responses “valid, trustworthy, and complete/satisfactory” and even “indicated a high tendency to follow the potentially harmful medical advice and incorrectly seek unnecessary medical attention as a result of the response provided.”

That’s despite AI models continuing to prove themselves as strikingly poor replacements for human medical professionals.

Meanwhile, doctors have the daunting task of dispelling myths and trying to keep patients from being led down the wrong path by a hallucinating AI.

On its website, the Canadian Medical Association calls AI-generated health advice “dangerous,” pointing out that hallucinations, as well as algorithmic biases and outdated facts, can “mislead you and potentially harm your health” if they choose to follow the generated advice.

Experts continue to advise people to consult human doctors and other licensed healthcare professionals instead of AI, a tragically tall ask given the many barriers to adequate care around the world.

At least AI Overviews sometimes appears to be aware of its own shortcomings. When queried if it should be trusted for health advice, the feature happily pointed us to The Guardian‘s investigation.

“A Guardian investigation has found that Google’s AI Overviews have displayed false and misleading health information that could put people at risk of harm,” read the AI Overviews’ reply.

            <h2>There’s Compelling Evidence That Someone Connected to the Trump Administration Profited Off the Invasion of Venezuela by Placing Large Bets on Polymarket</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-05</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi have long garnered a reputation for facilitating cheating and insider trading — allowing an athlete, for instance, to place a bet on a game they could then lose on purpose.

Now there’s compelling evidence that someone with inside information about the Trump administration’s regime change plans in Venezuela used that foreknowledge to profit massively from the conflict.

As spotted by researcher Tyson Brody, an unidentified user bet tens of thousands of dollars on various predictions that Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro would be imminently “out” or that the US forces would show up “in Venezuela by” a specified date during the runup to the incursion.

The account “existed for only one week and quickly became the biggest ‘yes’ holder in the Maduro out market,” Brody tweeted.

The evidence of insider trading is compelling, to say the least, given the highly suspicious timing. The account invested over $30,000 less than two days before the United States launched its invasion to kidnap Maduro and his wife and “profited $400,000 in less than 24 hours,” as sports entrepreneur Joe Pompliano calculated in a post on Bluesky.

“Seems pretty suspicious!” he added. “[Secretary of defense] Pete Hegseth making some beer money on the side?” Brody joked.

“Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged,” Pompliano argued.

Who was behind the Polymarket account remains a mystery. Accounts on markets like Polymarket are anonymous, and payouts are in cryptocurrency, making them hard to track.

As Semafor reported over the weekend, news organizations also had early intel of the US raid on Venezuela, but held off publishing the information so as not to put US troops in danger.

In other words, could it have been an insider at a New York or Washington newsroom who was trying to make a buck — or was it an operative inside the Trump administration?

Prediction markets have long raised concerns over exactly these types of situations. Case in point, one Polymarket user made $1 million in 24 hours in early December after betting on Google’s 2025 Year in Search rankings. Per Forbes, the account had a “near-perfect record of 22 correct predictions out of 23 attempts.”

As The American Prospect points out, critics of the Trump administration have long accused officials of dabbling in similar behavior. The administration has also allowed the prediction market to flourish by dropping enforcement cases in the crypto world and failing to introduce meaningful regulations.

Even Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which owns the president’s social network, Truth Social, entered the prediction markets business last year, showing a pointed appetite for the space.

“Of course insiders shouldn’t be able to get rich off of policy decisions — but even more concerning is the possibility that people are skewing policy outcomes in order to make their bets pay off,” Demand Progress executive director Sean Vitka told The American Prospect.

One thing’s for sure: while insiders profit, those without that privileged information lose out — and when the bets are on a deadly conflict, innocent people stand to suffer as well.

“And questions related to whether or not, and when, military action might be undertaken are especially vulnerable to such manipulation because the president frequently moves with discretion over the timing and (legally or not) without notice to the public or Congress,” Vitka added.

            <h2>Elon Musk After His Grok AI Did Disgusting Things to Literal Children: “Way Funnier”</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/elon-comment-grok-children">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last week, Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok began fielding an influx of stunningly inappropriate requests. Though the AI has long been known to have loose guardrails, users suddenly swarmed the AI to generate either nudes or sexually charged images of X users based on photos they posted to the site — and it obliged. Even worse, some of the individuals it took requests for appeared to be minors. The trend was so prolific that AI content analysis firm Copyleaks estimated the bot was generating a nonconsensually sexualized image every single minute.

Equally stunning is that the chatbot’s maker, xAI, has remained silent on the issue, despite it gaining international attention in news media and on X, where the bot operates. So has owner and CEO Musk — except for one instance in which he completely failed to meet the gravity of the situation.

“Grok’s viral image moment has arrived, it’s a little different than the Ghibli one was though,” one writer who covers AI euphemistically observed in a tweet.

For the most part, the only acknowledgment of wrongdoing has come from Grok itself, including in one widely seen post where it issued an “apology” — an output that many media outlets interpreted as Grok speaking for xAI.

“Dear Community, I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user’s prompt,” it wrote. “This violated ethical standards and potentially US laws on CSAM.”

“It was a failure in safeguards,” it added, “and I’m sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues.”

In another tweet spotted by Ars Technica, Grok acknowledged the gravely inappropriate requests using a royal “we.”

Responding to a user who had spent the past few days flagging the issue to Grok, the chatbot wrote: “We appreciate you raising this. As noted, we’ve identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them — CSAM is illegal and prohibited.”

“xAI is committed to preventing such issues,” Grok added.

It’s worth noting that these apologies and avowals of fixing the issue are almost certainly complete hokum from Grok. The fact that it’s freely generating such morally reprehensible — not to mention likely illegal — images indicates that it’s at heart designed to be highly compliant to virtually any request; in this case, the expression of contrition was responding to a prompt asking it to “write a heartfelt apology note.”

Nonetheless, it’s both alarming and cowardly that Grok’s writeups are the only acknowledgement we’re getting. Seemingly no one at xAI, Musk included, is brave enough to face the music. xAI rarely addresses the bad behavior of its chief product, but has done so on a handful of occasions in the past, including when Grok infamously began ranting about “white genocide,” a racist conspiracy theory, in response to completely unrelated posts all across the site.

Some of the recent posts, and especially the ones that involved minors, have been removed, with some of the users who made the requests receiving suspensions. But why Grok allowed the generation of these images at all is unclear. One user who is known for stress-testing the chatbot — and was behind the revelation that Grok would be willing to annihilate all Jewish people and kill a billion children — opined that its guardrails were “deliberately” lowered, noting that requests that were once refused were now being accepted.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon’s augmenting its Ring smart doorbells with new features, including new fire alerts, an app store, and a new set of Ring Sensors.

The company said the new Ring Sensors can detect motion, openings, glass breakage, and smoke, and can also monitor carbon monoxide levels, leaks, temperature changes, and air quality. They also let you control lighting and appliances that are connected to your smart home network.

Amazon is also adding a new app store to the Ring app to allow users to use its cameras with third-party apps. The store is currently available in the U.S. only, and users will be able to browse a selection of apps in the coming weeks. While the company didn’t specify what kind of apps the store would feature, it said these apps would focus on small business operations and everyday needs around the house.

And as fires grow more common in drought affected areas, the company has teamed up with the fire monitoring app, Watch Duty, to show real-time updates and early warnings in the Ring app’s Neighbors section. Users can also share live updates using their Ring cameras to this section.

Notably, the new devices being launched support Amazon’s Sidewalk shared network feature, which creates a mesh network between the company’s Echo and Ring devices by sharing a small portion of your bandwidth, enabling devices to work even when they aren’t in wireless range of your Wi-Fi router.

Amazon is also adding a new AI-based feature to Ring cameras that learns the everyday patterns of a property and alerts users if anything unusual occurs. Dubbed “AI Unusual Event Alerts,” the company said the feature enables the Ring camera to surface specific warnings when it detects a person, based on location, actions and clothing.

For people who subscribe to Amazon’s Virtual Security Guard services, these warnings could trigger intervention automatically. In the last month, the company has rolled out features that use video recognition to trigger Alexa responses and send you personalized notifications based on a database of 50 faces.

The company has also launched a new Ring Car Alarm with in-built GPS for vehicle monitoring.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Robot vacuum maker Narwal unveiled its new set of smart vacuum cleaners at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) with AI-powered features such as monitoring pets, finding valuable objects, and notifying users about misplaced toys.

The company said that its new flagship Flow 2 robot vacuum has a rounded design and easy-lift tanks for better cleaning. The device uses two 1080p RGB cameras with a 136-degree field of view to map out the area and recognize different kinds of objects using AI models.

Narwal said that through this tech stack, the vacuum cleaner has the ability to identify an unlimited number of objects. The device first tries to identify an object locally, but in case there are no matches, it sends the data to the cloud for further processing.

The Flow 2 has three key modes called pet care mode, baby care mode, and AI floor tag mode. With pet care mode, you can define zones where pets usually rest or hang out to clean them. Plus, it can monitor pets and also check in on your pets via two-way audio (there is no guarantee that they would listen to you, though). In the baby care mode, the vacuum switches to quiet mode near the crib and notifies you of misplaced toys. In the AI floor tag mode, the vacuum recognizes valuable items like jewelry, avoids them, and alerts you.

Narwal said that its newest vacuum cleaner has four cleaning modes that can identify different types of dirt. The device can also return to its base to wash the mop and then re-mop a certain area if it is dirty. The company noted that the Flow 2’s design allows for a higher hot water washing temperature for better cleaning.

Along with the Flow 2, the company also showed off a handheld vacuum called the U50 that weighs 1.41kg (3.1 lbs) and has UV-C sterilization along with heat treatment for allergen removal. The company also demoed an unnamed cordless vacuum with a slim design, 360-degree swivel, and up to 50 minutes of run time. The cordless vacuum also has an auto-empty station that can support up to 60 days of dust disposal.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su kicked off her keynote at CES 2026 with a message about what compute could deliver: AI for everyone.

As part of that promise, AMD announced a new line of AI processors as the company thinks AI-powered personal computers are the way of the future.

The semiconductor giant revealed AMD Ryzen AI 400 Series processor, its latest version of its AI-powered PC chips, at the yearly CES conference on Monday. The company says the latest version of its Ryzen processor series allows for 1.3x faster multitasking than its competitors and are 1.7x times faster at content creation.

These new chips feature 12 CPU Cores, individual processing units inside a core processor, and 24 threads, independent streams of instruction

This is an upgrade to the Ryzen AI 300 Series processor that was announced in 2024. AMD started producing the Ryzen processor series in 2017.

Rahul Tikoo, senior vice president and general manager of AMD’s client business, said AMD has expanded to over 250 AI PC platforms on the company’s recent press briefing. That represents a growth 2x over the last year, he added.

“In the years ahead, AI is going to be a multi-layered fabric that gets woven into every level of computing at the personal layer,” Tikoo said. “Our AI PCs and devices will transform how we work, how we play, how we create and how we connect with each other.”

AMD also announced the release of the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, the latest version of its gaming-focused processor.

“No matter who you are and how you use technology on a daily basis, AI is reshaping everyday computing,” Tikoo said. “You have thousands of interactions with your PC every day. AI is able to understand, learn context, bring automation, provide deep reasoning and personal customization to every individual.”

PCs that include either the Ryzen AI 300 Series processor or the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D processor become available in the first quarter of 2026.

The company also announced the latest version of its Redstone ray tracing technology, which simulates physical behavior of light, which allows for better video game graphics without a performance or speed lag.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/insight-partners-sued-by-former-vice-president-kate-lowry/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Kate Lowry, a former vice president at Insight Partners, is suing the firm, alleging disability discrimination, gender discrimination, and wrongful termination, according to a suit filed on December 30 in San Mateo County, California, and seen by TechCrunch.   Insight Partners did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

Lowry told TechCrunch she filed the suit because she believes “too many powerful, wealthy people in venture act like it’s OK to break the law and systemically underpay and abuse their employees.”

“It’s an oppressive system that reflect[s] broader trends in society that use fear, intimidation, and power to silence and isolate truth. I’m trying to change that.”

Lowry began working at Insight Partners in 2022, after previously working for Meta, McKinsey & Company, and an early-stage startup. The suit alleges that, upon being hired, she was assigned to a different supervisor than the person mentioned during her interview.

She alleges in the suit that she was told by her new supervisor, who was a woman, to be “online all the time, including PTO, holidays, and weekends,” and to respond between “6 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily.”

Lowry says in the suit that this first supervisor “berated, hazed, and antagonized” her, spoke openly about a hazing that would be “longer and more intense” than what she put other male reports through.

Some comments the supervisor allegedly made, according to the suit, include “you are incompetent, shut up and take notes” and “you need to obey me like a dog; do whatever I say whenever I say it, without speaking.”  Lowry also alleges that her supervisor assigned her “redundant tasks” and restricted her ability to participate in calls, while allowing less experienced male colleagues to do so. Lowry, instead, she alleges, was relegated to “administrative tasks such as note-taking and cataloging.”

Lowry said she became “increasingly ill” because of the work environment and that her physician advised a medical leave of absence, which she was granted and took from February to July 2023.

When she returned to work, she was placed on a new team and, the suit alleges, was told by the head of human resources that “if the new team did not like her, she would be fired.”

In September 2023, Lowry said she got a concussion and took another medical leave and returned to work near the end of 2024. Due to some departures, she was placed under the supervision of a new person, where Lowry said her poor treatment continued. She also alleges that in 2024, her compensation was about 30% below the market.

By April 2025, she alleges she was told her compensation would be cut. In May of 2025, through her attorneys, Lowry sent a letter to Insight regarding her alleged treatment by the company. A week later, the firm terminated her employment, the suit states.

The lawsuit is reminiscent of Ellen Pao’s suit against Kleiner Perkins back in 2012, in which she alleged discrimination and retaliation. That suit offered what was, at the time, a rare glimpse into how women partners felt they were treated in venture capital. Though Pao lost that suit, it sent waves through the industry, and other women went on to sue major tech companies.

            <h2>Microsoft’s Nadella wants us to stop thinking of AI as ‘slop’</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/microsofts-nadella-wants-us-to-stop-thinking-of-ai-as-slop/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A couple of weeks after Merriam-Webster named “slop” as its word of the year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella weighed in on what to expect from AI in 2026.

In his classic, intellectual style, Nadella wrote on his personal blog that he wants us to stop thinking of AI as “slop” and start thinking of it as “bicycles for the mind.”

He wrote, “A new concept that evolves ‘bicycles for the mind’ such that we always think of AI as a scaffolding for human potential vs a substitute.”

He continued: “We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our ‘theory of the mind’ that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other.”

If you parse through those syllables, you may see that he’s not only urging everyone to stop thinking of AI-generated content as slop, but also wants the tech industry to stop talking about AI as a replacement for humans. He hopes the industry will start talking about it as a human-helper productivity tool instead.

Here’s the problem with that framing, though: Much of AI agent marketing uses the idea of replacing human labor as a way to price it, and justify its expense.

Meanwhile, some of the biggest names in AI have been sounding the alarm that the tech will soon cause very high levels of human unemployment. For instance, in May Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could take away half of all entry-level white-collar jobs, raising unemployment to 10-20% over the next five years, and he doubled down on that last month in an interview on 60 Minutes.

Yet we currently don’t know how true such doomsday stats are. As Nadella implies, most AI tools today don’t replace workers, they are used by them (as long as the human doesn’t mind checking the AI’s work for accuracy).

One oft-cited research study is MIT’s ongoing Project Iceberg, which seeks to measure the economic impact on jobs as AI enters the workforce. Project Iceberg estimates that AI is currently capable of performing about 11.7% of human paid labor.

While this has been widely reported as AI being capable of replacing nearly 12% of jobs, the Project says what it’s actually estimating is how much of a job can be offloaded to AI. It then calculates wages attached to that offloaded work. Interestingly, the tasks it cites as examples include automated paperwork for nurses and AI-written computer code.

That’s not to say there are no jobs being heavily impacted by AI. Corporate graphic artists and marketing bloggers are two examples, according to a Substack called Blood in the Machine. Then there are the high unemployment rates among new-grad junior coders.

But it’s also true that highly skilled artists, writers, and programmers produce better work with AI tools than those without the skills. AI can’t replace human creativity, yet.

So it’s perhaps no surprise that as we slide into 2026, some data is emerging that shows the jobs where AI has made the most progress are actually flourishing. Vanguard’s 2026 economic forecast report found that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.”

The Vanguard report concludes that those who are masterfully using AI are making themselves more valuable, not replaceable.

The irony is that Microsoft’s own actions last year helped give rise to the AI-is-coming-for-our-jobs narrative. The company laid off over 15,000 people in 2025, even as it recorded record revenues and profits for its last fiscal year, which closed in June — citing success with AI as a reason. Nadella even wrote a public memo about the layoffs after these results.

Notably, he didn’t say that internal AI efficiency led to cuts. But he did say that Microsoft had to “reimagine our mission for a new era” and named “AI transformation” as one of the company’s three business objectives in this era (the other two being security and quality).

The truth about job loss attributed to AI during 2025 is more nuanced. As the Vanguard report points out, this had less to do with internal AI efficiency and more to do with ordinary business practices that are less exciting to investors, like ending investment in slowing areas to pile in to growing ones.

To be fair, Microsoft wasn’t alone in laying off workers while pursuing AI. The technology was said to be responsible for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, according to research from firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, CNBC reported. That report cited the large cuts last year at Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft, and other tech companies chasing AI.

And to be fair to slop, those of us who spend more time than we should on social media laughing at memes and AI-generated short-form videos might argue that slop is one of AI’s most entertaining (if not best) uses, too.

            <h2>This is Uber’s new robotaxi from Lucid and Nuro</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/this-is-ubers-new-robotaxi-from-lucid-and-nuro/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Uber, Lucid Motors, and Nuro have revealed the production-intent version of their collaborative robotaxi at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show, and TechCrunch got a sneak peek ahead of the reveal.

It’s a vehicle that’s been in the works for more than half a year now, part of a deal that saw Uber invest $300 million into Lucid and commit to buying 20,000 of the company’s EVs. On Monday, the companies said the robotaxi is already being tested on public roads ahead of a planned commercial service launching in the San Francisco Bay Area later this year.

Based on the Lucid Gravity SUV, the robotaxi has high-resolution cameras, solid state lidar sensors, and radars integrated into the body and the roof-mounted “halo.” The autonomy package is powered by Nvidia’s Drive AGX Thor computer. That halo also has integrated LED lights that will help riders identify their vehicle (similar to how Waymo’s Jaguar I-Pace SUVs work).

Crucially, all of this extra tech is added to the Gravity as it’s being built at Lucid Motors’ Casa Grande, Arizona factory, saving the companies some time and money. By comparison, Waymo currently has to take apart the I-Pace SUVs it receives from Jaguar and integrate the autonomous tech as it puts them back together. (Future Waymo vehicles are planned to be more purpose-built.)

The vehicle unveiled on Monday is a more polished-up version of the test version that the three companies have spent the last seven months showing off in press photos. The newest element revealed at CES has to do with how users will interface with the Uber-Lucid-Nuro robotaxi. That includes a small screen on the halo meant to greet riders and a ride interface inside the cabin.

Anyone who has ridden in a Waymo will find this UI experience familiar. The rear passenger screen shows an isometric graphical view of the robotaxi moving through city streets, with representations of nearby cars and pedestrians.

The companies did not have an interactive version of the software — which is being created by Uber — ready to test out just yet. But it has been built to show the standard information like estimated drop-off time, how much ride time is remaining, and climate and music controls. There are also buttons to reach rider support and to tell the robotaxi to pull over.

The front passenger screen shows a lot of the same information, just on a larger central touchscreen display. In the demonstration car on display at the Fontainebleau hotel, a lot of the same elements appeared on the Gravity’s sweeping 34-inch curved OLED display, which sits behind the steering wheel.

Uber chose to build this forthcoming “premium” robotaxi service around the Gravity, and at a high level it seems like a wise decision. The Gravity is immensely spacious inside, especially in the two-row configuration on display at the hotel. (Uber says a three-row version will be available, too.)

That said, the Gravity’s first full year came with struggles. Lucid fought with software issues as it ramped up production of the SUV, and the problems got bad enough that interim CEO Marc Winterhoff sent an email to owners in December apologizing for the “frustrations” they experienced.

Lucid has seemingly been able to bounce back from that, and on Monday announced that it doubled its 2024 production figures and reached new sales records. Time will tell if the robotaxi version has any of the same kinds of software struggles.

Uber, Lucid, and Nuro said Monday that once final validation is complete on the robotaxi later this year, true production versions will start rolling off Lucid’s factory lines in Arizona. The companies did not give a concrete timeline for that, though.

            <h2>January 6 Was My Fourth Day on the Hill</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/january-6-anniversary-insurrection/685183/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">January 6, 2021, was my fourth day on Capitol Hill. I was fresh out of law school and working as a senior aide for Mondaire Jones, a newly elected Democratic member of Congress from New York. Most of his staff were queer, Jewish, Black, or some combination thereof, and our very presence felt like a rejection of the waning Trump era. We knew that Republicans had organized a rally to protest the congressional certification of the presidential election, but we were focused on different news: Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock had won their runoff elections in Georgia, giving Democrats control of the Senate. Suddenly our party had the majorities it needed to pass legislation that would improve people’s lives.

There were signs that January 6 was going to be an unusual day. The House would not be in session until the afternoon, but we were asked to arrive before 8 a.m. On my drive to work, I saw hundreds of people wearing MAGA hats and flying “Stop the Steal” flags—rare flashes of red in deep-blue D.C. They’d traveled far, I thought. But the rally felt less threatening than futile.

At one that afternoon, Jones went to the House floor for the vote to certify the results. Shortly after, we received a cryptic update via the Capitol’s emergency-alert system ordering us to shelter in place due to “police activity.” We feared this was connected to reports that Capitol Police had discovered a “suspicious package” in the area, and we worried that we might be in the blast radius of an explosive. Still, we continued working while we followed a live feed of the House proceedings.

At about 2:15, in the middle of his speech objecting to the certification of Arizona’s electoral votes, Representative Paul Gosar stopped to call for order in the chamber. We weren’t sure why; the mics weren’t picking up any disturbance. Then the camera cut to members of Congress rushing toward the doors. We watched first with confusion, then with fear as we heard screams and pleas to lock the door before the feed cut.

We scrambled for information. A glance outside our back window, which faced away from the Capitol, revealed nothing; we drew the blinds. Aside from a few vague alerts warning of a “security threat,” our only intel came from Twitter, TV, and texts from equally confused colleagues. Americans following along at home knew as much as we did.

Reports began to filter in that insurrectionists, some of whom were believed to be armed and on a mission to kill, had breached the Capitol. My colleagues and I watched footage of the mob smashing windows, ramming down doors, and swarming the rotunda; one man brandished a Confederate flag; another wore a Camp Auschwitz sweatshirt. Just that morning, a colleague had hung Pride and Black Lives Matter flags outside our office. We didn’t know whether our building had been invaded, but we knew those flags would make us a target. We momentarily broke the shelter-in-place order to pull them down, then we locked the door and dragged a heavy leather couch in front of it.

It was my first week on the job. I barely knew where the bathrooms were. I had no idea how to deal with a siege.

Another House office building had been evacuated, and the employees there were told to take shelter in our building. They weren’t told exactly where to go, though, so many came to our door in search of safety. Each knock was a jump scare. Roughly 20 members of Congress and their staff, Democrats and Republicans, accumulated in our office. We shared bags of barbecue chips and peanut M&Ms that a colleague had brought in that morning, and made small talk about office decor, our favorite D.C. restaurants, our hometowns—anything to drown out the terror on our screens and the eerie silence outside our door.

That day was full of things that were not supposed to happen, but did. The more we learned about what was going on outside—the mob had zip ties; it was erecting gallows in front of the Capitol and chanting for blood—the more possible it seemed that we could be injured or even killed. Our reactions varied: One colleague wept when he saw the “QAnon Shaman” in the speaker’s chair; another sat silently, texting loved ones; I mostly made dark jokes.

Our boss, who had been whisked off the House floor to a secure location, was only intermittently reachable. In the early evening, his phone died and we lost contact with him entirely. Since Jones had launched his campaign nearly two years ago, he and I had been in near-constant touch. I considered him a close friend, and I was terrified for him. Even after we learned that the Capitol complex had been cleared, and watched through our office window as dejected insurrectionists shuffled away, we still did not hear from Jones. Only when he showed up in our office unannounced at about 6:30 p.m., clutching a gas mask, as close to speechless as I would ever see him, did we know for certain that he was alive.

We heard that Nancy Pelosi was planning to call the House back into session so that Congress could fulfill its duty to certify the election. We had a few hours of respite while first responders cleared the Capitol of debris. Famished after eating nothing but chips and candy, I found some sad chicken tenders in the cafeteria.

When the House gaveled back into session around 9 p.m., some Republicans continued to dispute the election results. Their antics extended for almost seven more hours, which I spent curled up on an office couch, the proceedings droning on in the background. Jones and I drove home at 4 a.m. during a citywide curfew, past buildings boarded up with plywood.

I was shell-shocked; for months, I couldn’t sleep through the night. But on January 7, I woke up feeling hopeful. My colleagues and I had lived through one of the most terrible days in American history, but I believed that something good would have to come of it. A violent, desperate outburst had laid bare the authoritarianism at the center of Trump’s movement. Surely now Americans would finally shut the door on him.

Trump was banned from several social-media platforms. Republican senators including Lindsey Graham publicly rebuked him; then–Minority Leader Mitch McConnell privately expressed support for his impeachment, according to some reports. Democrats, recognizing an opportunity to prove that they could deliver on their promises, seemed poised to push through legislation that would end partisan gerrymandering and expand the social safety net.

Read: Republicans once thought January 6 was ‘tragic’

This period of hope was short-lived. By the time I left the Hill, in June 2022, the Republicans who had, for a moment, grown a conscience had either fallen back in line behind Trump or been excommunicated. Elon Musk was in the process of buying Twitter, and had promised to return Trump to the platform. A coalition of cynics and sycophants had pried the door back open for Trump. After one congressional Republican described the riot of January 6 as a “normal tourist visit,” and the Republican National Committee called its perpetrators “ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse,” the American people handed the GOP control of the House.

I moved abroad that December. I was fed up not just with American politics, but with America. Democrats had squandered what I felt was our best chance at solving the nation’s problems, and now a completely unhinged version of the GOP was careening toward power.

Still, I struggled to imagine that Americans would actually vote Trump himself back into the White House. When they did, I felt horrified for my country, and also personally betrayed. Trump had promised to pardon the insurrectionists, who were willing to do almost anything to keep people like me from wielding power. Apparently, 77 million of my fellow Americans were okay with that.

Looking back now, as Trump consolidates his authoritarian approach, I can see that January 6 portended not an end, but the beginning of a new era of nihilism.

Trump’s supporters are emboldened. They punish their enemies and reward their friends. They have turned the power of the state against the free press and universities, trans people and immigrants. They have slashed Medicaid to fund tax cuts for the wealthy, and have redrawn electoral maps in an effort to keep themselves in power.

Democrats appear to have internalized the same lesson: If the MAGA movement can survive after attempting a coup, perhaps nothing can stop it. Locked out of power, Democrats at the national level can barely muster outrage against Trump, and have proved unable to rally popular opposition to his agenda or articulate a credible alternative.

I’ve been home only a few times since I left the country. Each visit feels worse than the last, either because things actually are getting worse, or because distance has sharpened my vision. January 6 really did change everything—just not in the way I’d hoped.</div>

            <h2>Is This What Patriotism Looks Like?</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/02/jan-6-ex-nypd-officer-capitol-police-attack/685325/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In the early-morning hours of January 5, 2021, Thomas Webster, a former U.S. Marine and retired police officer, drove south on Interstate 95 toward Washington, D.C. Webster, who was then 54, had been conflicted about whether to attend the “Save America” rally, but Donald Trump had used the word patriot. Webster had joined the military at 19, taken his first plane ride to boot camp in South Carolina, gotten his first taste of lobster tail on a ship in the Mediterranean. He loved the sense of purpose he’d drawn from the oath he’d sworn when he joined the Marines: I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

Webster, who’d retired from the New York City Police Department, where he’d been a street cop, a firearms instructor, and part of the Gracie Mansion security detail, lived in Goshen, New York, with his wife, Michelle, an Ivy League graduate who worked in biotech sales, and their three teenagers, one of whom had recently joined the Marines. He ran a small business, Semper Fi Landscaping, cutting grass and clearing snow during winter.

In the early days of the pandemic, Webster had masked in public, disinfected his groceries, and slept in the basement if he had the slightest sniffle. At first he thought keeping his kids home from school made sense. But as the months stretched on, he worried about his two younger teenagers, who didn’t seem to be socializing or learning much over Zoom. One morning that spring, when Webster went outside to mow a neighbor’s lawn, he found himself troubled by the surreal silence on his block, like he was standing on a vacant movie set.

When Webster turned on the news, the world seemed upside down. He saw millions of people flouting COVID restrictions to protest the killing of George Floyd. He became suspicious about what the government and the mainstream media were telling him. In the summer of 2020, he puzzled over how CNN and other news outlets could describe the Black Lives Matter protests as “mostly peaceful” while broadcasting discordant images—for instance, the flames from buildings burning orange against the night sky.

During that first year of COVID isolation, Webster consumed more news than he ever had and grew irritated by what he viewed as proliferating government intrusions into people’s lives. New York’s Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, issued early stay-at-home orders, imposed one of the first statewide mask mandates, and discouraged in-person church services. As time passed, Webster found his views diverging from some of his neighbors’ in the Hudson Valley. When students were eventually allowed to return to school, his children were among the few who climbed back onto the school bus. This was when he thought he noticed neighbors looking at him differently, as though they disapproved. Back in 2015, when Trump had begun his presidential campaign, Webster hadn’t taken him seriously, because he “said some crazy-ass stuff.” Webster thought of himself as a traditional, small-government, libertarian-leaning Reagan Republican; he’d supported Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican primary. Now, though, he began to find Trump’s bombast refreshing. In the president’s words, Webster heard echoes of his own thoughts about the strangulating overreach of an authoritarian government. Some of what Trump said about foreign policy also began to resonate with Webster, particularly his statements about wanting America to quit its “forever wars,” because he worried about his daughter in the Marines.

Over the course of 2020, Webster found himself pulled more and more deeply into the MAGA camp. The concept of “Make America Great Again” seemed pretty brilliant to him. Who could argue with it? Webster had been disappointed to see the Obama administration go on what he thought was an endless apology tour around the world. Trump, in contrast, embraced the country and was unabashed in putting America first. “I really appreciated that,” Webster told me recently. “I didn’t view MAGA as ‘extremism.’ I viewed it as a sense of patriotism, a love of God and family and country.”

As the pandemic and the 2020 election campaign wore on, Webster drifted further and further to the right. When he became disenchanted with even Fox News for being too moderate, and especially for its decision to call Arizona for Joe Biden so early on Election Night, he began turning instead to Newsmax and One America News Network. He migrated from far-right sites such as Breitbart News, The Federalist, and Gateway Pundit to smaller, even-further-right forums that pulsed with conspiratorial outrage.

When Trump claimed that the election had been stolen, Webster was inclined to believe him. He read about a Postal Service subcontractor who said that he’d driven 24 boxes of completed mail-in ballots from New York to Pennsylvania in a tractor trailer early one morning about two weeks before Election Day, suggesting that they’d been improperly moved across state lines. He saw images of poll workers in Detroit covering windows, which implied to him that they were concealing electoral skulduggery. He watched a video of poll workers in Georgia pulling what Trump called “suitcases” of ballots from beneath a table after election observers had gone home. Based on everything he was seeing, Webster didn’t find it so far-fetched that a cornerstone of democracy—a free and fair election—had been compromised. He believed Trump when he said that Democrats were using the pandemic to push the use of mail-in ballots in order to perpetrate widespread voter fraud. After the election results were in, when Trump asked how Biden—who, according to the president, had been “hiding” in his basement and couldn’t put two sentences together—had somehow won 81 million votes, Webster had to agree that was awfully suspicious.

Trump had been sowing doubts about the integrity of the election since before the voting even started. “The only way they”—the Democrats—“are going to win is by a rigged election,” he said at a rally in August, and he repeated this sentiment over and over in the weeks leading up to November 3. After midnight on Election Night, while the votes were still being counted, Trump said, “Frankly, we did win this election.” As soon as the votes were finally all tabulated and the race was declared for Biden, Trump began casting doubt and scheming to overturn the result.

On December 14, the leader of the Oath Keepers, the right-wing paramilitary group, published an open letter on their website urging Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act in order to block the transfer of power to Biden using military force. “If you fail to act,” the letter said, “we the people will have to fight a bloody civil war and revolution.” Five days later, Trump urged his supporters to attend a rally in Washington on January 6, the day the Electoral College vote was to be certified. “Will be wild!” he tweeted. MAGA supporters embraced the invitation. Social media and pro-Trump discussion forums teemed with people saying they were planning to “storm the Capitol” on January 6. Many of them declared that they would be armed.

Before 2021, the January 6 electoral certification had generally been a pro forma affair. By the time certification happens, the popular vote has long been counted, the Electoral College totals officially called. But Trump and some of his aides were plotting with a few far-right Republicans in the House of Representatives to stymie the proceedings. During the certification process, members of Congress have the opportunity to object to a state’s results, which triggers debate and then a vote about whether the objection is to be upheld. But in the 133 years that this certification process had been the law, no objection had ever been sustained. Trump and his coterie intended to change that by pressuring legislators, and Vice President Mike Pence, to uphold objections to certain states’ votes. “The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors,” the president tweeted on January 5. Trump supporters got the message: Outside pressure would help. If “a million patriots” show up “bristling with AR’s”—assault rifles—“just how brave do you think” legislators will be “when it comes to enforcing their unconstitutional laws?” someone posted on thedonald.win, a popular pro-Trump website. “Don’t cuck out. This is do or die. Bring your guns.” Other posts echoed this.

As Trump amplified calls for his supporters to assemble in Washington to “stop the steal,” Webster told his wife that he needed to go. Worried about antifa counterprotesters, he packed his NYPD-issued bulletproof vest, with his blood type, A+, written on the inside; he filled his military-issued rucksack with water, Gatorade, and Meals Ready-to-Eat (MREs). He took a Smith & Wesson revolver, small enough to fit in his pocket, and warm clothes, including a snow jacket with distinctive red, black, and white stripes. As he traveled south in his Honda CR-V, he was a man infused with purpose, a patriot answering a president’s plea for help.

The next afternoon, January 6, Noah Rathbun, an officer with the Metropolitan Police Department of Washington, D.C., stood behind a bike-rack barricade on the west side of the U.S. Capitol as a hostile and growing crowd closed in.

Though Rathbun, a U.S. Navy veteran, had been with MPD for five years, he’d never been to the Capitol. After joining the department, he’d been assigned to the Seventh District, which includes high-crime neighborhoods in Southeast D.C. But he was also a member of one of the department’s civil-disturbance units, and that morning his unit had been deployed near the White House. Around 1 p.m., when officers at the Capitol began radioing for help, his unit drove patrol cars toward the complex’s western end. Surveying the scene that confronted him there, Rathbun had never faced so many angry people, a mass of humanity that rippled out as far as he could see. He wore a helmet, a gas mask, a fluorescent-yellow jacket, and a body camera that recorded the crowd.

Earlier that day, Trump had begun his morning by once again exhorting Pence, who would oversee the election-certification process, to overturn Biden’s victory. “Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!” he tweeted. Just before noon, the president began speaking to the thousands of supporters he had summoned to the Ellipse. “We won this election, and we won it by a landslide,” he said. After telling them to “peacefully and patriotically” make their voices heard, in order to give Republicans the courage to reject the certification, he shifted to inflaming them: “We fight. We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” He told them to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol, where Congress was beginning the certification proceedings, and said that he would go with them. (He did not go with them.) At 2:11, the rioters breached the Capitol building. Two minutes later, the Secret Service whisked Pence off the Senate floor.

At 2:18, a woman wearing a Trump face mask and holding a Trump flag on a pole tried to push through the barricade that Rathbun was manning. He put his hand on the woman’s shoulder and shoved her back as they tussled over the flagpole. The woman fell to the ground, upsetting the crowd. On body-cam footage, you can see one protester square his shoulders in a confrontational posture, and another raise what looks like a cane into the air as a police officer tries to douse them with chemical spray.

Someone lobbed what looked like a cylindrical Bluetooth speaker into the air. It hit Rathbun in the chest. As he tried to reattach the barricade, which the crowd had dislodged, the woman reappeared. Rathbun put both hands on her chest and pushed her back, and she again fell down. Shortly after that, a bearded man, reading the officer’s name on his uniform, raised his hands in the air and said, “Rathbun, calm down. Nobody’s going to hurt you.”

Another man, wearing what looked to be tactical goggles, pointed his finger at Rathbun and said to the bearded man: “He hit the woman.”

“He’s ready to punch a woman in the face,” the man with goggles said, making an uppercut motion. “I treated Afghan women with way more respect than that.”

Rathbun responded by opening and closing his fingers and thumb like Pac-Man’s mouth, appearing to convey the universal symbol for blah blah blah.

As the crowd blew air horns and chanted “U.S.A.!,” the bearded man asked Rathbun, “Do you love America, Rathbun? Do you love your country, son?”

Rathbun stared forward, his hand resting on the barricade, the final barrier between the crowd and the Capitol’s western entrance. The nation’s legislators were gathered inside, certifying Biden’s election. Rathbun understood that his job was to protect those legislators. The barricades were flimsy and unanchored. He put his foot on the bottom of one, trying to stabilize it. Before long, another man appeared before Rathbun. “Y’all know what’s right and what’s wrong. I know you’re just doing what’s right, doing your job, and we hope that Pence does his job,” the man said. “My vote got disenfranchised by thousands of votes. Thousands of dead people voted. Those dead people are not here. I’m here.”

It was around this moment that Trump tweeted that Pence—then being evacuated to a secure location as some people in the mob chanted “Hang Mike Pence!”—lacked the “courage” to reject Biden’s certification.

At 2:28, a man in a red, black, and white snow jacket—Tom Webster—pushed his way to the front of the crowd. He carried a large metal pole with a red Marine Corps flag on it. He pointed his index finger at Rathbun and yelled: “You fucking piece of shit! You fucking commie motherfuckers, man. You’re gonna attack Americans? No, fuck that!” As Webster repeatedly jabbed his finger, Rathbun met it with his left hand, as if trying to swat him away. As Webster continued aggressively yelling, Rathbun reached over the barricade and shoved him back. Webster said, “You fucking commie fuck. Come on, take your shit off”—something people say to a cop when they want to fight.

Webster reached down and shoved the barricade toward Rathbun. It slid easily across the concrete, creating a gap between it and the next barricade. Rathbun reached out to shove Webster back and struck him in the head with an open palm. The blow further inflamed Webster, who raised his flagpole into the air and swung it down repeatedly in a chopping motion, hitting the barricade with a loud clang.

Rathbun and the other officers tried to reconnect the barricades but couldn’t, and the crowd surged forward. As Rathbun and other officers retreated, Webster clenched both fists, crouched into a linebacker’s stance, and charged into Rathbun, knocking him to the ground. As the two men wrestled, Webster tugged on Rathbun’s helmet, pulling the chin strap tighter around his neck, to the point where, Rathbun later testified, he struggled to breathe. Webster pulled the officer’s gas mask partway off and pressed his fingers close to his eyes. Rathbun tried to get up but couldn’t, feeling as if someone in the crowd was kicking him. After about 10 seconds, Webster stood and disappeared into the crowd flooding through the breach he’d helped create.

Shortly afterward, someone filmed Webster standing against a wall at the Capitol, his eyes red from tear gas. Stepping away from the wall and looking into the camera, he said: “Send more patriots. We need some help.”

As Webster drove home to New York that night, he wasn’t exactly pumping his fist over what had happened, but he wasn’t full of regret, either. He felt justified in what he’d done. He believed that Officer Rathbun had provoked him, gesturing him to come closer and fight. (Rathbun denied this in court testimony, saying he had “absolutely not” made such a gesture. He did not respond to requests for comment.) Webster thought back to how when he’d arrived on the Capitol grounds, he’d seen an elderly couple leaving, the woman’s face covered in blood. The image had troubled him. American citizens had gone to the Capitol to express their First Amendment rights, only to find themselves assaulted by the police? Webster says he thinks of himself as a “protector,” so seeing that woman put him into a rage, which was the state he was in when he approached Rathbun at the police barrier.

As he absorbed news coverage over the rest of that week, however, he was surprised by its tenor. He’d thought the January 6 crowd would be viewed the way the Black Lives Matter protesters had been—as a mostly peaceful group with a righteous cause. A few bad actors, to be sure, but he wasn’t among them.

But he quickly realized that many Americans viewed January 6 protesters like him not as patriots but as domestic terrorists. Much of the commentary Webster now saw online focused on white supremacy and featured images of protesters holding Confederate flags. Even Trump seemed to briefly forsake them, calling their intrusion on the Capitol a “heinous attack” that had “defiled the seat of American democracy.” As politicians in both parties warned that lawbreakers in the crowd would pay, Webster suppressed a pang of fear.

He seesawed back and forth as he surveyed the evidence. He watched footage of a man hurling a fire extinguisher at a group of police officers. Okay, that clearly crossed the line, Webster thought. Then he watched clips of the Air Force veteran and MAGA devotee Ashli Babbitt getting shot as she climbed through a window into the Speaker’s Lobby leading to the House Chamber, and he felt outraged by what he viewed as her murder.

From the October 2024 issue: Hanna Rosin on the insurrectionists next door

Webster learned that the FBI, media organizations, and amateur internet sleuths were using facial-recognition software to identify those who’d stormed the Capitol. His anxiety increased when he heard that federal agents had begun kicking down the doors of identified January 6 protesters. A friend told Webster that his picture was circulating online. One evening as he lay in bed, his wife’s phone rang. His brother-in-law spoke so loudly that Webster could hear what he said: “Tom is going viral on Twitter.” His wife looked at Webster, concerned. “What do you mean?” she asked.

Her brother texted a photograph that he’d found trending online under the hashtag #eyegouger, showing Webster appearing to thrust his fingers in a police officer’s face. Webster had already told his wife about his fight, explaining that the cop had struck him first. Now he again insisted that he’d been provoked, but his brother-in-law sounded doubtful. Whatever you say, dude.

Panicked, Webster went to see the priest at his Catholic church. The clergyman connected Webster with another church member who was a criminal-defense lawyer. He and Webster arranged to meet with the FBI.

In the spring of 2022, Webster sat at the defense table in a federal courtroom in Washington, D.C. Legal wrangling ahead of the trial had stretched out over 14 months, while lawyers and law-enforcement agents pored over hundreds of pages of filings, reports, and statements, and watched scores of video clips. Five attorneys argued the case—three for the government, two for Webster. Jurors heard from 12 witnesses: three U.S. Capitol Police officers, one MPD officer, one Secret Service agent, three FBI agents, a Safeway grocery-store district manager (who testified about how much the violence on January 6 had suppressed business), two longtime friends of Webster’s, and a former NYPD officer with whom he’d attended the police academy. Jurors also heard directly from Webster and Rathbun, both of whom testified for several hours, and repeatedly watched footage of their altercation from multiple angles. The court reporters’ transcription of the proceedings consumed more than 1,000 typed pages.

During closing arguments, a prosecutor urged the jurors to rely on what they’d seen with their own eyes. He repeated this six times, the last time as a question: “What did your eyes tell you?”

After a trial lasting five days, jurors deliberated for less than three hours before finding Webster guilty on all six counts he’d been charged with, including the most serious felony: assaulting a police officer with a dangerous weapon, for violently swinging his flagpole multiple times at Rathbun. At the sentencing, in September, a prosecutor acknowledged that people like Webster might have been pawns in a political game, but added: “Even if he didn’t know better than to believe Trump’s lies, he knew better than to assault a fellow cop, no matter the circumstances.”

Webster’s defense attorney had argued in a presentencing filing that judging his client’s character based solely on January 6 was like “judging the sea by a jugful of its water.”

“The court doesn’t see a lot of Tom Websters,” the attorney, James E. Monroe, told the judge. “In my career, I don’t get a chance to represent many Tom Websters, someone who’s had such a sparkling career and makes such a perfect disaster of his personal and professional life by seconds of stupidity.” He said that Webster came to D.C. at the invitation “of a president that was desperate to retain power. And like many other Americans, he accepted that invitation. And as we’ve laid out in our own papers, the lies and disinformation were sufficient to fool many Americans, especially those who showed up here at the Capitol on January 6.” He also scolded the government for seeking a long prison term for Webster, who’d never before had any legal trouble and who had served his country and New York honorably as a Marine and a police officer; he called the proposed sentence “an act of vengeance as opposed to a prayer for justice.”

Webster rose to speak. He told the judge that he’d become swept up in politics and Trump’s rhetoric. He said he wished he’d never gone to D.C. that day. He turned and addressed the police officer he’d assaulted, who was sitting in the courtroom gallery: “Officer Rathbun, I’m sorry.”

U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta, an Obama appointee, agreed that for 25 years, Webster had been “a public servant in the truest sense of the word,” an everyday American who now found himself looking at substantial jail time. But although he’d watched the video of Webster attacking the cop many times, Mehta said, “I still remain shocked every single time I see it.” Webster, he said, had contributed to one of America’s darkest days: “We cannot function as a country if people think they can behave violently when they lose an election.” Mehta believed that Webster had constructed an alternative truth about what happened that day, one that was “utterly fanciful and incredible.”

Before sentencing Webster to 10 years in prison, Mehta suggested that understanding his actions on January 6 required a wider lens. The judge posited that a man like Webster doesn’t do what he did unless he is “brought to a place where his mind and his otherwise sense of equilibrium, his patriotism, his sense of self are lost.”

“People need to ask themselves what conditions could have created that to happen,” Mehta said, “and be honest with yourself when you’re asking the question and answering it.”

After Webster turned himself in at a low-security prison in Texas on October 13, 2022, inmates quickly discovered that he was a former cop. When he sat down for his first meal in the chow hall, another inmate ordered him to go and sit with the “SOs”—the sex offenders.

But what was even harder for Webster to deal with was the knowledge that people didn’t see him the way he’d seen himself on January 6—as a patriot. Even his kids, who’d always looked up to him as the father who fixed their bikes and planned family camping trips, seemed sad and puzzled, as if no longer certain about who he was.

In the days immediately following the insurrection, the country seemed almost unified in agreement that what had happened at the Capitol was violent and dark. “The violence, destruction, and chaos we saw earlier was unacceptable, undemocratic, and un-American,” Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said from the House floor just hours after the attack had subsided, adding that January 6 was “the saddest day I’ve ever had serving as a member of this institution.” The next week, the House voted to impeach Trump, and in February the Senate voted 57–43 to convict him, with seven Republicans joining all 50 Democrats in finding him guilty of “incitement of insurrection.” Although this fell 10 votes short of the two-thirds majority necessary for conviction, polls showed that a clear majority of Americans believed Trump bore responsibility for the insurrection. He was effectively banned from all the major social-media platforms, and large corporations declared that they would no longer make financial contributions to politicians who had supported Trump’s election lies. Even the longtime Republican kingmaker Rupert Murdoch, who was then the chair of Fox Corporation, declared, in an email to one of his former executives, “We want to make Trump a non person.” The president seemed to be heading toward political exile, his election claims destined to be inscribed in history as treasonous lies.

But within hours of the attack on the Capitol, an alternative narrative was already forming. On her show the evening of January 6, the Fox News host Laura Ingraham wondered aloud whether antifa sympathizers had infiltrated the crowd. Before long, a chorus of conservative-media personalities, far-right lawmakers, and family members of rioters was suggesting that the reports of savagery had been overblown; that the events of that day had been more peaceful protest than violent insurrection; that the real insurrection had been on November 3, when the election was stolen.

By March, Trump was telling Ingraham live on Fox News that the crowd had posed “zero threat right from the start” and that protesters had been “hugging and kissing” the police. By the fall, Trump and other prominent MAGA figures were regularly referring to the rioters turned defendants as “patriots” and “political hostages.” January 6, Trump would later say, was “a day of love.” News clips featured residents of the “Patriot Pod,” a unit at the D.C. jail that housed January 6 defendants, singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” every night—and before long, Trump was playing a recording of their rendition at the start of his political rallies. On his Fox News show a year after the insurrection, Tucker Carlson said, “January 6 barely rates as a footnote. Really not a lot happened that day, if you think about it.” Representative Clay Higgins, a Republican from Louisiana, has said, “The whole thing was a nefarious agenda to entrap MAGA Americans.” Shortly after the first anniversary of January 6, Trump mentioned the possibility of pardoning the defendants if he were reelected. By March 2024, during the presidential campaign, he was saying that one of his first acts in office would be to “free the January 6 Hostages”; in December of that year, after he won the election, he said he would issue the pardons on his “first day.”

From his cell in Texas, Webster tried to tune out news about the election, the potential pardons, and the J6ers generally, not wanting to get his hopes up. Had the country remained coalesced around the accurate original understanding of January 6—that American citizens had been lied to about the 2020 election by the president and had attempted to sack the Capitol partly at his instigation—Webster might have been forced into a reckoning. Instead, he’d been presented with a more appealing framing that squared better with his view of himself as a patriot and a good person: He and other Americans had gone to Washington simply to petition their government about questionable election results and, while there, had been baited by antifa or undercover federal agents into storming the Capitol. This, in turn, reinforced Webster’s own initial claim about his fight with the MPD cop—that Rathbun had provoked the encounter by striking him in the head, then lied about it to counter Webster’s righteous assertion of self-defense, resulting in his wrongful conviction.

When Trump officially announced another run for president, in November 2022, it solidified everything Webster believed about Trump—that he was a fighter, that he loved America, that he would not be cowed. Despite all that the government had done to Trump, including impeaching him twice, the ex-president remained unyielding.

On Election Night in November 2024, Webster sat in the prison television room, watching the results. By the time he returned to his cell for the inmate head count at 9 p.m., Florida had been called for Trump. Webster spent the next few hours lying on his bunk in the dark, listening to the radio as newscasters called North Carolina for Trump, then Georgia, then Pennsylvania, then the election. Webster drifted off to sleep, full of hope.

For the next few weeks, he wondered whether Trump would keep his word about pardoning the J6ers on his first day back in office. He worried that Trump might pardon only some of the 1,600 defendants, and not the supposedly violent ones like him. Or maybe Trump would wait until the end of his term, to avoid any political heat. For Webster, that would mean continuing to languish in prison for years.

On Inauguration Day, Webster was anxious. He watched the ceremonies for a few hours, then went back to his cell to rest. Later that evening, a prison guard called out: “Webster! Get down to the lieutenant’s office right now.” Just before midnight, he stepped into the cold Texas night, a free man.

From the February 2026 issue: Jeffrey Goldberg on Donald Trump’s inexcusable pardons

The Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., requires nearly all of its 3,200 officers to work inaugurations, typically one of the longest and most boring days of their career; many calculate how close they are to retirement by how many more inaugurations they still have to work.

In January of last year, hundreds of MPD officers who had been at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, were working to safeguard Donald Trump’s second inauguration. To Officer Daniel Hodges, the experience was surreal: The last time he’d seen so many people wearing MAGA hats, they’d been trying to kill him.

On that day five years ago, Hodges had reported for duty at sunrise as part of a civil-disturbance unit, CDU 42. The group (25 officers, four sergeants, and one lieutenant) was specially trained in riot tactics: how to deploy large canisters of chemical spray; how to shoot rubber bullets from 40-millimeter launchers; how to perform extractions—fast, targeted operations to remove people from danger. But on that day, January 6, platoon members looked like typical patrol officers, standing in navy-blue uniforms along the blocks of Constitution Avenue leading to the Ellipse, where Trump was holding his rally. Supervisors had not authorized them to wear riot gear, which was stashed in nearby vans, or carry munitions. They’d been told that their assignment was simply to be visible.

Hodges watched the crowd flow by, noting that a significant number wore tactical gear such as helmets, goggles, and ballistic vests—not the sort of accoutrements people typically wear to peaceably listen to speeches. Around 11 a.m., a large crowd began streaming back toward the Capitol. Around 1 p.m., the U.S. Capitol Police summoned MPD for help; protesters were attacking officers, crashing through barricades, and climbing scaffolding that had been erected in advance of the inauguration. An MPD commander ordered CDU 42 to the Capitol for backup.

A little after 1:30 p.m., Hodges and other officers stood outside their vans putting on hard-shell protective pads that covered their shoulders, shins, and other bones. They listened as a veteran MPD commander at the Capitol began to sound more desperate over the police radio. Officers, some not yet in full gear, rushed into two scout cars and four vans, and sped toward the Capitol. Only two officers had managed to pull on their protective coveralls, stretchy black suits that look like onesies and shield them from flames and chemical spray.

On the northwest side of the Capitol, Hodges and other officers arranged themselves in a two-column formation as a sergeant called out orders: “Shields down! Cameras on!” As they marched toward the Capitol, Hodges noted that his platoon mates, who had worked many protests together, were grim and silent, as if nervous about what they were about to encounter. Many had never worked at the Capitol and had no idea where to go. An officer on the scene led them toward the West Terrace. As they drew closer, a loud roar filled the air. Taking in the crowd, Hodges saw that police officers were preposterously outnumbered. Each put a hand on the shoulder of the officer in front of them, and they marched into the dense, roiling horde, so thick that the two columns were forced to collapse into a single line. Soon the scene devolved into individual battles between officers and rioters.

One rioter tried to rip the baton from Hodges’s hand as he took blows from all sides. Another man, who wore a ballistic vest that bulged with thick protective plates, as if prepared for heavy gunfire, asked, “Are you my brother?” Another said, “You will die on your knees.” A rioter who’d climbed up scaffolding tossed down something heavy, hitting Hodges in the head. Another man tried to take Hodges’s baton and they fell to the ground, the man kicking Hodges in the chest as they wrestled. Hodges managed to hang on to his baton but then found himself on all fours, surrounded by the mob, terrified that he would soon be torn apart.

With the help of colleagues who materialized around him, Hodges managed to stand back up, and he and other platoon members fought their way through the crowd, arriving at the police line in various states of dishevelment. They joined other officers on the West Terrace and tried to keep the crowd at bay. Standing there, Hodges struggled to take in a scene of jarring dissonance: someone waving a flag with Trump’s head atop Rambo’s body; the steady, warlike pounding of a single drum; one angry protester demanding, “I want to speak to a supervisor!” The absolute entitlement of these people, Hodges thought. As minutes passed, Hodges felt as if he could feel the shift and flow of the crowd’s energy, a push of aggression followed by an unsteady lull. A man appeared before Hodges and shouted, “Do you think your little peashooter guns are going to stop this crowd?” Hodges scanned people’s hands for guns and knives, trying to calculate when and whether to use force, how to use just enough to stop the crowd but not inflame it, how any action he took might look later on video.

Horrified, he watched the crowd burst through the police line. An MPD commander shouted over the radio: “We’ve lost the line! All MPD, pull back!” Two men pushed Hodges against a wall; one man reached beneath his protective visor and dug into his right eye with his thumb. Hodges cried out in pain, and managed to shake the man off before his eye was permanently damaged.

Standing near the steps of the Capitol, trying to hold back the marauders, Hodges felt that the job was futile: He would fight off one man, and another 20 would appear. Hodges retreated with other officers inside the building. A high-ranking MPD commander, Ramey Kyle, called out, “It’s gonna be old-school CDU”—civil-disturbance unit—“if they come in those doors, do you hear me?” Officers took that to mean that this was no time for the reform-minded policing of recent years; this fight would be hard and violent. “We are not losing the U.S. Capitol today!” Kyle shouted.

Another officer called out for Hodges’s platoon: “42, come on!” Bracing himself to rejoin the battle, Hodges headed toward the Lower West Terrace tunnel, arriving at a dark concrete hallway about 10 feet wide. There, Hodges saw a few dozen officers in a haze of smoke—rows of four or five stacked shoulder to shoulder—struggling to hold off the hundreds of protesters who’d already breached two sets of doors. Behind those hundreds, thousands more swarmed. The officers believed theirs to be the last line of defense protecting the Capitol. They didn’t know that rioters had already entered the building on the northwest side.

Police and the mass of protesters battled for inches. The attackers swayed back and forth, their bodies working as battering rams. The crowd, Hodges realized, had itself become a weapon. When officers got injured or succumbed to exhaustion or pepper spray, they would fall back, other officers stepping forward to take their place in the fray. As officers around him fell, Hodges pressed to the front of the line. The other side was doing the same, calling out, “We need fresh patriots up here.” Unlike the police, though, the protesters seemed to have an infinite number of replacements.

Hodges had worked many protests, particularly during the long summer of 2020, after the killing of George Floyd. In his experience, when demonstrations turned violent, the violence itself was the point, serving as catharsis and release. But this crowd had a singular goal—to get inside the Capitol. Only a handful of exhausted cops, Hodges among them, stood in the breach.

Hodges braced himself against a metal door frame to his right. But as soon as he got situated, the momentum shifted. The crowd shouted “Heave, ho!” and pushed toward the officers, pinning Hodges against the door frame. He felt the hard plastic of a police shield that rioters had stolen pressing into his other side.

A video—which would soon be viewed by millions of people around the world—captured what happened next. Hodges was trapped, his whole body getting crushed. His arms hung uselessly at his sides. He effectively could not move his legs. A man wrapped his hand around Hodges’s gas mask, violently shoving it back and forth and then ripping it off, shouting what sounded like “How do you like me now, fucker?” As Hodges stood there, scared and vulnerable, the man grabbed his baton and bashed him on the head with it, rupturing his lip and smashing his skull. The video focused on Hodges’s face, his mouth bloody as he struggled to breathe. Fearing that he would soon collapse and be dragged into the crowd, Hodges did the only thing he could—he screamed for help.

Most cops have hero dreams, protector fantasies that sustain them through days that are mostly mundane. The video of Hodges crying out plaintively is the antithesis of how a cop wants to be seen. In the ensuing days and years, Hodges has had to come to terms with that helplessness. He’d bravely advanced to the front of the police line, but in the end, he’d needed rescuing. Like so many people whose lives have been defined by seconds of video from that day, Hodges doesn’t like the story his tells. But he has accepted it, because it’s what happened. Over time, he has learned to laugh when friends joke about how he got his ass kicked on January 6. But the seriousness of his predicament, how close he came to blindness or maybe death, remains ever near; he can still feel the man’s fingers crawling up his cheek toward his eye.

A little after 4 p.m., Trump finally submitted to the multiple entreaties from members of Congress, the vice president, and many others and recorded a video telling the protesters to go home. “We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side,” he said. “But you have to go home now. We have to have peace.” He continued: “There’s never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us—from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election, but we can’t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home.” National Guardsmen and other reinforcements finally began to arrive. At 6:01 p.m., Trump tweeted: “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!”

Though the Capitol had been breached and defiled, and the certification proceedings interrupted, police officers like Hodges—and Noah Rathbun; and Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, who saved lawmakers by redirecting a group of marauders away from the Senate chamber; and Capitol Police Lieutenant Michael Byrd, who in shooting Ashli Babbitt potentially stopped what would have been a surge of rioters toward the House chamber, where members of Congress were hiding—had held off enough of the mob for long enough that no legislators were killed or badly injured. The proceedings could resume, allowing the transfer of power to Joe Biden two weeks later.

Hodges and his fellow CDU 42 officers stayed in the Capitol Crypt until late that night, sitting cross-legged and leaning against columns, nursing their wounds. They were battered and exhausted, but would have fought again if they had to, he told me.

In the years that followed, Hodges testified in court at his attackers’ criminal trials and sentencing hearings. He believed it was important that they face consequences. He told one judge that he wasn’t a vengeful person; he just wanted what was fair. Two of his attackers from the tunnel, Patrick McCaughey III and Steven Cappuccio, were convicted of multiple felony counts and sentenced to roughly seven years each in prison. The man who dug into his eye, Clifford Mackrell, pleaded guilty to assaulting officers and was sentenced to 27 months.

In November 2024, when Americans reelected Trump, Hodges felt a deep sense of grief. During 11 years of policing, he’d seen people do terrible things to one another—shootings, stabbings, maimings. But the election results strained his faith in humanity more than any of that. After all Trump has done? Hodges thought. After all we know about him? His friend Harry Dunn, a former Capitol Police officer who’d been called “nigger” for the first time while in uniform on January 6, later said that seeing the 2024 election unfold was like watching the end of Titanic : You knew what was coming, but it still hurt to watch. Both Dunn and Hodges long ago grew tired of talk about the “shifting narrative” of January 6. “Ain’t no narrative,” Dunn likes to say. “Play the tape.”

As Hodges worked the inauguration in January 2025, he surveyed the legions of happy people in MAGA hats. The scene befuddled him. “It was just very baffling to me, how we’d gotten to this point, after everything we’d been through, that people saw fit to vote for him again,” he said. The assembled Trump supporters, none of whom seemed to recognize Hodges, may not have been thinking about the chaos of January 6, 2021, but he was. He thinks about it every day. His physical injuries have healed, but his psychic ones have not; he has PTSD symptoms and has been diagnosed with depression. When Hodges returned home from the inauguration that night and read about the pardons, he wasn’t surprised. He tried to wrap his mind around the idea of another four years of Trump, and around the incongruity of a so-called law-and-order president, hours into his second term, pardoning people who had attacked cops with weapons that included knives, Tasers, bear spray, pepper spray, lumber, bicycle racks, a cattle prod, a sledgehammer, a ladder, a flagpole, a baseball bat, a hockey stick, and a fire extinguisher.

How could this happen in a democracy, propelled by the leaders of a political party that professed to “back the blue”? It was even harder to understand how so many police officers still supported Trump. The Fraternal Order of Police, the profession’s largest union, had endorsed him for a third time in 2024. Certainly there was blame to go around, Hodges believed. He put some of that on Democrats, who’d all but abandoned police after Floyd’s killing.

Still, Hodges hoped that there would be some nuance in who received pardons. There was not. Trump did not weigh each case like Solomon: He issued full pardons to almost all of the 1,600 people charged in connection with the insurrection. Of those, about 600 had been charged with resisting arrest or assaulting officers, 175 of them with dangerous or deadly weapons. No matter how big their sin, no matter what all of those judges and juries had decided, almost everyone was just—poof—forgiven. The only (partial) exceptions were the 14 members of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys whose sentences Trump commuted, meaning they were released from prison but their convictions were not erased.

After the government spent tens of millions of dollars on what the Department of Justice said was one of the largest and most complex investigations in the country’s history, Trump erased it all at a stroke. Roughly 1,000 people had accepted culpability and pleaded guilty. “No,” Trump’s pardons declared, “you’re not guilty.” Another 250 people had taken their cases to trial. Only four were acquitted of all charges, according to NPR; the rest were found guilty by judge or jury on at least some counts. Nearly 500 defendants awaited trials or sentencing in 2025. “Anyone who spent any time working on Jan. 6 cases saw how violent a day that was,” Mike Romano, a former U.S. attorney who prosecuted some of those cases, told The New York Times recently. “It’s incredibly demoralizing to see something you worked on for four years wiped away by a lie—I mean the idea that prosecution of the rioters was a grave national injustice. We had strong evidence against every person we prosecuted.”

Hodges has watched as the January 6 defendants have been not merely forgiven but extolled, telling their persecution stories at Republican fundraisers as donors snack on meatball platters and charcuterie boards. Sometimes he can’t believe the lengths to which Trump will go to rewrite the history of that day: It was not an insurrection, but a “day of love.” The J6ers were not insurrectionists, traitors, and miscreants but patriots, heroes, and innocents. Hodges worries about the fact that Trump has ordered the Smithsonian to review all of its exhibits in order to “restore truth and sanity.” (One former Capitol Police officer told me that he’d donated the boots he’d worn on January 6 to the Smithsonian, hoping they’d be included in a future exhibit—now he fears they’ll be tossed.)

Though other cops sometimes accuse them of grandstanding, of seeking money or fame, Hodges and Dunn and a few others have continued to speak about what happened to them on January 6, because they believe it’s important to prevent history from being rewritten. “If people would just admit what happened that day, we wouldn’t have to keep telling our stories,” Hodges said. But the efforts of Trump and others to falsify the story, he added, have kept him “tragically relevant.” (Outside of court, many cops have not spoken publicly about their experiences on January 6, including Rathbun.) Hodges says this should not be a partisan issue. He would have defended Trump if he had been attacked at his second inauguration—just as, he says, he would defend the Capitol against an attack by a Democratic mob. “The second a Democratic president tries to hold on to power illegally, I will go after them hard,” he told me. “Until such a time, there’s only one person who’s done that.”

Recently, I told Hodges that I’d been interviewing Tom Webster about January 6. Hodges vaguely remembered the story about the former NYPD cop who’d assaulted one of his colleagues. When I told him that Webster still believed that the 2020 election may have been stolen, Hodges was not surprised. He doesn’t think people like Webster will stop lying to themselves anytime soon. “They can’t,” Hodges said; the cognitive dissonance and moral pain would be too great.

Accepting reality would mean reevaluating everything they thought they knew—that their actions were ethical and justified, that they are great patriots. Accepting the truth of January 6 would require coming to grips with the fact that they supported a con man and participated in a violent plot to subvert democracy. The immediate reward for undertaking this kind of hard self-examination would mainly be shame and regret.

“To grapple with these truths would, in a very real way, unmake them,” Hodges said.

After Thomas Webster was released from prison on January 20, 2025, having served a little more than two years of his 10-year sentence, he went home to a house he’d never seen and a group of people he’d never met. His wife, Michelle, had moved to Mississippi, where members of a church and a J6 support group had adopted her. They brought dinner and a cake to celebrate Webster’s return.

He worried that he’d struggle to readjust, but he quickly felt at home. He and Michelle, married for 25 years, had some bumps as they dealt with the damage from that day—social, financial, logistical—but he told me they’ve gotten past those. Webster mourns all that he missed—teaching his youngest son how to drive, moving his middle child into her college dorm, watching his oldest daughter graduate from boot camp. Interactions with his wife’s family remain strained; to this day, no one has told 99-year-old Nana that Webster was in prison.

Webster and his wife bought a one-story ranch house, 20 acres in the middle of nowhere. He likes living in Mississippi, where he feels farther from the reach of government and politics. Not long ago, when his daughter called him for help with a flat tire and he was able to drive out to her with a patch kit, he felt grateful to Trump for the pardon that allowed him to do that.

Over time, Webster has opened up, telling the people he’s gotten to know at the Toccopola Grocery, an old country store with checkered red-and-white tablecloths and vintage Coca-Cola signs, what he’s been through. He sent them a video about his case, one of the few that he thought rendered his story accurately—that he’d gone to petition his government peacefully and had been assaulted by an aggressive cop. Webster can’t determine if they believe him or not but, unlike some folks back in New York, they seem open-minded. “Ain’t our place to judge,” they say to him.

Webster remains frustrated that the full story of January 6, in his view, has yet to be told. Trump freed him and his fellow patriots from physical prison, Webster told me, “but we’re not truly free until people know the truth.”

When I asked Webster what the truth is, he said he believes that the 2020 election was probably stolen. (About a third of Americans share this belief, even though no credible evidence has ever emerged to support the claim, and dozens of courts have rejected it.) He believes that the federal government made an organized effort to entrap Trump’s biggest supporters on January 6. And he believes that, in pursuing the J6 defendants so mercilessly, the government attempted to silence them, by terrifying them and other conservatives across the country.

Webster has filed a petition to the court asking that it vacate his conviction, arguing that crucial facts were not known during his trial that could have led to him being found not guilty. Even though he’s now been pardoned, Webster told me he felt it was important to document his entire story for the record, preserving it for future generations to consider during “more stable times.”

I pointed out to Webster that he had apologized to Officer Rathbun in court. Wasn’t that a concession that he’d acted wrongly on January 6? In response, Webster said that, although he feels “bad about how the whole day went down,” his apology should not be taken as an admission of guilt: “I was pressured by my lawyer to apologize. He said it would help me reduce my sentence.”

Webster is disappointed by where things stand now: With Trump in office and MAGA conservatives in power, they finally have the ability to prove what happened that day—so why aren’t they? When Dan Bongino was a podcaster, he repeatedly asserted that undercover agents embedded in the crowd had helped orchestrate January 6; now that Trump has made him deputy director of the FBI, why isn’t Bongino releasing the evidence? Webster feels similarly disappointed in FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi. “Why are you guys always bragging about arresting illegal Mexicans doing roof work?” he asked. He wonders why they’re not instead exposing the plots of the deep state, as Trump has demanded. Webster believes that Bongino and Patel have become polluted by the same swamp that Trump has again and again vowed to clean up.

Webster says he barely recognizes the version of himself who drove to D.C. five years ago. Who was that man filled with so much bravado that he thought he could save the country? His days of charging into the fray are over, he said. Sometimes he feels guilty about the life he has now. So many of the J6 defendants have been divorced by their wives, disowned by their kids, fired from their jobs. By Webster’s count, at least five have died by suicide. Yet he still views Trump as the best hope for cleaning out the deep state. “He’s the one person I still kind of believe in,” Webster said.

Recently, he was asked to speak at an event with other J6 defendants. He’d felt fine as he’d approached the podium, full of thoughts to share. But as he stood onstage, he was overcome with emotion. Scenes from that day flashed through his mind: the cop with the gas mask. The feel of the flagpole in his hand. Their tug-of-war. His own rage.

As Webster looked out at the members of the crowd, he thought they’d probably Google him when they got home. Which video clip would they find? he wondered—would it tell the right story or the wrong one? Would they see him as a felon or a patriot? Which truth would they believe?

On his way home, Webster told his wife that he wouldn’t speak at any more events. Reliving what they’d been through was too painful. And he didn’t see much point until the whole story was revealed. So he waits for the truth to solidify into something firm enough to stand on, a day he fears may never come.

            <h2>The Triumph of Indecency</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/02/trump-indecency-jan-6-pardons/685324/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">At 1:42 a.m. on December 19, 2020, Donald Trump—disturbed, humiliated, livid—posted the following message on Twitter: “Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election. Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!”

In California, David Nicholas Dempsey, a 33-year-old man-child with multiple felony convictions and a profound affection for the president, answered the call. On January 6, wearing a tactical vest and an American-flag gaiter, Dempsey came to the Capitol. Shortly before he assaulted several police officers, he shared his perspectives in an interview given while standing near a gallows. The gallows had been erected as a reminder to Vice President Mike Pence to do, in Trump’s words, “the right thing.”

“Them worthless fucking shitholes like fucking Jerry Nadler, fucking Pelosi, Clapper, Comey, fucking all those pieces of garbage, you know, Obama, all these dudes, Clinton, fuck all these pieces of shit,” Dempsey said. “They don’t need a jail cell. They need to hang from these motherfuckers while everybody videotapes it and fucking spreads it on YouTube.”

Dempsey was not an organizer of the siege, but he was one of its most energetic participants. He assaulted Metropolitan Police Detective Phuson Nguyen with pepper spray. Nguyen was certain in that moment that he was “going to die,” he later testified. Dempsey assaulted another police officer with a metal crutch, cracking his protective shield and cutting his head. Dempsey, who was heard yelling “Fuck you, bitch-ass cops!,” assaulted other officers with broken pieces of furniture, crutches, and a flagpole. Prosecutors would later argue that “Dempsey’s violence reached such extremes that, at one point, he attacked a fellow rioter who was trying to disarm him.” All told, more than 140 police officers were injured in the riot, many seriously.

I attended the January 6 rally on the Ellipse, at which Trump told his supporters, “If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” Then I walked with the crowd to the Capitol. One woman, a QAnon adherent dressed in a cat costume, told me, “We’re going to stop the steal. If Pence isn’t going to stop it, we have to.”

What I remember very well about that day was my own failure of imagination. I did not, to my knowledge, see Dempsey—he had positioned himself at the vanguard of the assault, and I had stayed near the White House to listen to Trump—but I did come across at least a dozen or more protesters dressed in similar tactical gear or wearing body armor, many of them carrying flex-cuffs. I particularly remember those plastic cuffs, but I understood them only as a performance of zealous commitment. Later we would learn that these men—some of whom were Proud Boys—believed that they would actually be arresting members of Congress in defense of the Constitution. I interviewed one of them. “It’s all in the Bible,” he said. “Everything is predicted. Donald Trump is in the Bible.” Grifters could not exist, of course, without a population primed to be grifted.

After the riot, Dempsey returned to California, where he was eventually arrested. In early 2024, he pleaded guilty to two felony counts of assaulting an officer with a dangerous weapon. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Six months later, in the summer of 2024, Trump, who would come to describe the January 6 insurrection as a “day of love,” said that, if reelected, he would pardon rioters, but only “if they’re innocent.” Dempsey was not innocent, but on January 20, 2025, shortly after being inaugurated, Trump pardoned him and roughly 1,500 others charged with or convicted of offenses related to the Capitol insurrection. (Fourteen people, mainly senior figures in the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys movements, saw their sentences commuted but did not receive pardons.)

Of the 1,500 or so offenders who received pardons, roughly 600 had been charged with assaulting or obstructing police officers, and 170 had been accused of using deadly weapons in the siege. Among those pardoned were Peter Schwartz, who had received a 14-year sentence for throwing a chair at police officers and repeatedly attacking them with pepper spray; Daniel Joseph Rodriguez, who was sentenced to 12.5 years for conspiracy and assaulting an officer with a stun gun (he sent a text message to a friend, “Tazzzzed the fuck out of the blue”); and Andrew Taake, who received a six-year sentence for attacking officers with bear spray and a metal whip.

A day after the pardons were announced, Trump said in a press conference, “I am a friend of police, more than any president who’s been in office.” He went on to describe the rioters. “These were people that actually love our country, so we thought a pardon would be appropriate.”

Trump had something else to say during that first press conference of his new term: “I think we’re going to do things that people will be shocked at.” This would turn out to be true, but unfortunately, shock does not last. Here is the emblematic inner struggle of our age: to preserve the ability to be shocked. “Man grows used to everything, the scoundrel!” Dostoyevsky wrote. A blessing that is also a curse.

I understand that a review—even a short and partial review—of the past year might seem dismally repetitive. But repetition ensures that we remember, and perhaps even experience shock anew.

So, in brief: Trump has dismantled America’s foreign-aid infrastructure and gutted a program, built by an earlier Republican president, that saved the lives of Africans infected with HIV; he has encouraged the United States military to commit war crimes; he has instituted radical cuts to U.S. science and medical funding and abetted a crusade against vaccines; he has appointed conspiracists, alcoholics, and idiots to key positions in his administration; he has destroyed the independence of the Justice Department; he has waged pitiless war on prosecutors, FBI agents, and others who previously investigated him, his family, and his friends; he has cast near-fatal doubt on America’s willingness to fulfill its treaty obligations to its democratic allies; he has applauded Vladimir Putin for his barbarism and castigated Ukraine for its unwillingness to commit suicide; he has led racist attacks on various groups of immigrants; he has employed unusually cruel tactics in pursuit of undocumented immigrants, most of whom have committed only one crime—illegally seeking refuge in a country that they believed represented the dream of a better life. Those are some of the actions Trump has taken. Here are a few of the things he has said since returning to office: He has referred to immigrants as “garbage”; he has called a female reporter “piggy” and other reporters “ugly,” “stupid,” “terrible,” and “nasty”; he has suggested that the murder of a Saudi journalist by his country’s government was justified; he has labeled a sitting governor “seriously retarded”; he has blamed the murder of Rob Reiner on the director’s anti-Trump politics; he has called the Democrats the party of “evil.”

Yet, even when weighed against this stunning record of degeneracy, the pardoning by Trump of his cop-beating foot soldiers represents the lowest moment of this presidency so far, because it was an act not only of naked despotism but also of outlandish hypocrisy. By pardoning these criminals, he exposed a foundational lie of MAGA ideology: that it stands with the police and as a guarantor of law and order. The truth is the opposite.

The power to pardon is a vestige of America’s pre-independence past. It is an unchecked monarchical power, an awesome power, and therefore it should be bestowed only on leaders blessed with self-restraint, civic-mindedness, and, most important, basic decency.

Liz Oyer: Trump is using a sacred power for depraved purposes

We have been watching indecency triumph in the public sphere on and off for more than 10 years now, since the moment Trump insulted John McCain’s war record. For reasons that are quite possibly too unbearable to contemplate, a large group of American voters was not repulsed by such slander—they were actually aroused by it—and our politics have not been the same. Much has been said, including by me, about Trump’s narcissism, his autocratic inclinations, his disconnection from reality, but not nearly enough has been said about his fundamental indecency, the characteristic that undergirds everything he says and does.

In an important essay, Andrew Sullivan noted this past fall that Trump’s indecency is comprehensive in style and substance. “It is one thing to be a realist in foreign policy, to accept the morally ambiguous in an immoral world; it is simply indecent to treat a country, Ukraine, invaded by another, Russia, as the actual aggressor and force it to accept a settlement on the invader’s terms,” Sullivan wrote. “It is one thing to find and arrest illegal immigrants; it is indecent to mock and ridicule them, and send them with no due process to a foreign gulag where torture is routine. It is one thing to enforce immigration laws; it is another to use masked, anonymous men to do it. It is one thing to cut foreign aid; it is simply indecent to do so abruptly and irrationally so that tens of thousands of children will needlessly die. We have slowly adjusted to this entirely new culture from the top, perhaps in the hope that it will somehow be sated soon—but then new indecencies happen.”

The subject of Trump’s indecency came up in a conversation I had with Barack Obama in 2017. I asked him to name the most norm-defying act of his successor to date. Somewhat to my surprise, Obama mentioned Trump’s speech at the Boy Scouts’ National Jamboree earlier that year. This appearance has been largely forgotten, but it was a festival of indecency. At one point, Trump told the scouts about a wealthy friend of his who, he suggested, did unmentionable things on his yacht.

Obama, a model of dignified presidential behavior (just like nearly all of his predecessors, Democratic and Republican), understood viscerally the importance of self-restraint and adherence to long-established norms. Which is why he was so troubled by Trump’s decadent performance. “You can stand in front of tens of thousands of teenage boys and encourage them to be good citizens and be helpful to their mothers,” Obama said, “or you can go Lord of the Flies. He went Lord of the Flies.”

We are in a long Lord of the Flies moment, led by a man who, to borrow from Psalm 10, possesses a mouth “full of cursing and deceit and fraud.” For many people—government scientists seeking cures for diseases; FBI agents investigating corruption and terrorism; military leaders trying to preserve respect for the rules of warfare; and, in particular, police officers who were brutalized by Trump’s army of deluded followers—these days can seem infernal. Trump’s term is one-quarter over; a piece of advice often attributed to Churchill has it best: When you’re going through hell, keep going.

            <h2>Rotavirus Could Come Roaring Back—Very Soon</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/01/childhood-vaccine-schedule-rotavirus-paul-offit/685513/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Of all the diseases that the U.S. government announced today that it will no longer recommend vaccines against, rotavirus is by no means the deadliest. Not all children develop substantial symptoms; most of those who do experience a few days of fever, vomiting, and diarrhea, and then get better. In the early 1970s, when no rotavirus vaccines were available and most children could expect to be sickened with the virus at least once by the end of toddlerhood, Paul Offit considered it to be no big deal, relatively speaking. In this country especially, rotavirus “was an illness from which children recovered,” he told me.

That perception shifted abruptly during Offit’s pediatric residency training, when he saw hundreds of severe rotavirus cases admitted to the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh each year. Although plenty of children weathered the infection largely without bad symptoms, others vomited so profusely that they struggled to keep down the fluids they desperately needed. Offit can still recall the nine-month-old he treated in the late 1970s who was hospitalized after her mother had struggled to feed her sufficient fluids at home. The infant was so severely dehydrated that Offit and his colleagues couldn’t find a vein in which to insert an IV; as a last resort, they attempted to drill a needle into her bone marrow to hydrate her. “We failed,” Offit told me. “And then I was the one who had to go out to the waiting room to tell this mom of a little girl who had been previously healthy two days earlier that her child had died.”

Within a few years, Offit had partnered with several other scientists and begun to develop a rotavirus vaccine. Their oral immunization, called RotaTeq and delivered as a series of sugar-sweet drops to infants, would ultimately be licensed in 2006. Today, it remains one of the two main rotavirus vaccines available to American children. Offit is now a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, where, he told me, “most residents have never seen an inpatient with rotavirus-induced dehydration”—thanks in large part to the country’s deployment of rotavirus vaccines, which reaches about 70 percent of U.S. children each year.

Now, though, the United States’ rotavirus shield stands to fracture. Today, the Trump administration overhauled the nation’s childhood vaccination schedule, shrinking from 17 to 11 the number of immunizations it broadly recommends to all American kids. “After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent,” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy said in a statement today. Among the vaccines clipped—including immunizations against hepatitis A, meningitis, and influenza—is the rotavirus vaccine, which the administration frames as more of a personal choice, allowable under consultation with a health-care provider but not essential, because the virus poses “almost no risk of either mortality or chronic morbidity.” Experts suspect that vaccination rates will plummet in response. If they do, rates of diarrheal disease are likely to quickly roar back, Virginia Pitzer, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Yale, told me. (The administration’s nod to international consensus is tenuous at best; rotavirus also remains the leading cause of diarrheal death among young children worldwide.)

In an email, Andrew Nixon, HHS’s deputy assistant secretary for media relations, defended today’s decision as “based on a rigorous review of evidence and gold standard science, not claims from individuals with a financial stake in maintaining universal recommendations.” (Offit, who is a co-patent holder on RotaTeq, did profit from his invention but sold his interest in the vaccine more than 15 years ago and does not currently receive royalties from its sale.)

I called Offit to discuss the federal backtracking on the vaccine he once helped bring to market, and what the loss of protection will mean for future generations. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Katherine J. Wu: Rotavirus was once a disease that hospitalized up to 70,000 children each year. Since the arrival of the vaccine you co-invented, as well as another two years later, those rates have plummeted. What was it like to see a vaccine you helped develop have that sort of impact?

Paul Offit: I remember a meeting at Merck [the company that manufactured the vaccine] when they revealed the results of our big Phase 3 trial. [The presenter] showed the data, that it clearly was safe, in 70,000 children. And it was like 95 percent effective at preventing severe illness. She showed a map of the world, with Asia, Africa, Latin America studded with black dots, and each black dot represented 1,000 deaths. She said, “Now we have in hand the technology to prevent this.” Then she showed a picture of a map of the world where all those black dots were gone. And she put her head down, shoulders going up and down, and wept.

The vaccine was taken up relatively quickly, I think in large part because it was an oral vaccine and that is perceived as less difficult than a child getting a shot. To go from 1980 to 2006, and to start to see the incidence of the disease decline, it was just an amazing feeling.

Wu: What will it mean for this vaccine to no longer be recommended by the federal government?

Offit: My wife’s in private practice in pediatrics, and there certainly were many parents who she saw who were hesitant about getting vaccines. And I think it’s more convincing when you can say, “Look, this is a recommended vaccine. This is something that the CDC, the major public-health agency in this country, believes is important for your child to receive.” You can’t really say that now. And if you get rotavirus in early childhood, you have a chance of being one of those 70,000 children [who were hospitalized] before there was a vaccine.

Some diseases, you need to build up a susceptible population, like measles, which we eliminated from this country. That’s not true for viruses like rotavirus, flu, RSV. The virus is always circulating. So if you choose not to get a vaccine, you are at risk, because you may come in contact with that virus. So if there’s a fairly rapid erosion in vaccine rates, I think you would immediately see children suffering a preventable illness.

Wu: In a decision memo addressed to the acting director of the CDC, top officials at the Department of Health and Human Services downplayed the virus’s threat to American children and suggested that the decrease in rotavirus deaths that followed the approval of RotaTeq and another vaccine called Rotarix may instead have been attributable to factors “unrelated to the vaccine, including improved medical care, changes in diagnostic practices, or random fluctuations.” I’m curious what you make of that justification. Were there other reasons rotavirus might have been among the six vaccines targeted?

Offit: A phrase like almost no mortality—really? So the 20 to 60 children who died every year of rotavirus in this country, that’s okay? One child dying is too many, especially if you can safely prevent it. So I don’t agree with that.

Sure, right now the morbidity is low because of the vaccine, and certainly the mortality is largely gone because of the vaccine. We are once again exposing children unnecessarily to harm. There’s no advantage to this. There were 70,000 hospitalizations a year, which was not trivial, and virtually eliminating them was one of the major successes for vaccines in this country. And I don’t understand why you would ever back off that success.

I also just never imagined we would ever get to a time when the CDC, the nation’s No. 1 public-health agency, and the ACIP, which was a group of outside expert advisers who went through the science and made best recommendations, would get to the point where it was basically not a scientific organization anymore. It’s an organization run by an anti-vaccine activist who was a science denialist and conspiracy theorist. I mean, that’s where we are now. We don’t have the CDC anymore. We don’t have an ACIP anymore. I certainly never imagined that. [Editor’s note: Kennedy has an established history of anti-vaccine activism and of embracing conspiracy theories. Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, did not offer further comment on this criticism.]

Wu: This actually isn’t the first time that a rotavirus vaccine has lost a government endorsement. The U.S.’s first rotavirus vaccine, RotaShield, was taken off the market in 1999 after officials detected a rare intestinal-blockage complication. How does the current situation compare? Was there a safety reason to make current rotavirus vaccines less accessible to the public?

Offit: I was actually on the ACIP when that happened. [Editor’s note: Offit was no longer on the ACIP when his own vaccine was voted on.] The [rare side effect was] quickly picked up, and the vaccine was off the market within a little over a year. We care about vaccine safety. It depends on which paper you read, but anywhere from one in 10,000 to one in 30,000 children developed [the blockage]. You were still at greater risk of being hospitalized and dying from rotavirus, but the decision was made to take it off the market.

Wu: What do you think will be the future of the rotavirus vaccine you helped develop and bring to market, and watched help reshape the portrait of diarrheal disease in this country?

Offit: The American Academy of Pediatrics will certainly still recommend it. But younger pediatricians may be less compelled to offer this vaccine, because they didn’t experience this disease when they were in training. But I think what they hopefully realize is that this virus continues to circulate. It’s still out there. And the lower immunization rates, even a little, will cause children to suffer unnecessarily.</div>

            <h2>Trump Seizing Greenland Could Set Off a Chain Reaction</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/greenland-trump-venezuela-nato/685511/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Danish officials think they know how Donald Trump might seize Greenland. In a late-night Truth Social post, the president announces that the Danish territory is now an American “protectorate.” Because neither Denmark nor its European allies possess the military force to prevent the United States from taking the island, they are powerless to resist Trump’s dubious claim. And as the leading member of NATO claims the sovereign territory of another state, the alliance is paralyzed. Arguing that possession is nine-tenths of the law, Trump simply declares that Greenland now belongs to the United States.

This chain of events, which some Danish officials and security experts proposed to us in recent months, may have seemed faintly ridiculous as of last Friday. By the weekend—after the toppling of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Trump’s ensuing insistence that the United States now “runs” Venezuela—it seemed far less so. For months, Danes have anxiously imagined an audacious move by the Trump administration to annex Greenland, whether by force, coercion, or an attempt to buy off the local population of about 56,000 people with the promise of cutting them in on future mining deals. Now those fears are spiking.

Shortly after U.S. forces captured Maduro, Katie Miller, a former White House official who is married to the senior Trump aide Stephen Miller, posted on X a map of Greenland covered in the U.S. flag, with the caption “SOON.” Officials in Denmark told us that they were furious—and rattled. Then, yesterday morning, in an interview with our colleague Michael Scherer, Trump reasserted his intention to annex Greenland. “We do need Greenland, absolutely,” he said.

European leaders have long downplayed Trump’s acquisitive posture and tried to ignore his comments. Not after what happened in Venezuela. Today, the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, argued that the president’s threats are credible. “Unfortunately, I think the American president should be taken seriously when he says he wants Greenland,” she told the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR).

U.S. officials and Trump allies we spoke with downplayed the possibility of military action in Greenland. (Stephen Miller told CNN’s Jake Tapper today that it would hardly be necessary. “No one is going to fight the U.S. militarily over the future of Greenland,” Miller said, reiterating that the territory should belong to the United States.) But Trump has pointedly not ruled out taking Greenland by force. And if the U.S. goes down that road, NATO will effectively cease to exist the moment the first military personnel enter Greenlandic territory.

“If the United States attacks another NATO country, everything stops,” Frederiksen said on DR.

The German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, made clear to reporters during a visit to Lithuania that Greenland falls under Article 5 of the alliance, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all, obligating other members to respond: “Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark. And since Denmark is a member of NATO, Greenland will, in principle, also be subject to NATO defence.”

But how exactly would that play out in practice? One European official was blunt: “We won’t be able to defend Greenland. Are you kidding?”

Boosters of Trump’s Greenlandic ambitions are delighted by the Venezuela operation and by the president’s restated commitment to their cause. “I think it’s a big opportunity and a new beginning for Greenland, with Trump’s interest,” Jørgen Boassen, the president’s most prominent and vocal advocate in Greenland, told us. Boassen, known for his collection of MAGA hats and for wearing T-shirts with Trump’s face printed on them, said that Greenlanders yearn for independence from Denmark and from “Danish elites” in Greenland who don’t speak the native language or understand local culture.

Those long-standing rifts aside, polls do not show widespread Greenlandic support for swapping the Danish flag for the Stars and Stripes. Boassen insisted that many Greenlanders are afraid to speak up in favor of annexation because they would face professional and political retribution. He claimed that Danish authorities shut down his Facebook page, which is his primary means of spreading his support for Trump’s policies. (We were able to access the page this afternoon.) Boassen said that “Trump has heard about people suffering” and that he is “a savior for us right now.”

European leaders see matters very differently. Since yesterday, they have dispensed with the kind of equivocation that sometimes marks their public statements about the American president. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Sky News, “Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark are to decide the future of Greenland, and only Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark.” France’s foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, wrote on social media, “Greenland is neither for the taking nor for sale.”

As for the Danes, they’re cycling through various stages of grief, according to Rufus Gifford, who served as U.S. ambassador to Denmark under President Barack Obama. Above all, they can’t figure out what Trump’s true intentions are, Gifford told us. The likeliest outcome, in his estimation, is that the president uses the leverage of U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine to pressure European countries, including Denmark, to accept U.S. plans for the Arctic island. Indeed, a former senior U.S. official in Europe told us that one reason NATO leaders didn’t speak up sooner, and more emphatically, in opposition to U.S. territorial designs on Greenland was fear that Trump would lash out in response and curtail U.S. support for Ukraine, possibly interrupting intelligence sharing and weapons sales.

The former official said that panic first set in about U.S. plans a year ago, after MAGA acolytes, led by Donald Trump Jr., made a trip to Nuuk, Greenland’s capital. “From the standpoint of the Danish government, that’s when it began to get really heated,” said the former official, who, like some others, spoke with us on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity. The visit had a carnival atmosphere, with locals flocking to see the visiting delegation that had arrived in the president’s personal airplane, dubbed “Trump Force One.”

Danish officials and experts told us it was on this trip that Trump lost any prospect of popular support from Greenlanders. Rumors circulated that Trump’s son was handing out $100 bills to local homeless people. That wasn’t true, but Trump Jr. did buy the people lunch, said Boassen, who helped organize the trip. Still, many Greenlanders believed that Trump Jr. was exhibiting the kind of colonialist mentality that they have long complained about.

Over the following months, some dared to hope that Trump had moved on from his dreams of acquiring Greenland. But a series of recent moves created a new sense of urgency for Denmark. In December, Trump named Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland. (Landry’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment.) The same month, the president appointed Tom Dans, an ally, entrepreneur, and investor involved in organizing American excursions to the island, to lead an Arctic research commission. The U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Ken Howery, told us in a statement that members of his staff have “interacted” with Dans and that he expects to meet with him, given Dans’s new role. Dans wrote on social media that he would make “the ARCTIC GREAT AGAIN!” He declined to comment.

The operation in Venezuela seems to confirm that the president is willing to back up his demands of foreign nations with military action, a kind of gunboat diplomacy for the 21st century. People close to the president told us that Trump is enamored with the success of the military interventions he has ordered in Iran, Nigeria, and now Venezuela—and that he will not shy away from wielding force again. And he’s happy, at least, to use the threat of force as leverage while he eyes Greenland. Some around Trump have delighted in Europe’s impassioned reaction to his latest expression of interest in the mineral-rich island. “Let them squirm,” one close outside ally told us. “Maybe we’ll take it; maybe we won’t. But after what we just saw in Caracas, do you want to try to call Trump’s bluff?” Trump said this past weekend that Greenland is not yet at the top of his to-do list, but he offered multiple timelines—from 20 days to two months—for when he might fully engage on the issue.

Western diplomats and security officials we spoke with were apoplectic. One told us that Denmark and its Nordic neighbors have been taking the president’s statements seriously for a year but have remained uncertain about how to interpret them and, especially, how to respond. The editor in chief of the Copenhagen-based newspaper Berlingske wrote in a column today that Denmark and its allies should seek to raise the cost for Washington of any possible military aggression, including by moving more military assets to the island: “It won’t be able to stop the USA, but it will be a symbolic step.”

A Danish lawmaker, who spoke with us on the condition of anonymity to address the security situation candidly, said that the very notion of the U.S. invading Greenland—both mounting an invasion and defending against it—is absurd. The island is nearly four times the size of France and is mostly ice. The lawmaker told us that Danes are particularly baffled by Trump’s designs on Greenland because he could accomplish all of his security objectives by working with Denmark, a committed U.S. ally. During the Cold War, there was even a nuclear-powered U.S. base built under Greenlandic ice. “If the Americans want another military base, just say where,” the lawmaker said. “If you want a radar, you can put it up.”

Carsten Søndergaard, a career Danish diplomat who served as an ambassador to Russia and as the permanent representative to NATO, told us that additional U.S. troops in Greenland, as well as mining rights, could be negotiated, to the benefit of all parties. “A hostile takeover of an ally’s territory will have severe consequences for the transatlantic relations and the West. So much is at stake,” he said.

There was one specific jab at Denmark, made by Trump aboard Air Force One last night, that the Danish lawmaker felt compelled to counter. “You know what Denmark did recently to boost up security on Greenland?” Trump joked to reporters. “They added one more dogsled.”

A Danish naval unit, called the Sirius Patrol, actually does conduct reconnaissance missions by dogsled in the unforgiving northeastern part of the island. The U.S. Department of Defense—or the Department of War, as Trump’s team has taken to calling it—even celebrates the unit’s history on its website: Danish, Norwegian, and Greenlandic hunters patrolled Greenland’s coast by dogsled to fend off German intruders during the Second World War. Drawing on that legacy, the unit still conducts long-range missions and “enforces Danish sovereignty in the Arctic wilderness of northern and eastern Greenland,” according to the Defense Department.

Patrolling is typically done in pairs, sometimes for months on end without other human contact. The Danish lawmaker said that it’s a tough job in some of the bleakest conditions in the world. “Very few U.S. soldiers,” he told us, “would survive a week up there.”</div>

            <h2>Hegseth’s Appalling Vengeance Campaign</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/01/hegseth-mark-kelly-demotion-vengeance/685512/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>

One indicator of a polity’s health is whether a citizen can be punished merely for telling the truth about the law. The signs for American democracy are not good.

This morning, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that he has begun the process to demote Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and NASA astronaut, and reduce his pension pay. The operative facts here, naturally, are not Kelly’s past service but his current rank and service: a Democrat serving in the U.S. Senate and a political adversary of President Donald Trump.

“Six weeks ago, Senator Mark Kelly—and five other members of Congress—released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,” Hegseth wrote on X this morning. He cited two articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice; Kelly, unlike the other five, holds retired military status, which makes him subject to sanctions from the Defense Department.

What Hegseth did not cite was what Kelly and his colleagues actually said in the video, and for good reason. Doing so would expose the absurdity of the charge and the abuse of power involved in the attempt to demote him. “Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders,” Kelly said. No one in the Trump administration has disputed that this is true. A more agile or even-keeled administration would have smoothly dismissed the video as irrelevant: This is true, but of course we would never issue an illegal order. (As Kelly and his lawyers have noted, Hegseth has cited the same law about disobeying illegal orders in the past.) Instead, Trump and his aides threw a fit, dubbing the Democrats the “Seditious Six.”

One possible reason for the frantic response became apparent quickly. Not only have U.S. forces been conducting likely unlawful strikes on boats in the Caribbean; late last year, several news sources reported new details about the first attack, in which the initial strike had not killed all those aboard the boat, so a second strike was ordered. The Pentagon’s own Law of War Manual for service members states that “orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal.” This revelation made the video from Kelly and company not just hypothetical but directly relevant. It also put Hegseth on the defensive, even among Republican members of Congress, and he quickly shifted blame to Admiral Mitch Bradley, who commanded the operation.

In contrast to the language in the Law of War Manual, the UCMJ articles upon which Hegseth rests his decision to discipline Kelly are vague, involving “conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman” and “all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces.” As my colleague Tom Nichols has noted, these provisions might apply to Hegseth’s own admitted behavior while in uniform. Punishing Kelly is extremely pernicious political retaliation. It also ought to be embarrassing to Hegseth, though he seems as impervious to shame as his boss.

The censure is appealable in the next 30 days, and Kelly vowed to fight it. (If it goes through, it could cost him roughly $1,000 a month in pay, per Politico.) “My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife,” former Representative Gabby Giffords, “recovered from a gunshot wound to the head—all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder,” he said in a statement on X. “If Pete Hegseth, the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in our country’s history, thinks he can intimidate me with a censure or threats to demote me or prosecute me, he still doesn’t get it.”

Kelly is one of several critics of Trump to be targeted by the administration in the past year. The administration has repeatedly sought to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey; launched investigations into a major Democratic fundraising platform and prominent politicians including Senator Adam Schiff; and used administration policy to bully states that don’t fully cooperate with Trump—most recently vetoing a bipartisan bill on a Colorado water project, apparently as punishment for the state’s refusal to free a former local official who backed up Trump’s false claims of voter fraud.

Despite Kelly’s defiance, his attempted demotion sends a message, even if it ultimately doesn’t come to pass. Kelly has the resources and political support to fight for his views, and he’ll get plenty of prominent backers. But if a notable figure like Kelly can be punished, how can any ordinary soldier or sailor who is currently serving hope to refuse an illegal order without facing serious personal consequences?

Members of the armed forces, and retirees like Kelly, are particularly susceptible to Hegseth’s abuse of power, because they can be punished by the Defense Department internally. But the chilling effect does not end with those who are serving or have served, or with the particular question of illegal orders. The administration has told the other five Democrats that it is investigating them as well. The core belief underlying all of this is as plain as it is dangerous: Criticizing Donald Trump and defending the rule of law is sedition.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

The Venezuelan Opposition’s Desperate Gamble

Venezuelans have been through a lot in recent decades: the rise of Hugo Chávez, a ruinous revolution that turned democracy into dictatorship, an economic crisis that became a humanitarian one, the emigration of more than one in four inhabitants. Many people are by now familiar with the smell of tear gas and the sound of gunshots. But the sensory experience of bombs falling from the sky was for the most part novel. The Trump administration hit military bases mainly in or near Caracas; at least seven explosions killed dozens of people.

Many Venezuelans welcomed the strikes. Before Saturday, polls showed that a majority of Venezuelans both inside and outside the country favored U.S. military intervention. María Corina Machado, the leader of the opposition movement, issued a statement following the American operation: “Venezuelans, the hour of freedom has arrived!” she said, adding, “Let’s remain vigilant, active, and organized, until the Democratic Transition is fulfilled.”

The simplest reason for celebration is that Nicolás Maduro is out … But there are reasons to be wary too.

            <div id="article-text">I literally bought a 2011 BMW because it has real dials (not LCD) and actual buttons.

I also have a tesla, and other than the performance, everything else about the car sucks. It&#39;s objectively just poorly designed.  Even the touch screen ignoring the non-physical button aspect, the design is atrocious. There a

I am happy that a brand this large is reconsidering... but it&#39;s still VW...

I wouldn&#39;t touch a German car with a ten foot pole. Right now my dream car is a 2016 Toyota Sienna... used prices are just nuts at the moment...

So many of the OEMs who are bringing back physical controls are doing really shitty implementations. This includes VW with its new Golf.

The main benefit of physical controls compared to touchscreen only, is that users can operate them without looking. But the new Polo, and my Mercedes EQA, have a strip of identical physical buttons, all little up/down levers with small icons. So you can try to use muscle memory to hit the correct button, but it&#39;s hard to press the correct one without looking. The contrast w

The screen-only parts are for detailed things like oil temperature, individual tire pressure, lane monitoring, predicted miles between oil changes, and other things, which if I insisted on 100 percent manual would make the system as complicated as a B-29 cockpit. As well as make the thing cost over 150K

Even then, those are mostly steering wheel pushbutton controlled.

I want a fully AI car where the feature can never be turned off, the hood can&#39;t be opened, the screws all have one-way heads, and of course always-on 360 degree LED lights that outshine a galactic nucleus.

So I can leave it parked in my densified urban condo&#39;s underground storage while I work from home.

Unironically get a toyota. They had the same wheel and AC control layout for a while, and it&#39;s hilariously intuitive with circles for D-pad on both sides of the wheel with &quot;ok&quot; button in the middle.

Let side controls the UI if the car, right side controls driving features (cruise control, LTA, etc).

&quot;You had a phase with no buttons? No wonder your resale values are shit&quot;.

Remember when Boston Dynamics unveiled Atlas some 10 years ago (or thereabouts)? It was remote controlled then, too.

What I want to know is: have the Korean researchers figured out how opening doors [youtube.com] works?

While I’m sure this cool tech will matter to Hyundai, I think they’ll be much more positively affected by the two big battery announcements of the last few weeks: CATL launching production sodium batteries next year, and Donut launching production solid state batteries at CES.

It is Finnish, yes. There&#39;s lots of reasons to be skeptical, but fingers crossed it actually is real

we already have machines, what does making it a bipedal humanoid shape give?

how is a &quot;t-1000&quot; better than &quot;Johny five&quot;?

The idea behind humanoid robots is that they can go anywhere humans can go and use any tool that humans can use.

for the money it will cost them, they sure hope so

What they have demonstrated is a remote-controlled toy. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s charming.

sooo they have a demo with a robot that just stands there while they roll videos and talk corpspeak? very impressive, let me know when the thing actually works

For those hoping that Gen Z would usher in a new era of progressive politics in America, the past two years have been a whipsaw. In 2024 there was great panic over young voters’ drift toward Donald Trump. But in 2025, after young voters in New York City, New Jersey, and Virginia helped deliver Democratic wins, there was a reassessment. In light of these liberal victories, many put forward amended evaluations, stating that Gen Z is both more participatory and progressive than it has been given credit for, and that concerns about Democratic erosion among young men, spurred by the influence of the “manosphere,” have been exaggerated. In fact, Gen Z was lauded for being the most progressive generation ever based on recent measures of racial attitudes from the 2024 Cooperative Election Study dataset, a nationally representative survey of over 60,000 Americans.

So which is it? Is Gen Z a bastion of progressives who are immune to the manosphere’s toxicity? Or is 2025 a blip, and is Gen Z bucking the long-running trend of younger generations moving left?

The short answer is that it’s complicated, and neither of those dueling narratives gets to the truth.

The slightly longer answer is this: According to the best available data, on issues of race, members of Gen Z are, on average, far more progressive than any of their older counterparts. But when it comes to attitudes toward gender, Gen Z members are no more progressive than the rest of us.

It’s a sobering finding with large-scale implications, both for the future of U.S. politics and for our understanding of how the first generation to grow up online is processing the modern media ecosystem.

It’s also particularly telling about the manosphere— a corner of the digital landscape that features communities dedicated to men’s issues ranging from things like self-help, dating, and fitness to explicitly misogynistic forums defined by grievances toward feminism and women. Although the manosphere content often cited by media and scholars is not necessarily racially regressive, it is distinctly gender regressive, and that appears to be taking a toll on Gen Z.

OK, those are big claims. So how do I know this? I’m an academic whose work has focused explicitly on the importance of identity in American politics—things like race, gender, and class—and how we can use surveys to understand its influence. I’m going off not just vibes here; my conclusions are based on that same 2024 survey, which, as noted, drew from more than 60,000 Americans.

Among questions in which the survey asks how much one agrees or disagrees with statements like “Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for Blacks to work their way out of the lower class” and “Whites get away with offenses that African Americans would never get away with,” members of Gen Z are unique. Of all age groups, they show the lowest levels of what scholars call racial resentment, a standard survey index that combines multiple questions to measure racism. However, on measures of ambivalent sexism, via statements such as “Women seek to gain power by getting control over men” and “Women are too easily offended,” Gen Z–ers are strikingly no different from their grandparents. Let’s break it down.

The figure above shows that Gen Z’s level of sexism is only slightly below average, and negligibly lower than the Silent Generation’s. Sexism is measured using respondents’ level of agreement with two statements, mentioned earlier, about women seeking power over men and being too easily offended. Generational scores are then standardized so that they demonstrate how each generation compares with the overall average across all respondents in the CES. Values closer to “high” indicate groups that are more sexist than average, while values closer to “low” indicate groups that are less sexist than average.

This gender finding stands in sharp contrast to racial attitudes. Racial resentment is measured using five survey items about structural racial inequality and is also depicted relative to the overall average. On race, each older generation consistently displays higher resentment compared with the generation that succeeded it. Gen Z is notably lower than average on racial resentment.

The takeaway is not that Gen Z–ers are uniformly progressive, but that their progressivism is uneven. It is real and pronounced based on race but far more tenuous when it comes to gender.

Gen Z’s lack of progress on gender issues is all the more stark when you break down the differences in responses across genders.

One can look at how men and women across age differ in levels of racism and sexism. The first figure shows that younger generations are slightly less sexist than older generations (though this data is in no way as stark as that of racism). However, if you look at this by men and women in different generations, this slightly lower level of sexism is driven entirely by women in those generations. Men across each age group are above average in their level of sexism, and there is no generational difference in level of gender progressiveness.

These trends, unsurprisingly, differ by political party identification. Republicans exhibit the highest level of both sexism and racial resentment for all age cohorts. Interestingly, younger Republicans are actually more sexist than their elders, suggesting a potential regression in attitudes toward women across generations. This further lends support to the narrative that young people on the right are being influenced by sexist content online. Overall, Democrats and independents show rising racial progressiveness across age—but no similar generational shift on sexism.

If the narrative that Gen Z is uniquely progressive were true, we would expect Gen Z–ers to be more progressive than older generations by outright rejecting sexist statements. Older cohorts tend to hover around mild tolerance, so a genuinely more progressive generation (Gen Z Democrats included) should move decisively beyond that baseline. It doesn’t.

It is easier and more comfortable to conclude that Gen Z is pretty great and to advise people to stop panicking—to embrace a comforting narrative that the youth are here to save us. It is also reasonable to applaud reductions in racism that have taken shape over generations.

But dwelling too long on that can foster misplaced faith and ill-timed complacency.

The data reveals that concerns over young people, especially young men, are not unfounded. Gender-focused research supports the lived experience of what women already know: There is a rising tide of gender-based antagonism both online and offline. It does us no favors to conflate the important gains in racial progress among Gen Z with the real evidence of the impact of the manosphere and red-pill communities.

Beyond the findings presented here, research from scholars like Michael Tesler, John Sides, and Colette Marcellin, as well as from Melissa Deckman, supports this broader pattern of gender attitudes. According to their work, young Republicans, men and women alike, are gravitating toward traditional gender roles, and young men overall are becoming more conservative. This shows that gender attitudes broadly are an effective terrain for Republican appeals. Gender attitudes may be a bridge issue that allows the GOP to find new voters without conceding ground on other issues.

Young Republicans, the ones who are more sexist than their grandparents, are increasingly setting the tone and strategy for their party. And this new cohort has focused on reaching young voters in the media environments they already inhabit with campaign strategies that focus on entertainment-forward social media and generationally relatable messages.

In practice, this looks like using masculinity-based appeals to reach young voters, particularly in spaces that sit outside the conventional conservative-media ecosystem. From an attitudinal perspective, this strategy may be well suited to the moment. The lack of clear progress of Gen Z on gender attitudes leaves an opening in which appeals grounded in masculinity and skepticism toward feminism can resonate without triggering partisan backlash. If Republicans continue to organize their outreach around this dimension, the strategy may prove durable over time.

Over the next few decades, these attitudes toward both racism and sexism will shape not just elections, the focus of current commentary, but institutions and policy. A generation that is progressive on race but not on gender will not be able to implement a fully egalitarian society. There will be uneven progress, with movement forward on issues of racial inequality but stagnation and resistance toward inroads into gender inequality. This will manifest across institutions, producing a political world that can accommodate racial inclusion while continuing to normalize unequal gender relations in families, workplaces, and governance.

President Donald Trump’s military operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is flatly illegal under international law and almost certainly illegal under federal law—an unauthorized use of force against a foreign nation that pushes executive power past its breaking point. Yet there is no real chance that the courts will curb it, even as the mission evolves into a possible occupation of Venezuela and an expansion of hostilities to its neighbors. Nor is there any signal that Congress will impose restraints on what appears to be the dawn of a new conflict overseas, surrendering its constitutional war powers to Trump without objection. And even if Congress does try to assert its authority to oversee (or end) military action in South America, it will face an uphill battle in a judiciary that persistently favors the commander in chief.

This inversion of our constitutional order sets a perilous precedent that even many celebrating Maduro’s fall may come to regret. It marks the death knell of the post–World War II settlement that, however imperfect, wrestled the anarchy of war into a framework designed to condition armed aggression on legal justification. The executive branch’s consolidation of power now reverberates far beyond the United States’ shores as a saber-rattling president abandons any pretense that the law can constrain his resort to military force. Indeed, the legal theories the administration has floated to defend its actions draw on a historical source Trump once disavowed: the arch-interventionist claim that the U.S. has an inalienable right to police the world.

It is difficult to tally all the ways in which the Maduro operation was illegal, but start with a point that few dispute: This act violated international law. Trump’s invasion of Venezuela to capture its president cannot be squared with Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, which bars member nations from deploying “the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.” This principle—the most important rule of international law today—should bind the United States, which ratified the charter in 1945. And it clearly prohibits the American government from invading another country to make an arrest.

Yet Mike Waltz, Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, did not even pretend that the administration complied with Article 2(4) in his address to the U.N. Security Council on Monday. Instead, Waltz rejected the premise that this rule should apply to Venezuela at all, because Maduro was an “illegitimate narco-terrorist” and “fugitive from justice.” Of course, if a country can disregard the U.N. Charter whenever it concludes that another nation’s leaders have given up their claim to “territorial integrity or political independence,” then the charter means nothing. Arguably worse was Waltz’s insistence that Venezuela’s vast “energy reserves” also justified the action, a motive Trump has laid bare from the start. It should go without saying that the charter does not, under any circumstances, permit one nation to invade another to secure control over its natural resources.

So what is the government’s legal defense of its military incursion into Venezuela? The administration purports to be following the Panama precedent of 1989—when President George H.W. Bush ordered the military invasion of Panama to arrest its dictator, Manuel Noriega, ostensibly so he could stand trial in the U.S. But this episode was not approved by Congress (which found out just hours before) or the U.N. (which condemned it) or a federal court (which never passed on its legality). Instead, the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel justified the aggression in a secret memo signed by William Barr, who would go on to serve as attorney general for the first Bush and Trump.

In that memo, Barr claimed that the president has inherent constitutional authority to conduct extraterritorial arrests for violations of U.S. law. Even if those arrests require complex military incursions into foreign nations, he wrote, they remain within the president’s inherent powers and do not require congressional approval. Barr further asserted that these arrests did not have to comply with Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. That provision, he wrote, does not actually bind the executive branch because it is not “self-executing,” freeing the commander in chief to disregard it.

This conclusion was obviously wrong: Even if the charter cannot be enforced by federal courts, it remains binding on the executive branch and is a law that the president has a constitutional duty to faithfully execute. The memo was so absurd, in fact, that the DOJ did everything in its power to conceal it, as New York University law professor Ryan Goodman has documented. After Congress demanded to see Barr’s memo, the department refused, even failing to comply with a subpoena ordering its disclosure. When Barr eventually testified about its contents under oath, he omitted its assertion that the president can “override” the U.N. Charter (a legal justification that made up a mere four paragraphs). The Clinton administration finally released the memo in 1993, and in the years since, legal experts have derided it as “deeply counterintuitive and indefensible,” “fundamentally flawed,” “preposterous,” and utterly “bereft of citation to supporting authority.”

But embrace, for a moment, the nihilism of Barr’s memo and assume that international law imposes no legitimate constraints on the president’s use of force. Even then, Trump’s actions in Venezuela would still be illegal—or, most generously, an egregious distortion of the constitutional war powers. It is Congress, after all, that has the authority to declare war and must authorize use of military force. The president is the commander in chief, the civilian leader of the armed forces, but he holds no independent power to commence hostilities. Needless to say, Congress has neither declared war on Venezuela nor authorized military force within its borders.

From where, then, did Trump derive authority to invade Venezuela? As Harvard Law professor Jack Goldsmith has explained, the administration evidently contrived it from its desire to arrest Maduro on federal charges. The logic goes like this: The DOJ sought to take the dictator into custody on charges of drug trafficking. It could do so only by storming Venezuela. That operation would require protection from the military. And as a matter of “unit self-defense,” these accompanying troops had a right to bomb, shoot, and otherwise overwhelm any threats to the mission through lethal force. This rationale is quintessential bootstrapping: The alleged goal of trying Maduro in the U.S. gives Trump permission to launch a hostile incursion into a sovereign nation, whose ramifications may well give rise to a broader regional conflict.

Georgetown Law professor and Slate contributor Steve Vladeck has laid out the danger of this shameless maneuver: It subverts the constitutional order by allowing the president to set off offensive military operations under the pretext of carrying out an arrest warrant on foreign soil. If troops face any resistance, they can escalate with further use of force, sliding quickly toward war—all without authorization from the legislative branch. So the Trump administration’s apparent rationale is less of a loophole than a complete end run around Congress’ war powers with no limiting principle in sight.

Despite all this, no one seriously thinks that any federal court will slow or stop Trump’s attacks in Venezuela and its neighbors. Americans seem to have consigned ourselves to the reality that legal constraints on the commander in chief’s operational decisions are entirely theoretical, with no meaningful mechanism for enforcement. Congress has handed over to the president more and more of its authority over foreign affairs. The Supreme Court has persistently forbidden federal judges from second-guessing the executive branch’s use of military force. (That’s why the Trump administration’s legal defense comes not from a court decision but from a self-serving opinion produced by the Department of Justice.) And the rest of the world has no means to secure accountability for the United States, which does not even recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.

So Trump, already a “unitary executive” at home, becomes a kind of ersatz emperor abroad, bound by no law of nations, no treaty or charter, no checks but those he elects to honor. The post–World War II consensus, as enshrined in the U.N. Charter, rejected this kind of unbridled aggression as an invitation to perpetual conflict. Trump, in turn, rejects that consensus. It may be tempting to ignore the consequences of this radical new doctrine when it is wielded against an illegitimate dictator like Maduro. But Trump is already threatening action against Colombia, Cuba, Iran, and even Mexico, a liberal democracy with a legitimately elected president. The end point, it seems, is whatever this president says it is. That theory of American dominance does not merely push legal limits. It subordinates law to the logic of conquest.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Saturday morning, in what the Trump administration dubbed Operation Absolute Resolve, Delta Force commandos entered the compound of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and extracted him from his own country. They took his wife too, and killed dozens of Venezuelans in their path.

Members of the administration say this was about accountability. Attorney General Pam Bondi says Maduro is about to face the “full wrath of American justice.” She alleges he’s been running Venezuela as a narco-state.

Shane Harris, a staff writer covering national security and intelligence at the Atlantic, says the administration’s actions are not surprising. Since September, the United States has been obliterating fishing boats off Venezuela’s coast and calling it a drug war.

The logic behind Maduro’s extradition is equally hard to explain. And Harris doesn’t want to call it a regime change. The regime remains in place: The vice president is now the interim president.

“That’s still the regime,” he says. “And now I think the United States is not running Venezuela, as President Trump said they were going to do. I think that the United States is essentially holding Venezuela at gunpoint and saying to the new interim president, You’re going to do what we want and govern the country according to these demands, or you’re going to face consequences.”

On a recent episode of What Next, host Mary Harris tries to answer a few of the bigger questions about what just went down in Venezuela. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: I think some people would look at what’s happened over the weekend and say, “Oh, are we at war with Venezuela?” So are we?

Shane Harris: No. Look, we’ve taken hostile action against Venezuela. Could Venezuela say we’re at war with them? Sure. Yes. We invaded their country. I mean, we violated their territorial sovereignty. But Congress has not declared war.

Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, says this is primarily a law-enforcement action because members of the FBI were there to serve papers to Maduro. That is not normal, right?

No, that’s not normal. In the most technical sense, the mission that occurred over Caracas was the Department of Justice issuing an arrest warrant on the president of Venezuela and his wife, escorted by the U.S. military. That’s one hell of an escort. So, sure, in a very narrow, technical sense that is true, but that obviously obscures the reality of what happened here.

What I thought was interesting about the whole law-enforcement-operation framing of this was that Donald Trump was not reading from that script when he was briefing reporters. And in many ways, he seemed to go off script. He talked about this as removing a corrupt dictator and getting Venezuela to pay back what was stolen—to use his words—from the United States in terms of oil and oil revenues. And you could see, both in the other officials who were briefing and in Rubio’s comments on the Sunday shows, an effort to try to walk this back and frame it a bit more narrowly. But the president does what he often does, which is he goes off script. He gets grandiose in his explanations. And that points to the fact that there is no coherent strategy for what is happening right now.

My understanding of things is that Maduro was offered the opportunity to go into exile in Turkey. And he was like, “Oh, thank you.” And they’re like, “All right, we’re coming to get you.” So there were clearly weeks of, if not negotiation, discussion or raising of stakes.

From our reporting and that of other journalist colleagues, the administration wanted him to leave peacefully, go into this kind of gilded exile, as it has been described. The question remains, then: Who was going to replace him? Who would come next? And that seems to be the part that they haven’t quite figured out yet.

There were those clearly within the anti-Maduro camp, both in the administration and publicly, who wanted to see him go and be replaced with possibly the person who everyone agrees actually won the election for president in 2024, Edmundo González, or even with María Corina Machado, the Nobel Prize winner who has been such a huge force for democracy and activism in Venezuela.

Machado was banned from running, so she ran someone else in her stead, but it was sort of as if a vote for him was a vote for her. But Machado has been thanking Trump. She’s very deferential to him, clearly aiming for this goal of “OK, and I’ll take over.” But that’s not what happened.

It’s not what happened, and he was quite dismissive of Machado in his comments in Florida this weekend, essentially saying that she doesn’t have the respect in Venezuela, that there’s not really support for her. This is a very strange argument for him to make. And I think it’s a false argument because everybody agrees, including people in the Trump administration, that González, the candidate who essentially ran in her stead, won by a healthy margin. He is actually the legitimately elected leader of Venezuela. The United States has been saying that for months and months now. So why, then, is the person to replace Maduro his own vice president? Why are you sticking with the same regime?

The vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, got in front of cameras and was basically like, “Maduro is our president, and these people are trying to take our oil.” She doesn’t seem to be a pliant member of Team America here.

Yeah, at least not outwardly. We do have to hold open the possibility that there’s been some behind-the-scenes discussions. There has been reporting that she was in conversations with people in the Trump administration, saying, “If Maduro goes, I can take over, and maybe we can work something out.”

She’s known for straightening out the oil industry in Venezuela, making sure they could make money off it. Doesn’t she have a kind of tangled personal history and reasons not to maybe want to have this American oversight?

She is in the mold of Hugo Chávez and Maduro. This is not somebody who is the pro-democracy, pro-America kind of figure that we would expect to see in some of the other alternatives. She has impressed people in the West and in the U.S. and the administration as a competent technocrat. She is somebody we can do business with. That is how the Trump administration sees her.

What do you think is going to happen in Venezuela now? Who is in charge, and what does that mean for the actual people of Venezuela?

The next step—and this is what we should be watching for in the next couple of days—is some kind of signal or statement from Rodríguez about whether she is willing to negotiate with the U.S. [Editor’s note: Following the taping of this episode, Rodríguez issued a statement on Instagram, including this message: “We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence.”] Rubio has been very clear on behalf of the administration in laying out the demands and what he wants to see action on. And so now we will see if she can at least pay lip service to that in the coming days. I think that will go a long way toward lowering the temperature.

If she continues to be defiant—and, in the way that she was right after Maduro was captured, saying, “He is the legitimate president, we demand that he be brought back right now, we will not be colonized by anyone”—then you’re going to see that temperature raise back up, and that’s going to increase the likelihood that Trump will use military force again. What that looks like afterward I’m not even sure the administration knows. I’m not sure they’re thinking that far ahead.

Two days after the U.S. military action that forced Nicolás Maduro out of power and into a New York courthouse, two big questions remain: What happens next in Venezuela—specifically, who’s in charge? And, related to that: Who’s in charge of U.S. foreign policy?

At his Saturday press conference, where he announced the nabbing of Maduro, President Donald Trump said—to widespread astonishment—that the United States will soon “run,” or even is now “running,” Venezuela.

The next morning, on NBC’s Meet the Press, in an only slightly less baffling moment, Marco Rubio, Trump’s secretary of state and national security adviser, backpedaled on his boss’s claim. Asked whether the U.S. will really run Venezuela, Rubio replied, “Yeah, I keep [seeing] people fixating on that.” He continued: “The bottom line is, we expect to see changes in Venezuela. … It’s not running the—it’s running policy, the policy with regards to this. We want Venezuela to move in a certain direction” that would be “good for the people of Venezuela … [and] in our national interest.”

First, there should be no mystery why people are “fixating” on Trump’s claim. It’s because, in the course of his Saturday press conference, the president said 12 times that he and a group of his choosing, including Rubio himself, would “run” Venezuela.

Second, there is a distinction between running a foreign country and influencing its direction, even when this influence stems from a U.S. naval armada that remains off Venezuelan shores and an explicit threat from Trump to send in a second, larger wave of U.S. troops to enforce our influence.

Hence the question: Who is running American foreign policy—the president or his chief foreign policy adviser?

The question isn’t trivial. First, the answer will shape what happens next in Venezuela—who governs, to whose benefit, and with what level of internal freedom and stability? Second, it could shape what lessons other countries—friends and foes—take from Operation Absolute Resolve, the quite large and impressive military action that unfolded in the wee hours on Saturday. Will Russian President Vladimir Putin see the claim of unabashed regional imperialism as a winking green light to his claim of control over Ukraine? Will Chinese President Xi Jinping infer the same about his claims over Taiwan? Will the mullahs of Tehran take it as grounds for fear of an impending U.S. attack? How seriously will Cuba’s leaders take Trump’s—and Rubio’s—warnings that as goes Caracas will soon go Havana, whether by U.S. attack or self-immolation?

Given the regional and global stakes, one might think that Trump and his team would have worked out a unified message to explain and justify this audacious (to say the least) military action. Instead, this is just another case in point that Trump’s actions often have no underlying strategy—which is to say, no clear idea of how to link means and ends: or, in this case, just what the desired ends are.

Some of those ends are clear, as Trump laid out on Saturday and as neither Rubio nor any of the other officials flanking him contradicted: the desire for sole domination of the Western Hemisphere (as had been spelled out in his National Security Strategy document) and the desire for control of its oil and the wealth it produces.

Leaving aside the wisdom and legality of those goals, the press conference and Rubio’s subsequent caveat made clear that the administration has not thought through just how to obtain them—i.e., it’s clear they have no strategy.

If Trump is serious about “running” Venezuela, how, and through what agent, does he plan to do this? He said that Maduro’s former deputy, Delcy Rodríguez, who has now been sworn in as his interim successor, was an acceptable intermediary, and that Rubio is working with her. (Rodríguez herself, a longtime fiery Maduro associate who at first denounced the abduction, has since said she’s willing to “collaborate” with the U.S. to redevelop her country, though added, perhaps wishfully, that she wouldn’t let it become a U.S. colony.)

The same question applies if Rubio’s slightly less coercive notion of merely influencing the country’s policy applies. Maduro’s ministers remain in charge; the Venezuelan military retains ultimate power, offering security and oppression, assisted by at least 20,000 Cubans, many officers and some health care workers who have provided health care in exchange for Venezuelan oil. Will the military now be swayed toward northern-leaning sentiments, given the evaporation of the wages that Maduro provided and the continuing blockade of the country’s oil for as long as they refuse to budge? Some insiders were apparently bought off during the planning of the incursion. The CIA had recruited at least one person close to Maduro to keep track of his movements; it’s reasonable to assume that wasn’t the only spy.

And what about the democratic opposition? Trump shoved aside any role in a new government for María Corina Machado, the movement’s leader, saying, “She doesn’t have respect in the country.” And he said nothing about the leader of her party, Edmundo González Urrutia, who legitimately won the 2024 election and who fled in exile to Spain after Maduro, who was soundly defeated, held on to power. Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her valiant struggle (perhaps to the bitterness of Trump, who many times said he deserved it), issued a statement, calling on Urrutia to be brought back to lead the country. Will the democrats on the streets and elsewhere second her demands, or will they simply bow down to the continued reign of Maduro’s team just because it will now be tempered a bit by influence from Washington and the big oil companies?

This too has broader implications. The United States cannot easily claim to be leader of “the free world,” or even a champion of democracy, if it ousts a dictator—a feat that many Venezuelans cheer—but then does nothing to help restore the real, freely elected president.

There is also something a bit fishy about the official rationale for the military operation, which was to bring a criminal fugitive to justice, given that the U.S. extracted him through means that were likely in violation of international law. Yes, a U.S. grand jury indicted Maduro for drug smuggling back in 2020, and in the wake of his abduction this weekend, the Justice Department filed additional charges—most of them legitimate. (I say “most,” rather than “all,” because one of them, possession of a machine gun, seems an odd charge to level against a foreign head of state, however illegitimate he might be.)

Which leads to one more broad point. The United States has had a pretty successful record of overthrowing foreign leaders but a pretty lousy one of imposing order, or accomplishing whatever outcomes it has desired, in the aftermath. (Some obvious cases in point: Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Guatemala, and—going back several decades but one with enormous implications later on and ever since—Iran.)

A reporter at Saturday’s press conference asked Trump about this mixed record with previous presidents. His reply was evasive to say the least:

With me, that’s not true. With me, we’ve had a perfect track record of winning. … If you look at [the assassination of Qasem] Soleimani, you look at [Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi, you look at the Midnight Hammer [the air raid on Iranian nuclear targets] … we have essentially peace in the Middle East because of that. … So, with me, you’ve had a lot of victory. You’ve had only victories, you’ve had no losses.

There are several disturbing things about this passage, quite aside from the fact that “peace in the Middle East” remains, in many ways, aspirational. The most pertinent here is that Trump seems to believe that a dramatic tactically successful strike—the killing of a terrorist leader, the bombing of a nascent nuclear facility, the signing of a multiphase 20-point peace treaty (but the accomplishment of just the first phase), and now the extraction of a horrible dictator—amounts to a strategic victory and the fulfillment of an ambitious policy.

Trump doesn’t think he has to care about what happens next in Venezuela or what he needs to do to make it happen, to improve the odds of success or reduce the odds of catastrophe, however those terms are defined.

In Operation Absolute Resolve, the U.S. military showed itself to be, as it has several times in recent years, an agile, effective, supremely coordinated instrument of national power. Whose resolve it enforces, to what ends, is another matter. The policymaking machinery at the top of America’s power structure is appallingly adrift.

            <h2>Humongous 52-inch Dell monitor will make you feel like king of the internet with four screens in one</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/06/dell_52inch_monitor_four_screens_in_one/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you like to separate your workflow onto multiple monitors but hate the gap and bezel between screens, Dell’s new display was made for you. Announced on Tuesday at CES, the Dell UltraSharp 52 (U5226KW) offers 52 inches of 6K resolution screen real estate that you can divide into up to four virtual monitors, supporting input either from up to four different devices, or one computer that creates that many desktops.

Due out in January for $2,899, it&#39;s definitely a more elegant solution than having three or four monitors on your desk. Dell’s 27-inch, 4K Ultrasharps are about 24.1 inches wide, but this new one is just 48.16 inches wide, so it would take about the equivalent desk space of two monitors while providing the real estate of three or four.

With a 21:9 aspect ratio and 6144 x 2560 resolution, this IPS monitor has plenty of room for your work, whether it’s three or four desktops&#39; worth of content stacked horizontally next to each other or a parade of windows on a single 6K workspace. That’s a solid 129 pixels-per-inch, which is about on-par with a 32-inch 4K monitor (138 PPI).

Four desktops, evenly divided, would yield desktops that were each 1536 x 2560. That’s probably adequate for viewing web pages, but it might not be the best for seeing stock charts or wide spreadsheets next to each other. I’d recommend going with just three desktops at 2048 x 2560 each.

The panel has strong specs, boasting a 2000:1 contrast ratio, 400 nits of brightness and the ability to reproduce 99 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, along with 100 percent of the sRGB gamut. It has a slew of ports to help you connect to all those devices, including two HDMI 2.1 connections, two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, one Thunderbolt 4 port, three USB-C upstream ports for connecting to computers, two USB-C downstream ports for connecting to peripherals, and four USB Type-A ports for peripherals.

The Thunderbolt 4 port can deliver up to 140 W of juice to a laptop that needs it. And some of the USB-C and USB Type-A ports can offer up to 27 W to charge a phone or tablet.

If you need vibrant accurate color more than you need multiple desktops, Dell’s UltraSharp 32 (U3226Q) could be a solution. Due out in February for $2,599, this 32-inch screen features a vibrant QD-OLED panel that promises to reproduce 99 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut with a Delta E accuracy score of under 1 (lower is better). It also supports DisplayHDR True Black 500 and Dolby Vision HDR, both of which offer deep blacks that make the other colors pop more.

Perhaps more importantly, you can calibrate the display yourself using a built-in colorimeter. You can run the calibration on the display itself, without software, and the results are stored in the monitor’s firmware, so even if you connect it to another computer, it will stay the same. You can also use Dell’s software or a remote console to correct the color.

Like most OLED monitors, it doesn’t get super bright, at least not if you want the entire screen lit evenly. The UltraSharp 32 can reach up to 1,000 nits in a small 3 percent area of the display, about 500 nits in a 10 percent window, and roughly 300 nits across the full screen.

I got to see this monitor in person running a demo video and was impressed with the vibrant colors that seemed to jump off the screen. The green feathers of a parrot and the orange fur of a tiger really looked fantastic. Perhaps not surprisingly, the monitor also comes with a hood, something most serious photo and video editors require.

Dell stirred some controversy in 2025 when it decided it was killing off most of its laptop brands and replacing them with names like Dell Pro, Dell Plus, and Dell Premium. This year, the company acknowledged that it went too far and is going to bring back the XPS line of premium laptops that, for a moment, was known as Dell Premium.

If you were to have checked the Dell.com website before this announcement, you’d still have seen some XPS 13 laptops for sale, so it’s fair to say that the brand was never really gone. However, the 14 and 16-inch members of the family didn’t carry that tag.

Along with its brand announcement, Dell is bringing out new 14 and 16-inch systems, appropriately named the Dell XPS 14 and Dell XPS 16. To really show off the company’s commitment to the brand, the lid of the CNC aluminum laptops has the XPS logo on it, a first.

Available for sale right away, both laptops will be powered by Intel “Panther Lake” CPUs, ranging from the eight-core, Intel Core Ultra 5 325 on the low end to the 16-core Intel Core Ultra X9 388H on the high end (the 388H will be available at a later date). You’ll be able to configure them with up to 64GB of LPDDR5x RAM that runs at up to 9600 MT/s and up to a 4TB PCIe 5 SSD.

The Dell XPS 14 weighs just 3 pounds (1.36kg) and is a mere 0.58 to 0.6 inches (15.2 mm) thick. It’s available with either a 1920 x 1200 panel that has 500 nits of brightness and covers 100 percent of the sRGB color gamut or a 2880 x 1800 OLED touch screen panel that also hits 500 nits of brightness and offers 100 percent of the much-wider DCI-P3 color gamut, along with an impressive 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio.

The Dell XPS 16 starts at 3.65 pounds and is the same 0.58 to 0.6 inches thick. Its 16-inch display is available with either a 1920 x 1200, 500-nit panel or a 3200 x 2000 OLED touch panel. The base panel promises 500 nits of brightness and reproduces 100 percent of the basic sRGB gamut, while the OLED panel has the same peak brightness but reproduces the wider DCI-P3 gamut at 100 percent, along with a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio.

Interestingly, the LCD display on both models has a variable refresh rate that’s controlled by the system’s “smart power management.” It automatically adjusts the refresh rate from 120 Hz down to as low as 1 Hz, depending on the type of content you’re viewing. So video and games get the highest while reading emails gets the lowest, most power-efficient mode.

According to Dell, the XPS 14 and XPS 16 lasted “up to 27” hours on a charge when streaming Netflix at 4K using a 250-nit brightness setting. The company also claims that, at 150 nits of brightness and playing FHD video, the XPS 16 lasted an impressive 43 hours and 20 minutes and the XPS 14 endured for 40 hours and 27 minutes.

The XPS 14 and 16 are available for purchase on Tuesday with starting prices of $2,049 and $2,199 respectively in the US. A 13-inch XPS 13 will come later this year. ®

            <h2>Congress ctrl-Zs bulk of proposed cuts to NASA science</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/06/nasa_science_budget_boost/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA&#39;s budget battle took another turn this week as the US House and Senate Appropriations Committees released text rejecting proposed cuts to the space agency.

The &quot;joint explanatory statement&quot; [PDF] is a little light on detail, but restores most of NASA&#39;s science budget. The FY2026 Request was $3.9 billion, down from the FY2025 Enacted figure of $7.33 billion, which was described as &quot;an extinction-level event&quot; for science by some observers.

The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act has brought the amount back to $7.25 billion, doubtless to the relief of NASA and its new Administrator, Jared Isaacman. While this still represents a cut from previous levels, and inflation will further reduce its purchasing power, the reduction is far less severe than initially proposed.

There is, however, a slight reduction in Exploration budget, for which $8.31 billion was requested, and $7.78 billion was allocated under the agreement. That said, the Trump administration&#39;s desire to kill off the Space Launch System in favor of commercial options has been muted.

The document states: &quot;The agreement rejects the proposed termination of the Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion programs following Artemis III.&quot; It also prohibits raiding funds from the Artemis Moon to Mars Transportation account &quot;unless and until a commercial alternative is demonstrated to meet or exceed the capabilities of the SLS and Orion systems.&quot;

The agreement between the US House and Senate Committees still needs to pass the whole House and Senate, meaning that the uncertainty surrounding NASA&#39;s budget is not over.

Also not mentioned in the agreement is the fate or identity of the &quot;space vehicle&quot; to be transferred to Houston. Widely expected to be Space Shuttle Discovery, which is housed at the Smithsonian&#39;s Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia, the move has proved controversial. As 2025 drew to a close, US Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) stated that Isaacman had &quot;committed to follow Sen. Cornyn&#39;s provision of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act [OBBA], now law, to move the Space Shuttle Discovery in one piece from Virginia.&quot;

The OBBA does not mention Discovery by name. Instead, it calls for a space vehicle that &quot;has flown into space&quot; and &quot;has carried astronauts.&quot;

In a recent interview, Isaacman did not confirm that Discovery had been selected for the move. Instead, he cautioned that the relocation would have to be within budget and ensure &quot;the safety of the vehicle.&quot;

He said: &quot;And if we can&#39;t do that, you know what? We&#39;ve got spacecraft that are going around the Moon with Artemis II, III, IV, and V. One way or another, we&#39;re going to make sure the Johnson Space Center gets their historic spacecraft right where it belongs.&quot; ®

            <h2>Crypto wallet shop Ledger confirms customer data lifted in Global-e snafu</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/06/ledger_globale_breach/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Blockchain security biz Ledger says customer information was accessed in a breach at its ecommerce payment partner Global-e, and is warning that other brands using the platform may also be affected.

The number of customers impacted is not confirmed, but Ledger said basic personal information - name and contact data - was exposed, as were order details including products and prices.

Both Ledger and Global-e said there is no impact on financial data or cryptocurrencies, and that details such as passwords or 24-word Ledger recovery phrases are unaffected.

Global-e, which Ledger uses so that customers can purchase products in their local currency, started sending emails to affected customers on January 5, saying it does not store sensitive details - things like government IDs - since they are not used for order fulfilment.

The company did, however, warn that Ledger customers should be vigilant to potential phishing attacks.

Global-e stated in its fact sheet: &quot;Though only limited contact details were improperly accessed due to this incident, out of an abundance of caution we encourage you to remain vigilant to any suspicious or unsolicited communications, including emails, phone calls, text messages or instant messages that reference online orders, and avoid clicking on suspicious links.

&quot;Note that such suspicious communications may try to impersonate either one of the online brands we support or Global-e, however, neither of us will ever contact you requesting your information via text message or phone call. If you suspect that it is a phishing attempt, report it as spam, and block the sender.&quot;

Professional scam-hunter NanoBaiter shared on social media an early example of how cybercriminals have already capitalized on the breach.

The email, ostensibly from &quot;Katie at E-Global,&quot; is addressed to &quot;Ledger User&quot; and contains a link encouraging victims to learn more about how a recent update improves Ledger device security.

Potentially affected customers were warned that official notifications came from no-reply@global-e.com, and to check that this address matches before clicking any links they receive.

Ledger also warned customers to be extremely suspicious if any physical package or so-called replacement Ledger devices arrive at their door.

It said: &quot;Ledger will never send physical items or ask you to scan QR codes, visit websites, or share your 24-word recovery phrase.

&quot;Do not follow any instructions, do not scan anything, and never share your recovery phrase. Take photos and report the incident through Ledger&#39;s official support channels.

&quot;If you ever receive a device and are unsure about it, you can verify it by running the Ledger Genuine Check in Ledger Wallet, which verifies whether a device is authentic and untampered with. Your funds remain safe as long as your recovery phrase has not been shared.&quot;

Ledger, based in France, offers a wide range of blockchain-related products, from electronic wallets and backup solutions, to physical devices such as hardware wallets and signers for transaction security.

If customers were to link a compromised signing device, it could potentially lead to their accounts and wallets being taken over by criminals.

At the time of writing, Ledger is the only company to come forward and acknowledge its customers being affected by the attack on Global-e.

However, in its own fact sheet about the breach, it suggested other brands could have been caught up too.

&quot;Ledger was not the only brand whose customer data was affected,&quot; the company stated. &quot;The unauthorized party gained access to a Global-e cloud-based information system containing shopper order data from several brands.

&quot;Ledger takes data security seriously, and when informed by Global-e of the security incident, Ledger worked with Global-e to help it notify impacted Ledger users with information relevant to them.&quot;

Global-e made no direct reference to any of its other clients also being implicated, although it said in an email to affected customers that the attack pertained to &quot;one or more brands you have purchased on their web-store recently.&quot;

The company claims on its website that it provides services to more than 1,000 brands across 200 plus markets worldwide.

Listed among its more high-profile clients are high fashion brands Burberry, Hugo Boss, and Ralph Lauren, as well as the likes of Netflix, M&S, Adidas, the Wimbledon tennis championships, and the Disney Store.

The Register contacted Global-e for more information, but it provided nothing that was not already included in its fact sheet. ®

            <h2>UK urged to unplug from US tech giants as digital sovereignty fears grow</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Open Rights Group is warning politicians that the UK is leaning far too heavily on US tech companies to run critical systems, and wants the Cybersecurity and Resilience Bill to force a rethink.

The digital rights outfit says the bill, which is due to receive its second reading in the House of Commons today, represents a rare opportunity to force the government to confront what it sees as a strategic blind spot: the UK&#39;s reliance on companies such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and data analytics biz Palantir for everything from cloud hosting to sensitive public sector systems.

&quot;Just as relying on one country for the UK&#39;s energy needs would be risky and irresponsible, so is overreliance on US companies to supply the bulk of our digital infrastructure,&quot; said James Baker, platform power programme manager at Open Rights Group. He argued that digital infrastructure has become an extension of geopolitical power, and the UK is increasingly vulnerable to decisions taken far beyond Westminster&#39;s control.

&quot;Now more than ever, the UK needs to build and protect sovereignty over its digital infrastructure, and not leave itself vulnerable to the policies and actions of foreign powers such as the US and China,&quot; Baker added. While the US remains a close ally, he said its growing willingness to use economic and technological leverage to pursue political and military objectives should give UK lawmakers pause.

&quot;The Cybersecurity and Resilience Bill is an opportunity to improve the UK&#39;s control over its infrastructure,&quot; he added.

ORG points to several recent cases where control over digital infrastructure was used as political leverage.

One case cited in its briefing involves the International Criminal Court, which reportedly found itself caught up in US sanctions policy. After former US president Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the court over its arrest warrant for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reports emerged that the email account of chief prosecutor Karim Khan was blocked. Microsoft denied cutting off access, but the ICC later confirmed that in October 2025 it had stopped using Microsoft services altogether, switching instead to openDesk, an open source European platform.

Another episode dates back to 2022, when US agricultural giant John Deere remotely disabled tractors stolen by Russian forces from a Ukrainian dealership. The move was widely celebrated at the time, but it also revealed that the same remote &quot;kill switch&quot; could, under political pressure, be used against customers anywhere in the world.

Closer to home, ORG points to the UK&#39;s own experience with Huawei. The Chinese networking giant&#39;s kit is being expunged from Brit networks following extensive pressure from the US government. The episode, ORG argues, shows how quickly strategic dependencies can turn into liabilities.

ORG says ministers need to think harder about what happens when things go wrong, such as a major supplier pulling out or foreign laws getting in the way of UK access to data. It argues that those risks should be considered up front when the government signs off on core digital systems.

The group&#39;s point is that security tends to look fine until politics gets involved. Systems can be locked down and fully certified, but still come unstuck if they depend on a few foreign vendors, closed platforms that can&#39;t be swapped out quickly, or cloud services that ultimately answer to lawmakers in another country.

Its proposed fix is not flashy. ORG wants the government to lean harder on open source software and interoperable systems, reducing vendor lock-in and making it easier to replace suppliers when relationships sour. The upside, it says, is that more UK firms would finally stand a chance of bidding for public sector work, instead of watching contracts default to the same multinational names, including AWS and Microsoft.

The timing is no accident. Similar arguments are playing out across Europe, where governments are growing twitchy about just how much of their digital plumbing now sits in the hands of US hyperscalers.

Whether the UK treats that as a warning sign or just the price of convenience is now a question MPs will have to answer. ®

            <h2>Researchers poison stolen data to make AI systems return wrong results</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/06/ai_data_pollution_defense/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Researchers affiliated with universities in China and Singapore have devised a technique to make stolen knowledge graph data useless if incorporated into a GraphRAG AI system without consent.

Large language models (LLMs) base their predictions on training data and cannot respond effectively to queries about other data. The AI industry has dealt with that limitation through a process called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which gives LLMs access to external datasets. Google&#39;s AI Overviews in Search, for example, use RAG to provide the underlying Gemini model with current, though not necessarily accurate, web data.

GraphRAG represents Microsoft&#39;s effort to make RAG more effective. By creating semantically related data clusters called knowledge graphs (KGs), GraphRAG outperforms basic RAG when linked to an LLM-based system. The structuring of the data makes it easier for the LLM to make accurate predictions when prompted.

Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all support GraphRAG in their respective cloud services.

In a preprint paper titled Making Theft Useless: Adulteration-Based Protection of Proprietary Knowledge Graphs in GraphRAG Systems, authors Weijie Wang, Peizhuo Lv, et al. observe that enterprise KGs can cost a considerable amount to build, citing a figure of $5.71 per factual statement [PDF] in the KG encompassing 21 million assertions available in Cyc.

Given the potential expense, companies have an incentive to prevent KG assets from being stolen and used to build a competitive AI-oriented product – a concern exhibited by publishers, authors, and other creators of media content. Companies like Pfizer and Siemens have invested in KGs to facilitate drug discovery and assist with manufacturing.

Academics Wang, Lv, and their co-authors propose a KG defense called AURA, which stands for &quot;Active Utility Reduction via Adulteration.&quot; The ten authors are affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, and Beijing University of Technology.

AURA, they explain in their paper, is &quot;a novel framework that makes a stolen KG unusable to an adversary while maintaining minimal performance overhead for the GraphRAG system.&quot;

Essentially, it&#39;s a mechanism for subtly poisoning or adulterating the data that goes into a KG such that accurate retrieval requires a secret key. Unlike traditional encryption, the goal is not to deny access to cleartext; rather it&#39;s to degrade KG responses to LLMs such that predictions made without the key produce reduced accuracy and hallucinations.

Alternative approaches like watermarking may have some utility for making data theft traceable, but they don&#39;t address misuse of stolen data in a private setting. And the authors argue that encryption isn&#39;t practical.

&quot;Fully encrypting the text and embeddings would require decrypting large portions of the graph for every query,&quot; they claim. &quot;This process introduces prohibitive computational overhead and latency, making it unsuitable for real-world use.&quot;

The threat model here assumes that the attacker has been able to steal a KG outright but hasn&#39;t obtained the secret key. Trade secret lawsuits confirm that companies like Waymo aren&#39;t keen to see their IP assets spirited away.

The researchers tested their technique by creating adulterated KGs using datasets MetaQA, WebQSP, FB15K-237, and HotpotQA, then attempted to deploy GraphRAG systems using these poisoned KGs in conjunction with various LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash, Llama-2-7b, and Qwen-2.5-7b).

The results indicate that AURA is highly effective. The models retrieved adulterated content 100 percent of the time and emitted incorrect responses to users based on that misinformation 94 percent of the time.

The technique is not perfect, the academics note, because in some cases the KG may contain both correct and incorrect (adulterated) data about a subject and the LLM may choose the correct answer.

There are techniques for detoxifying poisoned data but the authors claim their approach mostly resists checks based on semantic consistency (e.g. Node2Vec), on graph-based anomaly detection (e.g. ODDBALL [PDF]), and on hybrid approaches (e.g. SEKA).

&quot;By degrading the stolen KG&#39;s utility, AURA offers a practical solution for protecting intellectual property in GraphRAG,&quot; the authors conclude. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Students at a school in Warwickshire, England, have scored an extended Christmas break after a cyberattack crippled its IT systems, forcing classrooms to close and staff to summon government incident responders.

Higham Lane School in Nuneaton said it would stay shut on Monday and Tuesday after a cyber incident &quot;took down the school IT system,&quot; cutting off access to phones, email, servers, and its management system. The school said the decision to close was taken on the advice of external experts as investigations continue.

In a message to parents published on Monday, headteacher Michael Gannon said the school is &quot;working closely with external agencies, including a Cyber Incident Response Team from the Department for Education, as well as IT experts from our Multi Academy Trust, the Central England Academy Trust, to fully investigate and resolve the issue.&quot;

As part of the response, the school has told both staff and students to keep well clear of its systems, including Google Classroom and SharePoint, until further notice. Gannon said pupils who had already logged in &quot;should not worry,&quot; but noted the lockdown on access was necessary &quot;to ensure maximum safety while investigations continue.&quot;

With school logins off-limits, pupils have been pointed instead to external revision sites such as BBC Bitesize and Oak National Academy, which the school stressed are not connected to its own network. Year 11 and Year 13 students have been encouraged to use the enforced downtime to brush up for their GCSE and A-level exams.

An earlier note sent to parents on January 3 set out the scale of the disruption more bluntly, saying the school and sixth form appear &quot;to have been a victim of a cyberattack&quot; that left it unable to use &quot;any digital services.&quot;

That message also acknowledged the regulatory implications of the incident. The school said it had reported the incident to the Information Commissioner&#39;s Office &quot;in line with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 2018 / GDPR and where possible within 72 hours,&quot; and that it would work with its local authority data protection officer to meet those obligations.

While the school has not said whether student or staff data was accessed, the decision to flag the incident with the ICO suggests that the possibility is being assessed. The January 3 update added that a risk assessment had been carried out &quot;taking into account the safeguarding and wellbeing of our pupils and staff,&quot; and described the closure as necessary &quot;to preserve the integrity of the network.&quot;

The school is aiming to reopen on Wednesday, January 7, but that depends on recovery work. Students have been instructed not to access school systems in the meantime, turning the incident into an unscheduled lesson in the fragility of school IT. ®

﻿Reduce energy bills and keep critical devices running during a power outage.

Pila Energy’s home batteries are now available to preorder with deliveries expected to begin in February 2026. These power stations are meant to be seen, unlike most batteries in this class that are better suited for job sites than designer lofts. Pila’s home batteries are designed to keep critical devices like a fridge running during a blackout, while also helping to reduce daily energy costs.

It’s a similar idea to Backup by BioLite, which was announced in 2024 but still hasn’t shipped.

With Pila, you could plug one battery unit, measuring 15.0 × 26.5 × 3.3 inches (380 × 675 × 85mm) and 45lbs (20.4kg), into a standard 120V kitchen wall outlet and keep the fridge permanently plugged into the Pila home battery — no electrician required. When there’s an outage, the fridge will automatically failover to protect your food. The battery can also be configured to charge when energy rates are low and then power the fridge when rates are high to save a few bucks each month on your utility bill. Units can be stacked for more capacity, or distributed around the home to power a window air conditioner, sump pump, or office. Everything is centrally managed over either Wi-Fi or onboard cellular via the Pila App.

The Pila home battery is built around a long-lasting 1.6kWh LFP battery and an AC inverter capable of 2400 watts of continuous output (and 7800W peak for half a second). That’s enough to keep a fridge / freezer combo running for about a day, while also making a few cups of coffee, charging a phone, and reheating a meal in the microwave. Click here if you need help figuring out what size home battery you need.

Pila home batteries start at $1,299, which is expensive at $0.81 per watt-hour, compared to about $0.50 per watt-hour you’ll typically pay in this category range. Nevertheless, I do think people will pay more for something that’s not an eyesore.

It’s overflowing with video inputs, and the large screen lets you view four PCs at once.

The world’s first 52-inch 6K monitor has arrived in Dell’s UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor, which was announced at CES 2026. It’s a 21:9 aspect ratio screen that’s slightly curved (4200R) and can display up to 6,144 x 2,560 at up to 120Hz refresh rate (with VRR support). Its IPS Black panel type offers deeper blacks and better contrast than standard IPS, although I wonder if its 129 pixels per inch (PPI) is low enough to make some of its pixels noticeable up close.

This monitor is absolutely packed with ports since it doubles as a Thunderbolt dock. It has two HDMI 2.1 ports, two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, and one Thunderbolt 4 port with video-out and 140W PD charging. It has three USB-C upstream ports, two USB-C and five USB-C downstream ports, and a 2.5Gbps ethernet jack.

What are you supposed to do with all these video inputs? Well, what other than display multiple PCs at once? You’ll be able to display up to four sources simultaneously with its screen partitioning feature. This display supports KVM, letting you control each of the machines with a single set of keyboard and mouse.

Dell envisions that folks in engineering, finance, and those who deal with CAD files will gravitate toward this gigantic display, as it’s designed to replace multi-monitor setups. It’s available starting today around the world for $2,899 with the stand included, or $2,799 without the stand.

Dell announced at CES 2026 that it’ll launch the UltraSharp 32 4K QD-OLED Monitor on February 24th for $2,599.99. Despite having released a productivity-focused 4K QD-OLED of the same size in 2025 that regularly sold for well under $1,000, its new one costs more mainly due to having greater color accuracy for creative professionals.

The company is pitching this as a display suited for those who do color grading, broadcast work, and film editing. Dell claims “true-to-life” color accuracy with a Delta E <1 rating, and it has an integrated colorimeter that stores calibration preferences on-device. Its press release claims that it offers true 10-bit color reproduction. IT managers can calibrate the monitor’s colors remotely.

This monitor has a 120Hz refresh rate and Dolby Vision HDR support (not to mention a VESA DisplayHDR True Black 500 rating). In terms of ports, it only supports video via one Thunderbolt 4 port that can charge at up to 140W (the aforementioned S3225QC Dell launched this year had HDMI 2.1, but no Thunderbolt support). It has one pop-out 27W USB-C port and a 10W USB-A port for charging accessories, plus a 2.5Gbps ethernet port.

Going off the specs that Dell shared, it doesn’t seem as good of a value as the Asus ProArt Display OLED PA32UCDM, another color-calibrated 32-inch 4k QD-OLED option with true 10-bit color support that’s gone on sale for around $1,899. The Asus model goes up to 240Hz refresh rate, making it a better candidate in the off chance that you want to do a bit of gaming on the side of work. It has more ports, too, with an HDMI 2.1 port plus two Thunderbolt 4 ports (one of which maxes out at 96W, the other is for daisy-chaining to other Thunderbolt monitors).

Together with a rotating camera for smarter conference calls.

Smart whiteboard manufacturer Vibe is expanding further into hybrid work hardware with the Vibe Bot, a physical AI device that can serve as a voice assistant, a smart webcam, and an AI note-taker, designed for office desks and meeting rooms.

Despite the name, Vibe Bot is definitely not a robot. In fact it’s closer to something you’d expect to find among Amazon’s Echo line: a cylindrical speaker with a small, circular screen, beam-forming microphones, and a built-in 4K camera for video calls. Like some of Amazon’s Echo Shows, it can even rotate that screen and camera, tracking speakers in group conversations to make sure that the right person is always on screen.

It’s not just a webcam though. It can record the audio from meetings, both online and offline, with live transcription along with AI-generated notes after the fact. You can use the voice assistant to ask questions about current and previous meetings, make recommendations, and trigger actions in other integrated apps like calendars and project management tools, though Vibe hasn’t confirmed any specific supported apps just yet.

Razer is announcing a new Wolverine V3 BT controller at CES 2026 that’s designed for TVs. It’s the world’s first gamepad to use ultra-low latency Bluetooth, allowing it a sub-3ms response time, and the first accessory to launch under LG’s “Designed for LG Gaming Portal” program. But since it’s been developed in collaboration with LG, the Wolverine V3 BT can only achieve that ultra-low latency when used with compatible LG TVs running webOS 25. It works as a universal Bluetooth gamepad with any device supporting Bluetooth controllers, including other TVs, but it won’t get ultra-low latency when doing so.

As a TV-first controller, the new Wolverine V3 BT has some living room-friendly features like a built-in mic and TV controls on its D-pad. The new controller is similar to the standard Wolverine V3 Pro, but it lacks hair-trigger lockouts or extra shoulder buttons. Also, it’s got two customizable rear paddle buttons instead of the usual four. While some of that is a downgrade, this controller gets one big upgrade: TMR sticks. The Hall effect sticks on the Wolverine V3 Pro are already anti-drift, but the TMR ones of the V3 BT should be more precise and less power hungry.

Pricing and availability are not yet finalized for the Wolverine V3 BT.

To begin, a line of new Ring Elite 4K security devices will come in four configurations: a 140-degree viewing angle using two cameras at $499.99; a 200-degree viewing angle using three cameras at $599.99; a 290-degree viewing angle using five cameras (that you can mount on the corner of a building to see both sides) for $749.99; and a Ring Elite that gives you a full 360-degree view using six cameras for $999.99. The devices will be available starting this spring.

If you need movable security, the Mobile Security Trailer offers a portable device with a solar-powered battery and built-in LTE connectivity (with an appropriate Ring subscription) that includes the 4K Ring Elite with 360-degree viewing using six cams. Besides the solar battery, the Trailer can use line power as well, and the unit can be used on any mobile flat surface such as a trailer, or as a standalone. The Trailer will also be available starting this spring.

Other upcoming devices include a Ring Car Alarm, with built-in GPS and connectivity using Amazon’s Sidewalk network, that is available for preorder, and a line of smart sensors, also based on Sidewalk, which will be available in March.

The sensors will offer security enhancements, such as pet-aware motion sensors and recognizing the sound of breaking glass, along with routines for devices such as smart plugs, light switches, fan controls, and light remotes.

Ring is bringing two new intelligence features to its security cameras: AI Unusual Event Alert and Active Warnings. According to the company, the former “learns and adapts to everyday routine patterns at your property” so that it can warn you if anything out of the ordinary is happening — for example, if there is unusual movement when everyone in the household is out at work.

With Active Warnings, when the camera detects a person, it will provide context-aware audio warnings when necessary based on that person’s location and actions. Both these features are available if you have a compatible Ring subscription plan and have enabled Video Descriptions.

Four bright spots in climate news in 2025

Climate news wasn’t great in 2025. Global greenhouse-gas emissions hit record highs (again). It’s set to be either the second or third warmest on record. Climate-fueled disasters like wildfires in California and flooding in Indonesia and Pakistan devastated communities and caused billions in damage.

There’s no doubt that we’re in a severe situation. But for those looking for bright spots, there was some good news in 2025, too. Here are just a few of the positive stories our climate reporters noticed this year. Read the full story.

            <h2>Europe’s drone-filled vision for the future of war</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-06</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/06/1129737/autonomous-warfare-europe-drones-defense-automated-kill-chains/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last spring, 3,000 British soldiers of the 4th Light Brigade, also known as the Black Rats, descended upon the damp forests of Estonia’s eastern territories. They had rushed in from Yorkshire by air, sea, rail, and road. Once there, the Rats joined 14,000 other troops at the front line, dug in, and waited for the distant rumble of enemy armor.

The deployment was part of a NATO exercise called Hedgehog, intended to test the alliance’s capacity to react to a large Russian incursion. Naturally, it featured some of NATO’s heaviest weaponry: 69-ton battle tanks, Apache attack helicopters, and truck-mounted rocket launchers capable of firing supersonic missiles.

But according to British Army tacticians, it was the 4th Brigade that brought the biggest knife to the fight—and strictly speaking, it wasn’t even a physical weapon. The Rats were backed up by an invisible automated intelligence network, known as a “digital targeting web,” conceived under the name Project ASGARD.

The system had been cobbled together over the course of four months—an astonishing pace for weapons development, which is usually measured in years. Its purpose is to connect everything that looks for targets—“sensors,” in military lingo—and everything that fires on them (“shooters”) to a single, shared wireless electronic brain.

Say a reconnaissance drone spots a tank hiding in a copse. In conventional operations, the soldier operating that drone would pass the intelligence through a centralized command chain of officers, the brains of the mission, who would collectively decide whether to shoot at it.

But a targeting web operates more like an octopus, whose neurons reach every extremity, allowing each of its tentacles to operate autonomously while also working collaboratively toward a central set of goals.

During Hedgehog, the drones over Estonia traced wide orbits. They scanned the ground below with advanced object recognition systems. If one of them spied that hidden tank, it would transmit its image and location directly to nearby shooters—an artillery cannon, for example. Or another tank. Or an armed loitering munition drone sitting on a catapult, ready for launch.

The soldiers responsible for each weapon interfaced with the targeting web by means of Samsung smartphones. Once alerted to the detected target, the drone crew merely had to thumb a dropdown menu on the screen—which lists the available targeting options based on factors such as their pKill, which stands for “probability of kill”—for the drone to whip off into the sky and trace an all but irreversible course to its unsuspecting mark.

Eighty years after total war last transformed the continent, the Hedgehog tests signal a brutal new calculus of European defense. “The Russians are knocking on the door,” says Sven Weizenegger, the head of the German military’s Cyber Innovation Hub. Strategists and policymakers are counting on increasingly automated battlefield gadgetry to keep them from bursting through.

“AI-enabled intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and mass-­deployed drones have become decisive on the battlefield,” says Angelica Tikk, head of the Innovation Department at the Estonian Ministry of Defense. For a small state like Estonia, Tikk says, such technologies “allow us to punch above our weight.”

“Mass-deployed,” in this case, is very much the operative term. Ukraine scaled up its drone production for its war against Russia from 2.2 million in 2024 to 4.5 million in 2025. EU defense and space commissioner Andrius Kubilius has estimated that in the event of a wider war with Russia the EU will need three million drones annually just to hold down Lithuania, a country of some 2.9 million people that’s about the size of West Virginia.

Projects like ASGARD would take these figures and multiply them with the other key variable of warfare: speed. British officials claim that the targeting web’s kill chain, from the first detection of a target to strike decision, could take less than a minute. As a result, a press release noted, the system “will make the army 10 times more lethal over the next 10 years.” It is slated to be completed by 2027. Germany’s armed forces plan to deploy their own targeting web, Uranos KI, as early as 2026.

The working theory behind these initiatives is that the right mix of lethal drones—conceived by a new crop of tech firms, sprinted to the front lines with uncommon haste, and guided to their targets by algorithmic networks—will deliver Europe an overwhelming victory in the event of an outright war. Or better yet, it will give the continent such a wide advantage that nobody would think to attack it in the first place, an effect that Eric Slesinger, a Madrid-based venture capitalist focused on defense startups, describes as “brutal, guns-and-steel, feel-it-in-your-gut deterrence.”

But leaning too much on this new mathematics of warfare could be a risky bet. The costs of actually winning a massive drone war are likely to be more than just financial. The human toll of these technologies would extend far behind the front lines, fundamentally transforming how the European Union—from its outset, a project of peace—lives, fights, and dies. And even then, victory would be far from assured.

If anything, Europe could be laying its hand on a perpetual hair trigger that nobody can afford for it to pull.

Twenty companies participated in Project ASGARD. They range from eager startups, flush with VC backing, to defense giants like General Dynamics. Each contender could play an important role in Europe’s future. But no firm among them has more tightly captured the current European military zeitgeist than Helsing, which provided both drones and AI for the project.

Founded in 2021 by a theoretical physicist, a former McKinsey partner, and a biologist turned video-game developer, with an early investment of €100 million (then about $115 million) from Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, Helsing has quickly risen to the apex of Europe’s new defense tech ecosystem.

The Munich-based company has an established presence in Europe’s major capitals, staffed by a deep bench of former government and military officials. Buoyed by a series of high-profile government contracts and partnerships, along with additional rounds of funding, the company catapulted to a $12 billion valuation last June. It is now Europe’s most valuable defense startup by a wide margin, and the one that would be most likely to find itself at the tip of the spear if Europe’s new cold war were to suddenly turn hot.

Originally, the company made military software. But it has recently expanded its offerings to include physical weapons such as AI-assisted missile drones and uncrewed autonomous fighter jets.

In part, this reflects a shift in European demand. In March 2025, the European Commission called for a “once-in-a-generation surge in European defence investment,” citing drones and AI as two of seven priority investment areas for a new initiative that will unlock almost a trillion dollars for weapons over the coming years. Germany alone has allocated nearly $12 billion to build its drone arsenal.

“You raise money, you create technology using this money that you raised, and then you go to market with that.”

But in equal measure, the company is looking to shape Europe’s military-industrial posture. In conventional weapons programs in Europe, governments tell companies what to build through a rigid contracting process. Helsing flips that process on its head. Like a growing number of new defense firms, it is guided by what Antoine Bordes, its chief scientist, describes as “a more traditional tech-startup muscle.”

“You raise money, you create technology using this money that you raised, and then you go to market with that,” says Bordes, who was previously a leader in AI research at Meta. Government officials across Europe have proved receptive to the model, calling for agile contracting instruments that allow militaries to more easily open their pocketbooks when a company comes to them with an idea.

Helsing’s pitch deck for the future of European defense bristles with weapons that will operate across land, air, sea, and space. In the highest reaches of Helsing’s imagined battlefield, a constellation of reconnaissance satellites, which the company is collaborating on with Loft Orbital, will “detect, identify and classify military assets worldwide.”

Lower down, the company’s HF-1 and HX-2 loitering munition drones—so called because they combine the functions of a small reconnaissance drone and a missile—can stalk the skies for long periods before zeroing in on their targets. To date, the company has publicly disclosed orders for around 10,000 airframes to be delivered to Ukraine. It won’t say how many have been deployed, although it told Bloomberg in April that its drones had been used in dozens of successful missions in the conflict.

At sea, the company envisions battalions of drone mini-subs that can plunge as deep as 3,000 feet and rove for 90 days without human control, serving as a hidden guard watch for maritime incursions.

Helsing’s newest offering, the Europa, is a four-and-a-half-ton fighter jet with no human pilot on board. In a set of moody promo pictures released in 2025, the drone has the profile of an upturned boning knife. Carrying hundreds of pounds of weaponry, it is meant to charge deep into heavily defended airspace, flying under the command of a human pilot much farther away (like Tom Cruise in Top Gun: Maverick if his costars were robots and he were safely beyond the range of enemy anti-aircraft missiles). Helsing says that the Europa, which resembles designs offered by a number of other firms, is engineered to be “mass-producible.”

Linking all these elements together is Altra, the company’s so-called “­recce-strike software platform,” which served as part of the collective brain in the ASGARD trials. It’s the key piece. “These kill webs are competitive in attack and defense,” says General Richard Barrons, a former commander of the United Kingdom’s Joint Forces Command, who recently coauthored a major Ministry of Defense modernization plan that champions the deterrent effect of autonomous targeting webs. Barrons invited me to imagine Russian leaders contemplating a possible incursion into Narva in eastern Estonia. “If they’ve done a reasonable job,” he said, referring to NATO, “Russia knows not to do that … that little incursion—it will never get there. It’ll be destroyed the minute it sets foot across the border.”

With a targeting web in place, a medley of missiles, drones, and artillery could coordinate across borders and domains to hit anything that moves. On its product page for Altra, Helsing notes that the system is capable of orchestrating “saturation attacks,” a military tactic for breaching an adversary’s defenses with a barrage of synchronized weapon strikes. The goal of the technology, a Helsing VP named Simon Brünjes explained in a speech to an Israeli defense convention in 2024, is “lethality that deters effectively.”

To put it a bit less delicately, the idea is to show any potential aggressors that Europe is capable, if provoked, of absolutely losing its shit. The US Navy is working to establish a similar capacity for defending Taiwan with hordes of autonomous drones that rain down on Chinese vessels in coordinated volleys. The admirals have their own name for the result such swarms are intended to achieve: “hellscape.”

The biggest obstacle to achieving the full effect of saturation attacks is not the technology. It’s the human element. “A million drones are great, but you’re going to need a million people,” says Richard Drake, head of the European branch of Anduril, which builds a product range similar to Helsing’s and also participated in ASGARD.

Drake says the kill chain in a system like ASGARD “can all be done autonomously.” But for now, “there is a human in the loop making those final decisions.” Government rules require it. Echoing the stance of most other European states, Estonia’s Tikk told me, “We also insist that human control is maintained over decisions related to the use of lethal force.”

Helsing’s drones in Ukraine use object recognition to detect targets, which the operator reviews before approving a strike. The aircraft operate without human control only once they enter their “terminal guidance” phase, about half a mile from their target. Some locally produced drones employ similar “last mile” autonomy. This hands-free strike mode is said to have a hit rate in the range of 75%, according to research by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. (A Helsing spokesperson said that the company uses “multiple visual aids” to mitigate “potential difficulties” in target recognition during terminal guidance.)

That doesn’t quite make them killer robots. But it suggests that the barriers to full lethal autonomy are no longer necessarily technical. Helsing’s Brünjes has reportedly said its strike drones can “technically” perform missions without human control, though the company does not support full autonomy. Bordes declined to say whether the company’s fielded drones can be switched into a fully autonomous mode in the event that a government changes its policy midway through a conflict.

Either way, the company could loosen the loop in the coming years. Helsing’s AI team in Paris, led by Bordes, is working to enable a single human to oversee multiple HX-2 drones in flight simultaneously. Anduril is developing a similar “one-to-many” system in which a single operator could marshal a fleet of 10 or more drones at a time, Drake says.

In such swarms a human is technically still involved, but that person’s capacity to decide upon the actions of any single drone is diminished, especially if the drones are coordinating to saturate a wide area. (In a statement, a Helsing spokesperson told MIT Technology Review, “We do not and will not build technology where a machine makes the final decision.”)

“The international community is crossing a threshold which may be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse later.”

Like other projects in its portfolio, Helsing’s research on swarming HX-2s is not intended for a current government contract but, rather, to anticipate future ones. “We feel that this needs to be done, and done properly, because this is what we need,” Bordes told me.

To be sure, this thinking is not happening in a vacuum. The push toward autonomy in Ukraine is largely driven by advances in jamming technologies, which disrupt the links between drones and their operators. Russia has reportedly been upgrading its strike drones with sharper autonomous target recognition, as well as modems that enable them to communicate among themselves in a sort of proto-swarm. In October, it conducted a test of an autonomous torpedo said to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads powerful enough to create tsunamis.

Governments are well aware that if Europe’s only response to such challenges is to further automate its own lethality, the result could be a race with no winners. “The international community is crossing a threshold which may be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse later,” UN Special Rapporteur Morris Tidball-Binz has warned.

And yet officials are struggling to imagine an alternative. “If you don’t have the people, then you can’t control so many drones,” says Weizenegger, of the German Cyber Innovation Hub. “So therefore you need swarming technologies in place—you know, autonomous systems.”

“It sounds very harsh,” he says, referring to the idea of removing the human from the loop. “But it’s about winning or losing. There are only these two options. There is no third option.”

In its pitches, Helsing often emphasizes a sense of dire urgency. “We don’t know when we could be attacked,” one executive said at a technology summit in Berlin in September 2025. “Are we ready to fight tonight in the Baltics? The answer is no.”

The company boasts that it has a singular capacity to fix that. In September 2024 it embarked on a project to develop an AI agent capable of controlling fighter aircraft. By May of the following year the agent was operating a Swedish Gripen E jet in tests over the Baltic Sea. The company calls such timelines “Helsing speed.” The Europa combat jet drone is slated to be ready by 2029.

European governments have adopted a similar fixation with haste. “We need to fast-track,” says Weizenegger. “If we start testing in 2029, it’s probably too late.” Last February, announcing that Denmark would increase defense spending by 50 billion kroner ($7 billion), Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told a press conference, “If we can’t get the best equipment, buy the next best. There’s only one thing that counts now, and that is speed.”

That same month, Helsing announced that it will establish a network of “resilience factories” across Europe—dispersed and secret—to churn out drones at a wartime clip. The network will be put to its first real test in the coming months, when the German government finalizes a planned €300 million order for 12,000 Helsing HX-2s to equip an armored brigade stationed in Lithuania.

The company says that its first factory, somewhere in southern Germany, can produce 1,000 drones a month—or roughly six drones an hour, assuming a respectable 40-hour European work week. At that pace, it would fill Germany’s order in a year. In reality, though, it could take longer. As of last summer, the facility was operating at less than half its capacity because of staffing shortages. (A company spokesperson did not respond to questions about its current production capacity and declined to provide information on how many drones it has produced to date.)

It will take a lot of factories for Europe to fully arm up. When Helsing unveiled its resilience factory project, one of its founders, Torsten Reil, wrote on LinkedIn that “100,000 HX-2 strike drones would deter a land invasion of Europe once and for all.” Helsing now says that Germany alone should maintain a store of 200,000 HX-2s to tide it over for the first two months of a Russian invasion.

Even if Europe can surge its capacity to such levels, not everyone is convinced that massed drones are a winning pitch. While drones now account for somewhere between 70% and 80% of all combat casualties in Ukraine, “they’re not determining outcomes on the battlefield,” says Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the defense program at the Center for a New American Security. Rather, drones have brought the conflict to a grinding stalemate, leading to what a team of American, British, and French air force officers have called “a Somme in the sky.”

This dynamic has led to remarkable advances in drone communications and autonomy. But each breakthrough is quickly met with a countermeasure. In some areas where jamming has made wireless communication particularly difficult, pilots control their drones using long spools of fiber-­optic filament. In turn, their opponents have engineered rotating barbed wire traps to snare the filaments as they drag along the ground, as well as drone interceptors that can knock the unjammable drones out of the sky.

“If you produce millions of drones right now, they will become obsolete in maybe a year or half a year,” says Kateryna Bondar, a former Ukrainian government advisor. “So it doesn’t make sense to produce them, stockpile, and wait for attack.”

Nor is AI necessarily up to the task of piloting so many drones, despite industry claims to the contrary. Bohdan Sas, a founder of the Ukrainian drone company Buntar Aerospace, told me that he finds it amusing when Western companies claim to have achieved “super-fancy recognition and target acquisition on some target in testing,” only to reveal that the test site was “an open field and a target in the center.”

“It’s not really how it works in reality,” Sas says. “In reality, everything is really well hidden.” (A Helsing spokesperson said, “Our target recognition technology has proven itself on the battlefield hundreds of times.”)

Zachary Kallenborn, a research associate at the University of Oxford, told me that in Ukraine, Russian forces have been known to deactivate the autonomous functionalities of their Lancet loitering munitions. In real-world conditions, he says, AI can fail—“And so what happens if you have 100,000 drones operating that way?”

In September, while reporting this story, I visited Corbera, a town perched on a rocky outcrop among the limestone hills of Terra Alta in western Catalonia. In the late summer of 1938, Corbera was the site of some of the most intense fighting of the Spanish Civil War.

The site is just as much a reminder of past horrors as it is a warning of future ones. The town was repeatedly targeted by German and Italian aircraft, a breakthrough technology that was, at the time, roughly as novel as modern drones are to us today. Military planners who led the Spanish campaigns famously used the raids to perfect the technology’s destructive potential.

For the last four years, Ukraine has served a similar role as Europe’s living laboratory of carnage. According to Bondar, some Ukrainian units have begun charging Western companies a fee to operate their drones in battle. In return, the companies receive reams of real-world data that can’t be replicated on a test range.

“We need to keep reminding ourselves that the business of war, as an aspect of the human condition, is as brutal and undesirable and feral as it always is.”

What this data doesn’t show is the mess that the technology leaves behind. In Ukraine, drones now account for more civilian casualties than any other weapon. A United Nations human rights commission recently concluded that Russia has used drones “with the primary purpose to spread terror among the civilian population”—a crime against humanity—along a 185-mile stretch of the Dnipro River. One local resident told investigators, “We are hit every day. Drones fly at any time—morning, evening, day or night, constantly.” The commission also sought to investigate Russian allegations of Ukrainian drone attacks on civilians but was not granted sufficient access to make a determination.

A European drone war would invite similar tragedies on a much grander scale. Tens of millions of people live within drone-strike range of Europe’s eastern border with Russia. Today’s ethical calculus could change. At a media event last summer, Helsing’s Brünjes told reporters that in Ukraine, “we want a human to be making the decision” in lethal strikes. But in “a full-scale war with China or Russia,” he said, “it’s a different question.”

In the scenario of an incursion into Narva, Richard Barrons told me that Russia should also know that once its initial attack is repelled, NATO would use long-range missiles and jet drones—abetted by the same targeting webs—to immediately retaliate deep within Russian territory. Such talk may be bluster. The point of deterrence is, after all, to stave off war with the mere threat of unbearable violence. But it can leave little room for deescalation in the event of an actual fight. Could one be sure that Russia, which recently lowered its threshold for using nuclear weapons, would stand down? “The mindset that these kinds of systems are now being rolled out in is one where we’re not imagining off-ramps,” says Richard Moyes, the director of ​Article 36, a British nonprofit focused on the protection of civilians in conflict.

To this day, Corbera’s old center lies in ruins. The crumbled homes sit desolate of life but for the fig trees struggling up through the rubble and the odd skink that scurries across a splintered beam. Walking through the wasteland, I was taken by how much it resembles any other war zone. It could have been Tigray, or Khartoum. Or Gaza, a living hellscape where AI targeting tools played a central role in accelerating Israel’s cataclysmic bombing campaign. What particular innovation wrought such misery seemed almost beside the point.

“We need to keep reminding ourselves that the business of war, as an aspect of the human condition, is as brutal and undesirable and feral as it always is,” Barrons told me, a couple of weeks after I was in Corbera. “I think on planet Helsing and Anduril,” he went on, “they’re not really fighting, in many respects. And it’s a different mindset.”

A Helsing spokesperson told MIT Technology Review that the company “was founded to provide democracies with technology built in Europe essential for credible deterrence, and to ensure this technology is developed in line with tight ethical standards.” He went on to say that “ethically built autonomous systems are limiting noncombatant casualties more effectively than any previous category of weapon.”

Would such a claim, if true, bear out in a gloves-off war between major powers? “I would be extraordinarily cautious of anyone who says, ‘Yeah, 100% this is how the future of autonomous warfare looks,’” Kallenborn told me. And yet, there are some certainties we can count on. Every weapon, no matter how smart, carries within it a variation of the same story. “Lethality” means what it says. The only difference is how quickly—and how massively—that story comes to its sad, definitive end.

Sometimes AI feels like a niche topic to write about, but then the holidays happen, and I hear relatives of all ages talking about cases of chatbot-induced psychosis, blaming rising electricity prices on data centers, and asking whether kids should have unfettered access to AI. It’s everywhere, in other words. And people are alarmed.

Inevitably, these conversations take a turn: AI is having all these ripple effects now, but if the technology gets better, what happens next? That’s usually when they look at me, expecting a forecast of either doom or hope.

I probably disappoint, if only because predictions for AI are getting harder and harder to make.

Despite that, MIT Technology Review has, I must say, a pretty excellent track record of making sense of where AI is headed. We’ve just published a sharp list of predictions for what’s next in 2026 (where you can read my thoughts on the legal battles surrounding AI), and the predictions on last year’s list all came to fruition. But every holiday season, it gets harder and harder to work out the impact AI will have. That’s mostly because of three big unanswered questions.

For one, we don’t know if large language models will continue getting incrementally smarter in the near future. Since this particular technology is what underpins nearly all the excitement and anxiety in AI right now, powering everything from AI companions to customer service agents, its slowdown would be a pretty huge deal. Such a big deal, in fact, that we devoted a whole slate of stories in December to what a new post-AI-hype era might look like.

Number two, AI is pretty abysmally unpopular among the general public. Here’s just one example: Nearly a year ago, OpenAI’s Sam Altman stood next to President Trump to excitedly announce a $500 billion project to build data centers across the US in order to train larger and larger AI models. The pair either did not guess or did not care that many Americans would staunchly oppose having such data centers built in their communities. A year later, Big Tech is waging an uphill battle to win over public opinion and keep on building. Can it win?

The response from lawmakers to all this frustration is terribly confused. Trump has pleased Big Tech CEOs by moving to make AI regulation a federal rather than a state issue, and tech companies are now hoping to codify this into law. But the crowd that wants to protect kids from chatbots ranges from progressive lawmakers in California to the increasingly Trump-aligned Federal Trade Commission, each with distinct motives and approaches. Will they be able to put aside their differences and rein AI firms in?

If the gloomy holiday dinner table conversation gets this far, someone will say: Hey, isn’t AI being used for objectively good things? Making people healthier, unearthing scientific discoveries, better understanding climate change?

Well, sort of. Machine learning, an older form of AI, has long been used in all sorts of scientific research. One branch, called deep learning, forms part of AlphaFold, a Nobel Prize–winning tool for protein prediction that has transformed biology. Image recognition models are getting better at identifying cancerous cells.

But the track record for chatbots built atop newer large language models is more modest. Technologies like ChatGPT are quite good at analyzing large swathes of research to summarize what’s already been discovered. But some high-profile reports that these sorts of AI models had made a genuine discovery, like solving a previously unsolved mathematics problem, were bogus. They can assist doctors with diagnoses, but they can also encourage people to diagnose their own health problems without consulting doctors, sometimes with disastrous results.

This time next year, we’ll probably have better answers to my family’s questions, and we’ll have a bunch of entirely new questions too. In the meantime, be sure to read our full piece forecasting what will happen this year, featuring predictions from the whole AI team.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <h2>The overlooked driver of digital transformation</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-05</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/05/1124662/the-overlooked-driver-of-digital-transformation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When business leaders talk about digital transformation, their focus often jumps straight to cloud platforms, AI tools, or collaboration software. Yet, one of the most fundamental enablers of how organizations now work, and how employees experience that work, is often overlooked: audio.

As Genevieve Juillard, CEO of IDC, notes, the shift to hybrid collaboration made every space, from corporate boardrooms to kitchen tables, meeting-ready almost overnight. In the scramble, audio quality often lagged, creating what research now shows is more than a nuisance. Poor sound can alter how speakers are perceived, making them seem less credible or even less trustworthy.

&quot;Audio is the gatekeeper of meaning,” stresses Julliard. “If people can&#39;t hear clearly, they can&#39;t understand you. And if they can&#39;t understand you, they can&#39;t trust you, and they can&#39;t act on what you said. And no amount of sharp video can fix that.&quot; Without clarity, comprehension and confidence collapse.

For Shure, which has spent a century advancing sound technology, the implications extend far beyond convenience. Chris Schyvinck, Shure’s president and CEO, explains that ineffective audio undermines engagement and productivity. Meetings stall, decisions slow, and fatigue builds.

&quot;Use technology to make hybrid meetings seamless, and then be clear on which conversations truly require being in the same physical space,&quot; says Juillard. &quot;If you can strike that balance, you&#39;re not just making work more efficient, you&#39;re making it more sustainable, you&#39;re also making it more inclusive, and you&#39;re making it more resilient.&quot;

When audio is prioritized on equal footing with video and other collaboration tools, organizations can gain something rare: frictionless communication. That clarity ensures the machines listening in, from AI transcription engines to real-time translation systems, can deliver reliable results.

The research from Shure and IDC highlights two blind spots for leaders. First, buying decisions too often privilege price over quality, with costly consequences in productivity and trust. Second, organizations underestimate the stress poor sound imposes on employees, intensifying the cognitive load of already demanding workdays. Addressing both requires leaders to view audio not as a peripheral expense but as core infrastructure.

Looking ahead, audio is becoming inseparable from AI-driven collaboration. Smarter systems can already filter out background noise, enhance voices in real time, and integrate seamlessly into hybrid ecosystems.

&quot;We should be able to provide improved accessibility and a more equitable meeting experience for people,&quot; says Schyvinck.

For Schyvinck and Juillard, the future belongs to companies that treat audio transformation as an integral part of digital transformation, building workplaces that are more sustainable, equitable, and resilient.

This episode of Business Lab is produced in partnership with Shure.

Megan Tatum: From MIT Technology Review, I&#39;m Megan Tatum, and this is Business Lab, the show that helps business leaders make sense of new technologies coming out of the lab and into the marketplace.This episode is produced in partnership with Shure.As companies continue their journeys towards digital transformation, audio modernization is an often overlooked but key component of any successful journey. Clear audio is imperative not only for quality communication, but also for brand equity, both for internal and external stakeholders and even the company as a whole.Two words for you: audio transformation.My guests today are Chris Schyvinck, President and CEO at Shure. And Genevieve Juillard, CEO at IDC.Welcome Chris and Genevieve.

Chris Schyvinck: It&#39;s really nice to be here. Thank you very much.

Genevieve Juillard: Yeah, thank you so much for having us. Great to be here.

Megan Tatum: Thank you both so much for being here. Genevieve, we could start with you. Let&#39;s start with some history perhaps for context. How would you describe the evolution of audio technology and how use cases and our expectations of audio have evolved? What have been some of the major drivers throughout the years and more recently, perhaps would you consider the pandemic to be one of those drivers?

Genevieve: It&#39;s interesting. If you go all the way back to 1976, Norman Macrae of The Economist predicted that video chat would actually kill the office, that people would just work from home. Obviously, that didn&#39;t happen then, but the core technology for remote collaboration has actually been around for decades. But until the pandemic, most of us only experienced it in very specific contexts. Offices had dedicated video conferencing rooms and most ran on expensive proprietary systems. And then almost overnight, everything including literally the kitchen table had to be AV ready. The cultural norms shifted just as fast. Before the pandemic, it was perfectly fine to keep your camera off in a meeting, and now that&#39;s seen as disengaged or even rude, and that changes what normalized video conferencing and my hybrid meetings.

But in a rush to equip a suddenly remote workforce, we hit two big problems. Supply chain disruptions and a massive spike in demand. High-quality gear was hard to get so low-quality audio and video became the default. And here&#39;s a key point. We now know from research that audio quality matters more than video quality for meeting outcomes. You can run a meeting without video, but you can&#39;t run a meeting without clear audio. Audio is the gatekeeper of meaning. If people can&#39;t hear clearly, they can&#39;t understand you. And if they can&#39;t understand you, they can&#39;t trust you and they can&#39;t act on what you said. And no amount of sharp video can fix that.

Megan: Oh, true. It&#39;s fascinating, isn&#39;t it? And Chris, Shure and IDC recently released some research titled “The Hidden Influencer Rethinking Audio Could Impact Your Organization Today, Tomorrow, and Forever.” The research highlighted that importance of audio that Genevieve&#39;s talking about in today&#39;s increasingly virtual world. What did you glean from those results and did anything surprise you?

Chris: Yeah, well, the research certainly confirmed a lot of hunches we&#39;ve had through the years. When you think about a company like Shure that&#39;s been doing audio for 100 years, we just celebrated that anniversary this year.

Chris: Our legacy business is over more in the music and performance arena. And so just what Genevieve said in terms of, &quot;Yeah, you can have a performance and look at somebody, but that&#39;s like 10% of it, right? 90% is hearing that person sing, perform, and talk.&quot; We&#39;ve always, of course, from our perspective, understood that clean, clear, crisp audio is what is needed in any setting. When you translate what&#39;s happening on the stage into a meeting or collaboration space at a corporation, we&#39;ve thought that that is just equally as important.

And we always had this hunch that if people don&#39;t have the good audio, they&#39;re going to have fatigue, they&#39;re going to get a little disengaged, and the whole meeting is going to become quite unproductive. The research just really amplified that hunch for us because it really depicted the fact that people not only get kind of frustrated and disengaged, they might actually start to distrust what the other person with bad audio is saying or just cast it in a different light. And the degree to which that frustration becomes almost personal was very surprising to us. Like I said, it validated some hunches, but it really put an exclamation point on it for us.

Megan: And Genevieve, based on the research results, I understand that IDC pulled together some recommendations for organizations. What is it that leaders need to know and what is the biggest blind spot for them to overcome as well?

Genevieve: The biggest blind spot is this. If your microphone has poor audio quality, like Chris said, people will literally perceive you as less intelligent and less trustworthy. And by the way, that&#39;s not an opinion. It&#39;s what the science says. But yet, when we surveyed first time business buyers, the number one factor they used to choose audio gear was price. However, for repeat buyers, the top factor flipped to audio quality. My guess is they learn the lesson the hard way. The second blind spot is to Chris&#39;s point, it&#39;s the stress that bad audio creates. Poor sound forces your brain to work harder to decode what&#39;s being said. That&#39;s a cognitive load and it creates stress. And over a full day of meetings, that stress adds up. Now, we don&#39;t have long-term studies yet on the effects, but we do know that prolonged stress is something that every company should be working to reduce.

Good audio lightens that cognitive load. It keeps people engaged and it levels the playing field. Whether you&#39;re in a room or you&#39;re halfway across the world, and here&#39;s one that&#39;s often overlooked, bad audio can sabotage AI transcription tools. As AI becomes more and more central to everyday work, that starts to become really critical. If your audio isn&#39;t clear, the transcription won&#39;t be accurate. And there&#39;s a world of difference between working, for example, the consulting department and the insulting department, and that is an actual example from the field.

The bottom line is you fix the audio, you cut friction, you save time, and you make meetings more productive.

Megan: I mean, it&#39;s just a huge game changer, isn&#39;t it, really? I mean, and given that, Chris, in your experience across industries, are audio technologies being included in digital transformation strategies and also artificial intelligence implementation? Do we need a separate audio transformation perhaps?

Chris: Well, like I mentioned earlier, yes, people tend to initially focus on that visual platform, but increasingly the attention to audio is really coming into focus. And I&#39;d hate to tear apart audio as a separate sort of strategy because at the same time, we, as an audio expert, are trying to really seamlessly integrate audio into the rest of the ecosystem. It really does need to be put on an equal footing with the rest of the components in that ecosystem. And to Genevieve&#39;s point, as we are seeing audio and video systems with more AI functionalities, the importance of real-time translations that are being used, voice recognition, being able to attribute who said what in a meeting and take action items, it&#39;s really, I think starting to elevate the importance of that clear audio. And it&#39;s got to be part of a comprehensive, really collaboration plan that helps some company figure out what&#39;s their whole digital transformation about. It just really has to be included in that comprehensive plan, but put on equal footing with the rest of the components in that system.

Megan: Yeah, absolutely. And in the broader landscape, Genevieve, in terms of discussing the importance of audio quality, what have you noticed across research projects about the effects of good and bad audio, not only from that company perspective, but from employee and client perspectives as well?

Genevieve: Well, let&#39;s start with employees.

Genevieve: Bad audio adds friction you don&#39;t need, we&#39;ve talked about this. When you&#39;re straining to hear or make sense of what&#39;s being said, your brain is burning energy on decoding instead of contributing. That frustration, it builds up, and by the end of the day, it hurts productivity. From a company perspective, the stakes get even higher. Meetings are where decisions happen or at least where they&#39;re supposed to happen. And if people can&#39;t hear clearly, decisions get delayed, mistakes creep in, and the whole process slows down. Poor audio doesn&#39;t just waste time, it chips away at the ability to move quickly and confidently. And then there&#39;s the client experience. So whether it&#39;s in sales, customer service, or any external conversation, poor audio can make you sound less credible and yet less trustworthy. Again, that&#39;s not my opinion. That&#39;s what the research shows. So that&#39;s quite a big risk when you&#39;re trying to close a deal or solve a major problem.

The takeaway is good audio, it matters, it&#39;s a multiplier. It makes meetings more productive and it can help decisions happen faster and client interactions be stronger.

Megan: It&#39;s just so impactful, isn&#39;t it, in so many different ways. I mean, Chris, how are you seeing these research results reflected as companies work through digital and AI transformations? What is it that leaders need to understand about what is involved in audio implementation across their organization?

Chris: Well, like I said earlier, I do think that audio is finally maybe getting its place in the spotlight a little bit up there with our cousins over in the video side. Audio, it&#39;s not just a peripheral aspect anymore. It&#39;s a very integral part of that sort of comprehensive collaboration plan I was talking about earlier. And when we think about how can we contribute solutions that are really more easy to use for our end users, because if you create something complicated, we were talking about the days gone by of walking into a room. It&#39;s a very complicated system, and you need to find the right person that knows how to run it. Increasingly, you just need to have some plug and play kind of solutions. We&#39;re thinking about a more sustainable strategy for our solutions where we make really high-quality hardware. We&#39;ve done that account for a hundred years. People will come up to me and tell the story of the SM58 microphone they bought in 1980 and how they&#39;re still using it every day.

We know how to do that part of it. If somebody is willing to make that investment upfront, put some high-quality hardware into their system, then we are getting to the point now where updates can be handled via software downloads or cloud connectivity. And just really being able to provide sort of a sustainable solution for people over time.

More in our industry, we&#39;re collaborating with other industry partners to go in that direction, make something that&#39;s very simple for anybody to walk into a room or on their individual at home setup and do something pretty simple. And I think we have the right industry groups, the right industry associations that can help make sure that the ecosystems have the proper standards, the right kind of ways to make sure everything is interoperable within a system. We&#39;re all kind of heading in that direction with that end user in mind.

Megan: Fantastic. And when the internet of things was emerging, efforts began to create sort of these data ecosystems, it seems there&#39;s an argument to be made that we need audio ecosystems as well. I wonder, Chris, what might an audio ecosystem look like and what would be involved in implementation?

Chris: Well, I think it does have to be part of that bigger ecosystem I was just talking about where we do collaborate with others in industry and we try to make sure that we&#39;re all playing by the kind of same set of rules and protocols and standards and whatnot. And when you think about compatibility across all the devices that sit in a room or sit in your, again, maybe your at home setup, making sure that the audio quality is as good as it can be, that you can interoperate with everything else in the system. That&#39;s just become very paramount in our day-to-day work here. Your hardware has to be scalable like I just alluded to a moment ago. You have to figure out how you can integrate with existing technologies, different platforms.

We were joking when we came into this session that when you&#39;re going from the platform at your company, maybe you&#39;re on Teams and you go into a Zoom setting or you go into a Google setting, you really have to figure out how to adapt to all those different sort of platforms that are out there. I think the ecosystem that we&#39;re trying to build, we&#39;re trying to be on that equal footing with the rest of the components in that system. And people really do understand that if you want to have extra functionalities in meetings and you want to be able to transcribe or take notes and all of that, that audio is an absolutely critical piece.

Megan: Absolutely. And speaking of bit of all those different platforms and use cases, that sort of audio is so relevant to Genevieve that goes back to this idea of in audio one size does not fit all and needs may change. How can companies also plan their audio implementations to be flexible enough to meet current needs and to be able to grow with future advancements?

Genevieve: I&#39;m glad you asked this question. Even years after the pandemic, many companies, they&#39;re still trying to get the balance right between remote, in office, how to support it. But even if a company has a strict return to office in-person policy, the reality is that work still isn&#39;t going away for that company. They may have teams across cities or countries, clients and external stakeholders will have their own office preferences that they have to adapt to. Supporting hybrid work is actually becoming more important, not less. And our research shows that companies are leaning into, not away from, hybrid setups. About one third of companies are now redesigning or resizing office spaces every single year. For large organizations with multiple sites, staggered leases, that&#39;s a moving target. It&#39;s really important that they have audio solutions that can work before, during, after all of those changes that they&#39;re constantly making. And so that&#39;s where flexibility becomes really important. Companies need to buy not just for right now, but for the future.

And so here&#39;s IDC&#39;s kind of pro-tip, which is make sure as a company that you go with a provider that offers top-notch audio quality and also has strong partnerships and certifications with the big players and communications technology because that will save you money in the long run. Your systems will stay compatible, your investments will last longer, and you won&#39;t be scrambling when that next shift happens.

Megan: Of course. And speaking of building for the future, as companies begin to include sustainability in their company goals, Chris, I wonder how can audio play a role in those sustainability efforts and how might that play into perhaps the return on investment in building out a high-quality audio ecosystem?

Chris: Well, I totally agree with what Genevieve just said in terms of hybrid work is not going anywhere. You get all of those big headlines that talk about XYZ company telling people to get back into the office. And I saw a fantastic piece of data just last week that showed the percent of in-office hours of the American workers versus out-of-office remote kind of work. It has basically been flatlined since 2022. This is our new way of working. And of course, like Genevieve mentioned, you have people in all these different locations. And in a strange way, living through the pandemic did teach us that we can do some things by not having to hop on an airplane and travel to go somewhere. Certainly that helps with a more sustainable strategy over time, and you&#39;re saving on travel and able to get things done much more quickly.

And then from a product offering perspective, I&#39;ll go back to the vision I was painting earlier where we and others in our industry see that we can create great solid hardware platforms. We&#39;ve done it for decades, and now that advancements around AI and all of our software that enables products and everything else that has happened in the last probably decade, we can get enhancements and additions and new functionality to people in simpler ways on existing hardware. I think we&#39;re all careening down this path of having a much more sustainable ecosystem for all collaboration. It&#39;s really quite an exciting time, and that pays off with any company implementing a system, their ROI is going to be much better in the long run.

Megan: Absolutely. And Genevieve, what trends around sustainability are you seeing? What opportunities do you see for audio to play into those sustainability efforts going forward?

Genevieve: Yeah, similar to Chris. In some industries, there&#39;s still a belief that the best work happens when everyone&#39;s in the same room. And yes, face-to-face time is really important for building relationships, for brainstorming, for closing big deals, but it does come at a cost. The carbon footprint of daily commutes, the sales visits, the constant business travel. And then there&#39;s the basic consideration, as we&#39;ve talked about, of just pure practicality. The good news is with the right AV setup, especially high-quality audio, many of those interactions can happen virtually without losing effectiveness, as Chris said it, but our research shows it.

Our research shows that virtual meetings can be just as productive as in-person ones, and every commute or flight you avoid, of course makes a measurable sustainability impact. I don&#39;t think, personally, that the takeaway is replace all in-person meetings, but instead it&#39;s to be intentional. Use technology to make hybrid meetings seamless, and then be clear on which conversations truly require being in the same physical space. If you can strike that balance, you&#39;re not just making work more efficient, you&#39;re making it more sustainable, you&#39;re also making it more inclusive, and you&#39;re making it more resilient.

Megan: Such an important point. And let&#39;s close with a future forward look, if we can. Genevieve, what innovations or advancements in the audio field are you most excited to see to come to fruition, and what potential interesting use cases do you see on the horizon?

Genevieve: I&#39;m especially interested in how AI and audio are converging. We&#39;re now seeing AI that can identify and isolate human voices in noisy environments. For example, right now, there are some jets flying overhead. It&#39;s very loud in here, but I suspect you may not even know that that&#39;s happening.

Genevieve: Right. That technology, it&#39;s pulling voices forward so that conversations like ours are crystal clear. And that&#39;s a big deal, especially as companies invest more and more in AI tools, especially for that translating, transcribing and summarizing meetings. But as we&#39;ve talked before, AI is only as good as the audio it hears. If the sound is poor or a word gets misheard, the meaning can shift entirely. And sometimes that&#39;s just inconvenient, or it can even be funny. But in really high stakes settings, like healthcare for example, a single mis-transcribed word can have serious consequences. So that&#39;s why our position as high quality audio is critical and it&#39;s necessary for making AI powered communication accurate, trustworthy, and useful because when the input is clean, the output can actually live up to its promise.

Megan: Fantastic. And Chris, finally, what are you most excited to see developed? What advancements are you most looking forward to seeing?

Chris: Well, I really do believe that this is one of the most exciting times that I know I&#39;ve lived through in my career. Just the pace of how fast technology is moving, the sudden emergence of all things AI. I was actually in a roundtable session of CEOs yesterday from lots of different industries, and the facilitator was talking about change management internally in companies as you&#39;re going through all of these technology shifts and some of the fear that people have around AI and things like that. And the facilitator asked each of us to give one word that describes how we&#39;re feeling right now. And the first CEO that went used the word dread. And that absolutely floored me because you enter into these eras with some skepticism and trying to figure out how to make things work and go down the right path. But my word was truly optimism.

When I look at all the ways that we are able to deliver better audio to people more quickly, there&#39;s so many opportunities in front of us. We&#39;re working on things outside of AI like algorithms that Genevieve just mentioned that filter out the bad sounds that you don&#39;t want entering into a meeting. We&#39;ve been doing that for quite a long time now. There&#39;s also opportunities to do real time audio improvements, enhancements, make audio more personal for people. How do they want to be able to very simply, through voice commands perhaps, adjust their audio? There shouldn&#39;t have to be a whole lot of techie settings that come along with our solutions.

We should be able to provide improved accessibility and a little bit more equitable meeting experience for people. And we&#39;re looking at tech technology solutions around immersive audio. How can you maybe feel like you&#39;re a bit more engaged in the meeting, kind of creating some realistic virtual experiences, if you will. There&#39;s just so many opportunities in front of us, and I can just picture a day when you walk into a room and you tell the room, &quot;Hey, call Genevieve. We&#39;re going to have a meeting for an hour, and we might need to have Megan on call to come in at a certain time.&quot;

And all of this will just be very automatic, very seamless, and we&#39;ll be able to see each other and talk at the same time. And this isn&#39;t years away. This is happening really, really quickly. And I do think it&#39;s a really exciting time for audio and just all together collaboration in our industry.

Megan: Absolutely. Sounds like there&#39;s plenty of reason to be optimistic. Thank you both so much.That was Chris Schyvinck, President and CEO at Shure.

Welcome to Kenya’s Great Carbon Valley: a bold new gamble to fight climate change

In June last year, startup Octavia Carbon began running a high-stakes test in the small town of Gilgil in south-central Kenya. It’s harnessing some of the excess energy generated by vast clouds of steam under the Earth’s surface to power prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.The company’s long-term vision is undoubtedly ambitious—it wants to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.

But DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. On top of that, Kenya’s Maasai people have plenty of reasons to distrust energy companies. Read the full story.

AI Wrapped: The 14 AI terms you couldn’t avoid in 2025

If the past 12 months have taught us anything, it’s that the AI hype train is showing no signs of slowing. It’s hard to believe that at the beginning of the year, DeepSeek had yet to turn the entire industry on its head, Meta was better known for trying (and failing) to make the metaverse cool than for its relentless quest to dominate superintelligence, and vibe coding wasn’t a thing.

If that’s left you feeling a little confused, fear not. Our writers have taken a look back over the AI terms that dominated the year, for better or worse. Read the full list.

MIT Technology Review’s most popular stories of 2025

2025 was a busy and productive year here at MIT Technology Review. We published magazine issues on power, creativity, innovation, bodies, relationships, and security. We hosted 14 exclusive virtual conversations with our editors and outside experts in our subscriber-only series, Roundtables, and held two events on MIT’s campus. And we published hundreds of articles online, following new developments in computing, climate tech, robotics, and more.As the new year begins, we wanted to give you a chance to revisit some of this work with us. Whether we were covering the red-hot rise of artificial intelligence or the future of biotech, these are some of the stories that resonated the most with our readers.

How aging clocks can help us understand why we age—and if we can reverse itWrinkles and gray hairs aside, it can be difficult to know how well—or poorly—someone’s body is truly aging. A person who develops age-related diseases earlier in life, or has other biological changes associated with aging, might be considered “biologically older” than a similar-age person who doesn’t have those changes. Some 80-year-olds will be weak and frail, while others are fit and active.Over the past decade, scientists have been uncovering new methods of looking at the hidden ways our bodies are aging. And what they’ve found is changing our understanding of aging itself. Read the full story.—Jessica Hamzelou

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

In an industry in constant flux, sticking your neck out to predict what’s coming next may seem reckless. (AI bubble? What AI bubble?) But for the last few years we’ve done just that—and we’re doing it again.

How did we do last time? We picked five hot AI trends to look out for in 2025, including what we called generative virtual playgrounds, a.k.a world models (check: From Google DeepMind’s Genie 3 to World Labs’s Marble, tech that can generate realistic virtual environments on the fly keeps getting better and better); so-called reasoning models (check: Need we say more? Reasoning models have fast become the new paradigm for best-in-class problem solving); a boom in AI for science (check: OpenAI is now following Google DeepMind by setting up a dedicated team to focus on just that); AI companies that are cozier with national security (check: OpenAI reversed position on the use of its technology for warfare to sign a deal with the defense-tech startup Anduril to help it take down battlefield drones); and legitimate competition for Nvidia (check, kind of: China is going all in on developing advanced AI chips, but Nvidia’s dominance still looks unassailable—for now at least).

So what’s coming in 2026? Here are our big bets for the next 12 months.

The last year shaped up as a big one for Chinese open-source models. In January, DeepSeek released R1, its open-source reasoning model, and shocked the world with what a relatively small firm in China could do with limited resources. By the end of the year, “DeepSeek moment” had become a phrase frequently tossed around by AI entrepreneurs, observers, and builders—an aspirational benchmark of sorts.

It was the first time many people realized they could get a taste of top-tier AI performance without going through OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google.

Open-weight models like R1 allow anyone to download a model and run it on their own hardware. They are also more customizable, letting teams tweak models through techniques like distillation and pruning. This stands in stark contrast to the “closed” models released by major American firms, where core capabilities remain proprietary and access is often expensive.

As a result, Chinese models have become an easy choice. Reports by CNBC and Bloomberg suggest that startups in the US have increasingly recognized and embraced what they can offer.

One popular group of models is Qwen, created by Alibaba, the company behind China’s largest e-commerce platform, Taobao. Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct alone has 8.85 million downloads, making it one of the most widely used pretrained LLMs. The Qwen family spans a wide range of model sizes alongside specialized versions tuned for math, coding, vision, and instruction-following, a breadth that has helped it become an open-source powerhouse.

Other Chinese AI firms that were previously unsure about committing to open source are following DeepSeek’s playbook. Standouts include Zhipu’s GLM and Moonshot’s Kimi. The competition has also pushed American firms to open up, at least in part. In August, OpenAI released its first open-source model. In November, the Allen Institute for AI, a Seattle-based nonprofit, released its latest open-source model, Olmo 3.

Even amid growing US-China antagonism, Chinese AI firms’ near-unanimous embrace of open source has earned them goodwill in the global AI community and a long-term trust advantage. In 2026, expect more Silicon Valley apps to quietly ship on top of Chinese open models, and look for the lag between Chinese releases and the Western frontier to keep shrinking—from months to weeks, and sometimes less.

T​​he battle over regulating artificial intelligence is heading for a showdown. On December 11, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to neuter state AI laws, a move meant to handcuff states from keeping the growing industry in check. In 2026, expect more political warfare. The White House and states will spar over who gets to govern the booming technology, while AI companies wage a fierce lobbying campaign to crush regulations, armed with the narrative that a patchwork of state laws will smother innovation and hobble the US in the AI arms race against China.

Under Trump’s executive order, states may fear being sued or starved federal funding if they clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. Big Democratic states like California—which just enacted the nation’s first frontier AI law requiring companies to publish safety testing for their AI models—will take the fight to court, arguing that only Congress can override state laws. But states that can’t afford to lose federal funding, or fear getting in Trump’s crosshairs, might fold. Still, expect to see more state lawmaking on hot-button issues, especially where Trump’s order gives states a green light to legislate. With chatbots accused of triggering teen suicides and data centers sucking up more and more energy, states will face mounting public pressure to push for guardrails.

In place of state laws, Trump promises to work with Congress to establish a federal AI law. Don’t count on it. Congress failed to pass a moratorium on state legislation twice in 2025, and we aren’t holding out hope that it will deliver its own bill this year.

AI companies like OpenAI and Meta will continue to deploy powerful super-PACs to support political candidates who back their agenda and target those who stand in their way. On the other side, super-PACs supporting AI regulation will build their own war chests to counter. Watch them duke it out at next year’s midterm elections.

The further AI advances, the more people will fight to steer its course, and 2026 will be another year of regulatory tug-of-war—with no end in sight.

Imagine a world in which you have a personal shopper at your disposal 24-7—an expert who can instantly recommend a gift for even the trickiest-to-buy-for friend or relative, or trawl the web to draw up a list of the best bookcases available within your tight budget. Better yet, they can analyze a kitchen appliance’s strengths and weaknesses, compare it with its seemingly identical competition, and find you the best deal. Then once you’re happy with their suggestion, they’ll take care of the purchasing and delivery details too.But this ultra-knowledgeable shopper isn’t a clued-up human at all—it’s a chatbot. This is no distant prediction, either. Salesforce recently said it anticipates that AI will drive $263 billion in online purchases this holiday season. That’s some 21% of all orders. And experts are betting on AI-enhanced shopping becoming even bigger business within the next few years. By 2030, between $3 trillion and $5 trillion annually will be made from agentic commerce, according to research from the consulting firm McKinsey.

Unsurprisingly, AI companies are already heavily invested in making purchasing through their platforms as frictionless as possible. Google’s Gemini app can now tap into the company’s powerful Shopping Graph data set of products and sellers, and can even use its agentic technology to call stores on your behalf. Meanwhile, back in November, OpenAI announced a ChatGPT shopping feature capable of rapidly compiling buyer’s guides, and the company has struck deals with Walmart, Target, and Etsy to allow shoppers to buy products directly within chatbot interactions.

Expect plenty more of these kinds of deals to be struck within the next year as consumer time spent chatting with AI keeps on rising, and web traffic from search engines and social media continues to plummet.

I’m going to hedge here, right out of the gate. It’s no secret that large language models spit out a lot of nonsense. Unless it’s with monkeys-and-typewriters luck, LLMs won’t discover anything by themselves. But LLMs do still have the potential to extend the bounds of human knowledge.

We got a glimpse of how this could work in May, when Google DeepMind revealed AlphaEvolve, a system that used the firm’s Gemini LLM to come up with new algorithms for solving unsolved problems. The breakthrough was to combine Gemini with an evolutionary algorithm that checked its suggestions, picked the best ones, and fed them back into the LLM to make them even better.

Google DeepMind used AlphaEvolve to come up with more efficient ways to manage power consumption by data centers and Google’s TPU chips. Those discoveries are significant but not game-changing. Yet. Researchers at Google DeepMind are now pushing their approach to see how far it will go.

And others have been quick to follow their lead. A week after AlphaEvolve came out, Asankhaya Sharma, an AI engineer in Singapore, shared OpenEvolve, an open-source version of Google DeepMind’s tool. In September, the Japanese firm Sakana AI released a version of the software called SinkaEvolve. And in November, a team of US and Chinese researchers revealed AlphaResearch, which they claim improves on one of AlphaEvolve’s already better-than-human math solutions.

There are alternative approaches too. For example, researchers at the University of Colorado Denver are trying to make LLMs more inventive by tweaking the way so-called reasoning models work. They have drawn on what cognitive scientists know about creative thinking in humans to push reasoning models toward solutions that are more outside the box than their typical safe-bet suggestions.

Hundreds of companies are spending billions of dollars looking for ways to get AI to crack unsolved math problems, speed up computers, and come up with new drugs and materials. Now that AlphaEvolve has shown what’s possible with LLMs, expect activity on this front to ramp up fast.

For a while, lawsuits against AI companies were pretty predictable: Rights holders like authors or musicians would sue companies that trained AI models on their work, and the courts generally found in favor of the tech giants. AI’s upcoming legal battles will be far messier.

The fights center on thorny, unresolved questions: Can AI companies be held liable for what their chatbots encourage people to do, as when they help teens plan suicides? If a chatbot spreads patently false information about you, can its creator be sued for defamation? If companies lose these cases, will insurers shun AI companies as clients?

In 2026, we’ll start to see the answers to these questions, in part because some notable cases will go to trial (the family of a teen who died by suicide will bring OpenAI to court in November).

At the same time, the legal landscape will be further complicated by President Trump’s executive order from December—see Michelle’s item above for more details on the brewing regulatory storm.

No matter what, we’ll see a dizzying array of lawsuits in all directions (not to mention some judges even turning to AI amid the deluge).

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

A conversation with a chatbot can shift people&#39;s political views—but the most persuasive models also spread the most misinformation.

            <div id="article-text">For years, the tech industry equated success with scale. Bigger stages, larger crowds, more logos, more panels, more noise. Five thousand people became ten thousand. Ten thousand became the goal.

Somewhere along the way, that stopped making sense.

Founders and executives didn’t announce a boycott. They simply stopped showing up.

What we see today is not a rejection of events, but a correction in how people who actually run companies choose to spend their time. The shift is subtle, but consistent. Fewer large conferences. More small, curated gatherings. More closed rooms. More dinners. More tables of twelve.

Big tech events struggle because they optimize for visibility, not usefulness. A founder does not need three days of generic content, dozens of panels with no real interaction, or networking sessions where relevance is left to chance.

At scale, everything becomes superficial by default. Conversations shorten. Access disappears. The signal is drowned by the format itself.

What founders look for instead is simple. Context. Trust. Direct access. Conversations without performance. The kind of environment where people can speak honestly, not publicly.

Even when larger conferences still make sense, there is a clear psychological ceiling. Around one thousand participants, in exceptional cases. Beyond that point, quality becomes impossible to control. The event stops being a place where decisions are made and turns into a product designed for mass consumption.

And tech, especially at the founder and executive level, no longer behaves like a mass industry. It behaves like a precision one.

This is why smaller, niche conferences outperform larger ones on every meaningful metric. Ten relevant people in a room will always create more value than a thousand irrelevant ones in a hall.

At a small table, access is natural. No one needs to chase anyone. Trust forms faster. Real conversations happen because there is no audience to impress.

The most important discussions in tech have never happened on stage. They happen before the lights turn on and after the microphones are off.

In parallel with this shift, we have been preparing a private community limited to one thousand founders and executives. It is strictly invite only. Not a platform. Not a public group. Not designed for scale. Designed for relevance. Quality is protected precisely by limitation.

One thing we can say publicly is that TNW will return with an event in 2026. Details, format, and the official launch will be announced soon, but not here. What matters is that this return will not mirror the old model. It will reflect how the industry actually operates today.

Big events are not disappearing. They are simply no longer where important decisions are made.

Across the industry, the shift is already happening. Smaller rooms. Sharper conversations. People who actually need to be there.

            <div id="article-text">Five stars used to mean something. People still read reviews before buying software. They just don’t trust them the way they used to. And no, this isn’t about fake reviews or obvious scams. Those are easy to spot. The real problem is more uncomfortable. The review economy didn’t collapse. It slowly drifted away from its original purpose.

User reviews began as authentic buyer guidance, but they’ve morphed into strategic assets for businesses. Scroll through any app store or e-commerce site: everything is “top-rated” and lavished with praise. If every product gleams with a 4.8/5 rating, those stars start to lose their meaning.

Consumers aren’t fooled, in fact, the share of people who trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations plummeted from nearly 80% in 2020 to just 42% in 2025

We read the glowing comments, but we’ve learned to read between the lines.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It’s not hard to see why trust has eroded. Companies have figured out that great reviews drive sales, so they’ve turned the whole system into a numbers game. High ratings aren’t just social proof now, they’re a growth tactic.  In other words, more stars = more money. So of course businesses are chasing stars like their life depends on it. And in a way, it does.

Behind the scenes, many companies actively engineer their review scores. One common tactic is to time the ask just right. For instance, some businesses send out a Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey to gauge your sentiment “How likely are you to recommend us?”

If you rate them a 9 or 10 (a promoter), you’re immediately nudged to post a public review. If you give a lukewarm or low score, the feedback form quietly thanks you and never mentions writing a review at all.

Only the happiest customers get the gentle push to “Share your experience!” This practice is so widespread it even has a name: “review gating.”

It’s essentially filtering which customers get invited to leave a review based on their initial feedback. Platforms officially frown on it (Google outright forbids “selectively soliciting positive reviews”), but behind closed doors it remains a growth hacker’s favorite trick.

Then there’s the outright incentivization. Perhaps you’ve received an email offering a discount, gift card, or free month of service in exchange for writing a review. It’s framed as a thank-you for your time, of course – “Share your honest feedback and get 10% off your next purchase!” – but the intent is clear.

In an economy of fake praise, even regulators have had to step in to remind everyone that trust isn’t a commodity to be bought. Companies know how to play the game from the other side too: suppressing negativity.

Unhappy customer feedback is quietly diverted to support teams or private channels, where it can be resolved (or simply contained) out of public view. The result is a skewed reality, a glossy wall of five-star testimonials that obscure any hint of dissatisfaction. It’s a great sales tool. It’s terrible for the truth.

Why go to such lengths to manicure the ratings? Because the platforms themselves reward it. The algorithms that sort and highlight products aren’t trying to surface the most truthful review; they’re trying to maximize engagement and conversion.

High ratings and large volumes of reviews make people more likely to click “Buy Now.” That means more conversion for sellers and more commission for the marketplace. In other words, the algorithm is biased toward whatever boosts the platform’s monetization metrics.

A bunch of five-star reviews isn’t just ego bait,  it’s algorithm bait.

Think about it: products with a 4.7-star average and hundreds of reviews tend to appear at the top of search results and recommendation lists. They convert better, so the system pushes them more.

More visibility leads to more sales, which reinforces the high ranking. It’s a feedback loop powered by positive feedback (pun intended). If a vendor can game their way into that virtuous cycle, via perfectly timed prompts or purchased praise, the platform’s code will happily amplify them.

Authenticity doesn’t earn you a top slot; performance does. The incentive is clear: keep it positive, and keep it plentiful. In the review economy, volume and sentiment are king.

Worse, some marketplaces have blurred the line between genuine high-rated listings and paid placement. It’s an open secret that many platforms offer sponsored spots or pay-to-play schemes, think “featured” placements, ads masquerading as top picks, or vendor subscriptions that subtly boost visibility.

Money talks, even if it speaks over the voice of authentic customer feedback. (To be fair, a few holdouts still refuse to monetize their review rankings or sell out their star system, but they’re the exception, not the rule).

Consumers aren’t sitting idly by in this charade. We’ve become savvy at sniffing out over-polished BS. The modern buyer knows how the game is played, and many are adapting their behavior to cope with the broken review system.

First, there’s a migration of trust to private networks and off-platform channels. Instead of relying on the star-average on a marketplace, people turn to friends, colleagues, and niche communities for real advice.

Think about the last time you were unsure about a purchase, maybe you shot a quick message to a group chat, or asked in a private Slack channel, “Hey, has anyone used this product? Is it actually any good?” Personal recommendations feel reliable again, precisely because they’re not part of the public review circus.

Second, savvy consumers cross-check everything. Rather than trusting one site’s reviews, they compare across multiple sources, the product might be 4.8 on the official store, but what’s it rated elsewhere?

Is there a discrepancy between the slick website testimonials and the chatter on Reddit? More often than not, shoppers now triangulate information. In fact, three out of four people use two or more sites when reading reviews, rather than putting all their faith in one platform’s word. We instinctively seek a consensus of truth across the noise.

Finally, many have decided the best judge is themselves. “Try before you buy” has made a comeback as a defense against dubious reviews. Free trials, freemium tiers, generous return policies, consumers leverage them all to test products firsthand.

If a software platform promises the world in its curated testimonials, a savvy buyer will take the 14-day free trial and see if it lives up to the hype. In sectors like enterprise software, where choices are costly and critical, buyers might run a pilot program or proof-of-concept rather than trust glossy case studies. Essentially, experience has become the new review.

All this has serious implications for platforms and software marketplaces. These businesses built their empires on user-generated trust, turning customer opinion into a key part of the shopping experience.

If that trust evaporates, the model cracks. We’re already seeing the early signs: users skipping the review tab, or treating every five-star rating with a healthy dose of skepticism.

If the review economy continues on its current path, platforms risk becoming mere transaction processors rather than trust brokers.

For the marketplaces, this is both a crisis and an opportunity. The crisis is obvious: loss of credibility. If people no longer believe what they read on your platform, they’ll seek validation elsewhere, and your influence over purchase decisions diminishes.

But the opportunity lies in reform. Platforms could double down on authenticity as a feature, verifying purchases, cracking down harder on fraudulent and incentivized reviews, and highlighting more qualitative, nuanced feedback instead of simple star counts.

There’s even a chance to innovate with new trust signals (some are experimenting with things like verified buyer badges, AI analysis for suspicious patterns, or weighted ratings that account for reviewer reputation). The platforms that find ways to genuinely restore faith in their review systems will win back weary consumers. Those that don’t will see their communities drift away, bit by bit.

Importantly, not all platforms have given in to the dark side. A handful still refuse pay-for-play tactics, no paid reviews, no under-the-table boosting of rankings for advertisers.

These holdouts demonstrate that integrity in reviews is possible, even if it means slower growth in the short term.

In the end, the broken review economy is forcing a rebalance of how we decide what to trust. Buyers are adapting, finding new ways to cut through the noise. And the platforms that once thrived on being the ultimate source of truth in purchasing may have to rethink their approach if they want to stay relevant.

Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The five-star system doesn’t shine as bright as it used to; perhaps it’s time for the next evolution in how we share and earn trust online.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">2025 was the year technology stopped being tomorrow’s promise and became today’s anchor. What began as a surge in generative AI and platform innovation two years prior crystallized this year into concrete shifts in how people work, governing bodies legislate, and markets invest. Across continents and industries, the arc of technology bent toward practical impact, regulatory reality, and economic weight!

At the heart of the year’s story was artificial intelligence’s jump from novelty to infrastructure. LLMs and multimodal models moved beyond demos into everyday workflows, influencing how documents are written, campaigns are conceived, products designed, and code generated.

Enterprises that once hesitated began deploying AI tools at scale, with early adopters reporting measurable productivity gains by integrating copilots into core processes, a trend visible in surveys showing widespread adoption among software professionals.

This editorial isn’t a chronicle of every press release.

It’s a reflection on how 2025, at the crossroads of technology, governance, and economic strategy, brought about a series of inflection points that will shape the next era of creation, competition, and control.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 in August pushed the boundaries of what AI could do, delivering notable gains in coding, math, and multimodal understanding. But unlike the jaw-dropping debut of ChatGPT a couple years prior, this new generation of foundation models arrived to a more measured reception.

Tech leaders and investors had begun asking harder questions: beyond impressive demos, could these models drive real products and revenue?

Google’s answer was Gemini 3, launched in November as its “most intelligent model” and immediately woven into Google’s flagship product, Search. For the first time, an AI model upgrade wasn’t just about boastful leaderboard scores, it was about transforming user experience.

Typing a query into Google now often meant receiving an AI-generated synthesis instead of the familiar list of links, a sea change in how information is delivered. Google even unveiled a Gemini “agent” that could execute multi-step tasks like booking travel or organizing email, hinting at a future where AI acts more like a digital butler than a chatbox.

Anthropic’s Claude 4 model, for instance, gained a strong following among developers by expanding how much it could handle at once, processing entire codebases with tens of thousands of lines, rather than by producing viral one-liners.

AI grew up in 2025: it was still improving at breakneck speed, but it also had to earn its keep in real products and justify the billion-dollar bets fueling its rise.

Driving this AI explosion was a parallel leap in hardware. The hunger for AI computers in 2025 was insatiable, and chipmakers raced to deliver.

NVIDIA, whose GPUs had become the era’s essential infrastructure, rolled out its new Blackwell architecture with chips like the B200 that boasted up to 3× the training speed of its predecessor. Cloud data centers around the world scrambled to deploy these to keep up with demand from model training and inference.

Rival chipmakers weren’t idle either: AMD and a cadre of startups pushed innovative AI accelerators, while even Intel signaled ambitions to catch up, reportedly exploring an acquisition of AI chip designer SambaNova.

Perhaps most tellingly, tech giants themselves started designing silicon tailored for AI workloads, recognizing that owning the chip means owning the future of computing.

Beyond AI chips, consumer hardware saw its own milestones. After years of anticipation, augmented reality glasses and mixed-reality headsets finally had their moment, sort of.

Apple’s Vision Pro headset, unveiled in late 2023, reached select markets in 2024; by 2025 developers were crafting the first wave of immersive apps. However, mass adoption lagged due to the device’s sky-high price and bulky format.

Competitors like Meta’s Quest line offered cheaper VR headsets and modest improvements, but the “metaverse” hype of yesteryear largely fizzled out, users and investors had shifted their excitement to generative AI and tangible productivity tools.

Smartphones and laptops in 2025 continued incremental improvements (faster Apple M3/M4 chips, foldable screens becoming more common), yet it was clear the next paradigm shift in personal tech was still on the horizon.

Even so, one hardware frontier made concrete progress: quantum computing. Industry leaders like IBM and Google demonstrated prototype systems with ever-larger qubit counts and made strides in error correction, inching closer to viable quantum machines.

These advances, while esoteric to the public, underscored a broader theme, from AI accelerators to quantum chips, the machinery under the hood of tech was evolving rapidly to enable the software of tomorrow.

If 2025 proved anything, it’s that technology no longer operates above the law. This was the year regulators moved from intent to enforcement, with Europe leading the charge.

After years of debate, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act came into force, becoming the world’s first complex AI law. From February, certain “unacceptable risk” uses, such as social scoring and real-time biometric surveillance, were banned outright.

By August, transparency rules followed, forcing companies to label AI-generated content and comply with new obligations for general-purpose models. The signal was unmistakable: in Europe, the era of unchecked AI was over.

Companies now face audits, penalties, and real consequences if their systems cross legal or ethical lines, a regulatory moment European officials openly compared to GDPR’s impact on data privacy.

The pressure didn’t stop with AI. In 2025, regulators also went after the gatekeepers. The EU’s Digital Markets Act forced long-resistant changes from Big Tech, most notably when Apple opened the iPhone to third-party app stores and sideloading in Europe, dismantling a 15-year walled garden.

At the same time, enforcement of the Digital Services Act intensified. Platforms were scrutinized for how they handle disinformation, with companies like X warned or penalized during periods of geopolitical tension. In response, social networks expanded moderation teams, adjusted algorithms, and exposed more of their inner workings to researchers.

The US issued an AI executive order and signaled tougher enforcement through agencies like the FTC, while states stepped in, including New York’s law requiring mental-health warnings on addictive social features.

In China, new draft rules targeted AI systems designed for human-like interaction, tightening licensing and ideological oversight. By the end of the year, the freewheeling phase of tech disruption had given way to something more restrained. The question was no longer whether regulation would catch up, but how deeply it would reshape innovation itself.

The platform shake-up that began in 2023 gathered real momentum in 2025, as both companies and users adjusted to a post-pandemic, AI-saturated reality.

Nowhere was this clearer than in social media. Elon Musk’s X, which entered the decade with noise and bravado, found itself on the defensive. Meta’s Threads, initially dismissed after an early spike, steadily closed the gap, nearing parity with X in daily mobile users by mid-year.

X’s audience shrank as policy whiplash and leadership churn eroded confidence, and while its remaining users were still deeply engaged, the era of unquestioned Twitter dominance was over. Disenchanted users scattered across a fragmented landscape, from Meta’s polished Threads to decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, breaking the old Facebook–Instagram–Twitter equilibrium.

The recalibration extended well beyond social feeds.

Major platforms retooled around changing habits: Google reshaped Search around generative answers to fend off AI assistants and algorithmic discovery, while Microsoft pushed its Copilot deeper into Windows, Office, and Bing, betting on “AI inside” as a platform reset.

Everyday behavior shifted too. Smarter voice and chat assistants returned to daily use, handling emails, refunds, and scheduling with little friction. At the same time, screen fatigue set in. Digital-detox travel gained traction, and younger users gravitated toward apps that promised less algorithmic pressure and more human curation. Even streaming came full circle.

After years of fragmentation, providers began rebundling services, offering combined video, music, and gaming packages that looked suspiciously like cable TV reborn, a reminder that while technology moves forward, user preferences often move in cycles.

Amid the gains and momentum, 2025 also became a year of reckoning. As AI systems spread, society began grappling with their cultural and ethical cost. Creators who once marveled at generative tools started pushing back, arguing that their work had been absorbed without consent or compensation.

A wave of lawsuits moved through US courts, with authors accusing companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google of scraping books and articles to train models. By year’s end, the message was unmistakable: if AI is built on human creativity, many believe its rewards can no longer flow in one direction alone.

Public trust in technology was also tested by a rise in malicious uses and misuses. In the financial domain, sophisticated deepfake scams caused real damage. The frequency of such incidents spiked sharply; cybersecurity firms reported a 3000% increase in deepfake-related fraud over two years, and authorities scrambled to educate businesses on new verification practices.

Misinformation continued to be a menace: during elections and conflicts, AI-generated fake images and videos spread on social media, forcing newsrooms to set up rapid-response fact-checking teams.

Encouragingly, 2025 also saw growth in countermeasures, from better deepfake detection algorithms to nascent standards for cryptographic content authentication (the Coalition for Content Provenance, including major publishers and tech platforms, expanded efforts to watermark authentic media).

Still, the information ecosystem remained fraught, as even savvy citizens found it ever harder to tell the truth from fabrication online.

And then there’s the human element: how all this tech is affecting everyday lives and livelihoods. Workplace AI adoption soared this year; tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and a host of AI assistants became common on office desktops. Studies showed productivity boosts but also raised concerns about workers becoming overly reliant on AI suggestions.

Meanwhile, fears of automation resurfaced in certain sectors, for example, as chatbots took over more customer service and code-generation tools improved, professionals in call centers and junior programming positions wondered about long-term job security.

These anxieties fueled calls for new approaches to education and training, so that the workforce of 2030 will be prepared for more creative, complex tasks that AI can’t easily handle.

Lovable (Stockholm, Sweden) came as one of the most remarkable AI software stories of the year, for me. What began as an open-source project evolved into a commercial platform that lets users build fully functional websites and apps using plain-language prompts, no traditional coding required.

This approach, known in the industry as “vibe coding,” turns ideas into production-ready software simply by describing what you want in natural language.

Lovable’s growth in 2025 was extraordinary by any measure. Eight months after its launch, the company hit over $100 million in annual recurring revenue and raised a $200 million Series A at a roughly $1.8 billion valuation, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing software startups ever.

By year’s end, Lovable had secured $330 million in Series B funding at about a $6.6 billion valuation, and was rapidly scaling globally.

What makes Lovable meaningful beyond the numbers is what it represents: a shift in how software is built. It demonstrated that AI can democratize development, giving power to non-technical founders, creators, and teams to go from concept to product without traditional engineering barriers.

In an industry long centered on specialized skills and team structures, Lovable’s rise suggested a future where natural language becomes the primary interface to software creation.

On a more hopeful note, 2025 showed signs of a maturing tech culture. Ethical design moved from talking point to practice. Major platforms began experimenting with limits, turning off infinite scroll for teens, adding prompts that nudged users to pause, and treating “time well spent” as a real metric rather than a slogan.

In AI, transparency gained ground. Under pressure from regulators and researchers, companies like OpenAI and Google disclosed more about how their models are trained and where they fall short.

Researchers formed new alliances to share safety techniques, and a second global AI Safety Summit brought dozens of countries together around questions of alignment and control.

None of it amounted to binding rules, but it marked a shift in tone: even the architects of powerful systems openly acknowledged the need for restraint.

Taken together, these moments made 2025 a turning point. For years, technology had surged ahead of the institutions meant to guide it. This year, that gap began to close.

The breakthroughs were real and transformative, but so were the responses to them: laws passed, norms reset, alliances formed. If 2024 was the year the world grasped the power of generative AI, 2025 was the year it began deciding how that power should be used.

The story of technology is no longer just about what can be built, but about how it fits into the lives it shapes, and who gets to decide that fit.

            <div id="article-text">My name is Alexandru Stan, and this article continues the dialogue I began following the acquisition of TNW.

Following the recent transaction, TNW Spaces remains with the Financial Times, while we continue the mission of the website, the events, and the global community.

We already have a dedicated team at tekpon operating the platform, events, and community initiatives. Our objective is to expand and strengthen the team as TNW accelerates its next chapter.

TNW is already a global media platform with millions of readers. We’re not starting over. We are building forward.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Technology is entering a decisive stage: AI is reshaping workflows, distribution is shifting, capital is becoming more selective, and founders are expected to demonstrate value rather than potential.

The world doesn’t need more noise.
It needs clarity, execution, and access to trustworthy knowledge and people.

TNW will serve that need through editorial independence, real expertise, and community-built intelligence.

Success for TNW looks like this: more accurate understanding, faster access to verified knowledge, and direct pathways from insight to action.

I’ve been an entrepreneur since 2007, building in B2B SaaS, marketplaces, and scalable systems. I believe deeply in servant leadership. Without people, I am zero.

I lead two private networks grounded in practice rather than theory:

These groups ensure TNW remains rooted in lived experience, informed by operators, not commentators.

Our mission is to build the most trusted European tech media platform with global reach, focused on practical innovation, responsible scaling, and transparency.

We will continue to host events across Europe’s major capitals including Paris, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Monaco.

These will not be festivals. We are introducing a concept validated through tekpon events: curated gatherings built for meaningful relationships, deep content, and tangible business outcomes.

In 2026, we return to Amsterdam for a special edition centered on AI among other fields. We will explore technologies and strategies shaping the future of work and business:

The editorial focus remains European, while the audience is global.

AI is not a threat to publishing. It is the infrastructure of the next generation of content and knowledge.

At TNW, we will use AI to accelerate research, enable personalized intelligence, reduce noise and bias, and amplify high-quality human expertise. Technology assists. Human judgment remains central.

Because this moment in Europe matters.
Because founders here are ready to scale responsibly.
Because independent media with integrity is rare.
Because innovation deserves a platform built around people, not hype.

TNW will continue its legacy with a renewed emphasis on contribution, execution, and community built through trust.

If you are building, scaling, or researching the next wave of technology, I invite you to engage with us, contribute insights, and participate in shaping the conversation.

The next era begins now. Let’s shape it together.

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.
