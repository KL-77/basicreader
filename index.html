            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As of today, the US is no longer a member of the World Health Organization—and it leaves the United Nations health agency with hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid bills, according to reporting by Stat News.

A year ago today, the US informed the WHO of its intent to exit, setting the clock for a one-year withdrawal period mandated in a 1948 joint resolution of Congress. But, in practice, the withdrawal was immediate, with the Trump administration cutting all ties with WHO upon the announcement. In explaining his reasoning for leaving the WHO, Trump referenced his long-standing complaints about the agency’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, dues payments, and alleged protection of China. Trump had attempted extract the US from WHO during his first term, but the Biden administration rescinded the withdrawal on the first day in office, well before the one-year notice period was reached.

The joint resolution also stipulated that the US would have to pay its financial obligations in full before departing. But, that too has not been honored by the Trump administration. According to Stat, the US owed the WHO $278 million in dues, which are a percentage of each member state’s gross domestic product. That dues payment covered the country’s 2024–2025 membership, as WHO runs on a two-year budget cycle.

In the past, such payments were made through the State Department’s international agencies bureau. A spokesperson for the department told Stat that there was no way the US would pay its debt.

“The United States will not be making any payments to the WHO before our withdrawal on January 22, 2026,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “The cost [borne] by the US taxpayer and US economy after the WHO’s failure during the COVID pandemic—and since—has been too high as it is. We will ensure that no more US funds are routed to this organization.”

In addition, the US had also promised to provide $490 million in voluntary contributions for those two years. The funding would have gone toward efforts such as the WHO’s health emergency program, tuberculosis control, and the polio eradication effort, Stat reports. Two anonymous sources told Stat that some of that money was paid, but they couldn’t provide an estimate of how much.

The loss of both past and future financial support from the US has been a hefty blow to the WHO. Immediately upon notification last January, the WHO began cutting costs. Those included freezing recruitment, restricting travel expenditures, making all meetings virtual, limiting IT equipment updates, and suspending office refurbishment. The agency also began cutting staff and leaving positions unfilled. According to Stat, the WHO staff is on track to be down 22 percent by the middle of this year.

In a recent press conference, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the US withdrawal is a “lose-lose situation” for the US and the rest of the world. The US will lose access to infectious disease intelligence and sway over outbreak responses, and global health security will be weakened overall. “I hope they will reconsider,” Tedros said.</div>

            <h2>Overrun with AI slop, cURL scraps bug bounties to ensure "intact mental health"</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/overrun-with-ai-slop-curl-scraps-bug-bounties-to-ensure-intact-mental-health/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The project developer for one of the Internet’s most popular networking tools is scrapping its vulnerability reward program after being overrun by a spike in the submission of low-quality reports, much of it AI-generated slop.

“We are just a small single open source project with a small number of active maintainers,” Daniel Stenberg, the founder and lead developer of the open source app cURL, said Thursday. “It is not in our power to change how all these people and their slop machines work. We need to make moves to ensure our survival and intact mental health.”

His comments came as cURL users complained that the move was treating the symptoms caused by AI slop without addressing the cause. The users said they were concerned the move would eliminate a key means for ensuring and maintaining the security of the tool. Stenberg largely agreed, but indicated his team had little choice.

In a separate post on Thursday, Stenberg wrote: “We will ban you and ridicule you in public if you waste our time on crap reports.” An update to cURL’s official GitHub account made the termination, which takes effect at the end of this month, official.

cURL was first released three decades ago, under the name httpget and later urlget. It has since become an indispensable tool among admins, researchers, and security professionals, among others, for a wide range of tasks, including file transfers, troubleshooting buggy web software, and automating tasks. cURL is integrated into default versions of Windows, macOS, and most distributions of Linux.

As such a widely used tool for interacting with vast amounts of data online, security is paramount. Like many other software makers, cURL project members have relied on private bug reports submitted by outside researchers. To provide an incentive and to reward high-quality submissions, the project members have paid cash bounties in return for reports of high-severity vulnerabilities.

Last May, Stenberg said the number of low-quality AI-generated reports was putting a strain on the cURL security team and was likely to metastasize, hampering other software developers.

“AI slop is overwhelming maintainers *today* and it won’t stop at curl but only starts there,” he said at the time.

The lead developer has also posted a page listing some of the specious reports submitted in recent months. In response to one such report, a cURL project member wrote: “I think you’re a victim of LLM hallucination.” The member continued:

The text has some similarities to the (bogus) CVE-2020-19909 and other reports. There are plenty of clues that Bard has manufactured bogus information: that code snippet of “curl_easy_setopt” doesn’t match the actual signature of the function (and wouldn’t even compile), a changelog that don’t match reality, and more indications that this is completely bogus. I’m curious to hear what your exploit does against a made-up vulnerability. Care to share it?

After the bug reporter complained and reiterated the risk posed by the non-existent vulnerability, Stenberg jumped in and wrote: “You were fooled by an AI into believing that. In what way did we not meet our end of the deal?

Stenberg isn’t critical of AI-assisted bug reports in all cases. In September, he publicly applauded a researcher for sending a “massive list” of bugs that were found using a set of AI-assisted tools. The reports had resulted in 22 bug fixes at the time.

In an interview, Stenberg said that the reporter, Joshua Rogers, mostly used AI-powered code analyzer called ZeroPath.

“A clever person using a powerful tool,” Stenberg wrote. “I believe most of the worst reports we get are from people just asking an AI bot without caring or understanding much about what it reports.”

Unfortunately, such cases seem to be the exception. AI slop has already flooded music-streaming services with so many songs—often misattributed to real artists—that the platforms are slowly becoming unusable for music discovery. cURL’s move may be an early indication that something similar is happening to bug bounty programs.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Thursday, Ilya Lichtenstein, who was at the center of a massive 2016 crypto heist worth billions at the time, wrote online that he is now out of prison and has changed his ways.

“Ten years ago, I decided that I would hack the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world,” Lichtenstein wrote on LinkedIn, detailing a time when his startup was barely making money and he decided to steal some instead.

“This was a terrible idea. It was the worst thing I had ever done,” he added. “It upended my life, the lives of people close to me, and affected thousands of users of the exchange. I know I disappointed a lot of people who believed in me and grossly misused my talents.”

In 2023, Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, pleaded guilty to money laundering conspiracy in a wild 2016 scheme to steal 120,000 bitcoins (worth over $10 billion today) from Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange. The pair were arrested at their Manhattan home in 2022.

Lichtenstein quickly flipped, helping the government recover the assets he had stolen and then helping the feds “on a variety of crypto cases.” He says that he enjoyed working with the government.

“When I was a black hat hacker, I was isolated and paranoid,” he wrote. “Working with the good guys, being part of a team solving a bigger problem felt surprisingly good. I realized that I could use my technical skills to make a difference.

Lichtenstein, who did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment, noted that he was sentenced to 60 months in prison and spent “nearly [four] years in some of the harshest jails in the country.” While in prison, Lichtenstein says that he spent as much time as he could in the prison library studying math books to engage his mind and distract himself from his surroundings.

The 38-year-old added that he was “released to home confinement earlier this month.”

Convicted hackers cooperating with federal authorities or turning their lives around is not without precedent.

One notable example is the late Kevin Mitnick, who was convicted of multiple phone and computer crime cases in the 1980s and 1990s. Mitnick eventually started his own security consulting company and became a penetration tester and public speaker for many years before his death in 2023.

“Now begins the real challenge of regaining the community’s trust,” Lichtenstein concluded, noting that he wants to work in cybersecurity.

“I think like an adversary,” he said. “I’ve been an adversary. Now I can use those same skills to stop the next billion-dollar hack.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple is working on a wearable device that will allow the user to take advantage of AI models, according to sources familiar with the product who spoke with tech publication The Information.

The product is said to be “the same size as an AirTag, only slightly thicker,” and will be worn as a pin, inviting comparisons to the failed Humane AI pin that launched to bad reviews and lackluster sales in 2024. The Humane product was criticized for sluggish performance and low battery life, but those shortcomings could potentially be addressed by Apple’s solution, should Apple offload the processing to a synced external device like an iPhone.

The Information’s sources don’t specify whether that’s the plan, or if it will be a standalone device.

The wearable will have a single physical button “along its edges” and will feature a speaker. It will have three microphones and two cameras (one regular and one wide-angle) for capturing information about the user’s surroundings. It will use a magnetic inductive wireless charging surface similar to the one used to charge the Apple Watch.

The report didn’t include any information about pricing, but it did say that Apple has fast-tracked the product with the hope to release it as early as 2027. Twenty million units are planned for launch, suggesting the company does not expect it to be a sensational consumer success at launch the way some of its past products, like AirPods, have been.

Not long ago, it was reported that OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) plans to release its own hardware, though the specifics and form factor are not publicly known. Apple is expecting fierce competition there, as well as with Meta, which Apple already expected to compete with in the emerging and related smart glasses market.

Apple has experienced significant internal turmoil over AI, with former AI lead John Giannandrea’s conservative approach to the technology failing to lead to a usable, true LLM-based Siri or other products analysts expect would make Apply stay competitive in the space with other Big Tech companies.

Just a few days ago, it was revealed that Apple will tap Google’s Gemini large language models for an LLM overhaul of Siri. Other AI-driven products like smart glasses and an in-home smart display are also planned.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Journalists and advocates have been trying to grasp how many victims in total were harmed by Grok’s nudifying scandal after xAI delayed restricting outputs and app stores refused to cut off access for days.

The latest estimates show that perhaps millions were harmed in the days immediately after Elon Musk promoted Grok’s undressing feature on his own X feed by posting a pic of himself in a bikini.

Over just 11 days after Musk’s post, Grok sexualized more than 3 million images, of which 23,000 were of children, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) estimated in research published Thursday.

That figure may be inflated, since CCDH did not analyze prompts and could not determine if images were already sexual prior to Grok’s editing. However, The New York Times shared the CCDH report alongside its own analysis, conservatively estimating that about 41 percent (1.8 million) of 4.4 million images Grok generated between December 31 and January 8 sexualized men, women, and children.

For xAI and X, the scandal brought scrutiny, but it also helped spike X engagement at a time when Meta’s rival app, Threads, has begun inching ahead of X in daily usage by mobile device users, TechCrunch reported. Without mentioning Grok, X’s head of product, Nikita Bier, celebrated the “highest engagement days on X” in an X post on January 6, just days before X finally started restricting some of Grok’s outputs for free users.

Whether or not xAI intended the Grok scandal to surge X and Grok use, that appears to be the outcome. The Times charted Grok trends and found that in the nine days prior to Musk’s post, combined, Grok was only used about 300,000 times to generate images, but after Musk’s post, “the number of images created by Grok surged to nearly 600,000 per day” on X.

In an article declaring that “Elon Musk cannot get away with this,” writers for The Atlantic suggested that X users “appeared to be imitating and showing off to one another,” believing that using Grok to create revenge porn “can make you famous.”

X has previously warned that X users who generate illegal content risk permanent suspensions, but X has not confirmed if any users have been banned since public outcry over Grok’s outputs began. Ars asked and will update this post if X provides any response.

At first, X only limited Grok’s image editing for some free users, which The Atlantic noted made it seem like X was “essentially marketing nonconsensual sexual images as a paid feature of the platform.”

But then, on January 14, X took its strongest action to restrict Grok’s harmful outputs—blocking outputs prompted by both free and paid X users. That move came after several countries, perhaps most notably the United Kingdom, and at least one state, California, launched probes.

Crucially, X’s updates did not apply to the Grok app or website; however, it can reportedly still be used to generate nonconsensual images.

That’s a problem for victims targeted by X users, according to Carrie Goldberg, a lawyer representing Ashley St. Clair, one of the first Grok victims to sue xAI; St. Clair also happens to be the mother of one of Musk’s children.

Goldberg told Ars that victims like St. Clair want changes on all Grok platforms, not just X. But it’s not easy to “compel that kind of product change in a lawsuit,” Goldberg said. That’s why St. Clair is hoping the court will agree that Grok is a public nuisance, a claim that provides some injunctive relief to prevent broader social harms if she wins.

Currently, St. Clair is seeking a temporary injunction that would block Grok from generating harmful images of her. But before she can get that order, if she wants a fair shot at winning the case, St. Clair must fight an xAI push counter-suing her and trying to move her lawsuit into Musk’s preferred Texas court, a recent court filing suggests.

In that fight, xAI is arguing that St. Clair is bound by xAI’s terms of service, which were updated the day after she notified the company of her intent to sue.

Alarmingly, xAI argued that St. Clair effectively agreed to the TOS when she started prompting Grok to delete her nonconsensual images—which is the only way X users had to get images removed quickly, St. Clair alleged. It seems xAI is hoping to turn moments of desperation, where victims beg Grok to remove images, into a legal shield.

In the filing, Goldberg wrote that St. Clair’s lawsuit has nothing to do with her own use of Grok, noting that the harassing images could have been made even if she never used any of xAI’s products. For that reason alone, xAI should not be able to force a change in venue.

Further, St. Clair’s use of Grok was clearly under duress, Goldberg argued, noting that one of the photos that Grok edited showed St. Clair’s toddler’s backpack.

“REMOVE IT!!!” St. Clair asked Grok, allegedly feeling increasingly vulnerable every second the images remained online.

Goldberg wrote that Barry Murphy, an X Safety employee, provided an affidavit that claimed that this instance and others of St. Clair “begging @Grok to remove illegal content constitutes an assent to xAI’s TOS.”

But “such cannot be the case,” Goldberg argued.

Faced with “the implicit threat that Grok would keep the images of St. Clair online and, possibly, create more of them,” St. Clair had little choice but to interact with Grok, Goldberg argued. And that prompting should not gut protections under New York law that St. Clair seeks to claim in her lawsuit, Goldberg argued, asking the court to void St. Clair’s xAI contract and reject xAI’s motion to switch venues.

Should St. Clair win her fight to keep the lawsuit in New York, the case could help set precedent for perhaps millions of other victims who may be contemplating legal action but fear facing xAI in Musk’s chosen court.

“It would be unjust to expect St. Clair to litigate in a state so far from her residence, and it may be so that trial in Texas will be so difficult and inconvenient that St. Clair effectively will be deprived of her day in court,” Goldberg argued.

The estimated volume of sexualized images reported this week is alarming because it suggests that Grok, at the peak of the scandal, may have been generating more child sexual abuse material (CSAM) than X finds on its platform each month.

In 2024, X Safety reported 686,176 instances of CSAM to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which, on average, is about 57,000 CSAM reports each month. If the CCDH’s estimate of 23,000 Grok outputs that sexualize children over an 11-day span is accurate, then an average monthly total may have exceeded 62,000 if Grok was left unchecked.

NCMEC did not immediately respond to Ars’ request to comment on how the estimated volume of Grok’s CSAM compares to X’s average CSAM reporting. But NCMEC previously told Ars that “whether an image is real or computer-generated, the harm is real, and the material is illegal.” That suggests Grok could remain a thorn in NCMEC’s side, as the CCDH has warned that even when X removes harmful Grok posts, “images could still be accessed via separate URLs,” suggesting that Grok’s CSAM and other harmful outputs could continue spreading. The CCDH also found instances of alleged CSAM that X had not removed as of January 15.

This is why child safety experts have advocated for more testing to ensure that AI tools like Grok don’t roll out capabilities like the undressing feature. NCMEC previously told Ars that “technology companies have a responsibility to prevent their tools from being used to sexualize or exploit children.” Amid a rise in AI-generated CSAM, the UK’s Internet Watch Foundation similarly warned that “it is unacceptable that technology is released which allows criminals to create this content.”

Yet, for Musk and xAI, there have been no meaningful consequences for Grok’s controversial outputs.

It’s possible that recently launched probes will result in legal action in California or fines in the UK or elsewhere, but those investigations will likely take months to conclude.

While US lawmakers have done little to intervene, some Democratic senators have attempted to ask Google and Apple CEOs why X and the Grok app were never restricted in their app stores, demanding a response by January 23. One day ahead of that deadline, senators confirmed to Ars that they’ve received no responses.

Unsurprisingly, neither Google nor Apple responded to Ars’ request to confirm whether a response is forthcoming or provide any statements on their decisions to keep the apps accessible. Both companies have been silent for weeks, along with other Big Tech companies that appear to be afraid to speak out against Musk’s chatbot.

Microsoft and Oracle, which “run Grok on their cloud services,” as well as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, “which sell xAI the computer chips needed to train and run Grok,” declined The Atlantic’s request to comment on how the scandal has impacted their decisions to partner with xAI. Additionally, a dozen of xAI’s key investors simply didn’t respond when The Atlantic asked if “they would continue partnering with xAI absent the company changing its products.”

Similarly, dozens of advertisers refused Popular Information’s request to explain why there was no ad boycott over the Grok CSAM reports. That includes companies that once boycotted X over an antisemitic post from Musk, like “Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, all of which have advertised on X in recent days,” Popular Information reported.

It’s possible that advertisers fear Musk’s legal wrath if they boycott his platforms. The CCDH overcame a lawsuit from Musk last year, but that’s pending an appeal. And Musk’s so-called “thermonuclear” lawsuit against advertisers remains ongoing, with a trial date set for this October.

The Atlantic suggested that xAI stakeholders are likely hoping the Grok scandal will blow over and they’ll escape unscathed by staying silent. But so far, backlash has seemed to remain strong, perhaps because, while “deepfakes are not new,” xAI “has made them a dramatically larger problem than ever before,” The Atlantic opined.

“One of the largest forums dedicated to making fake images of real people,” Mr. Deepfakes, shut down in 2024 after public backlash over 43,000 sexual deepfake videos depicting about 3,800 individuals, the NYT reported. If the most recent estimates of Grok’s deepfakes are accurate, xAI shows how much more damage can be done when nudifying becomes a feature of one of the world’s biggest social networks, and nobody who has the power to stop it moves to intervene.

“This is industrial-scale abuse of women and girls,” Imran Ahmed, the CCDH’s chief executive, told NYT. “There have been nudifying tools, but they have never had the distribution, ease of use or the integration into a large platform that Elon Musk did with Grok.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">It’s no secret that students worldwide use AI chatbots to do their homework and avoid learning things. On the flip side, students can also use AI as a tool to beef up their knowledge and plan for the future with flashcards or study guides. Google hopes its latest Gemini feature will help with the latter. The company has announced that Gemini can now create free SAT practice tests and coach students to help them get higher scores.

As a standardized test, the content of the SAT follows a predictable pattern. So there’s no need to use a lengthy, personalized prompt to get Gemini going. Just say something like, “I want to take a practice SAT test,” and the chatbot will generate one complete with clickable buttons, graphs, and score analysis.

Of course, generative AI can go off the rails and provide incorrect information, which is a problem when you’re trying to learn things. However, Google says it has worked with education firms like The Princeton Review to ensure the AI-generated tests resemble what students will see in the real deal.

The interface for Gemini’s practice tests includes scoring and the ability to review previous answers. If you are unclear on why a particular answer is right or wrong, the questions have an “Explain answer” button right at the bottom. After you finish the practice exam, the custom interface (which looks a bit like Gemini’s Canvas coding tool) can help you follow up on areas that need improvement.

While the SAT is the most widely used test in US college admissions, it’s not the only one. Google is starting with the SAT but says it plans to support other tests in the future. It does not specify if future tests will be US-centric or if they could branch out to other regions.

Currently, SAT prep courses and tutoring are a big business. Practice tests and books can cost several hundred dollars, and a one-on-one tutor can run into the thousands. Overall, Americans spend billions of dollars every year on these products and services in hopes of giving their kids a leg up in college admissions.

AI is already making a dent in the industry—even without a dedicated test prep mode, students regularly use chatbots for tutoring, hallucinations be damned. The addition of this feature to Gemini for all users will likely accelerate declines in test prep and tutoring services.</div>

            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/white-house-ai-protester">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The White House published an image on X in which the face of a protester had been altered using AI to depict her weeping during her arrest — instead of striking a stoic pose, as she actually looked during the event.

The woman in the image, civil rights attorney and organizer Nekima Levy Armstrong, was arrested this week after interrupting a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota. The protesters were calling for the resignation of a pastor at the church, whom they say is the acting director of an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in St. Paul, Minnesota. Levy Armstrong and other protesters are now being charged with federal conspiracy and intimidation charges, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Trump Administration officials have repeatedly characterized the protest as a “riot” and an attack on Christian worshipers; speaking to CNN on Wednesday before her arrest, Levy Armstrong defended the action as a “peaceful nonviolent demonstration.”

On Thursday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem published a photo on X of Levy Armstrong’s arrest. Levy Armstrong appears to be handcuffed as she was escorted through an office space by a federal agent. In this image, Levy Armstrong isn’t crying. She’s also wearing bright pink lipstick, and her mouth is closed.

Roughly 30 minutes later, things got decidedly more bizarre when the official White House X account also published an image on X purportedly depicting Levy Armstrong’s arrest. But in this version of the photo, Levy Armstrong is pictured sobbing, with visible tears streaming down her cheeks and her mouth open. Her pink lipstick, notably, is gone.

“ARRESTED,” reads large, bolded text, inserted over the image of Levy Armstrong allegedly sobbing. “FAR LEFT AGITATOR NEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG FOR ORCHESTRATING CHURCH RIOTS IN MINNESOTA.”

Everything else about the image, however, is the same, including the positioning of Levy Armstrong’s body, the agent, and the background.

As CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale soon confirmed, the image had been altered to make it look as though Levy Armstrong was crying during her arrest.

Can you please provide comment on why this image was manipulated using AI to make it appear that the woman was crying? pic.twitter.com/Z2anIsoLan

Journalists and lawyers, among others, were quick to point out the discrepancy, taking to social media to show the stark difference between the two images.

The White House posted an edited photo of the activist involved in the Minneapolis church protest, made to look like she was crying.

Futurism contacted both the White House and the Department of Homeland Security to ask whether generative AI was used to alter the image, but hasn’t immediately received a reply.

According to Dale, when reached for comment, the White House responded with a link to a post from an administration spokesperson reading: “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.”

In its initial post, however, the White House made no attempt to clarify that the photo had been altered, nor did its presentation suggest in any way that it wasn’t real. It was presented as exactly that: a photo. In this context, to categorize this action — the undisclosed and unflattering altering of a photo of the arrest of an American citizen who has been charged with a federal crime but not yet tried or convicted in court, published on an official White House information channel — as a “meme” is, at best, disingenuous. At worst, it’s a revisionist lie intended to influence public opinion and the information ecosystem.

To that end, it’s unclear why the White House would feel the need to alter an arrest photo in this way, other than to portray a different reality of Levy Armstrong’s detainment — that is, if the reality of the photo published by Noem didn’t suit the administration and its aims.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The loudest calls for taxing the ultra-rich amid this year’s Davos summit aren’t coming from hooded anarchists or revolutionary socialists, but from the one-percenters themselves.

We’re not joking. While some of the richest individuals in history flock to the World Economic Forum summit, hundreds of their peers penned a letter calling on global leaders to address rising wealth inequality.

“The richest 1 percent now own more than 95 percent of the world’s population put together,” the letter declared. “Millionaires like us refuse to be silent. It is time to be counted. Tax us and make sure the next fifty years meet the promise of progress for everyone.”

The letter has some 400 signatories representing 24 countries so far, according to Fortune. They include Disney heirs Abby and Tim Disney, actors including Mark Ruffalo, and real estate moguls like Jeffrey Gural.

“Tax us. Tax the super rich,” the letter demands. “As millionaires who stand shoulder to shoulder with all people, we demand it. And as our elected representatives — whether it’s those of you at Davos, local councilors, city mayors, or regional leaders — it’s your duty to deliver it.”

Indeed, economic inequality isn’t simply a matter of frustration over income. As philosopher and ethics chair of institutions at Utrecht University Ingrid Robeyns explains in a column penned in the Guardian, “it is about who gets what share of what we produce together.”

“In recent decades the divide has widened, making capital owners even richer and workers even poorer,” Robeyns wrote.

That ever-widening gap between rich and poor has produced cascading crises: climate change accelerated by oil cartels, mass hunger despite an overabundance of food, preventable deaths while pharmaceutical giants hoard patents, deteriorating public schools stripped by private equity, and housing treated as a financial asset instead of shelter.

“As long as we dodge the question of whether neoliberal capitalism delivers what we want, and fail to take seriously the question of whether there are better systems, the world’s key problems cannot be properly understood, let alone solved,” Robeyns explains.

On a global scale, in other words, these millionaires and billionaires are essentially asking governments to solve a problem they’ve created. Their fortunes exist thanks to decades of wage suppression, privatization, and unequal exchange.

Waiting for the ultra-wealthy to voluntarily fund the common good isn’t a viable strategy. As history shows, lasting progress comes from organized power that gives working people real control over economic decisions. Still, it’s as good a place as any to start the conversation, and it’s nice to see a handful of the ultra-rich demand that they — and their less justice-conscious peers — be forced to pay their fair share.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last year, questions regarding president Donald Trump’s physical health started swirling after photographs showed a large, greenish bruise appearing on his right hand.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt offered an eyebrow-raising explanation, telling reporters at the time that the bruises were the result of him “constantly working and shaking hands all day every day.”

But now onlookers have spotted a similar bruise on his left hand. In other words, Trump has either been using his left hand to shake the hands of world leaders — or Leavitt’s explanation was one more example of the Trump administration’s dismal relationship with the truth.

One thing’s for sure: the mysterious injury is looking grisly. Photos of Trump at this year’s World Economic Forum in Switzerland show an even gnarlier darkish bruise on his left hand.

Experts have suggested that the bruising is the result of blood being drawn via an intravenous needle. Needles can puncture the walls of veins, causing blood to leak into surrounding tissues.

That explanation dovetails with other details the public has learned about Trump’s medical situation. After the 79-year-old was spotted with significant swelling in his legs, the White House announced in July that Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition among older people that causes blood to pool in the extremities.

George Washington University professor Jonathan Reiner told CNN last month that he has seen similar bruising in patients who take strong blood-thinner medications, including ones that are more potent than aspirin, a drug Trump is known to be fond of.

Any attempts to gain clarity on the situation have been met by hostility, suggesting it’s a highly sensitive topic among Trump administration officials.

“Any so-called medical professionals engaging in armchair diagnosis or false speculation for political purposes are clearly breaking the Hippocratic Oath they’ve sworn to, and they should get their head examined,” fumed White House communications director Steven Cheung in a statement to CNN.

Yet Trump’s inability to form coherent sentences, his garbling of words, and recent shuffling of his feet have once again raised questions over the president’s health.

Last week, Washington State University professor of medicine Bruce Davidson argued during a podcast appearance that Trump appears to have suffered a stroke that’s impacting his ability to move.

Beyond questions surrounding Trump’s physical health, experts have long speculated about his cognitive health as well. Former White House attorney Ty Cobb speculated this week that there has been a “significant decline” in his mental faculties.

“He’s always been driven by narcissism,” he told MS Now on Wednesday. “But I think the dementia and the cognitive decline are, you know, palpable, as do many experts, including many physicians.”

            <div id="article-text">The International Space Station is scheduled to be retired in 2030, bringing an end to three decades of cutting-edge space research. What comes next remains to be seen, as several private companies compete for NASA funding to once again establish an outpost in our planet’s orbit — outside of China’s existing Tiangong space station, that is.

As part of Phase 2 of its Commercial Space Stations program, NASA has been seeking feedback from its industry partners. While we have yet to find out the requirements, let alone which company — or companies — the agency will choose to move onto the next phase, some firms have started making tangible progress.

As Ars Technica reports, space startup Vast has opted to build a smaller and more feasible interim station, dubbed Haven-1, which will serve as the precursor for much larger outposts capable of continuous habitation in the more distant future.

Vast first showed off flashy renders of the capsule in October 2024, including luxuriously plush beds, enormous domed glass windows, and a minimalist interior layout. However, how much the final product will resemble these renders remains to be seen.

The company’s CEO, Max Haot, told Ars that “we reached the key milestone of fully completing the primary structure, and some of the secondary structure” last week. The company has since kicked off “clean room integration” ahead of a “full test campaign” with NASA scheduled for later this fall. The hope is to launch the capsule in early 2027.

Haven-1 will rely heavily on SpaceX’s existing hardware. The small capsule is designed to launch on a single SpaceX Falcon 9 and dock with a Crew Dragon spacecraft.

During its inaugural mission, the goal is to first check whether the capsule can stay pressurized and maintain its attitude before allowing any humans on board, Haot told Ars, a process that could take anywhere from two weeks to three years.

“The nominal plan is for a two-week mission,” he said, “and we have one fully contracted with SpaceX, as well as a second one that we have a deposit and an option on.”

The company is still waiting to hear from NASA about what its requirements will be for its commercial space station program until it decides whether to compete for funding.

Last week, lawmakers called on NASA to accelerate its plans to replace the ISS ahead of its decommissioning a mere four years from now.

“With the current budget, we don’t think more than two winners is reasonable, but it should absolutely be two in the best interest of the country,” Haot told Ars. “If there was a bigger budget, obviously, three would be great.”

There are several other companies looking to make inroads in the space. Voyager Technologies recently moved into “full-scale development” of its “Starlab” station. Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is still exploring its options after showing off plans for its “Orbital Reef.”

Axiom Space is also hoping to launch the “world’s first commercial space station.” The company released a detailed plan for its modular station last week, with a goal of launching as early as 2028.

But given the degree of complexity involved, plenty of questions remain about what will ultimately replace the ISS.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Four astronauts had to cut their mission on board the International Space Station short after a “medical concern” forced NASA to return them to Earth weeks early.

The space agency has been incredibly careful about not revealing too much in an effort to “protect the crew’s medical privacy.” We don’t know which of the four crew members — including NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov — fell ill. We also don’t know anything about what the medical issue actually was.

Now, Fincke has revealed a tantalizing clue about what went down during the first medical evacuation in the space station’s 25 years of continuous occupation. During their first public appearance following the medical evacuation on Wednesday — during which all four members appeared to be doing well enough to field questions — Fincke said that an onboard ultrasound machine “came in super handy” when “we had this emergency.”

“It really helped,” he added. “Of course, we didn’t have other big machines that we have here on planet Earth. We do try to make sure that everybody before we fly are really, really not prone to surprises.”

“But sometimes things happen and surprises happen, and the team was ready,” Fincke said.

“We can handle any kind of difficult situation,” he told reporters. “This is actually very, very good experience for the future of human spaceflight.”

While we now know that identifying the medical issue involves using a portable ultrasound machine, we’re still left guessing, since a litany of diagnoses can involve the versatile gadget.

After splashdown, the team was helicoptered to the Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego via helicopter for a “planned overnight stay at a local medical facility for additional evaluation,” and was “released as expected,” per NASA.

Among other things, ultrasound can be used to identify issues affecting muscles, joints, and tendons. Considering one of the most common types of injuries on board the space station is musculoskeletal in nature — a 2020 report suggests exercise is ironically the number one source of injuries — it’s entirely possible one of the crew members had injured themselves.

Medical professionals also use ultrasound for cancer screening and checking heart valves for leaks and clots, which could certainly make for an extremely serious situation on board the space station that would warrant an evacuation.

To be clear, NASA hasn’t revealed any details about what caused the agency to orchestrate the first-ever medical evacuation. And whether it ever will remains unclear. Before even jumping into questions during Wednesday’s conference, Cardman preempted any probing questions.

“Just to say it upfront, we are not going to be identifying the crew member or talking through the differential or any of the details of the medical situation,” she said. “Thank you so much for respecting our agency.”

Nonetheless, given the stakes involved, this month’s evacuation is a first test in case things were to go wrong during even longer missions into deep space — like NASA’s Artemis 2 mission to the Moon, which is scheduled to launch just over two weeks from now — in a possibility that the agency will have to prepare for no matter what.

“How we handled everything all the way through nominal operations to this unforeseen operation, it really bodes well for future exploration,” Fincke said.

We’re a well-honed machine here at Johnson Space Center and around the world,” he added. “So when we’re getting ready for Artemis, I am very optimistic.”

            <h2>San Diego Comic Con Quietly Bans AI Art</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-22</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The San Diego Comic Con has quietly updated its policy to ban AI-generated art, 404 Media reports, providing a major victory to artists.

The about-face is a welcome surprise. Until now, the massive convention — which has become a melting pot of all kinds of pop entertainment beyond the comic medium, with everyone ranging from game developers to movie studios using it as a platform to tease new content — has allowed some AI art to be displayed, so long as it was labeled as such and wasn’t for sale, as well as other stipulations that have been in place since at least 2024, according to 404.

In an interview with 404, Karla Ortiz, an artist who’s worked with major studios that attend Comic Con, called the decision a “relief.”

“Generative AI is still going to creep its nasty way in some way or another,” she said, “but at least it’s not something we have to take lying down. It’s something we can actively speak out against.”

Artists have been hostile towards AI pretty much from the moment it became popular, as the models were trained on troves of photos and artworks ripped from the internet without permission or compensation.

But this past year saw a particularly notable surge in anti-AI sentiment, which now seems to have finally reached a boiling point in the Comic Con community.

When the convention posted its latest rules for its upcoming Art Show this July, artists and fans on social media blasted it for allowing AI images. Ortiz was among the vocal critics.

“Comic-[C]on deciding to allow GenAI imagery in the art show — giving valuable space to GenAI users to show slop right NEXT to actual artists who worked their asses off to be there—is a disgrace!” she wrote in a post highlighted by 404.

Strikingly, less than a day after the AI backlash started, the convention quietly updated its policy: “Material created by Artificial Intelligence (AI) either partially or wholly, is not allowed in the art show,” it now reads. It’s seemingly keeping its cards close to its chest, as it made no announcement about the policy change.

The decision isn’t the only sign of resistance to AI in the world of comics and fandoms. President of DC Comics Jim Lee vowed to uphold human creativity and not support AI: “Not now, not ever,” Lee said last October. In August, another fandom convention, GalaxyCon, instituted a “sweeping AI art ban,” with its president saying it would “fight against unethical AI companies.” The following month, a vendor accused of selling AI art at Dragon Con was shown out by cops after organizers, with onlookers’ approval, demanded that the vendor leave.

Now, Comic Con’s reversal on the issue represents one of the biggest and most consequential shifts in the comic and fandom worlds, and seems to be part of a much greater turning tide sweeping across the entertainment landscape. Last week, musicians rejoiced when Bandcamp, a major music distribution platform favored by indie artists, also instituted an AI ban, prohibiting any songs that generated “wholly or in substantial part by AI.”

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/former-sequoia-partners-new-startup-uses-ai-to-negotiate-your-calendar-for-you/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Kais Khimji has spent most of his professional career as a venture investor, including six years as a partner at the prominent VC firm Sequoia Capital.

But just like several other former Sequoia partners — including David Vélez, who founded the Brazilian digital bank Nubank — Khimji (pictured left) has always wanted to be a startup founder. On Thursday, he announced that he has revived an idea he began working on as a student at Harvard about 10 years ago, turning it into the AI calendar-scheduling company Blockit. In a major vote of confidence, Khimji’s former employer, Sequoia, led the company’s $5 million seed round.

“Blockit has a chance to become a $1Bn+ revenue business, and Kais will make sure it gets there,” Pat Grady, Sequoia’s general partner and co-steward who led the investment, wrote in a blog post.

While many startups have tried to automate scheduling in the past, Khimji believes that thanks to advances in LLMs, Blockit’s AI agents can handle scheduling more seamlessly and efficiently than many of its predecessors, including now-defunct startups Clara Labs and x.ai. (Yes, that domain name ended up with Elon Musk’s AI company.)

Unlike the current category leader Calendly, which was last valued at $3 billion and relies on users sharing links to find availability, Blockit is betting that its AI agents can master the nuance required to handle the entire scheduling process without human involvement.

With Blockit, Khimji and co-founder John Hahn — who previously worked on calendar products, including Timeful, Google Calendar, and Clockwise — are building what is essentially an AI social network for people’s time.

“It always felt very odd. I have a time database — my calendar. You have a time database — your calendar, and our databases just can’t talk to each other,” Khimji told TechCrunch.

Khimji says that Blockit can finally solve this disconnection. When two users need to meet, their respective AI agents communicate directly to negotiate a time, bypassing the typical back-and-forth emails entirely.

Users can invoke the Blockit agent by copying it on an email or messaging it in Slack about a meeting. The bot then takes over the logistics, negotiating a mutually convenient time and location that fits the preferences of all participants.

Khimji said that Blockit can work as seamlessly as a human executive assistant. Users simply need to provide the system with specific instructions about their preferences, such as which meetings are nonnegotiable and which are “movable” based on daily needs. “Sometimes my calendar is crazy, so I need to skip lunch, and the agent needs to know that it’s okay to skip lunch,” he said.

The system can even be trained to prioritize meetings based on the tone of an email. For instance, a user might instruct the agent that a meeting request signed with a formal “Best regards” should take precedence over a casual interaction ending with “Cheers.”

By learning the preferences of its users, Blockit appears to be capitalizing on what venture firm Foundation Capital’s partners Jaya Gupta and Ashu Garg call “context graphs.” In a widely shared essay, the investors describe a multibillion-dollar opportunity for AI agents to capture the “why” behind every business decision by relying on the hidden logic that previously only existed in a person’s head.

Blockit is already being used by more than 200 companies, including AI startup Together.ai, the newly acquired fintech company Brex, and robotics startup Rogo, as well as venture firms a16z, Accel, and Index. The app is available for free for 30 days. After that, it costs $1,000 annually for individual users and $5,000 annually for a team license with support for multiple users, Khimji said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Defense tech company Anduril on Thursday announced its plans to expand its Southern California presence with a major campus in Long Beach, the coastal town where founder Palmer Luckey grew up.

The expanded campus will eventually support about 5,500 jobs. Luckey told TechCrunch that these will be new jobs, not transfers from other operations.

Anduril’s headquarters is nearby, in Costa Mesa, California, and it also has a massive manufacturing facility in Ohio. The Long Beach campus will span 1.18 million square feet across six buildings, combining office space and industrial areas dedicated to R&D. It is expected to be ready by mid-2027, the company said.

Long Beach is “a major aerospace hub right in our backyard,” Luckey told TechCrunch about why the company chose that location.

The plan is to hire similar types of employees to those working at headquarters: manufacturing workers, technicians, assembly workers, and engineers across disciplines (electrical, mechanical, aerodynamics), as well as build and test roles, and “a lot of people on the logistics side, because the things that we’re going to be making there, we’re going to be sending all over the world,” he said.

While bringing thousands of jobs to his childhood town made headlines today, Luckey said the most exciting part for him was the fighter jets.

“It looks like we’re going to be able to manufacture autonomous fighter jets that will take off right from the factory and fly to wherever the customer needs them,” he said. “We might have jets leaving the factory, flying directly into combat. And I think that that is extremely cool.”

Anduril makes autonomous military drones and aircraft for land, air, and sea. In 2025, it unveiled a fighter jet called Fury, designed to fly autonomously, meaning it operates using AI rather than being piloted remotely by a human operator. The AI executes flight plans set by humans. The Fury completed its first test flight in California on October 31.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has reorganized some of its leadership and picked a familiar face to lead its push into selling AI to business customers as the company looks to catch up to its rivals in 2026.

The company appointed Barret Zoph to lead its efforts to sell its AI to enterprises, according to reporting from The Information, citing an internal OpenAI memo.

TechCrunch reached out to OpenAI for confirmation and more information.

Zoph returned to OpenAI last week after leaving Thinking Machine Labs, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s AI startup where Zoph had served as a co-founder and CTO since October 2024.

The exact circumstances of his departure aren’t clear, with rumors swirling about whether Zoph and a few other former OpenAI employees were fired or left on their own accord, possibly with plans to return to OpenAI all along.

Zoph was previously the vice president of post-training inference at OpenAI from September 2022 to October 2024. He’s stepping into a very different position and will likely play an important role at the company as it looks to grow its enterprise business — an area where it is losing ground to competitors.

OpenAI launched its enterprise-focused ChatGPT Enterprise product in 2023 more than a year before Anthropic and multiple years before Google launched its enterprise offerings. The company claims the product has more than 5 million business users and counts companies including SoftBank, Target, and Lowe’s as customers.

But its market share is falling while its rivals are climbing.

Anthropic holds a dominant lead over its AI rivals when it comes to enterprise large language model usage. The AI research lab holds a 40% market share, according to a December report from VC firm Menlo Ventures (which, it should be noted, has invested aggressively in Anthropic). In July, the startup’s market share was estimated to be 32%.

Google’s Gemini adoption has been steadier, according to Menlo Ventures. The company released its enterprise product last fall and has seen its enterprise LLM usage market share largely stay the same, per Menlo’s findings, growing from 20% in July to 21% at the end of the year.

OpenAI on the other hand has seen its usage market share drop from 50% in 2023 to 27% at the end of 2025 — a trend that appears to concern the company. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expressed concern specifically that Google Gemini’s growth was starting to encroach on OpenAI in an internal memo a few months ago.

Enterprise growth is an area of focus for the company in 2026, OpenAI’s CFO Sarah Friar wrote in a blog post this past Sunday.

The company has since announced an expanded multi-year partnership with ServiceNow that will give ServiceNow customers access to OpenAI models.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Vimeo, the video-hosting platform, is laying off some of its global staff, according to a report from Business Insider. The move comes shortly after the company’s acquisition by the Italian tech conglomerate Bending Spoons, which purchased it in an all-cash deal last year for $1.38 billion.

Bending Spoons confirmed the layoffs to BI but wouldn’t share how many people would lose their jobs. The Verge reports that the cutbacks will impact a “large portion” of the company’s total workforce, citing a LinkedIn post from Vimeo’s former VP of Global Brand and Creative, who stated that he, “along with a large portion of the company,” had been “impacted by layoffs.”

TechCrunch reached out to Vimeo and Bending Spoons for more information.

Vimeo, which was founded in 2004, has struggled to find its footing in a field dominated by YouTube. In recent years, the company has leaned heavily into AI. In 2023, it announced plans to launch AI-powered script-writing and video-editing tools. This past October, the company added a suite of additional AI-powered creator tools designed to connect filmmakers’ “content directly to AI workflows.”

In recent years, Bending Spoons has acquired a number of other well-known tech platforms, including Meetup, Evernote, and WeTransfer.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/gm-to-end-chevy-bolt-ev-production-next-year-move-china-made-buick-to-u-s-factory/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">General Motors is shuffling where its vehicles are made in a move that will shift production away from China and Mexico and to a U.S. factory in Kansas. That change will also mean the end of its rebooted Chevrolet Bolt EV, the only vehicle currently built at the Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas.

The factory musical chairs reflect an economic and political environment, shaped by the Trump administration’s tariff policy and its decision to end the federal EV tax credit, which provided up to $7,500 off qualifying electric vehicles. These changes have made it more expensive to build vehicles in China and Mexico that are then sold in the United States.

Production of the 2027 Chevy Bolt EV, which landed in dealerships this month, is expected to end in about a year and a half. The new Chevy Bolt EV, which is priced at $29,990 including the destination fee, is one of the most affordable new EVs available to U.S. consumers.

GM confirmed to TechCrunch that the next-generation Buick Envision, currently built in China, will move to the Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas, beginning in 2028. The gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox, which is made in the San Luis Potosí plant in Mexico, will move to the Kansas factory in mid-2027.

The Bolt, meanwhile, will have a short life if GM follows through with its previously announced plans.

“When we revealed Bolt in October, we said and it was widely reported that it’d be a limited run model,” a GM spokesperson said in a statement sent to TechCrunch. “We had also previously announced the gas-powered Equinox would be coming to Fairfax in mid 2027 after Bolt production ramps down. Today we’re announcing the next-generation Buick compact SUV will come to Fairfax beginning in 2028.”

The company still sells other EVs, including an electric Chevy Equinox and Chevy Blazer. The question is whether GM will change course and save the Bolt if sales are better than expected. We do know that GM has promised to make new future investments in Fairfax Assembly for its next generation of affordable EVs. We just don’t know when.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/capital-one-acquires-brex-for-steep-discount-to-its-peak-valuation-but-early-believers-are-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a feeling of schadenfreude in Silicon Valley when a unicorn stumbles. So when the WSJ broke the news Thursday afternoon that Capital One will acquire Brex for $5.15 billion in cash and stock (Capital One issued an official release confirming the details 30 minutes later), you could practically hear the collective snickering from Sand Hill Road to San Francisco’s South Park. That figure represents less than half of Brex’s last private-market valuation of $12.3 billion from its 2022 Series D-2 round.

Before everyone sharpens their knives, consider that for the VCs who backed Brex at its outset, the sale is a triumph.

Micky Malka’s Ribbit Capital, which led Brex’s $7 million Series A soon after its 2017 founding, is likely staring at a very handsome return. Reached by phone this afternoon, Malka declined to offer specifics, but as a Brex board member from the outset and the company’s biggest shareholder, he was unsurprisingly enthusiastic about the deal: “We’re excited for the team, which was one of the youngest YC teams at the time. I’ve known [the founders] since they were 16. Capital One will be a great partner, and their ability to scale [as part of the bank] is good for America.”

Indeed, that early bet — Ribbit was joined by Y Combinator, Kleiner Perkins, DST Global, and individual investors including Peter Thiel and Max Levchin — has multiplied somewhere in the neighborhood of 700-fold. Even accounting for dilution across subsequent rounds, early stakeholders are walking away with the kind of gains that have long made venture capital seem like such an attractive asset class to outsiders.

Still, the sting of that valuation haircut is sharper when you consider what happened to Brex’s chief rival, Ramp, during the same period. Just as Brex lost momentum several years ago, Ramp went on a tear. The competing expense management fintech has at this point raised $2.3 billion in total equity financing and saw its valuation zoom from $13 billion in March of last year to $32 billion by November across successive funding rounds.

You could argue whether those kinds of paper gains across a dizzying number of financing events means that much (that’s definitely not always the case). Still, assuming Ramp is presenting a truthful picture to the world, it’s traction in undeniable. The company announced last October that it had surpassed $1 billion in annualized recurring revenue and secured more than 50,000 customers. The contrast is probably more painful for Brex’s later-stage investors, who watched a competitor lap them multiple times while they awaited an exit.

The Capital One deal comes at a bit of an inflection point for Brex. Just five months ago, the company announced it had secured a license to operate in the European Union. As CEO Pedro Franceschi wrote in a blog post at the time, the move enabled Brex to “directly issue credit and debit cards and offer its spend management products to any business in all 30 EU countries with no workarounds required.” Previously, the company could only work with EU firms that maintained a U.S. presence, a significant limitation for a would-be global player.

For Capital One, the timing is as good as it gets. The bank, which already swallowed Discover Financial in a $35 billion deal last May, gains Brex’s tech platform and client roster — including, reportedly, TikTok, Robinhood, and Intel — as well as immediate access to European corporate banking customers through its freshly minted EU license. (TechCrunch has reached out to Brex for more information.)

The $13 billion in deposits that Brex reportedly oversees at partner banks and money-market funds also presumably sweetened the pot.

The founders, Brazilian entrepreneurs Pedro Franceschi and Henrique Dubugras, dropped out of Stanford as freshmen to launched Brex in 2017 after being accepted into YC’s winter 2017 “batch,” initially pitching a virtual reality concept. But they were bound to circle back to payments having sold — at the tender age of 16 — a payments processor startup in Brazil that had raised $30 million and was later acquired for more than $1 billion by one of its strategic investors.

Dubugras stepped back from day-to-day operations in 2024 to serve as board chairman; Franceschi will remain CEO post-acquisition.

As with nearly every startup, Brex’s path wasn’t without its stumbles. There was a questionable detour in 2019, when the then-23-year-old co-CEOs, who had never run a restaurant, bought San Francisco’s beloved South Park Cafe. The pair had envisioned Brex cardmembers dining before heading upstairs to an exclusive lounge, a timing decision that proved spectacularly lousy, when COVID-19 shut down most of San Francisco for over a year.

Then, in 2022, as the macroeconomic picture darkened and VCs began demanding actual profitability from their portfolio companies, Brex made a decision that generated considerable ill will; it abandoned tens of thousands of small- and medium-size business customers, informing them their accounts would close unless they had “professional” funding from VCs, angels, or accelerators.

The move, designed to focus resources on higher-margin enterprise clients and a nascent SaaS business, struck many as tone-deaf. The company that had built its reputation serving underbanked startups and was suddenly showing its champions the door (was how the move was perceived at the time).

The strategy may be what positioned Brex for this exit. By concentrating on corporate clients with deeper pockets and predictable revenue streams, the company stabilized its business model, even as Ramp ramped up its fundraising. (Mercury, another competitor, also doubled its valuation to $3.5 billion with a $300 million raise last March. To steal some of the attention paid in 2025 to Ramp, Mercury more recently shared with Fortune that it had hit a rate of $650 million in annual recurring revenue.)

Capital One said it expects to close the deal in the second quarter. For Brex’s later-stage investors, including TCV, GIC, Baillie Gifford, Madrone Capital Partners, Durable Capital Partners, Valiant Capital Management, and Base10, all of which invested at a $7.4 billion valuation or higher, the exit may not be quite what they hoped, but they’re still liquid, which, in today’s climate, counts for something.

Joan Brugge has worked for nearly 50 years as a cancer scientist, studying the earliest signs that someone might become sick. Then the Trump administration canceled her lab’s funding. The administration’s attacks on medicine, culture, and education—which include verbal threats and funding cuts—are about more than just budgeting and bravado. Ruth Ben-Ghiat is a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University and the author of Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present. She argues that this effort is part of a larger autocratic project to maintain power.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Joan Brugge: I was actually at a breast-cancer retreat. And during the coffee break, I looked at my emails to see, you know, if there’s anything that I had to deal with. And I got this email from the university, and it was a real gut punch. My knees basically buckled, and I had to sit down.

Brugge: I never imagined that it would be possible that funding for lifesaving research would be terminated for issues that were totally unrelated to the quality of the work or the progress that we had made in the work.

Anne Applebaum: From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I’m Anne Applebaum. In this new season, I am asking how the Trump White House is rewriting the rules of U.S. politics, and talking to Americans whose lives have been changed as a result.

Today’s episode examines the administration’s attacks on science, medicine, culture, and education—a combination of verbal threats and funding cuts that look very much like an attempt to control knowledge. Maybe there’s a broader goal, too: to build distrust, and, ultimately, to reshape all Americans’ perceptions of reality. I know that sounds dramatic, but I spent many years writing about authoritarian regimes, and almost all of them try to undermine admired institutions, in order to radically alter the way people think.

Let’s start with the attacks on science. Joan Brugge was stunned when her research became a target:

Brugge: I’ve been doing cancer research for almost 50 years now, not just at Harvard. When I was at undergrad, my sister was diagnosed with a highly aggressive brain tumor. I’ve been moving forward from that ever since. It’s definitely been a compass that’s been directing my life’s work.

The research projects in our lab involve studies of finding better ways to detect and destroy cells that are the earliest precursors of breast cancer, and to design treatments that can eliminate them so that we could try to prevent them from progressing to cancer. It’s like we’re detectives, like, you go in and there was a bank robbery, and you gotta figure out who did it. We’re trying to figure out what genes are responsible for causing this cancer, and how do they do it?

It was May of 2025 when I found out that both of my research grants were terminated. A few days after we first got the notices, it was like walking through a morgue, because all the faculty and staff from the labs were, just, almost paralyzed by the consequences of this.

It’s shocking and demoralizing to have to deal with this.

One of the impacts of the terminations was that instead of guiding my lab towards the studies to prevent or treat cancer, I’ve been extremely distracted by efforts to try to raise money to support the lab. Since last May, seven people have left the lab, but I only have sufficient funding to be able to replace two of them.

It’s funny; I think it gets emotional here, just ’cause this is what we’re living with and it’s just so difficult. It doesn’t feel right that Americans are going to be deprived of the outcome from this research.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat: We have a very focused and intense effort across the board to set America back a generation, at least, for education, health, research, climate policy.

Applebaum: Ruth Ben-Ghiat is a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University and the author of Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present.

Ben-Ghiat: The thing many people don’t understand is that autocrats think about governments in a totally different way. Public welfare and accountability are not of interest to autocrats. It’s about amassing power, staying in power as long as you can, and enriching yourself.

Applebaum: Ruth, of all the changes made by this administration, it seems to me that the attack on science is the strangest. I can’t even think of other places where this has happened in recent memory.

Ben-Ghiat: I’ve been trying, since the start of this administration in January 2025, to figure out where it is following the classic autocratic playbook and what, instead, is new or novel. There are two things that stand out as new to me. One is the speed of change, really the speed at which institutions have been destroyed.

Ben-Ghiat: Research has been destroyed. Whole areas of knowledge and policy have been set back. It doesn’t correspond to any other example I know where the leader came to power via elections.

It doesn’t correspond to the first 10 months of Putin, Orbán, Erdoğan—none of them.

Applebaum: To a lot of Americans, it feels like these attacks are coming out of the blue. How do you explain them? How do you explain their origin? Why are these things the focus of Trump or his acolytes’ interest?

Ben-Ghiat: Well, they only come out of the blue if you ignored what was going on during Trump 1.0. Many of these fanatic causes and the people involved in them, such as Stephen Miller and others, were active then. And it was simply that they were only able to push these things so far, and now they feel free and empowered to push this through. The speed at which these parallel wars on American institutions and science and knowledge are happening resemble not the aftermath of an election, but when people come to power via coup. And, in fact, in some areas, like the universities or science, the Trump administration has acted more swiftly than people did, for example, Pinochet’s regime after a coup. They didn’t start a lot of their large-scale changes to the economy and education for a year or two. So here we have something that’s been planned for a long time.

And then the other thing I would mention is that they used their power when they were out of office beautifully. And by partnering with the Heritage Foundation—Project 2025—when he won the election, they were able to hit the ground running.

Applebaum: And is the purpose of this attack to diminish academic institutions themselves, or is it to do with the people who work for them?

Ben-Ghiat: It’s both. If we take the example of education institutions, of course you wanna go after individuals. And so every autocrat ends up purging any kind of critic. Certain fields of knowledge must go, and others are actually replaced. So you have a reform of institutions at the curricular level, such as Italy and Germany under the fascist period, made huge investments in demographics, in eugenics, racial engineering, and other subjects—and people who taught them had to go. But also, at a structural level, you want to change the tenor of the institution. You want to make educational institutions into places where you don’t have free thinking, critical thinking, and curiosity, as you would in democracies. Instead, the education institution itself becomes a place that breeds the values of authoritarianism: suspicion, hostility. And so every regime invests in having student informers.

And when I start my classes now at New York University, the first day, if they’re about authoritarianism or fascism, I look out at the students and I say, If this were an authoritarian state, one of you or two of you would be informing on each other. And another would be assigned to inform on me, as the instructor.

So it’s curriculum; it’s personnel. But the very conception of the institution must change, and it must become realigned and recast to fit in with the larger goals of that state.

Applebaum: And in this case, what do you mean by “larger goals”?

Ben-Ghiat: Well, this is what I call, and others call, personalist rule, under the Trump administration. Under personalist rule, you have, obviously, a very strong leader, and everyone has to pay tribute to him. Some people call this patrimonialism. I use personalism. And so educational institutions have to be compliant to him.

Applebaum: Ruth, several academics have told me that they believe cuts in funding for university-scientific research are really not about science but about the humanities. They fear that the administration thinks it can use federal funding to influence the kinds of courses universities teach, the students they enroll, the people they hire, ultimately the thoughts that they generate. But still, this doesn’t quite explain why an American president would want to destroy the most powerful engine of innovation in our economy, and maybe the world, which is our universities and their research departments. Why would they want to stifle lifesaving cancer research? Also, why would any government want its people not to be vaccinated? I’m not sure there are any other examples in the modern world, or even in recent history.

Ben-Ghiat: I agree. I can’t find any examples either, although we have examples of people such as [Jair] Bolsonaro, when he was president [of Brazil], trying to dissuade people during COVID that—he said, it was just “a little flu.” So this is a way to attack science, most obviously; a way to spread conspiracy theories.

We’ve seen attempts to smear and discredit scientists, librarians, teachers, judges, journalists. Anybody who works with empirical-research protocols, fact-based methods, scientific methods, investigations—all of them must go. And a very terrifying void opens up that is filled by fear, by conspiracy theories, or by nothing, where people don’t have any recourse against disease—creating conditions so that with the CDC and NIH and all the other infrastructure of science, if there is an outbreak of mass disease, we’ll be completely undefended. So it’s really, almost, a totalitarian—I don’t use that word lightly—effort to change the mindset of people away from science and fact-based research, across the board.

Applebaum: Of course, totalitarian leaders in the past did try to use schools and universities and research institutions to create an alternative reality. Stalin wanted to build a world in which everything he said was automatically accepted as true and nobody ever questioned him. Hitler manipulated science to prove his theories about race. But still, both of them were interested in engineering, in nuclear technology, in energy technology. They weren’t cutting research funding across the board.

Ruth, as we heard from Joan Brugge at the top of this episode, huge cuts in federal support have already been impacting research labs across the United States, including labs that don’t have anything to do with politics. Can you think of an example, prior to this administration, of a very advanced society with very advanced scientific institutes, simply threatening to cut off funding?

Ben-Ghiat: The only example I can think of is China, during Mao.

Applebaum: I was just gonna ask about that.

Ben-Ghiat: During Mao’s long-tenured Cultural Revolution, et cetera, science was put back by generations. Scientists were among the intellectuals and researchers who were killed and imprisoned and purged.

And so you had some of this winnowing-out because of loyalty. You had ideological obedience to the party and to the revolution over fact-based knowledge, and fact-based research became the enemy. Universities were destroyed. Experts were sent to the countryside for reeducation.

So really, people who have studied this talk about an entire lost generation of scientists, and engineers as well. And instead, you had institutions, including scientific ones populated with guards and people who were inexperienced, fanatics, reckless. And so even people who were heroes of the nation, they were beaten, tortured, taken for reeducation. It didn’t matter who they were and what kind of contribution they could make. The entire enterprise of science had to be wrecked. That’s the only example I can think of where you have an intention, an intensity. And, of course, the scope was bigger, but this is just beginning in the United States, and it’s really, really frightening.

Applebaum: Why do you think Harvard has been such a focus? What is it about that institution that has attracted the attention not really just of Trump but of the Project 2025 crowd.

Ben-Ghiat: Well here we get into the logic of authoritarian bullying. The more powerful an entity is, the more they must be made an example of. And the higher, more prestigious your target, the more bringing them down, or trying to, sends a message to everybody else.

And so that’s how authoritarian shifts in culture—and I’m talking about culture as turns of behavior, values—that’s how they can be jump-started, because then universities with far smaller endowments and power and clout would say, Oh, if Harvard’s capitulating, well, what can we do?

Applebaum: Yeah, when I saw the attack on Harvard, I also thought: They’re doing this to show that they can do anything. If they can destroy Harvard, they can destroy anyone.

Applebaum: There are quite a lot of people out there who like some of what Trump is doing, and maybe they’re worried by some pieces of it, but they wouldn’t see this as some kind of deliberate destruction. What would you say to them, to convince them of your point of view?

Ben-Ghiat: I think that it’s a question of time. When you take away pandemic planning, when you take away scientific research, when you take away accessibility for vaccines, the results aren’t seen immediately.

It takes time for these things to develop. And so, unfortunately, I believe we’re going to have a reckoning, that eyes will open as things fall apart in America. And then people who did not want to believe who Trump was will see the light.

Applebaum: The erosion of these institutions, the attempt to undermine our faith in the scientific method—these things could be part of a larger autocratic effort to maintain power.

Ben-Ghiat: Why is he militarizing everyday life? He wants to build fear in people about going to vote. There’s both a work of discrediting elections and a work of intimidation that’s going to intensify as the midterms grow closer.

Applebaum: Let’s talk a little bit about cultural institutions. Why would an American president be interested in dictating the content of exhibitions at the Smithsonian, a beloved American institution. It belongs to all of us. Its governing board has all kinds of worthy people on it: the chief justice of the Supreme Court; it’s usually had the vice president; many other important figures in public life—bipartisan, I should say. What is it about the Smithsonian that’s attracting his interest or, again, the interest of the people around him?

Ben-Ghiat: Autocrats engage in a mix of utopia and nostalgia, so the Smithsonian is a perfect target if you truly are aiming big. And authoritarians like Trump, they think big; they think long-term. They’re very obsessed with their legacy.

You purge the content of histories that you no longer want, or people you no longer want featured—and instead, you promote your own sanitized, mythological version of history. It’s not enough to just fire people you are smearing who are “radical left,” even though they’re not. You have to go after the whole thing.

Applebaum: For people listening for whom this is a new idea: Why would a leader be trying to reshape or rewrite history? How does it serve the president to erase Black history, or to eliminate stories of the immigrants who have come from all over the world? What does that do for him?

Ben-Ghiat: So every leader, especially authoritarians, want to situate themselves within the flow of the nation. And they need to show that they are on the right side of history. History itself has to be rewritten. And in this case, we have white-Christian-nationalist history, which in a totalitarian framework does not permit the coexistence with other histories. You can’t read the history of institutionalized racism or slavery. And so the entire history, and this translates down to what’s been banned first in Florida and Oklahoma and other states. All of this has to go. And cultural and political icons—people who might be enshrined in the Smithsonian—have to go. At stake is rewriting the entire history of America as a multiracial, multifaith democracy.

Applebaum: The administration has also halted some federal-government cultural spending—for example, on small museums or monuments, and indeed scholars—and redirected it instead to the upcoming 250th-anniversary celebrations of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Why do you think the Trump administration cares about that anniversary, and what distinguishes that from teaching civics or the history of the American Revolution?

Ben-Ghiat: Well, Trump in particular is a man of spectacle. He knows how to stage a spectacle, and ideally, of course, he is at the center of this.

This is a classic appropriation of what would be a very important national milestone. It will become an excuse to intensify a kind of rewriting of American history, but also remapping of the way that Washington, D.C., looks as the power center. And he’s already done this with the White House. That’s leaving his mark. So it’s never just a superficial transformation when you have authoritarians. They can change countries so that even in the space of just a decade, it can take generations for that country to recover.

Applebaum: Ruth, we know how this worked in the past. Dictators have built monumental palaces, or reconstructed their capital cities, as a way of proving they can defeat death, make their power last forever. Famously, Stalin built skyscrapers in Moscow, as well as in Riga and Warsaw, after he occupied those cities, too.

Ben-Ghiat: Yeah, I agree. What autocrats really want is to feel safe, because they of all people know how hated they are. They know who their enemies are, and the depth of hatred that they foster with their violence and their corruption. And so they build these safe spaces for themselves, both at the level of governance where they have these, they’re called inner sanctums, with sycophants and family members.

And they also put their mark on the capital. I think, in America, because we haven’t had a national dictatorship, it’s hard to envision that autocrats truly don’t care about public welfare. They have totally different priorities.

Applebaum: How does that make sense even from the point of view of the authoritarian? I mean, if they continue to strive to damage America, how long can their destruction continue before it reflects the failure of the leader himself?

Ben-Ghiat: That’s a risk they take. But one thing about authoritarians is—although, as I’ve just described, they’re very fearful—they also come to believe in their own omnipotence. In part, because, all day long, if they’ve done their job and gotten enough sycophants around them—we’ve seen this daily in America—all day long,they’re having praise from people. Without you, we wouldn’t be anything, Mr. President. And after a while of this, and we’ve seen this, they start to believe their own propaganda. And then they take risks, and they exceed; they overreach. And that often is their downfall.

Applebaum: Ruth, finally, how does this change the conversation about the midterms in 2026? Is the rewriting of history or attacks on universities—are these part of an attempt to persuade Americans to think differently about elections? Do you connect these attacks on science, on medicine, on culture to the midterms?

Ben-Ghiat: There’s been a concerted and very relentless attempt to change the way that Americans feel about authorities, to change the way that they feel about American institutions. And elections are the most important of those institutions because it is the way that we express our voice and have our agency in the world.

And so, already, as we well know, with his election denial in 2020, he had managed—he actually pulled off a historic feat—he managed to convince tens of millions of people of a very easily verifiable fact that he lost the election. Instead, he convinced tens of millions that he was the rightful winner. And he kept up the distrust in elections all these years. The churches allied with him; the manosphere; all of his enablers and allies. They’ve done a beautiful job from the autocratic point of view of discrediting not only elections but the whole way you think about democracy. So that’s part of it.

The other is: Why is he militarizing everyday life? He wants to build fear in people about going to vote. There’s both a work of discrediting elections and a work of intimidation that’s going to intensify as the midterms grow closer.

Applebaum: So part of the point of attacking institutions that collect and promote knowledge, whether scientific or cultural, is just to reduce Americans’ trust in everything. If we don’t know what’s true and what’s not true, then when Trump argues that the results of the 2020 election are fake, we believe him. There isn’t any evidence, but we don’t care about evidence. And they might also persuade Americans not to accept the results of elections this year either, if they aren’t favorable to the Republicans.

Ben-Ghiat: Yes.And it’s so nice to speak with you because you’ve studied these things too. That’s a big point. It’s destroying trust, which is really trust in each other, too, because what is an election? It’s everybody casting their vote, their preference, and then based on that collective will, you can change a leadership.

And so by convincing people that, Oh, it’s just all gonna be rigged, you’re really giving up on each other. And when you don’t vote, you’re also kind of giving up on your own voice.

Ben-Ghiat: Ultimately, destroying trust is the currency of autocrats, and it’s one of the saddest things. And we know, when autocracies finally fall, rebuilding that trust is one of the most difficult things to do.

Applebaum: Thank you very much, Ruth Ben-Ghiat.

            <h2>The Trump Administration’s Affordability Messaging Is Confusing Americans</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-23</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/2026/01/trump-affordability-speech-davos/685719/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

At a rally in Detroit earlier this month, Donald Trump told the crowd that his upcoming speech at the World Economic Forum would tackle one of his core issues: affordability. But the address he delivered in Davos yesterday was not quite what he’d telegraphed.

In what my colleague David A. Graham described as a “stump speech,” the president strayed from that focus, roaming from Arctic defense to the Minnesota fraud scandal to the policies of “Sleepy” Joe Biden. When he returned to the topic of affordability, he claimed that grocery prices are “going down” (they’re not) and that drug prices have declined by “2,000 percent” (they haven’t). Although Trump campaigned on the economy, weak polling has recently spurred new plans to make life in America more affordable.

At one point, Trump plugged a plan to curb predatory lending practices by capping credit-card interest rates at 10 percent—but the deadline (proposed on Truth Social) for the policy to go into effect had passed the day before. Trump also used his speech to promote his plan to lower housing costs, which he recently unveiled in an executive order. The policy is aimed at preventing corporations from buying up single-family homes, and has bipartisan support. These proposals were a blip in his 80-minute speech before he quickly pivoted.

Trump has lately been laser-focused on foreign policy. Nearly three weeks ago, U.S. troops captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and brought him to New York for trial. Since then, Trump has flirted with military action in Iran and attempted to bully Denmark into giving up Greenland, threatening a sweeping new tariff strategy that—had Trump not reneged yesterday—could have raised costs for Americans.

When Trump and his officials have talked about the economy, their comments have been confusing. The White House’s insistence that consumer goods are, in fact, affordable has so far not connected with many Americans, for whom high prices are still top of mind. In an attempt to underscore how cheap supermarkets have supposedly become, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said last week that “it can cost around $3 a meal for a piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, you know, a corn tortilla, and one other thing.” After being criticized online for appearing out of touch, she clarified that $15.64 was the more accurate figure, based on “almost 1,000 simulations,” for “three full square meals and a snack.” (I have some follow-up questions: What’s that “other thing”? And what constitutes a “square” meal?)

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also faced blowback from observers and Democratic politicians this week after suggesting in an interview that “mom and pop” homebuyers are snapping up “five, 10, 12 homes” for retirement. And at a rally in Ohio earlier today, Vice President Vance compared the American economy to a doomed enterprise: “You don’t turn the Titanic around overnight,” he said. Trump has blamed “bad public-relations people” for failing to sell his affordability message—but the problem could also have to do with these sorts of gaffes.

The president’s inconsistent messaging may play a role too. Before the holidays, he held a rally in Pennsylvania as part of his “affordability tour”—an effort to shift Americans’ perspectives on the economy. His address included a digression about why the Democrats’ emphasis on affordability was a “hoax,” how Representative Ilhan Omar “does nothing but bitch,” and why Americans don’t need so many pencils. His speech at the Detroit Economic Club included a few diversions but was overall more targeted. “The Trump economic boom has officially begun,” he said.

Trump is right that the economy is showing signs of health. Unemployment is low, and the stock market is on a tear. But these metrics don’t reveal the whole picture. The economy is adding fewer jobs even as inflation remains under control. The Atlantic contributing writer John Dickerson recently pointed out that “aggregate gains mask uneven distribution, and many workers really are seeing their purchasing power erode.” If Trump’s attempts to interfere with the Federal Reserve’s independence prove successful, they could unleash even more economic uncertainty. “Trump is hardly the first president to cherry-pick numbers and accentuate the positive,” Dickerson wrote. “But his argument is weak because he has to overcome people’s lived experience.”

Despite his constant jabs at his predecessor, Trump is in some sense following in Biden’s footsteps. “Bidenomics” fell flat as a slogan in part because Biden’s rosy view of the economy didn’t connect with voters facing ever-higher inflation. When Trump and his team aren’t shutting down criticism of the economy, they’re simply distracted. Neither communicates to Americans that their struggles are understood.

Here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

There’s a double helix in my local Sephora. It’s roughly the size and shape of a soda can, and it is accompanied by a placard referencing patents and peptides, as if in a science fair. It’s trying to sell me a hair mask.

Online, the company responsible for this display describes itself as a “biology-first haircare brand, powered by biotech.” It practices “biomimetic hairscience,” and, thanks to “a decade of complex research into the bioscience of hair,” has patented a peptide that repairs hair “at a molecular level across multiple types of bonds including polypeptide chains and disulfide bonds.” I have no idea what any of this means. The mask costs $75.

In Princeton, New Jersey, a short stroll from the university you have heard of, there lies a little campus home to the Institute for Advanced Study. It was founded in 1930 not to confer degrees nor—God forbid!—to make money, nor even to conduct research toward any end in particular. The institute proclaims that its purpose is “the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.”

Founder Abraham Flexner reckoned that brilliant minds, once freed to pursue “useless satisfactions,” would stumble upon discoveries of “undreamed-of utility,” as he wrote in a magazine a few years into the institute’s work. It seems to have worked for Albert Einstein, who had an office there. J. Robert Oppenheimer, too.

Enjoy this week’s useless satisfactions. I look forward to your theory of everything the week after.

And by the way, did you know that the vaunted Athenians, inventors of democracy, most commonly selected their political officeholders by chance? Bronze tokens representing the adult men of Athens would be slotted into a carved-stone device called the kleroterion, then dice would be repeatedly dropped into the contraption to rule out tokens until only the number required to hold office remained.

The proper poli-sci term for this is sortition, which also applies to how the United States selects people for jury duty today. But imagine the rest of U.S. democracy working like that: You’re tossing out your junk mail when you notice a letter from the feds—congrats, the big government Plinko board has decided you’re serving one year in Congress. Good luck!

How did you do? Come back tomorrow for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that—speaking of snow monsters—the U.S. State Department in 1959 issued guidance on yeti expeditions? It informed Americans who wished to hunt for the abominable snowman that they would have to comply with certain rules set by Nepal: They needed to pay for a permit, they had to share any photographic evidence they found, and they were allowed to capture the yeti alive but could kill it only “in an emergency arising out of self defence.”

Alas, this did not mean that State officials believed in the monster. Rather, they were trying to show their support for Nepalese sovereignty—and thus keep the country out of the clutches of a boogeyman that scared Americans even more than the yeti: communism.

And by the way, did you know that throughout the history of the Nobel Prizes, there have been years so turbulent that the Peace Prize committee determined not to confer an award, even as other categories went on?

This happened in a few of the interwar years as Nazi Germany rearmed, Italy invaded Ethiopia, and peace generally disintegrated. It was also the case for the years of World War I, with the exception of 1917, when the committee recognized the Red Cross for its humanitarian aid. (All of the Nobel Prizes were suspended during the early years of World War II.)

The circumstances were a bit different in 1948, when the committee ruled that “there was no suitable living candidate.” The clear message was that the award—which by rule cannot be given posthumously—should have gone to Mahatma Gandhi, assassinated earlier that year.</div>

            <h2>What the Greenland Crisis Teaches Europe About Trump</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/greenland-crisis-trump-diplomacy-nato/685715/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Yesterday afternoon, Donald Trump announced that he had “formed the framework of a future deal” with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, raising hopes in Europe that the Greenland crisis may have reached an end. The framework reportedly respects Denmark’s sovereignty over Greenland and focuses instead on beefing up America’s military presence in the territory, reaching a deal on crucial minerals, and increasing cooperation on both Arctic security and Trump’s Golden Dome missile-defense system.

The worst of the crisis may have passed, at least for now. But the past few days underscore the extraordinary stakes of a debate among Europe’s leaders that remains unresolved. Should they take a conciliatory approach toward Trump, in the hope of coaxing him to their side? Or should they stand firm when he threatens them, imposing costs on him even if it means risking their relationship with his administration?

The lesson that Europe is likely to draw from the past year—and particularly from the Greenland fiasco—is that it must do both. It needs Trump whisperers who will flatter him, but it also needs to pack its velvet gloves with steel. If Europe’s leaders only praise him, Trump is likely to ignore them when convenient, rip up any deals they have made, and take whatever he can when the opportunity arises. If they show only toughness, they risk prompting him to withdraw from NATO or rupture the transatlantic alliance in other ways.

Vivian Salama: Trump wants to be the new Polk

The past week helps demonstrate these dynamics. Just a few days ago, Trump refused to rule out the use of force in taking Greenland, and he promised to impose tariffs on eight countries that recently sent troops to the territory for a security mission, even though the deployment had been fully coordinated with the U.S. military. Then, in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos yesterday morning, Trump lambasted Europe: “If it wasn’t for us, you’d all be speaking German and a little bit of Japanese perhaps.” He reiterated his argument that “no nation or group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States.” “That’s our territory,” he claimed. But he disavowed the use of force, saying instead that he wanted to acquire Greenland through “immediate negotiations.”

This was seen as a major concession, but it prompted further questions. What happens when Denmark refuses to transfer ownership? Will force be back on the table? Senator Lindsey Graham, who had been meeting with European officials in Davos, stoked further anxiety with a social-media post soon after Trump’s speech, in which he demanded that Denmark give the United States the legal title to Greenland.

Just an hour after his speech, however, Trump rescinded his tariff threat and announced that the aforementioned framework had been reached. The New York Times reported that European officials had discussed granting America sovereignty over Greenland’s U.S. military bases. But a European official with direct knowledge of the negotiations—and who was not authorized to speak publicly—told me this was not part of the deal.

If the framework sticks, it will be a triumph of Danish diplomacy. For the past year, Copenhagen has offered to work with the Trump administration on all of its policy demands. But it imposed two red lines and never wavered: The Danes wouldn’t compromise on territorial integrity or Greenland’s right to self-determination. Otherwise, though, the president had wide latitude to get what he wanted.

Many other European leaders, by contrast, have responded to Trump’s repeated bullying over the past year with nearly unconditional accommodation and praise, while working behind the scenes to moderate his policies. They agreed to his demands to increase their defense spending to 5 percent of their GDP. Their response to his tariffs last year was minimal. Rutte, the NATO leader, even called Trump Europe’s “daddy.”

This soft approach is easy to ridicule, but the Europeans have been able to point to some successes since deploying it. Trump stopped talking about leaving NATO. He agreed to sell weapons to Ukraine and provide intelligence support. And the approach prepared the way for yesterday’s announcement that Rutte himself had been the one to broker the deal with Trump that defused the crisis.

The framework appears to respect Copenhagen’s red lines, which raises the question: Why did Trump suggest he would finally agree to it? After all, it was on offer for most of the past year.

The main answer is that Denmark made clear that it was not going to back down in negotiations, leaving Trump with few options. If he had used force in Greenland, he could find himself in a war with one of America’s closest allies. Such a war would be clearly illegal under U.S. law, and it could trigger a civil-military crisis, presenting military officers with plainly unlawful orders.

Other European countries also played a key role in increasing the potential costs of Trump’s aggression. The European Union agreed to impose $93 billion tariffs on the U.S. if the ones Trump had threatened actually took effect. And some leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, suggested using the Anti-Coercion Instrument, also known as the European “bazooka,” which allows for a unified trade-policy response to coercive behavior like Trump’s. The Europeans were divided on invoking the instrument; some worried that Trump might escalate and pull out of NATO altogether. But their serious discussion of it suggested to the president that he might run a genuine risk.

And then there were the financial markets. According to Treasury Department data, EU members and NATO allies hold more than $3.31 trillion in U.S. debt—more than triple what China holds. On Tuesday, the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year bond reached its highest level since August, sparking concern that investors would sell off U.S. Treasuries if Trump escalated the conflict.

Moreover, the prospect of controlling Greenland is deeply unpopular among Americans. One poll conducted earlier this month found that 75 percent of them oppose any attempt to take over the territory. And more than a dozen Republican senators made public statements warning against it.

The Greenland crisis was in many ways the sum of Europeans’ fears about Trump, raising the specter of an attack on a NATO ally and the dissolution of the alliance. For the moment, the crisis seems to have been averted. But Trump is too fickle a negotiator for Europe to take comfort in yesterday’s announcement. To keep him from reescalating or threatening them on other issues in the future, they may well follow some advice from an unlikely source: J. D. Vance.

“I think a lot of European nations were right about our invasion of Iraq,” Vance said last year. “Frankly, if the Europeans had been a little more independent, and a little more willing to stand up, then maybe we could have saved the entire world from the strategic disaster that was the American-led invasion of Iraq.” Vance continued, “I don’t want the Europeans to just do whatever the Americans tell them to do. I don’t think it’s in their interest, and I don’t think it’s in our interests, either.”</div>

Even before the legendary gunslinger Wild Bill Hickok was shot dead holding aces and eights at a Deadwood poker table, the practice of gambling—as a pastime and an enterprise—has been bound up in American identity.

But for as long as some Americans have loved gambling, others have judged it. All of the cockfighters, lottery participants, and sailors throwing scrimshaw dice had to work around the ethical code imposed by Quakers, Shakers, and Puritans who vehemently opposed these games of chance. Gambling has been intermittently banned throughout this country’s history. (By the 1830s, lotteries were banned outright in most states.) The result was a certain cultural ambivalence: Gambling was widespread despite being morally out-of-bounds. It was even once a part of American politics—in the 19th century, before the advent of reliable polling, people would place public bets on electoral outcomes as a form of electioneering.

The critics took a variety of approaches. In the December 1907 issue of The Atlantic, the Unitarian minister Charles F. Dole argued that “the long and costly experience of mankind bears uniform testimony against gambling, till at last the verdict of civilization has become as nearly unanimous as human judgment can be that it is an intolerable nuisance.” Even the humble church raffle, he proposed, flirts with an inherent moral danger: “We have no right to expect to receive when we give no equivalent return.”

In the April 1962 issue, Robert F. Kennedy condemned gambling not for its moral valence but for its inevitable connection to organized crime. His view was that the factory worker filling out a basketball parlay card at a local lunch counter was in some sense complicit. “Once the housewife, the factory worker, or the business executive gives money to a local bookie or policy writer, it disappears into the pocket of the underworld figure, who is in business to cheat the government—and his customer, if he can,” wrote Kennedy. In a 2010 story, Thomas Sugrue framed gambling as an engine of social inequity, taking aim at the ubiquity of contemporary state-sponsored lotteries. (Most states now run their own lotteries, which send revenues back to local government budgets.) Sugrue saw them as preying on a “great American pathological co-dependency, namely the desperation of tens of millions of mostly working-class folks to escape their financial insecurity.”

Since the emergence of COVID, gambling has only become more accessible. Mobile sports betting took off in 2020; research from last year suggested that nearly half of men under 50 have an account with an online sports book. And prediction markets now enable bets on almost anything. Will Donald Trump acquire Greenland? Will Paul Thomas Anderson finally win the Academy Award for Best Director? Will Jesus return? If it can be formulated as a yes-or-no question, you can probably bet on it. And the fact that it’s all available on demand only makes it easier to lose your shirt.

Gambling is no longer confined to casinos, horse tracks, or backroom card games. It’s everywhere—in restaurant chains and gas stations, Super Bowl ads and video games. This has created new temptations, particularly for the young people now being coaxed into putting their weekly allowance toward randomized Call of Duty loot boxes and Polymarket wagers. To be sure, there is something predatory about the ways in which companies are now “working really hard to separate young guys from their money,” as the writer Max Read put it on the Galaxy Brain podcast. But the integration of online gambling into daily life also builds on a push-pull that has existed for centuries: the rush of risking it all, and the nagging intuition that it might be better not to.</div>

            <h2>Trump Casually Denigrates NATO’s War Dead</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-22</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Benni Schmidt Pedersen lives on a small farm in Denmark, where it’s quiet and he can hear if anyone is coming down the gravel road to his home. He’s stricken with PTSD from his time as a soldier in Afghanistan, where five members of his 130-person company died in the American-led war against the Taliban.

I called him today to read him a quote from President Trump about America’s NATO allies: “We’ve never needed them,” Trump said in a Fox Business interview at the World Economic Forum, in Davos. “We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan or this or that. And they did. They stayed a little back, little off the front lines.&quot;

First Pedersen laughed. Then he tried to brush it off—classic Trump bluster. “Why doesn’t it surprise me that he’s saying that?”

Finally, his voice dropped an octave. “That’s bullshit,” he said.

It is, indeed, bullshit. The United States invoked Article 5, the mutual-defense clause of NATO’s founding charter, the day after the September 11 attacks. It remains the only time in NATO’s nearly 80-year history that the obligation of common defense has been activated. All 28 members of the alliance at the time sent soldiers to Afghanistan. Many never returned.

An estimated 3,500 soldiers from NATO countries died in Afghanistan. The United States suffered the most losses in absolute terms: Nearly 2,500 U.S. service members were killed in the 20-year war. But per capita, Denmark suffered even more severe losses, burying 43 soldiers in a population, at the time, of about 5.5 million.

Other NATO members sacrificed, too. Britain lost about 450 soldiers, Canada more than 150. Other small countries, like Denmark, weren’t spared: Estonia lost nine soldiers. Norway, 10. Czech Republic, 14. Romania, 27.

Why does this matter now? Because Trump has been disparaging Europe’s contributions to NATO, and Denmark’s in particular, as he threatened to take over part of the Nordic country’s territory. Yesterday, he avoided doing what many feared he might. He told an audience in Davos that he wouldn’t use military force to acquire his coveted Greenland, which would have put an abrupt end to the alliance. But he made his disdain for NATO clear: “The United States is treated very unfairly by NATO. I want to tell you that. When you think about it, nobody can dispute it. We give so much, and we get so little in return.”

That prompted a bit of fact-checking by NATO’s secretary-general, Mark Rutte. Privately, Rutte met with Trump and convinced him to accept a framework for negotiations that could see an enhanced U.S. military presence on Greenland as well as stepped-up NATO efforts in the broader Arctic region. Both are options that Denmark and other alliance members have been open to, and in fact encouraged, all along. In a public portion of their meeting, Rutte challenged Trump’s account of NATO’s steadfastness. “There is one thing I heard you say yesterday and today. You were not absolutely sure that the Europeans would come to the rescue of the U.S. if you will be attacked,” Rutte told Trump. “Let me tell you, they will. And they did in Afghanistan.”

Rutte continued: “For every two Americans who paid the ultimate price, there was one soldier from another NATO country who did not come back to his family.”

Trump, whose bone-spurs diagnosis in 1968 made him exempt from service in Vietnam, seems not to have taken kindly to the history lesson. So he offered his own, make-believe history of NATO activity in Afghanistan, in an interview with Fox’s Maria Bartiromo. The notion that soldiers from NATO allies “stayed a little back, little off the front lines” is false, Pedersen, the Danish veteran, told me. He deployed in 2010, the deadliest year for NATO forces, with some 700 fatalities. (Trump was hosting two seasons of his Apprentice TV series that year and toying publicly with a presidential bid.)

Pedersen’s company worked in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan. Five of the company’s members were killed, including Sophia Bruun, the first female soldier to die in combat in Danish history, whose service I wrote about last week. Seventy-eight were injured, Pedersen said. They faced off with Taliban fighters nearly every other day.

“We were on the front lines, the same as the Americans,” he said. “That was our job.”</div>

After about 30 mins I need to stand up , stretch, maybe take a short walk around the office or the house, otherwise I just get uncomfortable with very occasional leg cramp.

Not a great attention span, mate. Or if your work is not engaging, find a new job.

Yeah, disruptions at work were a big problem for me at one point. Now I got into a working routine where for every non-meeting hour I spend 50 minutes doing focused work, 5 minutes replying to messages and 5 minutes recharging. My teammates got used to it pretty quickly and my managers got convinced when they saw how much actual value I started delivering in exchange for longer response time.

Or maybe I&#39;m just better at it than you and don&#39;t have sit staring blankly at a screen for hours to get work done. Plus a short walk often helps with thinking about problems, maybe give it a try sometime instead of sitting next to that empty pizza box and coke can.

Thinking about problems is great if you&#39;ve got a though one and need some mental space to solve it. But while you walk, you don&#39;t actually solve any problems - you just think about it.

Perhaps it&#39;s your personality trait or just the kind of work you do, that you can or prefer thinking over doing. Some of us, most notably the autistic spectrum people can get super excited when thinking about a problem but their enthusiasm quickly dwindles when they&#39;ve found a solution and it&#39;s time to implement it. I believe

Who would have thought that doing brain-engaging things is better for you than just sitting idle. Sitting is just means to an end. Did we really need a study for this?

It happens all the time, somebody does some eyecatching behavioral study and it makes the rounds as the next new fascinating thing that &#39;science&#39; has discovered, and then subsequent studies fail to replicate or find it was only true for a certain subpopul

I&#39;m not sitting idly, I&#39;m entering power-saving mode, you insensitive clod!

You&#39;re dying a little bit every day you sit on your butt impairing your circulation which in turn compromises the blood supply to your brain.

No article should make you think that a clever made up term like &quot;active sitting&quot; is in any way healthy.   A healthy mind and body is one that is not sitting around but out and about engaging with the real world physically.

Basically, people sift through data trying to find &quot;relationships&quot; without giving too much construction on the actual knowledge behind these.

So, a lot of &quot;discoveries&quot; of correlations, not a lot of effort to explain the causative links.

Sad, really, but enhanced by the publish-or-perish crap.

Not &quot;construction&quot;, auto-carrot, &quot;consideration to&quot;. Or something similar.

Especially true for the younger researchers, who are very much stuck on &quot;AI&quot;, but not limited to them.

classism and greed are destroying our institutions and our societies, all you selfish irresponsible elites are wrecking everything for everybody

it appears to me that you&#39;re just in denial about how deep corruption is in our institutions; patronism, cronyism and nepotism are obviously the main factors affecting financial and institutional &#39;success&#39;

it&#39;s not what one does, it&#39;s who one knows

if hoarding wealth and power are success, then sure, the entitled upper class is successful

When you can&#39;t dispute the claim, you attack the credibility of those making it

Everyone can see how corrupt, institutionalized and self serving academia and science have become and how most our &#39;schools&#39; are just there so the teachers and the staff can earn comfortable upper middle class salaries. Clearly the road to success is in having the right connections. It&#39;s not just academia of course, classism has corrupted and perverted our entire society and only the overly affluent deny how unethical and unfair

you just resent that some people are more enlightened and intelligent than you and we know when people are unethical and we call it out

of course, unethical people resent being exposed for the frauds they are, clearly all these upper class freeloaders are heading straight for hell, sadly they&#39;re wrecking everything for everybody as they go. it&#39;s easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the gates of heaven

all thanks to selfish and irresponsible fascist fundamentali

sadly the decline of civilization is no joking matter, billions will suffer and die because of the unethical behavior of the greedy, the selfish and the irresponsible

Tell us which part of DEI you hate: Is it the diversity, equity, or inclusion?

The problem with scientists&#39; careers is the expectations to make great discoveries. Science doesn&#39;t work like that. You may spend 20 years running experiments and crunching numbers and make a handful of mediocre observations at best. Then, one day, if you&#39;re extremely lucky and all the stars align, you may discover something more  valuable when sitting on the sofa in the evening doing nothing. Still no guarantees that it&#39;s going to be anything big. Maybe 3 out of 10. Perhaps 4.

Meanwhile, all the young people want to be superstars from day 1 these days. And, of course, AI only enables to spin more bullshit to big themselves up instead of accepting that their career may ultimately amount to nothing at all.

I&#39;ll assume the &quot;current AI&quot; is LLM based. Why would anyone expect it to make new discoveries of intellectual depth. All its doing is rearranging the deck chairs, there&#39;s nothing deep about that. It can do it faster than humans, I suppose there&#39;s that.

As someone above noted, most scientists are in trenches mining salt (my paraphrase). To put it in a different light, most science is pushing current theories a bit farther, or figuring out new consequences of current theories; they are not discovering new theo

Even Intel, after years of decline, can&#39;t keep up.

I&#39;m not a person who denies the usefulness of AI. But there is a ton of garbage ideas out there that will never pan out. But in the short term, all those garbage-AI-idea startups are still needing lots of computers and chips. But a whole lot of them will go out of business, leaving behind perfectly good hardware that can be bought up at fire sale prices. Let the good times roll, because soon, they&#39;ll be a distant memory.

I forecast Intel will belly up when the AI bubble crash depresses the entire IT industry.

That is unless The Orange One wants the gov&#39;t to own even more of Intel: socialism, wooopyy!

However, the backlog of people who want to buy PC&#39;s but delay due to high prices may actually give Intel a boost after the crash, as people start buying regular equipment again.

Someone will buy it. That sheer volume of IP and physical assets wont simply slip below the waves, someone will acquire it. I mean shit, Intel actually has Fabs. No doubt debt levered to hell and back, but Fabs none the less. My guess is Nvidia would be eyeing it off hungrily, and so would AMD, although AMD would face serious regulatory hurdles being that such an acquisition would create a true monopoly.

Even Intel, after years of decline, can&#39;t keep up.All fabs (TSMC, Intel, Samsung, etc.) have a fixed number of wafers they can produce per hour.  Most of those wafers already have customer contracts (and most of Intel&#39;s fabs customers are Intel itself, but it is still a customer).  Building new fabs takes time (and billions of dollars), and most companies do not build until they have predictions and commitments of future customers (an entirely new fab that has no customers can be a $20B white elephant).  The AI demand (bubble) was not predicted with enough

Even Intel, after years of decline, can&#39;t keep up.I dunno about that. If they can get yields up on 18A, that would, unquestioningly, place them quite a ways beyond what *anybody* else is doing right now. Shit, they&#39;re basically already there, it seems. Until I read this, I didn&#39;t even know it was fabbed yet, all I knew was that it was theoretical, but here they are, and apparently the newer core processors already in the hands of some OEMs are built on it, so it&#39;s already well past that.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?...

Presumably he&#39;s talking about their supply from TSMC.  TSMC are, of course, overtaxed on every front.

At this point, no advanced lithography fab has any measurable excess capability.

Intel uses TSMC for the compute tiles on their latest consumer CPUs (Arrow Lake).  Panther Lake is on 18A but is (for now) relatively low-volume.  Their latest datacentre CPUs (Granite Rapids) still use internal Intel processes (Intel 3).

There are not yet any datacentre products on 18A, and their may not be until the limited release of Diamond Rapids on 18A or 18A-P.

Maybe that was a bad idea in the face of rapidly growing demand.

There&#39;s a pattern here. Today&#39;s &quot;server&quot; becomes tomorrow&#39;s must have home personal computer.

They should bring back the guys in the bunny suits while they&#39;re at it!

18A isn&#39;t used in any current Intel datacentre products.  Their latest datacentre CPU is Granite Rapids on Intel 3.  The only CPU/SoC on 18A so far is Panther Lake, which is a mobile SoC.

            <div id="article-text">The US government has made its position clear.  It&#39;s absolute folly for non-US organizations to rely on US tech products or services.

Is that before Miller and Rubio invade Greenland?

The damage to the USA&#39;s international reputation is humongous - you guys are now a rogue nation.

Saying sorry under President Jasmine would be a start.

la Presidenta could get up tomorrow morning, see that he didn&#39;t get the promised prize in his box of cereal, and decide that he absolutely had to have Iceland after all. Okay, so he mixes up Iceland and Greenland (see his Davos speech....BEFORE you have lunch), is that any reason to take him seriously?

They go back largely because MS will give them deep discounts. MS has four decades of experience of undercutting potential competition with loss leaders and similar tactics. The motives then were largely that open source represented significant savings, but now it&#39;s about data and technology sovereignty.

The problem is that it is not actually the crazy one that is the problem. All he did was make the actual problem obvious. Without him, the problem stays and cannot easily be ignored again.

Added to that, it isn&#39;t that Europe cannot trust la Presidenta, it is that they now realize they cannot trust Americans. If Americans are stupid enough to put that oaf in the White House, how can Europe be confident Americans will not do something similarly stupid in the future. How can any country make an agreement with the U.S. and have any confidence the U.S. will uphold their part? What does an agreement even mean if it is only an agreement for America to hit them over the head with a smaller stick? Any interaction with the U.S. is now being treated by the U.S. as some sort of transaction. See la Presidenta&#39;s speech at Davos, he wants Iceland or Greenland (he gets confused, hint la Presidenta: volcanoes are not rare earth elements) because the U.S. single-handledly defeated Nazi Germany. Oh? And the Europeans and Russians had nothing to do with it?

More deeply, la Presidenta has shown just how brittle the American system of governance is. The Republicans drop their pants for him if he even hints at the notion. The Supreme Court has been taken over by Nazis. The judicial system is being corrupted by his judicial nominations and the R&#39;s in Congress are just potty with that. He nominated Emil Bove who has to be one of the most corrupted lawyers in the country. And that moron from Iowa, Charles Grassley, determined he was &quot;honorable&quot;. Pathetic.

It is clear that Americans do not value democracy or freedom or human rights anymore. And it is now becoming clearer that a major segment of the pop. never did.

Within the next few years most European countries are having elections, and in many of those alt.right, Putin-friendly populists are in pole position (Hungary, Italy and Slovakia are already lost; the UK, France and possibly Germany are on the way). So we&#39;ll soon prove we Europeans are just as stupid. In a worst case scenario Ukraine is toast, the EU dissolves, and there&#39;s war again.

To be fair, the EU has its share of stupidity too. The UK and brexit, Poland, Hungary. At least it can control some of that stuff, and isn&#39;t likely to go to war over territory with any of them.

Indeed. But many people struggle to move away from something they think they know.

This is a spectacular idea.
Europe needs to go its own way into oblivion without any further US support.Did you get your Trump phone yet?

Raspberry Pi .... the most sold computer in history. .... around 70 million computers.  An UK product following the steps of BBC Micro.  And the last 500+ model is a really capable desktop machine, just it is not full of bloated software and/or services not needed.

And RiscV CPUs are becoming very capable also.  ARM is from England also, and there is a lot of capable people around all Europe that can design what it is needed.  In fact, the machines TSMC uses to create their magical chips are made in the Netherlands.  Neither China nor the US have that level of capacity.

Maybe each set of related countries must have enough capacity for not to be anchored in other set of countries.  They can interchange things, but not to use their products to force others to follow their political points of view.

We here in Latin America lack such level of technology, but we are delighted to see that we have &quot;alternatives&quot; in other parts of the planet.  Not every good mind lives in the US, Europe, Orient ... they are around all the planet.  And why not to le them grow?  Why to starve the development capability of any country just because there are de-facto standard that are property of very few companies or countries?
>p>

Also, ASML could just stop selling to US chipmakers... that&#39;d get some attention.

Intel, Texas Instruments, GlobalFoundries, Analog Devices - just to name a few.

We are now a fucking pariah. The Iraq war also made us a pariah, but not in the commercial sense. Donnie just had to be the strongly top-most pariah ever seen in USA history, believe me!

Our Constitution strongly needs to shore up checks & balances on the Prez. Amendments could pass if GOP is embarrassed enough after Don&#39;s reign to try to patch relations with the world & voters; then Congress could get the 2/3 votes needed. Fairly unlikely, but not unrealistic.

Our Constitution strongly needs to shore up checks & balances on the Prez.Our Constitution already has checks and balances on Presidential overreach.  What we have is the perfect storm of both houses of Congress with a majority that refuses to do anything against the Orange Idiot, a DoJ that has a sycophant that also refuses to prosecute obvious violations and instead is seeking to punish past foes, and a Supreme Court that is predisposed to lean conservative or look away at obvious violations.However, even MAGA is getting tired of broken promises, flagrant violations of the rule

Lol, when some ruzzkies try to justify bombing Ukraine, they say &quot;hey, Ukraine, you said you wanted to get rid of Soviet inheritance, now we&#39;re doing it for you&quot;, confusing on purpose the &quot;Soviet inheritance&quot; of the NKVD, Golodomor, totalitarian oppression and the persecution of the 50s and the zastoy era to mean the things Ukrainians built there themselves.

Just like them, you yap about &quot;returning&quot; shit to the us without considering even for a moment that the android is to a considerable extent Linux, a &quot;product&quot; of Finland, that most of the hardware is manufactured in Asia on machinery made in Holland, etc. and that your attempt to show the supposed untenability of the EP actually shows how dumb your government is.

Not very smart, your maga lot, but so very Soviet.

If Europe wants to release a decent Linux phone free from the colonial oppression of US tech giants then sign me up and ship to Australia. :)

I don&#39;t use anything from Microsoft, Facebook, Instagram or Apple.  No Amazon, Netflix, Paypal or eBay accounts.  I do have an Android phone, alas, but I&#39;m not really dependent on Google for anything.  I have a few offline games and other than that, it&#39;s just texting and calls.  My next phone will be an open-source one.

As for email and calendar, I am de-Googled  [skoll.ca].  Basically, all the big American tech firms could disappear tomorrow and my personal computing environment wouldn&#39;t notice.  (There&#39;d be worldwid

Most US tech CEOs have strong antipathy to anything like the EU.  Musk, Thiel, Bezos, Ellison, Zuckerberg... they all hate the idea of voters and government actually having a say in anything that doesn&#39;t align with their financial interests.

Out of the frying pan and into the fire . . .

What makes these headlines so frustrating is that becoming independent would be trivial if deciders had some basic knowledge about computers and digital networks, what exactly those do and how they work. We&#39;re taking 5th grade level of knowledge here.

Because that isn&#39;t the case, we have huge portions of society and politicians who think this computer thing only works if you spend astronomical amounts of taxpayer money on completely superfluous licenses for trashy software.

Yes that is my opinion and why I&#39;m not hopeful on an EU Linux replacing US software stacks.   Or at least it happening in the UK where I am from.

You get the usual directors/managers put in at the higher levels of government who know absolutely nothing about software/computers. Instead of actually being worth their high salaries and putting together (hence managing) a team of experienced open source developers/sysadmins - to create a stack that meets public sector requirements (e.g. a way to manage look+feel

What the EU needs to think about isn&#39;t the components.  They need to think about the entire ecosystem.  You can make new hardware, new apps, but that is going to go nowhere without an entire ecosystem to go with it.

Starting out, lets look at an ISA like RISC-V.  ARM maybe another good one, but we need to start with an architecture that is decent.  Maybe something with more registers like the Itanium if possible.  Now, Europe needs to make multiple fabs.  I&#39;d say a 2-3nm process node to get the ball rolling.

I know that SAP (probably Europes biggest software developer) are working on sovereign cloud for their services https://www.sap.com/products/s... [sap.com]. But if you look at all of the things that we take for granted today IT service wise from the US, really Europe are currently barely scratching the surface. For sure we need to be independent, but we are really only just starting on that journey.

If EU member nations want regional &quot;digital sovereignty&quot; then they ought to resist the urge to sell out to someone else.  China is more than happy to offer its (admittedly quite janky) hardware and software solutions.

            <div id="article-text">This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

Over the past few weeks, previously unthinkable horrors have unfolded in Minnesota as federal agents working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement have shot Renee Nicole Good in the head, killing her, and arrested a 5-year-old boy just as he was arriving home from school. Erin Maye Quade is a Minnesota state senator who has now witnessed countless instances of federal agents arresting and detaining her constituents. This week, Maye Quade decided it was time to put out a blunt warning for the rest of America in the form of a TikTok video: “There may be people outside of Minnesota who are thinking: When this comes to my state, I’m white, or a U.S. citizen, or I live in a suburb or rural area, or a neighborhood with few or no immigrants, and this is something I won’t experience or see,” the senator said. “I’m here to dispel that myth for you. That is not the case.”

Maye Quade, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Apple Valley, emphasized just how ubiquitous immigration enforcement has become across rural, suburban, and urban Minnesota. ICE presence is so large it surpasses the number of local law enforcement members in the state’s 10 largest metro areas combined. These agents are not working from an organized list of known immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully, let alone a judicial warrant; instead they are operating at random. Maye Quade says she’s observed agents just driving around her town “looking for kidnappings of opportunity,” which she described as agents idling their cars and simply waiting for Black, brown, or Asian Americans to walk by, as they take out the trash, walk their dog, or run into a gas station. “They will swarm that person, kidnap them, and take them away.”

Maye Quade realized she should use what she has witnessed to warn her colleagues in other states, along with friends and family who don’t live in Minnesota. Her video has garnered more than 3 million views. “It sounds like a wartime diary,” Maye Quade said in an interview with Slate, but it wasn’t only that the senator gave a no-frills, boots-on-the-ground perspective that drew so much attention to her video. It was the fact that she simultaneously was offering advice on how to deal with federal immigration agents when they come to your town.

Two days after Maye Quade posted her TikTok, the Department of Homeland Security announced it had launched “Operation Catch of the Day” in Maine, the latest state to face an onslaught of federal agents. I asked Maye Quade what advice she would give residents there and across the country as they begin to deal with federal immigration agents.

“The first thing is to either put together your constitutional observer training now, or reach out to folks in Minnesota to get that training.”

That’s a reference to the Handbook for Constitutional Observers, a project by the advocacy groups Immigrant Defense Network and COPAL. It was created in response to Donald Trump’s second term in office and offers guidelines on how to legally observe and document law enforcement interactions and inform people about their civil rights and due process. Francisco Segovia, executive director of COPAL, explained that this training is specifically designed for folks who are not directly impacted by the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement, but who can still participate in helping educate people about their constitutional rights.

In Minnesota, Maye Quade explained that communities organized themselves by zones or regions, and established Signal chats to communicate about federal immigration activity. Participants were each assigned a role; some were in charge of vetting people who want to join the group, while others were assigned to commute around the community and report on any immigration enforcement activity. Local mutual aid networks were also stood up to ensure those impacted by federal agents’ immigration enforcement actions had food, medicine, rides to work and school, and safety patrols around them.

“DOPA forms—delegation of parental authority.”

This is a document that gives someone authority to take care of a child when their parents or guardians cannot, for up to one year. The designated adult can make decisions about a child’s care, custody, and medical treatment, but it does not give permission for adoption or marriage. The DOPA form does not take away a parent or guardian’s ability to make decisions for their child. Having this prepared in advance can ensure a child is taken care of in a worst-case scenario, as Maye Quade recounted instances of parents shouting out the names of their children and their school while being arrested by federal agents in hopes that someone will help them.

“Have whistles with you in your car and keep your cellphone charged.”

Maye Quade reaffirmed that it is not illegal to record a federal agent. However, if you do happen to encounter an arrest, it’s important to understand that agents don’t usually differentiate between protestors and observers. Anyone who happens to be around can be targeted, with the senator emphasizing that you should close your car vents and turn off the heat in case you are pepper-sprayed or tear-gassed. It’s also a good idea to keep water or saline spray with you, as both can help remove pepper spray from the eyes.

“Businesses should get very familiar with what their legal rights are.”

Businesses should understand when they have the legal authority to keep people off their private property and how they can enforce a code of conduct. Maye Quade also suggested businesses be prepared for an I-9 audit, when federal agents inspect whether a business has confirmed their workers’ identities and work authorizations. This process does not require a warrant, but agents have to give employers at least three days’ notice.

Here, Maye Quade also emphasized that businesses should become familiar with federal agents’ tactics. In one case, “they used a ruse of a pretend car crash in the parking lot to lure a day care worker out of her house,” she said, while in other instances federal agents have asked passersby for help outside businesses only to arrest them instead.

“The people that are being taken are like us.”

Despite the Trump administration’s insistence that federal agents are targeting “the worst of the worst,” immigrants who have committed crimes or are in the U.S. without permanent legal status, that is not what Maye Quade has witnessed in Minnesota. U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and people who have been legally admitted into the country are all being targeted right now. “It’s literally just anyone who’s Black, brown, or Asian. Most of them have status and have broken no law,” she said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

As masked men dressed for war surrounded the car my friend Patty and I sat in, all I could think about were the moments that had led to my neighbor Renee Good’s death. “I’m not mad at you,” she had told her killer. These agents, who I had to assume were from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (they never identified themselves), were already banging on our windows and recording us. Then they pepper-sprayed the intake vent of the car. They were definitely mad at us.

“You’re under arrest!” the agents yelled. Terrified, I thrust my hands in the air and waited for instruction. They did not give me any—instead, they shattered our windows and pulled me out. I was roughly handcuffed and shoved into the back of an unmarked Subaru.

I was a recent volunteer to the neighborhood group that had organized to observe and report ICE after Operation Metro Surge began here in Minnesota weeks ago. The efforts had only increased since Good’s killing. In community chats, suspected ICE sightings are reported, their license plates checked against a constantly updated public spreadsheet. If they are confirmed, people in cars drive to the scene to record what the agents are doing and warn people that ICE is in the area with car horns and whistles. Recording, a legally protected action, occurs on public streets.

Most of the time, commuting (as it’s known in activist circles) is boring. You typically drive in circles around familiar streets. Volunteer dispatchers will help coordinate where people should go, but usually they just recommend sticking around areas with lots of brown people: restaurants, community centers, the kinds of places that make Minneapolis vital. Commuting has become so popular as of late that it’s common to hear a dispatcher request that listeners “please leave the call if you are not actively commuting.” Signal calls have limited space.

Occasionally, though, commuting is terrifying. “Have y’all not learned?” an agent provocatively asks a legal observer in a video that’s been circulating among volunteers, two days after Good was killed. Her response, “What’s our lesson here?,” angers him, and he tries to snatch her phone. Agents have also been known to follow commuters to their homes to intimidate them, which means “He’s following me to my house” has become another common refrain on the Signal chat. One time, I suggested that a woman on a call drive to a nearby gas station to meet me because an ICE vehicle was idling outside her home and she was audibly terrified.

I ended up in ICE custody shortly after beginning a commute on Jan. 11. Someone in our neighborhood chat had reported that ICE vehicles were pepper-spraying an observer. Patty and I, not far away, drove there. I was keenly aware of Good’s death when we arrived on the scene—it had been just four days and was a six-minute drive from where she was killed. This was the first time I had ever seen ICE agents in my life (I wasn’t joking when I said some commuter shifts are boring), and that’s when they pepper-sprayed the interior of our car and hauled us out of it. By the time the agents shoved me into that unmarked SUV, three minutes and 30 seconds had elapsed. We didn’t understand why we were being taken in: We hadn’t blocked their cars or done anything beyond routine observing.

Patty, separated from me, was subject to humiliation on her drive in. They called her ugly, took pictures of her, and referred to Renee Good as “that lesbian bitch.” They took us both to the Whipple Federal Building, a place where, the day before, three local lawmakers had been denied access. They had been trying to ascertain the conditions within. As I was being processed, shackled, and led into a cell, I wondered if I would be able to report to the outside world what it was like in there.

In a bare yellow cell, I tried to sleep, but when I closed my eyes, I could hear screaming and crying from deeper inside the facility. My requests to use the bathroom or to drink water were routinely ignored, met only after I banged on the one-way glass in my cell and begged agents directly.

I saw other detainees only when I was finally able to go to the bathroom—presumably, they were the other people that ICE was here to hunt. The looks on their faces horrified me. Through observation glass, I saw more than a dozen people crammed into a cell, seemingly lacking energy. They stared at the ground or at the wall. They didn’t talk to one another. One man pushed his face up against the one-way glass, either trying to see out or just desperate for any kind of stimulation.

Elsewhere, I saw a woman, through an observation glass, using the bathroom. She wore a garment to preserve her modesty, but that could not protect her from three leering agents who stood watching her, making small talk and laughing. She cried on the toilet.

I was lucky—after the eight hours I spent in custody, I was released with no charges. It helped that I had a lawyer, Emanual Williams, whom my family contacted as they tried to piece together what had happened to me.

After I got out, I called Williams to thank him. I asked him if it was difficult to come speak with me. Legal counsel is supposed to always be allowed in the building, even when it’s closed. He told me that things are changing at Whipple. “We’ve started to see a process that’s more dangerous towards U.S. citizens being detained, receiving charges, and being transported to federal jails,” he said.

Often, whether someone in custody gets to see their lawyer simply depends on who is working that day. “Some people at the door have said it’s not possible to see someone unless someone has retained us,” Williams said. “One time, I drove up to the guard post outside of the Whipple building, and they told me it was closed. One of the postmen—I think they were part of the police team—approached my vehicle with pepper spray.”

A video of the arrest of my cellmate, a legal resident named Dennis, shows his body being bent forward into an unmarked van as two agents try to force him in. Dennis’ face is placid. A third agent, trying to be helpful, gropes for pepper spray on his tactical vest.

“Do you want me to spray you?” he demands, thrusting it an inch from Dennis’ eye.

“Don’t spray him, don’t fucking spray him,” the agent in the front of the car scolds his partner, swatting the pepper spray away from Dennis’ face.

“I told him, ‘Go ahead,’ ” Dennis had said to me in our cell, laughing.

Patty and I weren’t the only ones detained for trying to alert people to ICE’s presence and filming agents. We’ve since met four others who had similar experiences. I was never charged with a crime; I now assume that my detention was meant to stop me from recording ICE officers.

The effort to intimidate observers continues, but they haven’t been discouraged. Minneapolis is so organized in its observer responses that increasingly, the agency has spread its activities to the surrounding area, where there aren’t as many residents mobilized, alerted to their presence, and filming them. ICE officers don’t want people to see what they’re doing, which is why it’s more important than ever to document it. My arresting agent stole my whistle. After I got out, I bought a pack of 24 more.

The version of Spencer Pittman visible to the world on social media, at least until last month, was familiar to anyone who has lived in a very Christian part of the country. Pittman, on his Instagram account, posted photos of himself in a baseball uniform in high school and college, action shots on the diamond, and off-field photos of more casual moments with captions such as “God is good. Thankful for my teammates.” On X, he chronicled his college career as an outfielder for Coahoma Community College in western Mississippi, posting his game schedules, his personal records in the gym, and videos of his training captioned with scripture passages. With his gym clothes, cross necklace, floppy hair, and singular fixation on linking all of his efforts and successes to his faith, the 19-year-old Pittman looked like the archetype of the Southern Christian sports bro. In a note accompanying one video of batting practice from late 2024, he wrote: “If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Romans 12:18.”

But last week, Pittman confessed to burning down a synagogue in Jackson, Mississippi. It was an act of calculated and ambitious hate, targeting the Beth Israel Synagogue, Jackson’s oldest synagogue and a building that had been firebombed by the Ku Klux Klan back in 1967. Pittman, who was arrested Saturday night after his father contacted the FBI, told investigators he had targeted the “Synagogue of Satan” for its “Jewish ties.” Authorities also say he laughed when his father confronted him and bragged that he “finally got them.” (No one was hurt in the arson.)

The question of how Spencer Pittman was radicalized is, so far, a slightly confounding one. He does not look to be an isolated internet obsessive with overt ties to white nationalists. He appeared to have friends—or at least teammates. He seemed to be from a comfortable suburban background. His life appeared to be a largely offline one, with community in his world of athletics.

There are gaps in our understanding of how Pittman went from a baseball-obsessed teenager to a fanatical antisemite. But he left enough of his digital world visible to the public for us to piece together some clues. Pittman, it seems, had found himself highly active in a strange community on the internet—one of those bizarre new digital spaces where toxic forms of masculinity culture merge with fundamentalist Christianity. This Christian-bro gym culture offers many young men an intoxicating sense of purpose, one in which the pursuit of conventional masculinity is given a kind of divine backing. Depending on who you ask, this culture is part of the manosphere, right-wing purity culture, or reactionary religious politics. But however you categorize this subculture, it may provide some clues to understanding how a gym rat could encounter militant new ideas.

The clearest insight into Pittman’s version of this world came in early January, when he posted a link to a website for a lifestyle brand called “One Purpose.” The site, which according to Mississippi Today was registered to Pittman in December, advertised a kind of wellness subscription service with a mishmash of Gen Z buzzwords and Christian self-help: looksmaxxing (including mewing and “facial aesthetics”), testosterone optimization, scripture memorization, divine schedule optimization, A.I. food scanning, financial tracking, and Bible-based workouts. The brand appeared to take the Bible very literally in its inspiration, scattering Hebrew throughout and promising a diet based on biblical foods (as in those specifically mentioned in scripture, such as figs, olives, and barley) and a health plan that enabled the biblical patriarchs to live for centuries. (“Their secret? Biblical eating patterns, fasting, and walking with God.”) The latter was advertised as a “life-expectancy maxxing protocol.”

If you spend some time on the website, you’ll see signs of how Pittman saw this world—or at least how he was trying to sell it to others. One section of the website explains “Why the World’s Way Has Failed You,” noting that secular diet and workout plans will fail young men because they aren’t pushing them to be disciplined enough. (The site is geared exclusively toward men.) “God’s solution,” on the other hand, asks these men to “build their temple”—their bodies—“for His glory,” giving them proper motivation to hit the gym.

While it may seem baffling to many Christians and non-Christians alike, this kind of exercise-based faith expression is not uncommon among a certain category of young men, experts say. According to Mariel Barnes, a professor who researches gender and public affairs at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, it offers the same appeal as other factions of the “manosphere”—incels, pickup artists, and male separatists, for example—by emphasizing the power of men and the importance of traditional gender roles.

According to the Rev. Angela Denker, a Lutheran pastor and the author of Disciples of White Jesus: The Radicalization of American Boyhood, that hyperfixation on masculinity is a common element of extreme right-wing Christianity. The vision of a kind of premodern, brutish masculinity provides a comfortingly simple guide for how a young man should act in a complex world—and the religious backing makes him feel more righteous in his belief.

The question of how he got from there to extreme antisemitism is murky. But experts in masculinity and right-wing Christianity noted that the different ideas that fed into this subculture encourage rigid ideology and bold action.

Take, for example, the website’s offer of a “Biblical longevity protocol based on Noah, Moses, and Caleb’s lifespans”—a prominent feature on the page. It sounds like nonsense, but it’s new internet framing of an older idea. The term “life-expectancy maxxing” appears to be original, but some Christians have occasionally claimed that the Bible offers a kind of code to the ideal form of bodily existence. According to Heidi Campbell, a Texas A&M University professor who researches technology, religion, and digital culture, in the 1990s, the era of fad dieting, the country saw a revival in biblical dieting, in which people looked through Levitical laws for instruction on nutrition and fasting.

But it’s internet culture that allowed Pittman to package this as a kind of Christian answer to Silicon Valley’s anti-aging movement, in which you can hack your way to a long life with the right interactive tech tool, plus God. There’s nothing hate-oriented about that. Still, it calls on young men to cast off their old interests and influences and remake their lives by embracing a collection of extreme worldviews—in this case, tech’s optimization culture, fundamentalist Christianity, and the manosphere’s aesthetic self-improvement culture. When that level of single-minded intensity is brought to reforming the physical body, Campbell said, it can set the conditions for other kinds of extremism.

“There can be a lot of overlap with different people who tend toward more extremist ideas and behaviors,” Campbell said. “That jump in an extreme in how you treat bodies to an extreme in how you treat culture—that idea of purification—can be twisted to justify certain logic.”

“It’s not just being healthy but resisting anything ‘polluting’ to your body, to your mind, to the culture,” she added.

Pittman clearly saw these things—body, mind, culture—as connected. On Instagram, Pittman posted about what he perceived as the true threats to the world: “How to destroy society: Make discipline cringe. Make truth offensive. Make masculinity shameful.”

These ideas are often articulated in conservative Christian spaces as about being a “warrior” for Christ. The Christian warrior defends society against secular, feminist groups that want to eradicate family values and spread moral confusion. He is not afraid to be strong and fight for what he knows to be Biblical truth.

Usually, pastors advocating for young men to be warriors for Christ don’t mention Judaism. But on the internet, it doesn’t take a lot of searching to find men proclaiming themselves to be devoted Christians who will argue that Jews are behind society’s adoption of feminist and secular values. Pittman was clearly immersed in internet culture. And he appears to have bought into the idea, spread by so many on the Christian right, that it was his duty to stand up against Christianity’s “enemies.”

“It’s a theology of power, of power and dominance, and that does lend itself to antisemitism,” Denker said.

It’s possible that Pittman had become, in some way, confused. We don’t know his mental state before the crime. In December, after years of anodyne baseball photos, he started posting about money and cars. He posted selfies meant to show off his physique, a photo of bloodied knuckles, and videos of him driving at 160 miles per hour. He blasted money as the source of all evil while simultaneously bragging about his sports car and “escaping modern slavery” through stock trading. Finally, the night of the crime, he posted a clip from the Comedy Central show Drawn Together in which an antisemitic character panics about “a Jew in my backyard,” confronting an ugly, yellow-skinned cartoon character with a large nose and money bags. This was a hard swerve from Pittman’s inoffensive baseball posting from just a few weeks before.

It will remain hard to piece together Pittman’s path there because he, like every young man on the internet, could have constructed it from any number of sources. He didn’t need a single pastor or priest or denomination to tell him his views; he could have turned to podcasters, influencers, meme pages, YouTube pastors, and any other number of figures for inspiration. Some observers have been quick to point out that Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes have used the phrase “Synagogue of Satan.” But Pittman just as easily could have picked it up from any antisemite: The phrase, used in the Bible to refer to persecutors, has a long history of misuse, including by the KKK, Louis Farrakhan’s Nation of Islam, the televangelist Billy Graham, and various modern Christian white supremacist groups. Until he tells us where he learned it, we can’t know what his inspiration was.

But what we do know is that for young men like Pittman, the internet is awash in groups ready to prey on their confusion and insecurities and tell them that if they only remake themselves to be strong enough, masculine enough, driven enough, powerful enough, they’ll get the approval they want—whether it’s from women, society, or God.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon saw his pay packet swell to $29.7 million in fiscal 2025, up from $25.91 million the year before, even as Qualcomm&#39;s full-year net income fell 45 percent.

According to the chip giant&#39;s latest proxy filing [PDF], Amon&#39;s compensation for the year comprised a $1.35 million base salary, $24.16 million in stock awards, $3.19 million in non-equity incentives, and just over $1 million in other compensation.

Salary itself was unchanged year-on-year, with the 15 percent uplift driven almost entirely by equity and incentive pay.

The bump came in a year when Qualcomm reported full-year revenue of $44.3 billion, up 14 percent, but net income plunged 45 percent to $5.5 billion after the company booked a hefty non-cash tax charge tied to changes in US tax law. In other words, sales were up, profits went backwards, and executive pay kept climbing anyway.

Amon was not the only Qualcomm exec enjoying a healthy payday. CFO and COO Akash Palkhiwala took home $13.14 million in total compensation, while EVP and president Alexander Rogers earned $9.7 million. CTO Baaziz Achor received $9.46 million.

By contrast, Qualcomm calculated the annual total compensation of its median employee at $101,639, putting Amon&#39;s pay at roughly 292 times that figure.

Operationally, 2025 gave Qualcomm enough positives to keep investors upbeat. Fourth-quarter revenue climbed to $11.27 billion, up 10 percent year-on-year, driven in part by record quarterly automotive chip sales of $1.1 billion. Amon described that milestone as evidence that Qualcomm is now a serious player in a market long dominated by traditional automotive suppliers.

Amon also used the company&#39;s earnings call to flesh out plans to cautiously push Qualcomm into the datacenter. He confirmed the company is developing both a system-on-chip and an accelerator &quot;card&quot; for AI inference workloads, arguing that datacenter growth is shifting away from energy-hungry training toward more efficient inference at scale.

&quot;AI datacenter growth is moving from training to dedicated inference workloads, and this trend is expected to accelerate,&quot; Amon told analysts, while stressing that Qualcomm does not expect &quot;material&quot; datacenter revenue until 2027.

Not all of Qualcomm&#39;s optimism rests on AI. Amon struck a bullish note on the company&#39;s PC chips, saying there is still room for growth, and pointed to continued strength in modems and communications silicon, even after Apple opted to build its own modems rather than continue buying from Qualcomm.

He also went out of his way to mention Qualcomm&#39;s relationship with Samsung, noting the company expects to supply around 75 percent of the processors used in the Galaxy S26. That comment came shortly after the Korean giant signaled it wants to strengthen its own high-end smartphone processors following its decision to rely exclusively on Qualcomm chips in the Galaxy S25.

As ever, shareholders will get a non-binding say-on-pay vote at Qualcomm&#39;s annual meeting. Whether they view a near-$30 million CEO payday as well-earned in a year when profits fell sharply, and datacenter revenues remain a promise rather than a reality, is likely to be one of the more closely watched signals to come out of the meeting. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft 365 suffered a widespread outage last night affecting multiple services including Outlook – adding to the megacorp&#39;s troubled start to 2026.

The software and cloud biz acknowledged problems at 1937 UTC, when many users found Microsoft 365 services suddenly unavailable or sluggish. In addition to Outlook, Defender and Purview were also downed.

Microsoft blamed &quot;a portion of service infrastructure in North America that is not processing traffic as expected.&quot;

Affected users reported internal mail flowing slowly, while external email had packed up altogether. One wailed: &quot;You got to be kidding me! We haven&#39;t gotten emails since 1:30 pm and we run a financial company with clients!!&quot;

At the peak of the outage, 15,000 reports flooded incident-tracking site Downdetector.

Recovery was painfully slow as Microsoft worked to restore the infrastructure and balance traffic as the environment lurched back into life. By 0533 UTC, almost ten hours after the company first admitted there was a problem, Microsoft reported: &quot;We&#39;ve restored access to the affected services and mail flow remains stable.&quot;

Just under an hour later, it claimed: &quot;We&#39;ve confirmed that impact has been resolved.&quot;

Some users disagreed, with one posting: &quot;No it has not been resolved,&quot; and another writing: &quot;Our tenant is still unable to receive external email. I do not think this is resolved.&quot; Judging by the slowdown in complaints, services seemed back up and running for many.

The Register asked Microsoft for more details regarding the cause of the outage and the steps taken to ensure it won&#39;t happen again. We will update this piece should the company respond.

In the meantime, service has been restored as far as Microsoft is concerned, although we&#39;ve no doubt that somewhere in Redmond an engineer is removing the &quot;5&quot; from Microsoft 365 and replacing it with a &quot;4.5.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The British government has conceded it should not have approved a campus near London&#39;s M25 orbital motorway and that the decision should be quashed, following a legal challenge by campaign group Foxglove.

The non-profit filed its challenge last year after the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government overturned Buckinghamshire Council&#39;s rejection of the Woodlands Park site near Iver. The local authority had blocked the project on grounds it would significantly alter the area&#39;s character and appearance.

The UK&#39;s former Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner decided to recover two planning appeals regarding server farms in 2024, one of which was the Woodlands Park project, in line with government policy that building the facilities would benefit the economy.

The actual decision to grant the appeal and allow planning permission was given in July last year by the Minister of State for Housing and Planning, Matthew Pennycook MP, on behalf of the Secretary of State.

Foxglove says the government now accepts the decision must be quashed, claiming officials concede there were insufficient measures to hold the developer and any future site occupier of the site to environmental impact commitments.

&quot;It shouldn&#39;t take us having to drag the government to court for them to admit their decision to back Big Tech&#39;s polluting datacenters was fundamentally wrong,&quot; said Foxglove co-executive director Rosa Curling.

The Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government confirmed the U-turn and told The Register it would not be appropriate to comment further as the case is still subject to live litigation.

We also approached the developer of the site, Greystoke Land Ltd, for its reaction and if it intended to take any action over this decision, but the company declined to comment.

Greystoke Land Ltd is behind several other datacenter projects, including one near Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire, which is about 20 miles from the Woodlands Park site and also close to the M25.

This was likewise granted planning permission by the government, overturning a previous rejection by the local authority, Three Rivers District Council.

Other projects are also clustered near to London and the M25, including a massive facility being built for colocation biz Equinix at South Mimms, and a newly opened Google datacenter at Waltham Cross. ®

            <div id="article-text">Hammersmith & Fulham Council says payments are now being processed as usual, two months after a cyberattack that affected multiple boroughs in the UK&#39;s capital city.

In a Thursday update, the West London borough confirmed online and telephone payments had resumed, though some council tax and housing rent account balances may not be current.

H&F urged suppliers to continue submitting invoices for work provided, as systems for paying them are now back online too, despite &quot;a small backlog&quot; that could delay payments.

The council&#39;s status page indicates most services are available, although some remain down, and those seeking support on the phone could face lengthy waits.

&quot;A cybersecurity incident in a neighboring council last November affected some shared legacy H&F systems,&quot; the notice states. &quot;At the time of the attack, we quickly identified the risks and were able to successfully isolate and safeguard our network. Currently, there is no evidence of our H&F systems being compromised.

&quot;We have introduced enhanced security measures and are carefully investigating the impacts on all systems and services, including any risks to historic data. As a precautionary measure, we temporarily suspended some public-facing applications. We apologize for this inconvenience.&quot;

According to the Local Government & Social Care Ombudsman, the cyberattack impacted Westminster City and Kensington and Chelsea councils, with H&F also affected.

Westminster City Council faces more severe disruptions. Direct debits won&#39;t resume until after January at the earliest, and missed payments will be spread across remaining months of the financial year, resulting in larger-than-normal bills. Residents cannot order birth, death, and marriage certificates, and school application forms, library cards, and free school meal applications remain unavailable.

The Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea - the only authority to confirm the incident carried criminal intent and data compromise - still cannot process some residents&#39; payments. The council tax team can&#39;t access systems or emails.

It warned the investigation into the attack remains ongoing, and a full system restoration may take months. &quot;We continue to work closely with law enforcement and cybersecurity agencies here and internationally to investigate the incident.

&quot;We understand this is a worrying situation, and we thank residents, local partners, and our own staff for their patience and cooperation.&quot;

The borough reported blocking over 113,000 phishing attempts between June and September 2025, noting UK councils face near-daily attacks.

The UK&#39;s NCSC, the cyber arm of the sigint agency GCHQ, warned this week that local authorities are among the primary targets for pro-Russia hacktivist attacks that, while rarely sophisticated, can cause costly disruption. ®

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/23/uk_dbt_windows_11/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There was a time when an operating system upgrade meant wailing, gnashing of teeth, and a dive in productivity as computers and staffers stopped working for... well, as long as it took.

So The Register&#39;s Strategy Boutique was heartened to see the UK&#39;s Department for Business and Trade (DBT) take a very human-centered approach to shifting to Windows 11 ahead of Microsoft axing support for Windows 10.

After all, as the department this week noted: &quot;When going through change, people need time to understand in their own way what exactly is happening and how it will affect them personally.&quot;

&quot;Technical changes especially can bring about uncertainty for many people.&quot;

Which means: &quot;It makes sense that people can become extremely concerned when we tell them that their ways of working are about to change, and they will need to build them up again from scratch.&quot;

Just imagine if a crack DBT operative turned on their machine unprepared for a centered taskbar and start menu, or was taken unawares by the sight of rounded corners on their favorite icons. Before you know it, the UK could be engaged in a trade war with Greenland, or forcing Scottish distillers to drop an &quot;e&quot; into their premium product.

Luckily, DBT was well aware of the importance of guiding civil servants through &quot;the emotional landscape of change.&quot;

&quot;We made sure the Windows 11 upgrade programme was shaped by user-centred design from the beginning.&quot; It leapt on user research that showed staffers fell into three broad categories: the advocate; the engaged; the cautious.

One boutique member at El Reg was surprised that no one identified as curious. But then again, maybe that sort of thing is discouraged in Whitehall these days.

That meant the tech team could target their messaging to explain &quot;the what, the why, the benefits and reassurance that Windows 11 was not too dissimilar from Windows 10.&quot;

But just telling people the change is not that deep clearly wasn&#39;t going to be enough. &quot;We worked with data analysts to create a dashboard so colleagues could see for themselves whether their laptop required upgrading and what type of change they would experience.&quot;

Why would you trust Microsoft&#39;s own tool for telling you whether your laptop needed upgrading? Or a startup screen saying the laptop was running, say, Windows 10? Or Windows 11. Or perhaps Windows XP. Or Ubuntu.

The department supported this with a Windows 11 hub, which centralized all the information related to the update. This received more than 2,000 unique views, while 500 staffers attended one of the webinars organized by the team to highlight new features.

Sadly, the report doesn&#39;t suggest whether these stats encompassed the advocates, the engaged, or the cautious. What is clear is that it was just a small proportion of the department&#39;s current 12,000-plus headcount.

Perhaps they needed a category for people who are unsure whether they&#39;re concerned by change. Or just incurious.

Nevertheless, the report concluded: &quot;The DBT Windows 11 rollout has reminded us that technical change is also emotional change... Behind every laptop is a real person, reminding us that change isn&#39;t about systems, it&#39;s about people.&quot;

Which is very true. Though it&#39;s unfortunate that while the department&#39;s tech team has worked hard to smooth workers&#39; path to Windows 11, its political masters are more concerned with how to smooth their path out of the building. There are plans to reduce DBT&#39;s headcount of 12,440 down to around 8,000 by April next year.

As the PCS union put it: &quot;DBT is gambling on AI and other digital solutions, though it is unclear how these will replace the important role DBT staff play.&quot;

On the upside, tools like Copilot shouldn&#39;t need guiding through the emotional landscape of change, be startled by rounded corners, or prompt public servants to make politically disastrous decisions on the basis of incorrect information. Should it? ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">More than 15,000 former members of the UK&#39;s armed forces have successfully applied for a digital version of their veterans ID card since its launch in October, according to the Government Digital Service (GDS).

However this is less than 1 percent of the 1.8 million former forces personnel who are eligible for the physical Veteran Card. These physical cards have been automatically issued to those leaving the armed forces since 2019. Those who left the armed forces before then can apply for one for free.

The optional digital card, which the government had originally planned to launch in the summer of 2025, is held within the GOV.UK One Login app. Unlike the physical card, it cannot be used as photo identity for domestic British Airways flights or in applications for a Veterans Railcard for discounted rail tickets. And despite being digital, it cannot currently be used online, meaning it is limited to some in-person uses, such as registering as a veteran with a doctor or claiming cheaper entry to some museums.

The digital veterans ID is held in the GOV.UK One Login app, which the government plans to rebrand as the GOV.UK Wallet when it has added more forms of identity. In December, GDS started testing a digital version of the driving license - using the same app - with both its own staff and colleagues from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).

&quot;Later this year, the digital driving license will be rolled out more widely, enabling people to store their driving license on their phone, making it easier and faster to prove who you are and your driving entitlements,&quot; GDS said in a blogpost.

GDS is working on digital programmatic verification of both veterans&#39; ID cards and driving licenses, which would allow online use as well as in-person verification. It plans to involve third-party service providers in tests of how they can use programmatic verification later this year.

The work is part of the government&#39;s efforts to develop digital identity. It pre-dates prime minister Sir Kier Starmer&#39;s announcement in September that digital identity would be compulsory in right-to-work checks by the end of the current Parliament, which he abandoned earlier this month. ®

            <h2>Google won’t stop replacing our news headlines with terrible AI</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-01-23</strong></p>

            <div id="article-text">It now says AI headlines are a ‘feature,’ not an experiment.

It now says AI headlines are a ‘feature,’ not an experiment.

In early December, I brought you the news that Google has begun replacing Verge headlines, and those of our competitors, with AI clickbait nonsense in its content feed. Google appeared to be backing away from the experiment, but now tells The Verge that its AI headlines in Google Discover are a feature, one that “performs well for user satisfaction.” I once again see lots of misleading claims every time I check my phone.

Like I explained last month, these AI headlines are akin to a bookstore replacing the covers of the books it puts on display — only here, the “bookstore” is the news tab that appears when you swipe right on the homescreen of a Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel phone, and the “cover” might be a AI-generated lie instead of the truth.

For example, Google’s AI claimed last week that “US reverses foreign drone ban,” citing and linking to this PCMag story for the news. That’s not just false — PCMag took pains to explain that it’s false in the story that Google links to!

I saw a headline saying that the drone ban was dropped. Is that true? No. While it’s true the Commerce Department ended its efforts to restrict DJI and other drones from import in Jan. 2026, it only did so because it would be redundant in the wake of the FCC actions. The Commerce Department is a separate entity from the FCC, and its proposed restrictions were never put in place to begin with. Some reports on the Commerce Department’s decision have misleading headlines that could make you think the government did an about-face, so I don’t blame you for being confused.

What does the author of that PCMag story think? “It makes me feel icky,” Jim Fisher tells me over the phone. “I’d encourage people to click on stories and read them, and not trust what Google is spoon-feeding them.”

He says Google should be using the headline that humans wrote, and if Google needs a summary, it can use the ones that publications already submit to help search engines parse our work.

Google claims it’s not rewriting headlines. It characterizes these new offerings as “trending topics,” even though each “trending topic” presents itself as one of our stories, links to our stories, and uses our images, all without competent fact-checking to ensure the AI is getting them right.

In some ways, Google’s current implementation isn’t quite as bad as it was a month ago. I’ve seen fewer examples of egregious clickbait, partly because Google Discover is now serving me quite a few unadulterated news stories alongside its AI ones — though it does cut off their genuine headlines far too quickly, making many tough to read.

The AI is also no longer restricted to roughly four words per headline, so I no longer see nonsense headlines like “Microsoft developers using AI” or “AI tag debate heats.” (Instead, I occasionally see tripe like “Fares: Need AAA & AA Games” or “Dispatch sold millions; few avoided romance.”)

But Google’s AI has no clue what parts of these stories are new, relevant, significant, or true, and it can easily confuse one story for another.

On December 26th, Google told me that “Steam Machine price & HDMI details emerge.” They hadn’t. On January 11th, Google proclaimed that “ASUS ROG Ally X arrives.” (It arrived in 2024; the new Xbox Ally arrived months ago.) On January 20th, it wrote that “Glasses-free 3D tech wows,” introducing readers to “New 3D tech called Immensity from Leia” — but linking to this TechRadar story about an entirely different company called Visual Semiconductor. I found another that claimed to be about a GPU maker commenting on the RAM shortage; it linked instead to a Digitimes story about a RAM maker.

I’m particularly frustrated when I see bait-and-switch headlines on Verge stories, of course, and worried they’re taking away our ability to market our own work.

Google boiled down my colleague Jay Peters’ story about how RGB stripe OLED monitors can unlock sharper text and more accurate colors to the boring “New OLED Gaming Monitors Debut.” My story about letting you experience an immersive 3D demo of the Lego Smart Brick like you’re there with us at CES became “Lego Smart Play launches March 1,” a date that wasn’t news by the time Google wrote that! And Google AI decided to advertise our big Verge Awards at CES 2026 story as “Robots & AI Take CES,” which was basically the opposite of our conclusion in that story.

And yet, our new AI overlords are not effectively weeding out the worst human clickbait in exchange for our fealty. One headline that Google’s AI didn’t overwrite was “Star Wars Outlaws Free Download Available For Less Than 24 Hours” by Screen Rant. Here’s what the author of that story reveals halfway down the post:

Just the one code being given away when thousands of people are likely to get involved feels a bit stingy, although at the time of writing Ubisoft’s post hasn’t exactly blown up, so you might be in with a shot.

Yes, Ubisoft gave away a single copy of a game on X, in a giveaway only open to residents of the UK, yet Google’s news bot decided that Screen Rant’s FOMO clickbait was fine to serve up without tweaks at all.

Here’s the statement from Google spokesperson Jennifer Kutz about the Google feature:

We launched a new feature last year in Discover to help people explore topics that are covered by multiple creators and websites. The feature includes a helpful AI-powered overview of the topic, a featured image, and links to related stories. The overview headline reflects information across a range of sites, and is not a rewrite of an individual article headline. This feature performs well for user satisfaction, and we continue to experiment with the UI to help people click through and explore content on the web.

Google declined our request for an interview to more fully explain the idea.

I don’t know how broadly Google is showing these “trending topics” AI headlines yet, but it seems the company is testing them beyond the Google Discover news feed, too. I’ve recently seen some of them appear as push notifications to my phone; tapping them takes me to a Google Gemini chatbot that attempts to summarize a recent piece of news.

Google changes like these are the biggest reason The Verge now has a subscription, without which we won’t survive Google Zero.

Disclosure: Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company, has filed a lawsuit against Google, seeking damages from its illegal ad tech monopoly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft is giving its Paint and Notepad apps on Windows new AI capabilities for editing text and making digital illustrations. The updates are currently rolling out to Windows Insiders in the Windows 11 Canary and Dev channels, and include features that feel oddly niche or advanced for such simplified apps, such as AI text improvements in Notepad and the ability to instantly generate coloring book pages in Paint.

The latter feature is aptly called “Coloring book,” and lets you make blank coloring templates in version 11.2512.191.0 of Paint based on a text prompt. Users can access this feature by selecting the Coloring book option from the Copilot menu in Paint, and then describing what the design should be, such as “a cute fluffy cat on a donut.” Paint will then generate four results that Paint users can click to add to their canvas. From there, you can presumably use Paint itself to color the image, or print it out to use traditional art materials.

It’s such an oddly specific tool that I have to wonder if this is something that coloring book consumers (parents and stressed-out millennials) actually use Paint for. The Coloring book feature is notably only available on Copilot Plus PCs, so it’s more likely that Microsoft is exploring novel ways to make its AI-infused Windows 11 devices more marketable. Paint is also getting a fill tolerance slider (which isn’t just restricted to Copilot hardware) that provides more control over how the Fill tool applies color.

The Notepad 11.2512.10.0 update includes the ability to stream AI-generated results for Write, Rewrite, and Summarize features, allowing a preview of the text results to quickly appear without waiting for the full response. Notepad also has a new welcome experience that provides a quick overview of what’s available in the app, and now supports additional Markdown syntax features, including strikethrough formatting and nested lists.

            <div id="article-text">TikTok is now under new ownership in the US, but what happens next?

TikTok is now under new ownership in the US, but what happens next?

Just over a year after it briefly disappeared from app stores, TikTok in the US is now part of a new entity, TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC. With approval from both the US and China closing on the schedule laid out in December, ByteDance’s ownership of the new joint venture is now only 19.9 percent to satisfy the terms of the divest-or-ban law signed in 2024 by President Biden. The other 80.1 percent is owned by investment firm Silver Lake, Oracle, and Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX — the three “managing investors” that now hold 15 percent stakes — and several other smaller investors, like Michael Dell’s family investment firm.

A press release announcing the deal’s closure didn’t say how much those stakes cost or give details about potentially launching a new app in the US. It did say that the joint venture’s oversight of “comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for U.S. users” will apply to TikTok, the video editor CapCut, Lemon8, and “a portfolio” of other apps and services.

For now, most of what we know is about the joint venture’s seven-member board, which includes TikTok US CEO Shou Zi Chew, and its first executive appointments, with TikTok’s former head of operations and trust and safety, Adam Presser, now serving as CEO.

Interoperability enables the Joint Venture to provide U.S. users with a global TikTok experience, ensuring U.S. creators can be discovered and businesses can operate on a global scale. TikTok global’s U.S. entities will manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.

TikTok USDS Joint Venture’s mandate is to secure U.S. user data, apps and the algorithm through comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity measures. It will safeguard the U.S. content ecosystem through robust trust and safety policies and content moderation while ensuring continuous accountability through transparency reporting and third-party certifications.

Data Protection: U.S. user data will be protected by USDS Joint Venture in Oracle’s secure U.S. cloud environment. The Joint Venture will operate a comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity program that is audited and certified by third party cybersecurity experts. The program will adhere to major industry standards, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) CSF and 800-53 and ISO 27001 as well as the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Security Requirements for Restricted Transactions.

Algorithm Security: The Joint Venture will retrain, test, and update the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data. The content recommendation algorithm will be secured in Oracle’s U.S. cloud environment.

Software Assurance: The Joint Venture will secure U.S. apps through software assurance protocols, and review and validate source code on an ongoing basis, assisted by its Trusted Security Partner, Oracle.

Trust & Safety: The Joint Venture will safeguard the U.S. content ecosystem and have decision-making authority for trust and safety policies and content moderation.

TikTok USDS Joint Venture has three managing investors, Silver Lake, Oracle and MGX, each holding 15%. Completing the full consortium of investors are: Dell Family Office, the investment firm of Michael Dell, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies; Vastmere Strategic Investments, LLC, an affiliate of Susquehanna International Group, LLP; Alpha Wave Partners; Revolution; Merritt Way, LLC controlled and managed by partners of Dragoneer; Via Nova, an affiliate of General Atlantic; Virgo LI, Inc., investment arm of a foundation established by Yuri and Julia Milner in support of science; and NJJ Capital, the family office of Xavier Niel, a French entrepreneur and pioneer in telecommunications. ByteDance retains 19.9% of the Joint Venture.

Ring has launched a new Ring Verify tool that the company says can “verify that Ring videos you receive haven’t been edited or changed.” But since Ring won’t verify videos that have been altered in any way, it probably won’t be able to verify those videos you see on TikTok that look like they’re from security camera footage but are actually made with AI.

All videos downloaded from Ring’s cloud now include a “digital security seal,” Ring says. To check and to see if a video is authentic, go to the Ring Verify website and select a video from your device to upload it. When Ring Verify says a video is “verified,” that means “the video hasn’t been changed in any way since it was downloaded from Ring.” (Ring Verify is built on C2PA standards, according to spokesperson Kaleigh Bueckert-Orme.)

Any change to the video, including something small like tweaking the brightness, will make a video fail the test. Ring cannot verify videos that “were downloaded before this feature launched in December 2025, or videos that have been edited, cropped, filtered, or altered in any way after download (even trimming a second, adjusting brightness, or cropping)” or “videos uploaded to video sharing sites which compress the video.” Videos recorded with end-to-end encryption turned on can’t be verified, either.

If Ring can’t verify the video as authentic, it also can’t tell you exactly what was changed about it. “Ring’s verification only confirms that a video has not been modified at all since download,” Ring says. If you want an original version of a video, Ring suggests asking the person who shared it with you to share a link from the Ring app.

”Beyond Good & Evil 2 remains a priority for us in the context of our strategy centered around Open World Adventures,” an unnamed Ubisoft spokesperson told Kotaku and Insider Gaming.

The original Beyond Good & Evil is a fantastic game I can enjoy even now, over 20 years on from its 2003 release.

The sequel has been in development hell nearly as long at over 17 years, the longest of any major game; it’s survived the retirement of its first creative director, the death of its second creative director, and that one time Joseph Gordon-Levitt attempted to suggest an army of fans should generate its art and music in the attempt to win a small amount of prize money.

I would love to see proof of life... don’t suppose Ubisoft would like to share some with us?

The 4K TV doubles as wall art when idle, and the smallest panels are now on sale at Woot for up to $400 off.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Unless you’re dead set on picking up a larger panel, Samsung’s forthcoming 2026 Frame lineup represents a fairly minor upgrade. That makes last year’s model an easy rec for those on the hunt for an art-inspired 4K TV, especially given the 43- and 50-inch models are down to the lowest prices we’ve seen at Woot, selling for $597.99 ($302 off) and $697.99 ($402 off), respectively, through January 31st.

Samsung’s last-gen 4K TV can easily pass for a piece of artwork, thanks to its slim QLED display that can showcase thousands of famous paintings when idle. Its anti-glare matte panel adds a realistic, canvas-like quality that helps it blend into your home decor, and you can even display your own photos and images. It’s great for watching TV shows and movies, too, as it supports HDR10 Plus for richer image quality and Dolby Atmos for more spacious, immersive sound. You also get access to all your major streaming apps — Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, etc. —along with support for both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.

There are some caveats to bear in mind, such as the fact that the 43-inch model only offers a 60Hz refresh rate, whereas larger models can reach 144Hz. And though Samsung offers a limited selection of free artwork, you’ll need a Samsung Art Store subscription ($4.99 a month / $49.99 a year) to access the full catalog. Nonetheless, both the 43-inch and 50-inch models are a good investment if you want Samsung’s artsy TV experience but in a smaller, more affordable package.

            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

In the final weeks of 2025, the battle over regulating artificial intelligence in the US reached a boiling point. On December 11, after Congress failed twice to pass a law banning state AI laws, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order seeking to handcuff states from regulating the booming industry. Instead, he vowed to work with Congress to establish a “minimally burdensome” national AI policy, one that would position the US to win the global AI race. The move marked a qualified victory for tech titans, who have been marshaling multimillion-dollar war chests to oppose AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of state laws would stifle innovation.

In 2026, the battleground will shift to the courts. While some states might back down from passing AI laws, others will charge ahead, buoyed by mounting public pressure to protect children from chatbots and rein in power-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, dueling super PACs bankrolled by tech moguls and AI-safety advocates will pour tens of millions into congressional and state elections to seat lawmakers who champion their competing visions for AI regulation.

Trump’s executive order directs the Department of Justice to establish a task force that sues states whose AI laws clash with his vision for light-touch regulation. It also directs the Department of Commerce to starve states of federal broadband funding if their AI laws are “onerous.” In practice, the order may target a handful of laws in Democratic states, says James Grimmelmann, a law professor at Cornell Law School. “The executive order will be used to challenge a smaller number of provisions, mostly relating to transparency and bias in AI, which tend to be more liberal issues,” Grimmelmann says.

For now, many states aren’t flinching. On December 19, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, signed the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark law requiring AI companies to publish the protocols used to ensure the safe development of their AI models and report critical safety incidents. On January 1, California debuted the nation’s first frontier AI safety law, SB 53—which the RAISE Act was modeled on—aimed at preventing catastrophic harms such as biological weapons or cyberattacks. While both laws were watered down from earlier iterations to survive bruising industry lobbying, they struck a rare, if fragile, compromise between tech giants and AI safety advocates.

If Trump targets these hard-won laws, Democratic states like California and New York will likely take the fight to court. Republican states like Florida with vocal champions for AI regulation might follow suit. Trump could face an uphill battle. “The Trump administration is stretching itself thin with some of its attempts to effectively preempt [legislation] via executive action,” says Margot Kaminski, a law professor at the University of Colorado Law School. “It’s on thin ice.”

But Republican states that are anxious to stay off Trump’s radar or can’t afford to lose federal broadband funding for their sprawling rural communities might retreat from passing or enforcing AI laws. Win or lose in court, the chaos and uncertainty could chill state lawmaking. Paradoxically, the Democratic states that Trump wants to rein in—armed with big budgets and emboldened by the optics of battling the administration—may be the least likely to budge.

In lieu of state laws, Trump promises to create a federal AI policy with Congress. But the gridlocked and polarized body won’t be delivering a bill this year. In July, the Senate killed a moratorium on state AI laws that had been inserted into a tax bill, and in November, the House scrapped an encore attempt in a defense bill. In fact, Trump’s bid to strong-arm Congress with an executive order may sour any appetite for a bipartisan deal.

The executive order “has made it harder to pass responsible AI policy by hardening a lot of positions, making it a much more partisan issue,” says Brad Carson, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma who is building a network of super PACs backing candidates who support AI regulation. “It hardened Democrats and created incredible fault lines among Republicans,” he says.

While AI accelerationists in Trump’s orbit—AI and crypto czar David Sacks among them—champion deregulation, populist MAGA firebrands like Steve Bannon warn of rogue superintelligence and mass unemployment. In response to Trump’s executive order, Republican state attorneys general signed a bipartisan letter urging the FCC not to supersede state AI laws.

With Americans increasingly anxious about how AI could harm mental health, jobs, and the environment, public demand for regulation is growing. If Congress stays paralyzed, states will be the only ones acting to keep the AI industry in check. In 2025, state legislators introduced more than 1,000 AI bills, and nearly 40 states enacted over 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Efforts to protect children from chatbots may inspire rare consensus. On January 7, Google and Character Technologies, a startup behind the companion chatbot Character.AI, settled several lawsuits with families of teenagers who killed themselves after interacting with the bot. Just a day later, the Kentucky attorney general sued Character Technologies, alleging that the chatbots drove children to suicide and other forms of self-harm. OpenAI and Meta face a barrage of similar suits. Expect more to pile up this year. Without AI laws on the books, it remains to be seen how product liability laws and free speech doctrines apply to these novel dangers. “It’s an open question what the courts will do,” says Grimmelmann.

While litigation brews, states will move to pass child safety laws, which are exempt from Trump’s proposed ban on state AI laws. On January 9, OpenAI inked a deal with a former foe, the child-safety advocacy group Common Sense Media, to back a ballot initiative in California called the Parents & Kids Safe AI Act, setting guardrails around how chatbots interact with children. The measure proposes requiring AI companies to verify users’ age, offer parental controls, and undergo independent child-safety audits. If passed, it could be a blueprint for states across the country seeking to crack down on chatbots.

Fueled by widespread backlash against data centers, states will also try to regulate the resources needed to run AI. That means bills requiring data centers to report on their power and water use and foot their own electricity bills. If AI starts to displace jobs at scale, labor groups might float AI bans in specific professions. A few states concerned about the catastrophic risks posed by AI may pass safety bills mirroring SB 53 and the RAISE Act.

Meanwhile, tech titans will continue to use their deep pockets to crush AI regulations. Leading the Future, a super PAC backed by OpenAI president Greg Brockman and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, will try to elect candidates who endorse unfettered AI development to Congress and state legislatures. They’ll follow the crypto industry’s playbook for electing allies and writing the rules. To counter this, super PACs funded by Public First, an organization run by Carson and former Republican congressman Chris Stewart of Utah, will back candidates advocating for AI regulation. We might even see a handful of candidates running on anti-AI populist platforms.

In 2026, the slow, messy process of American democracy will grind on. And the rules written in state capitals could decide how the most disruptive technology of our generation develops far beyond America’s borders, for years to come.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">This week marked a rather unpleasant anniversary: It’s a year since Texas reported a case of measles—the start of a significant outbreak that ended up spreading across multiple states. Since the start of January 2025, there have been over 2,500 confirmed cases of measles in the US. Three people have died.

As vaccination rates drop and outbreaks continue, scientists have been experimenting with new ways to quickly identify new cases and prevent the disease from spreading. And they are starting to see some success with wastewater surveillance.

After all, wastewater contains saliva, urine, feces, shed skin, and more. You could consider it a rich biological sample. Wastewater analysis helped scientists understand how covid was spreading during the pandemic. It’s early days, but it is starting to help us get a handle on measles.

Globally, there has been some progress toward eliminating measles, largely thanks to vaccination efforts. Such efforts led to an 88% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2024, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that “nearly 59 million lives have been saved by the measles vaccine” since 2000.

Still, an estimated 95,000 people died from measles in 2024 alone—most of them young children. And cases are surging in Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Last year, the US saw the highest levels of measles in decades. The country is on track to lose its measles elimination status—a sorry fate that met Canada in November after the country recorded over 5,000 cases in a little over a year.

Public health efforts to contain the spread of measles—which is incredibly contagious—typically involve clinical monitoring in health-care settings, along with vaccination campaigns. But scientists have started looking to wastewater, too.

Along with various bodily fluids, we all shed viruses and bacteria into wastewater, whether that’s through brushing our teeth, showering, or using the toilet. The idea of looking for these pathogens in wastewater to track diseases has been around for a while, but things really kicked into gear during the covid-19 pandemic, when scientists found that the coronavirus responsible for the disease was shed in feces.

This led Marlene Wolfe of Emory University and Alexandria Boehm of Stanford University to establish WastewaterSCAN, an academic-led program developed to analyze wastewater samples across the US. Covid was just the beginning, says Wolfe. “Over the years we have worked to expand what can be monitored,” she says.

Two years ago, for a previous edition of the Checkup, Wolfe told Cassandra Willyard that wastewater surveillance of measles was “absolutely possible,” as the virus is shed in urine. The hope was that this approach could shed light on measles outbreaks in a community, even if members of that community weren’t able to access health care and receive an official diagnosis. And that it could highlight when and where public health officials needed to act to prevent measles from spreading. Evidence that it worked as an effective public health measure was, at the time, scant.

Since then, she and her colleagues have developed a test to identify measles RNA. They trialed it at two wastewater treatment plants in Texas between December 2024 and May 2025. At each site, the team collected samples two or three times a week and tested them for measles RNA.

Over that period, the team found measles RNA in 10.5% of the samples they collected, as reported in a preprint paper published at medRxiv in July and currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal. The first detection came a week before the first case of measles was officially confirmed in the area. That’s promising—it suggests that wastewater surveillance might pick up measles cases early, giving public health officials a head start in efforts to limit any outbreaks.

There are more promising results from a team in Canada. Mike McKay and Ryland Corchis-Scott at the University of Windsor in Ontario and their colleagues have also been testing wastewater samples for measles RNA. Between February and November 2025, the team collected samples from a wastewater treatment facility serving over 30,000 people in Leamington, Ontario.

These wastewater tests are somewhat limited—even if they do pick up measles, they won’t tell you who has measles, where exactly infections are occurring, or even how many people are infected. McKay and his colleagues have begun to make some progress here. In addition to monitoring the large wastewater plant, the team used tampons to soak up wastewater from a hospital lateral sewer.

They then compared their measles test results with the number of clinical cases in that hospital. This gave them some idea of the virus’s “shedding rate.” When they applied this to the data collected from the Leamington wastewater treatment facility, the team got estimates of measles cases that were much higher than the figures officially reported.

Their findings track with the opinions of local health officials (who estimate that the true number of cases during the outbreak was around five to 10 times higher than the confirmed case count), the team members wrote in a paper published on medRxiv a couple of weeks ago.

There will always be limits to wastewater surveillance. “We’re looking at the pool of waste of an entire community, so it’s very hard to pull in information about individual infections,” says Corchis-Scott.

Wolfe also acknowledges that “we have a lot to learn about how we can best use the tools so they are useful.” But her team at WastewaterSCAN has been testing wastewater across the US for measles since May last year. And their findings are published online and shared with public health officials.

In some cases, the findings are already helping inform the response to measles. “We’ve seen public health departments act on this data,” says Wolfe. Some have issued alerts, or increased vaccination efforts in those areas, for example. “[We’re at] a point now where we really see public health departments, clinicians, [and] families using that information to help keep themselves and their communities safe,” she says.

McKay says his team has stopped testing for measles because the Ontario outbreak “has been declared over.” He says testing would restart if and when a single new case of measles is confirmed in the region, but he also thinks that his research makes a strong case for maintaining a wastewater surveillance system for measles.

McKay wonders if this approach might help Canada regain its measles elimination status. “It’s sort of like [we’re] a pariah now,” he says. If his approach can help limit measles outbreaks, it could be “a nice tool for public health in Canada to [show] we’ve got our act together.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131692/dr-google-had-its-issues-can-chatgpt-health-do-better/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week.

That’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. It landed at an inauspicious time: Two days earlier, the news website SFGate had broken the story of Sam Nelson, a teenager who died of an overdose last year after extensive conversations with ChatGPT about how best to combine various drugs. In the wake of both pieces of news, multiple journalists questioned the wisdom of relying for medical advice on a tool that could cause such extreme harm.

Though ChatGPT Health lives in a separate sidebar tab from the rest of ChatGPT, it isn’t a new model. It’s more like a wrapper that provides one of OpenAI’s preexisting models with guidance and tools it can use to provide health advice—including some that allow it to access a user’s electronic medical records and fitness app data, if granted permission. There’s no doubt that ChatGPT and other large language models can make medical mistakes, and OpenAI emphasizes that ChatGPT Health is intended as an additional support, rather than a replacement for one’s doctor. But when doctors are unavailable or unable to help, people will turn to alternatives.

Some doctors see LLMs as a boon for medical literacy. The average patient might struggle to navigate the vast landscape of online medical information—and, in particular, to distinguish high-quality sources from polished but factually dubious websites—but LLMs can do that job for them, at least in theory. Treating patients who had searched for their symptoms on Google required “a lot of attacking patient anxiety [and] reducing misinformation,” says Marc Succi, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a practicing radiologist. But now, he says, “you see patients with a college education, a high school education, asking questions at the level of something an early med student might ask.”

The release of ChatGPT Health, and Anthropic’s subsequent announcement of new health integrations for Claude, indicate that the AI giants are increasingly willing to acknowledge and encourage health-related uses of their models. Such uses certainly come with risks, given LLMs’ well-documented tendencies to agree with users and make up information rather than admit ignorance.

But those risks also have to be weighed against potential benefits. There’s an analogy here to autonomous vehicles: When policymakers consider whether to allow Waymo in their city, the key metric is not whether its cars are ever involved in accidents but whether they cause less harm than the status quo of relying on human drivers. If Dr. ChatGPT is an improvement over Dr. Google—and early evidence suggests it may be—it could potentially lessen the enormous burden of medical misinformation and unnecessary health anxiety that the internet has created.

Pinning down the effectiveness of a chatbot such as ChatGPT or Claude for consumer health, however, is tricky. “It’s exceedingly difficult to evaluate an open-ended chatbot,” says Danielle Bitterman, the clinical lead for data science and AI at the Mass General Brigham health-care system. Large language models score well on medical licensing examinations, but those exams use multiple-choice questions that don’t reflect how people use chatbots to look up medical information.

Sirisha Rambhatla, an assistant professor of management science and engineering at the University of Waterloo, attempted to close that gap by evaluating how GPT-4o responded to licensing exam questions when it did not have access to a list of possible answers. Medical experts who evaluated the responses scored only about half of them as entirely correct. But multiple-choice exam questions are designed to be tricky enough that the answer options don’t give them entirely away, and they’re still a pretty distant approximation for the sort of thing that a user would type into ChatGPT.

A different study, which tested GPT-4o on more realistic prompts submitted by human volunteers, found that it answered medical questions correctly about 85% of the time. When I spoke with Amulya Yadav, an associate professor at Pennsylvania State University who runs the Responsible AI for Social Emancipation Lab and led the study, he made it clear that he wasn’t personally a fan of patient-facing medical LLMs. But he freely admits that, technically speaking, they seem up to the task—after all, he says, human doctors misdiagnose patients 10% to 15% of the time. “If I look at it dispassionately, it seems that the world is gonna change, whether I like it or not,” he says.

For people seeking medical information online, Yadav says, LLMs do seem to be a better choice than Google. Succi, the radiologist, also concluded that LLMs can be a better alternative to web search when he compared GPT-4’s responses to questions about common chronic medical conditions with the information presented in Google’s knowledge panel, the information box that sometimes appears on the right side of the search results.

Since Yadav’s and Succi’s studies appeared online, in the first half of 2025, OpenAI has released multiple new versions of GPT, and it’s reasonable to expect that GPT-5.2 would perform even better than its predecessors. But the studies do have important limitations: They focus on straightforward, factual questions, and they examine only brief interactions between users and chatbots or web search tools. Some of the weaknesses of LLMs—most notably their sycophancy and tendency to hallucinate—might be more likely to rear their heads in more extensive conversations and with people who are dealing with more complex problems. Reeva Lederman, a professor at the University of Melbourne who studies technology and health, notes that patients who don’t like the diagnosis or treatment recommendations that they receive from a doctor might seek out another opinion from an LLM—and the LLM, if it’s sycophantic, might encourage them to reject their doctor’s advice.

Some studies have found that LLMs will hallucinate and exhibit sycophancy in response to health-related prompts. For example, one study showed that GPT-4 and GPT-4o will happily accept and run with incorrect drug information included in a user’s question. In another, GPT-4o frequently concocted definitions for fake syndromes and lab tests mentioned in the user’s prompt. Given the abundance of medically dubious diagnoses and treatments floating around the internet, these patterns of LLM behavior could contribute to the spread of medical misinformation, particularly if people see LLMs as trustworthy.

OpenAI has reported that the GPT-5 series of models is markedly less sycophantic and prone to hallucination than their predecessors, so the results of these studies might not apply to ChatGPT Health. The company also evaluated the model that powers ChatGPT Health on its responses to health-specific questions, using their publicly available HeathBench benchmark. HealthBench rewards models that express uncertainty when appropriate, recommend that users seek medical attention when necessary, and refrain from causing users unnecessary stress by telling them their condition is more serious that it truly is. It’s reasonable to assume that the model underlying ChatGPT Health exhibited those behaviors in testing, though Bitterman notes that some of the prompts in HealthBench were generated by LLMs, not users, which could limit how well the benchmark translates into the real world.

An LLM that avoids alarmism seems like a clear improvement over systems that have people convincing themselves they have cancer after a few minutes of browsing. And as large language models, and the products built around them, continue to develop, whatever advantage Dr. ChatGPT has over Dr. Google will likely grow. The introduction of ChatGPT Health is certainly a move in that direction: By looking through your medical records, ChatGPT can potentially gain far more context about your specific health situation than could be included in any Google search, although numerous experts have cautioned against giving ChatGPT that access for privacy reasons.

Even if ChatGPT Health and other new tools do represent a meaningful improvement over Google searches, they could still conceivably have a negative effect on health overall. Much as automated vehicles, even if they are safer than human-driven cars, might still prove a net negative if they encourage people to use public transit less, LLMs could undermine users’ health if they induce people to rely on the internet instead of human doctors, even if they do increase the quality of health information available online.

Lederman says that this outcome is plausible. In her research, she has found that members of online communities centered on health tend to put their trust in users who express themselves well, regardless of the validity of the information they are sharing. Because ChatGPT communicates like an articulate person, some people might trust it too much, potentially to the exclusion of their doctor. But LLMs are certainly no replacement for a human doctor—at least not yet.

It’s supposed to be frigid in Davos this time of year. Part of the charm is seeing the world’s elite tromp through the streets in respectable suits and snow boots. But this year it’s positively balmy, with highs in the mid 30s, or a little over 1°C. The current conditions when I flew out of New York were colder, and definitely snowier. I’m told this is due to something called a föhn, a dry warm wind that’s been blowing across the Alps.

I’m no meteorologist, but it’s true that there is a lot of hot air here.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump arrived in Davos to address the assembly, and held forth for more than 90 minutes, weaving his way through remarks about the economy, Greenland, windmills, Switzerland, Rolexes, Venezuela, and drug prices. It was a talk lousy with gripes, grievances and outright falsehoods.

One small example: Trump made a big deal of claiming that China, despite being the world leader in manufacturing windmill componentry, doesn’t actually use them for energy generation itself. In fact, it is the world leader in generation, as well.

I did not get to watch this spectacle from the room itself. Sad!

By the time I got to the Congress Hall where the address was taking place, there was already a massive scrum of people jostling to get in.

I had just wrapped up moderating a panel on “the intelligent co-worker,” ie: AI agents in the workplace. I was really excited for this one as the speakers represented a diverse cross-section of the AI ecosystem. Christoph Schweizer, CEO of BCG had the macro strategic view; Enrique Lores, HP CEO, could speak to both hardware and large enterprises, Workera CEO Kian Katanforoosh has the inside view on workforce training and transformation, Manjul Shah CEO of Hippocratic AI addressed working in the high stakes field of healthcare, and Kate Kallot CEO of Amini AI gave perspective on the global south and Africa in particular.

Interestingly, most of the panel shied away from using the term co-worker, and some even rejected the term agent. But the view they painted was definitely one of humans working alongside AI and augmenting what’s possible. Shah, for example, talked about having agents call 16,000 people in Texas during a heat wave to perform a health and safety check. It was a great discussion. You can watch the whole thing here.

But by the time it let out, the push of people outside the Congress Hall was already too thick for me to get in. In fact I couldn’t even get into a nearby overflow room. I did make it into a third overflow room, but getting in meant navigating my way through a mass of people, so jammed in tight together that it reminded me of being at a Turnstile concert.

The speech blew way past its allotted time, and I had to step out early to get to yet another discussion. Walking through the halls while Trump spoke was a truly surreal experience. He had truly captured the attention of the gathered global elite. I don’t think I saw a single person not starting at a laptop, or phone or iPad, all watching the same video.

Trump is speaking again on Thursday in a previously unscheduled address to announce his Board of Peace. As is (I heard) Elon Musk. So it’s shaping up to be another big day for elite attention capture.

I should say, though, there are elites, and then there are elites. And there are all sorts of ways of sorting out who is who. Your badge color is one of them. I have a white participant badge, because I was moderating panels. This gets you in pretty much anywhere and therefore is its own sort of status symbol. Where you are staying is another. I’m in Klosters, a neighboring town that’s a 40 minute train ride away from the Congress Centre. Not so elite.

There are more subtle ways of status sorting, too. Yesterday I learned that when people ask if this is your first time at Davos, it’s sometimes meant as a way of trying to figure out how important you are. If you’re any kind of big deal, you’ve probably been coming for years.

But the best one I’ve yet encountered happened when I made small talk with the woman sitting next to me as I changed back into my snow boots. It turned out that, like me, she lived in California–at least part time. “But I don’t think I’ll stay there much longer,” she said, “due to the new tax law.” This was just an ice cold flex.

Because California’s newly proposed tax legislation? It only targets billionaires.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Four ways to think about this year&#39;s reckoning.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

Yann LeCun is a Turing Award recipient and a top AI researcher, but he has long been a contrarian figure in the tech world. He believes that the industry’s current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems.

Instead, he thinks we should be betting on world models—a different type of AI that accurately reflects the dynamics of the real world. Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that he recently left Meta, where he had served as chief scientist for FAIR (Fundamental AI Research), the company&#39;s influential research lab that he founded.

LeCun sat down with MIT Technology Review in an exclusive online interview from his Paris apartment to discuss his new venture, life after Meta, the future of artificial intelligence, and why he thinks the industry is chasing the wrong ideas. Read the full interview.

In 2026, I’m going to be closely watching the price of lithium.

If you’re not in the habit of obsessively tracking commodity markets, I certainly don’t blame you. (Though the news lately definitely makes the case that minerals can have major implications for global politics and the economy.)

But lithium is worthy of a close look right now. The metal is crucial for lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage arrays on the grid.

Prices have been on quite the roller coaster over the last few years, and they’re ticking up again.

            <h2>Why 2026 is a hot year for lithium</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-01-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131563/lithium-2026/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2026, I’m going to be closely watching the price of lithium.

If you’re not in the habit of obsessively tracking commodity markets, I certainly don’t blame you. (Though the news lately definitely makes the case that minerals can have major implications for global politics and the economy.)

But lithium is worthy of a close look right now.

The metal is crucial for lithium-ion batteries used in phones and laptops, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage arrays on the grid. Prices have been on quite the roller coaster over the last few years, and they’re ticking up again after a low period. What happens next could have big implications for mining and battery technology.

Before we look ahead, let’s take a quick trip down memory lane. In 2020, global EV sales started to really take off, driving up demand for the lithium used in their batteries. Because of that growing demand and a limited supply, prices shot up dramatically, with lithium carbonate going from under $10 per kilogram to a high of roughly $70 per kilogram in just two years.

And the tech world took notice. During those high points, there was a ton of interest in developing alternative batteries that didn’t rely on lithium. I was writing about sodium-based batteries, iron-air batteries, and even experimental ones that were made with plastic.

Researchers and startups were also hunting for alternative ways to get lithium, including battery recycling and processing methods like direct lithium extraction (more on this in a moment).

But soon, prices crashed back down to earth. We saw lower-than-expected demand for EVs in the US, and developers ramped up mining and processing to meet demand. Through late 2024 and 2025, lithium carbonate was back around $10 a kilogram again. Avoiding lithium or finding new ways to get it suddenly looked a lot less crucial.

That brings us to today: lithium prices are ticking up again. So far, it’s nowhere close to the dramatic rise we saw a few years ago, but analysts are watching closely. Strong EV growth in China is playing a major role—EVs still make up about 75% of battery demand today. But growth in stationary storage, batteries for the grid, is also contributing to rising demand for lithium in both China and the US.

Higher prices could create new opportunities. The possibilities include alternative battery chemistries, specifically sodium-ion batteries, says Evelina Stoikou, head of battery technologies and supply chains at BloombergNEF. (I’ll note here that we recently named sodium-ion batteries to our 2026 list of 10 Breakthrough Technologies.)

It’s not just batteries, though. Another industry that could see big changes from a lithium price swing: extraction.

Today, most lithium is mined from rocks, largely in Australia, before being shipped to China for processing. There’s a growing effort to process the mineral in other places, though, as countries try to create their own lithium supply chains. Tesla recently confirmed that it’s started production at its lithium refinery in Texas, which broke ground in 2023. We could see more investment in processing plants outside China if prices continue to climb.

This could also be a key year for direct lithium extraction, as Katie Brigham wrote in a recent story for Heatmap. That technology uses chemical or electrochemical processes to extract lithium from brine (salty water that’s usually sourced from salt lakes or underground reservoirs), quickly and cheaply. Companies including Lilac Solutions, Standard Lithium, and Rio Tinto are all making plans or starting construction on commercial facilities this year in the US and Argentina.

If there’s anything I’ve learned about following batteries and minerals over the past few years, it’s that predicting the future is impossible. But if you’re looking for tea leaves to read, lithium prices deserve a look.

As early electric cars age out, hundreds of thousands of used batteries are flooding the market, fueling a gray recycling economy even as Beijing and big manufacturers scramble to build a more orderly system.

A cheaper, safer, and more abundant alternative to lithium is finally making its way into cars—and the grid.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In October 2021, the Beethoven Orchestra Bonn interpreted the first movement of Beethoven’s 10th unfinished symphony, which was completed with the use of artificial intelligence.

A team of computer scientists, music historians, musicologists, and composers developed the ‘Beethoven AI’ to analyze Beethoven’s music style and life, using the sketches he left behind of the 10th symphony, plus works from other composers that had a notable influence on his life, such as Johann Sebastian Bach, to generate pieces that reflect what he would have composed.

Beethoven AI, as others AI composition programs, produces music in the same way ChatGPT produces outcomes. It uses machine learning and algorithms to analyse musical data and patterns, and generative models to produce music based on inputted prompts.

Hence, the AI tool was trained by the team of experts and provided with all the necessary information for it to understand, be contextualized, and finally, be able to create something that Beethoven himself could have written.

This milestone raises an important question that becomes more relevant day by day: as technology becomes increasingly capable of initiating creativity, what remains distinctly human in the classical music world?

Can AI replace the sensitivity and humanity needed to compose, interpret, convey the emotions, or communicate the composer’s intended message?

Classical music has historically been a niche domain. It was born in the house of Jesus as the natural successor after choral music.

Whatsoever, only the most privileged ones, those of noble background or family with ties to music, could dedicate their lives to the study of an instrument or composition, and only those part of the aristocracy had the privilege to enjoy it.

Over time and thanks to globalization and the massive spread of information, classical music has expanded, allowing millions of people around the world to be delighted by it.

Digital platforms like Spotify and YouTube offer all audiences the opportunity to access an immense variety of compositions and recordings across history, democratizing classical music.

Simultaneously, social media allows traditional or innovative artists to showcase their interpretation of it, whether it is a classical performance of Campanella by Paganini or a modern version of The Four Seasons by Vivaldi, played as a trap variation.

The introduction of modern technologies has represented an opportunity for the classical music industry to find innovative ways to remain relevant in a fast-paced world.

The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra has launched a digital concert hall, a streaming platform for users to access multiple recordings and content on demand. Similarly, the Philharmonia Orchestra uses Virtual Reality to create an immersive experience, allowing the audience to enjoy the concerts onstage, among the players.

However, the new technologies also symbolize a challenge and introduce concerns about the future of human creativity for the creative industries, including the classical music world.

AyseDeniz Gokcin, a Turkish pianist, uses AI to arrange pieces from iconic composers, adapting them to modern trends or to what they might have produced if they lived today, which risks displacing contemporary composers trying to establish their own voices.

From a symphony finished with AI, to the experience of listening to an orchestra being onstage with them, or to have the possibility of listening to your favorite composer in a modern, personalized style, technology brings clear advantages to the classical music industry.

A study in ‘Music Composition with AI’ made by the World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews (WJARR) highlights how AI technologies can improve efficiency and accessibility, preserve and enhance historical pieces, and unlock new possibilities for innovation in performance and education. Y

et, it also challenges the role of human artistry and raises concerns about the lack of emotional depth, ethical and legal issues, and the livelihoods of today’s musicians and composers.

AI can be a powerful tool and ally for those who are willing to work with it as an extension of human creativity and as a means to explore new ways of expressing themselves.

While those who see it as a threat can focus on seeing AI as a digital instrument that will never replace the touch of mankind, since it depends on artists to create, replicate, and generate outcomes.

Lastly, it is on us, creators and audiences, to make a conscious choice in how we use new technologies and to preserve humanity in a rapidly evolving world.

            <h2>Op-Ed: Can Europe’s Digital Networks Act deliver for AI and Startups?</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As Europe races into the AI era, its policymakers are laying new pipes for the continent’s digital future. The European Commission’s proposed Digital Networks Act (DNA) promises to rewire the EU’s telecom landscape, with big implications for artificial intelligence infrastructure, connectivity equity, and the startup ecosystem.

Exposed as part of a broader push to make Europe “fit for the Digital Age,” the draft law aims to modernize how networks are built and regulated, from 5G towers in rural villages to fiber links between data centers.

I have to say it’s a bold vision of a more connected, innovative Europe, but one that must navigate a thicket of competing interests and unanswered questions.

For years, EU leaders have urged the creation of a true single market for digital services. The DNA is a centerpiece of that strategy, aligning with Europe’s Digital Decade goals for universal high-speed internet by 2030.

How can we translate this? Well, I think Brussels wants to turn the patchwork of 27 national telecom systems into one seamless network. The Act’s core objective is to “harmonise the EU connectivity sector by addressing delays, inconsistencies, and fragmentation”, removing barriers to cross-border operations and stimulating investment in very high-capacity networks.

This mirrors the logic behind earlier EU tech regulations;  just as the Digital Markets Act tackled Big Tech gatekeepers, the Digital Networks Act targets the digital plumbing beneath them.

This reform doesn’t come out of the blue.

A Commission white paper in 2024 warned that without cutting-edge digital infrastructure, Europe’s digital economy would stall. It painted vivid scenarios: doctors unable to perform remote surgery, smart farms and self-driving cars hamstrung by slow connections.

Secure and sustainable networks are one of the “cardinal points” of the EU’s 2030 digital agenda.

The DNA is Brussels’ attempt to meet those needs by boosting investment, standardizing rules, and making sure that every corner of Europe can plug into the opportunities of the digital age.

At its core, the Act hands telecom operators some long-sought gifts. One headline measure would grant carriers unlimited radio-spectrum licenses, ending the era of auctions that force telcos to periodically renew their rights.

For Europe’s big mobile providers, this change offers certainty: they can invest in 5G and future 6G networks without fearing their spectrum will expire.

Regulators argue this will “increase investment predictability” and accelerate network roll-out.

In theory, more cell towers could now reach remote areas, and companies might more freely trade or lease unused frequencies to new players.

The DNA couples permanent licenses with “use-it-or-share-it” obligations to prevent hoarding. If an incumbent isn’t using its spectrum in, say, a rural region, it could be forced to share it or lose it,  allowing a competitor or community network to serve that area.

It’s a nod to connectivity equity: Europe doesn’t want scarce wireless spectrum lying fallow while some communities remain underserved.

Broadband for all is the mantra, and long license tenures will come with accountability to deliver on coverage.

Another provision tightens the oversight of dominant firms. Under current plans, if a telecom operator holds significant market power (SMP) in one market (for example, fixed broadband), regulators could extend that designation to a closely related market (like mobile services).

In practice, this means big incumbents might face extra obligations, from transparency to price controls, across their range of services. The idea is to prevent giants from leveraging their dominance in one domain to squelch competition in another.

That could open space for smaller internet providers or innovative ISPs to compete, a boon for consumer choice and startup entrants.

A cohort of six member states,  including France, Germany and Italy, has pushed back, urging Brussels not to centralize control over frequencies and mergers.

Spectrum auctions have long been jealously guarded as national turf (they can fill state coffers, after all), and capitals are wary of one-size-fits-all rules emanating from the EU.

These governments also worry that encouraging pan-European telecom mergers (another idea floated in the reform) could reduce competition at home. In their joint memo, they caution that while a level playing field between telecoms and tech firms is a laudable goal, “this does not necessarily imply the same regulations should apply”to both sectors.

It’s a reminder that the DNA, for all its single-market ideals, must reckon with political realities: Europe’s telecom revolution won’t happen without consensus among very different national markets.

Perhaps the most contentious debate surrounding the Digital Networks Act has been over who pays for the next-generation networks. Telecom giants have spent years lobbying for a “fair share” contribution from Big Tech, arguing that bandwidth-hungry services like Netflix, YouTube, and cloud platforms should chip in to finance the infrastructure that carries their content.

The draft Act steers clear of any direct “network usage fee” on content providers. Instead, it reaffirms Europe’s commitment to net neutrality, the principle that all internet traffic must be treated equally by providers.

Any cooperation with Big Tech will rely on voluntary “best practice” discussions moderated by EU regulators, not on legally mandated payments.

This decision followed intense pushback from many sides. Over the summer, consumer groups and tech industry alliances publicly warned against reviving the “fair share” idea under any guise, noting it had been “clearly rejected in previous consultations” for threatening consumers, competition and innovation.

Even a U.S.–EU trade agreement in late 2025 extracted a pledge from Brussels “not [to] adopt or maintain network usage fees”, highlighting the geopolitical stakes of singling out mostly American tech firms.

On the other hand, startups and digital rights advocates breathed a sigh of relief at the Commission’s stance. Allied for Startups, a coalition of European entrepreneurs, argued that net neutrality is essential for startup growth, preventing a two-tier internet that would “favour dominant players” and raise barriers for newcomers.

In their view, a “traffic tax” isn’t just about Google or Amazon’s bottom line, it would set a harmful precedent that could box out the little guys who rely on affordable, equal-access bandwidth to innovate.

By keeping the DNA free of explicit network fees, Europe is signaling that the open internet won’t be collateral damage in the drive for better infrastructure.

Beyond telecom boardrooms and Silicon Valley balance sheets, the Digital Networks Act is ultimately about the kind of digital society Europe wants to build.

A major motivation is preparing for a future where artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and IoT devices are ubiquitous, and will demand unprecedented bandwidth and low latency.

The Commission’s own analysis stresses that only with the “highest performance” networks will transformative technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, remote health care, and smart grids reach their potential.

In simple terms: if data is the new oil, Europe needs better pipes to pump it.

The Digital Networks Act sits alongside Europe’s broader tech push by focusing on the infrastructure AI needs to scale. Beyond regulating AI, the EU is investing in next-generation networks, from fiber to 5G and 6G, through initiatives such as the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.

Faster rollout of these networks would underpin everything from AI-driven industry to cloud services, all of which depend on high-capacity, cross-border connectivity.

The Act also addresses connectivity equity. While Europe’s digital goals assume universal gigabit access and widespread 5G, large parts of the continent still lag behind.

The proposal combines simpler deployment rules with tougher coverage obligations, while allowing flexibility where older networks cannot yet be switched off. The aim is to expand access without letting rigid deadlines slow progress.

Whether this works will depend on execution. Investment still favors dense urban markets, and rural coverage remains a challenge. If the Act can meaningfully lift fiber and 5G reach across Europe, it could help ensure the AI economy extends beyond major tech hubs to the rest of the continent.

From the perspective of Europe’s startups and innovators, the DNA is a double-edged sword that tilts promisingly toward opportunity. On one side, the Act’s push to harmonize telecom rules could tear down barriers that have long frustrated young companies.

Today, a cloud services startup or an IoT device maker in Europe must navigate a maze of national regulations when scaling up, from differing network standards to separate certification hoops in each country.

By creating a more unified framework (for instance, common rules on spectrum and infrastructure access), the DNA could make it easier for a startup in Portugal to expand its services to Poland or Finland without running into 27 different regulatory roadblocks.

Startups rely on an open and predictable internet, and on this front the Commission’s approach offers some reassurance. By preserving net neutrality and rejecting new network tolls, the Act allows young companies to reach users on equal terms, without the risk that deeper-pocketed rivals can buy preferential treatment.

For small fintech or AI startups, avoiding additional network costs matters, and under the current proposal they won’t be asked to shoulder them.

At the same time, founders are reading the fine print carefully. Proposals around a “level playing field” raise concerns that telecom-style regulation could spill over onto digital services, including smaller platforms.

The balance remains fragile: regulate too little and dominant players squeeze out challengers; regulate too broadly and compliance costs can smother the next generation of European tech companies.

As an ambitious blueprint for Europe’s digital infrastructure, the Digital Networks Act embodies a careful balancing act. It must entice telecom operators to spend the billions needed to upgrade networks for an AI-driven future, yet not at the expense of the open internet or new challengers.

It seeks to unify Europe’s connectivity market while respecting that one size may not fit all in a Union of 27. In the coming months, EU lawmakers and member states will debate and tweak the proposal, and the stakes are high.

The outcome will shape not just who foots the bill for Europe’s next-gen networks, but also who can innovate on those networks in the years ahead.

There will be bumps on this road, resistance from powerful telecom lobbies, wrangling between capitals and Brussels, and possibly even transatlantic frictions.

In the end, the Digital Networks Act is about Europe’s place in the digital world. A continent that pioneered GSM mobile standards and championed data privacy now wants to set the standard for equitable, innovation-friendly networks.

Striking a balance between investment and fairness, between scale and competition, won’t be easy. But it’s essential. If the EU succeeds, the reward could be a resilient digital backbone capable of supporting AI breakthroughs and economic growth across all its regions, without leaving its core values behind.

If it stumbles, Europe risks buffering on the sidelines while others surge ahead.

The coming debate will reveal whether Europe can indeed reshape its digital DNA for the better, or if old divides will slow down this grand connectivity project.

Either way, the world will be watching the EU’s next move in this high-stakes telecom reboot.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Berlin’s energy transition sector got a defining boost today as Cloover, a climate fintech based in Berlin, announced it has secured more than $1.2 billion in total capital commitments, combining Series A equity and a substantial debt facility to accelerate the rollout of its software and financing platform across Europe.

The financing package includes €18.8 million (approximately $22 million) in Series A equity, led by MMC Ventures and QED Investors, with participation from Lowercarbon Capital, BNVT Capital, Bosch Ventures, Centrotec, and Earthshot Ventures.

Alongside that, a €1.02 billion debt facility provided by a major European bank will be deployed directly as customer and installer financing through Cloover’s platform, backed by a €300 million guarantee from the European Investment Fund to support scalable, low-cost lending for clean energy projects.

For a company that only a few years ago was in seed-stage fundraising, the scale of these commitments marks a striking shift. The debt element is operational capital designed to help manufacturers, installers, and homeowners finance solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, and other distributed energy technologies under a single unified system.

Cloover was founded in 2023 by Jodok Betschart, Peder Broms, and Valentin Gönczy, who arrived at the idea after interviewing hundreds of installers across Europe and hearing the same frustrations: fragmented software stacks, manual processes, and limited access to project financing. They saw a structural gap in the energy transition; demand for decentralised power had surged, but the financing and platform infrastructure to scale it weren’t keeping pace.

That gap is what Cloover’s platform intends to close. At its core is an integrated operating system that combines workflow management, procurement, financing, energy optimisation, and risk analytics into one environment that serves all parts of the distributed energy value chain. Installers can offer financing at the point of sale, streamline operations, and reduce administrative drag.

Homeowners, in turn, gain access to installations with lower upfront costs and financing terms linked to projected energy savings rather than traditional credit scoring.

Some investors now call Cloover the “Shopify for energy”, a digital backbone that supports the entire process of deploying distributed energy systems at scale. The model is built around scalable capital deployment combined with end-to-end software automation, including AI-driven tools for underwriting and operations.
The timing of this financing is noteworthy.

Across Europe, demand for residential solar and decentralised energy solutions is accelerating as regulatory pressure, rising electricity prices, and broader electrification trends push households and businesses toward clean alternatives. Yet installers often struggle with financing bottlenecks. Cloover’s platform embeds capital directly into the sales workflow, turning financing from a hurdle into a built-in feature.

In a statement, CEO Jodok Betschart framed the new financing as a way to enable energy independence without the friction of upfront costs or complex loan applications, noting that the company’s AI operating system connects stakeholders across the value chain.

For European climate tech and energy markets, the scale of Cloover’s backing is remarkable. Few startups in this space have bridged software infrastructure and finance at this magnitude, and the size of the debt commitment signals deep lender confidence in distributed energy as a growth asset class.

It sets a potential precedent for how renewable energy projects can be financed and adopted more quickly across the region, something both policymakers and industry leaders have identified as essential to meeting the EU’s climate goals.

            <div id="article-text">To many readers, this may sound like a paradox: how can knowledge ever become invaluable?

In this article, I want to explore how corporate knowledge, when poorly structured and rigidly transferred, can slowly transform from an asset into a disadvantage. Not only for companies, but especially for employees. And over time, that disadvantage compounds.

The journey usually looks familiar. You apply for a job, speak with a recruiter, send your CV, go through interviews, and eventually receive the green-light email: “Congratulations, you’re hired.”

This moment takes us directly to the real turning point: the onboarding process.

Those first one, two, sometimes even three months when you are introduced to the people, the tools, the workflows, the strategies, and the “way things are done.” On paper, onboarding exists to accelerate integration and performance. In reality, in many corporations, it quietly becomes an indoctrination phase.

Relatable to anyone who has worked in large organizations, onboarding often shifts from enabling understanding to enforcing conformity. New hires are not only taught what the company knows, but also what the company no longer questions.

This is where corporate knowledge starts becoming invaluable.

Because instead of acting as a foundation to build on, it becomes a ceiling.

It tells you what to do, how to do it, and more importantly, what not to rethink. Over time, this “do according to the manual” culture doesn’t just standardize execution. It standardizes thinking. And standardized thinking is the natural enemy of innovation.

History shows us a consistent pattern: breakthroughs rarely come from the center of an industry. They come from the edges.

Elon Musk was not an automotive executive. He treated cars as computers on wheels and energy systems. The result? An entire industry forced to reset its assumptions.

Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp were not transportation insiders. They were technologists. They saw GPS-enabled phones, invisible payments, and drivers that didn’t need to be owned. They reframed taxis not as a fleet problem, but as a software and trust problem. And the taxi industry, as it existed, effectively ended.

These examples point to a simple truth: transformative ideas usually emerge from new mental models, not from perfected manuals.

Yet most onboarding processes are designed to remove new mental models as quickly as possible.

They don’t ask: “What do you see that we no longer notice?”
 They ask: “How fast can you adapt to how we already work?”

Most programs teach tools, not systems. New hires learn where to click, not how to think. They are trained on CRMs, scripts, workflows, and reporting routines, but not on AI-assisted decision-making, signal-based prospecting, or how to design work alongside automated agents.

As a result, organizations scale activity instead of intelligence.

Even worse, onboarding still assumes that humans should work like software: following rigid processes, filling manual reports, executing predefined sequences. Instead of being taught how to orchestrate software, delegate to AI, and concentrate on judgment, creativity, and relationships.

Over time, this creates a paradoxical outcome: the more “knowledge” an organization accumulates, the harder it becomes for new ideas to survive inside it.

And when knowledge can no longer be challenged, recombined, or re-imagined, it stops being knowledge.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a Davos dominated by talk of tariffs, subsidies, and geopolitical risk, Europe used the stage to question its own economic limits. At the World Economic Forum, Ursula von der Leyen put forward one of the clearest signals yet that the European Union is preparing a structural shift in how it treats business, competitiveness, and economic power.

The phrase that stuck, “Europe Inc”, is not the name of a regulation, nor a new Brussels invention ready to roll out. It is a political framing for a shift that the European Commission wants to accelerate.

What Europe Inc actually refers to is an idea long discussed in EU policy circles and now pushed into the spotlight: the so-called 28th regime. An optional, EU-wide corporate framework that would sit alongside national systems and allow companies to operate across the bloc under a single legal structure.

The problem it is meant to solve is real and well-documented. Europe has a single market in theory, but in practice, companies still face 27 different company laws, registration processes, capital requirements, and administrative timelines. Startups incorporate in one country, then struggle to expand. Scaleups hit legal friction. Many leave.

The Commission’s answer is simplification through centralisation. Under the proposed 28th regime, entrepreneurs would be able to set up a company digitally, once and use that structure across the EU. One registration, one legal form, one set of rules. The ambition presented at Davos goes further: company creation within 48 hours, fully online.

That figure matters. It is also where political ambition risks being read as immediate reality.

The 48-hour setup is not in force. It is a target attached to a proposal that still needs to be formally drafted, negotiated, and approved by both the European Parliament and member states. Nothing in current EU law allows this yet. What exists is intent, not implementation.

Von der Leyen was explicit about why this push is happening now. Global conditions have hardened. Trade is increasingly weaponised. Industrial policy has returned, unapologetically, in the US and China.

Supply chain shocks and energy crises exposed Europe’s vulnerabilities. In that environment, regulatory fragmentation stops being a technical issue and becomes a strategic one.

Europe Inc is Brussels admitting that rules alone do not build power. Scale does. There is also a political recalibration underway. The EU has traditionally defined itself as a regulator first, a market shaper second.

The message from Davos suggests a change in emphasis: competitiveness, capital mobilisation, and strategic autonomy are moving closer to the centre of EU policymaking.

Still, limits remain. The 28th regime, as currently described, would be optional. It would not harmonise taxation overnight. Labour law, insolvency rules, and social policy remain largely national domains. Europe Inc would coexist with national systems, not replace them.

That coexistence is both its strength and its risk. Optional frameworks can attract fast-growing companies, but they can also deepen a two-speed Europe if not carefully designed. This tension is not resolved yet.

What Davos revealed is not a finished Europe Inc, but a Commission willing to say openly that Europe’s economic model, as it stands, is too slow for the world it operates in. Whether Europe Inc becomes a meaningful tool or another unrealised promise will depend less on slogans and more on legislation, compromise, and political courage across 27 capitals.

For now, Europe Inc is best understood as a warning shot. Europe intends to compete as a bloc, not as a collection of administrative borders. The clock, as von der Leyen implied, is already running.

            <h2>Odoo tops €7 billion valuation as General Atlantic increases stake</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/odoo-tops-7-billion-valuation">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian business software company Odoo, also a unicorn, has reached a fresh milestone. Growth investor General Atlantic has increased its stake in the firm, buying additional shares from regional backer Wallonie Entreprendre and pushing Odoo’s valuation to roughly €7 billion.

This move isn’t a typical funding round where a company raises new capital. Instead, it’s a secondary transaction: General Atlantic bought existing shares that were previously held by Wallonie Entreprendre, the investment arm of Belgium’s Walloon region. After the deal, Wallonie Entreprendre still holds about 3 % of the company.

Odoo was founded in 2002 in Belgium and has grown steadily from a small project into a global software platform. It offers an integrated suite of business applications used by small and medium-sized enterprises for everything from finance and sales to HR and marketing.

The software is built on an open-core model that encourages developers around the world to build add-on apps, creating a vast ecosystem of nearly 40,000 extensions.

Today, Odoo counts more than 170,000 paying customers in around 180 countries. That global footprint and the steady revenue growth it has delivered helped convince General Atlantic to deepen its involvement.

Since first investing in the company in 2023, the firm has supported Odoo’s expansion into new markets and helped refine its commercial strategy.

Part of what makes this update noteworthy is how Odoo has expanded its product offerings. Its newest versions include AI-infused features and automation tools that make the suite more attractive to businesses looking to replace outdated, fragmented systems with a single, unified digital platform.

For the European tech scene, this development highlights a shift in how successful software companies grow and attract capital. Rather than chasing quick exits or IPOs, some founders are choosing secondary share deals to let early investors realise gains while keeping strategic control.

That path can make it easier for companies to stay private longer and focus on building value over time.

I don’t know what is happening in Belgium or what they are having for breakfast, but the country itself has quietly become a place where software businesses can scale internationally.

Odoo is one of its standout success stories, showing that strong product focus, community-driven development, and global reach can win serious backing from major growth investors.
