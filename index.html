            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/how-europes-new-carbon-tax-on-imported-goods-will-change-global-trade/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For people living in the European Union, the price of their next car, home renovation, and even local produce may soon reflect a climate policy that many have never even heard of. This new regulation, which comes fully into force on New Year’s Day, does not just target heavy industry—it affects everyday goods which now face an added carbon cost when they enter Europe.

The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) puts a carbon price on many imported goods—meaning that EU-based importers will pay for the greenhouse gases emitted during the production of certain carbon-intensive materials.

If goods come from countries with weaker climate rules, then the charge will be higher. To sell to the EU, producers will effectively need to show their goods aren’t too carbon-intensive.

The goal is to prevent companies from relocating their production to places with looser regulations, ensuring fair competition between EU and non-EU companies, while incentivising global decarbonisation.

After a trial phase, full payment obligations begin on January 1 2026, when importers will need to buy CBAM certificates to cover the embedded emissions in goods such as iron and steel, aluminium, cement, fertilisers, hydrogen and (eventually) electricity.

Although it is an EU climate policy, CBAM looks set to be a game-changer for global trade. Countries that rely on EU exports may need to make costly investments in cleaner technologies and better emissions tracking, or risk losing market share. The UK government plans to introduce its own version of CBAM in 2027—although how this links to the EU’s is yet to be decided.

A positive shift is already underway: more and more companies are now measuring and reporting their emissions accurately, responding to the growing demand for reliable carbon data. At the same time, an increasing number of countries are introducing their own carbon pricing systems to stay aligned with the EU and protect the competitiveness of their exports.

Morocco is a prominent example: its 2025 finance law gradually introduces a carbon tax from January 2026. As Moroccan firms will already pay a carbon price domestically, their exports are likely to avoid additional CBAM charges at the EU border, helping them remain competitive.

In many countries, CBAM is also accelerating interest in renewable energy and greener industrial processes. Some see it not as a threat, but an opportunity to attract investment and position themselves as low-carbon manufacturing hubs.

However, this mechanism is still controversial. For businesses, CBAM is complex and administratively heavy. Firms need robust systems to measure embedded emissions, collect data from suppliers, and produce environmental product declarations. Many will also need new renewable energy contracts to cut their carbon footprint.

Around the world, CBAM has faced strong criticism. India and China describe it as “green protectionism,” arguing that it puts unfair pressure on developing economies. At the same time, the EU has not yet created dedicated funding to help exporters in lower-income countries adapt. Without this support, the mechanism may not achieve the desired results.

Although CBAM is mainly aimed at industry, its ripple effects will reach consumers in the EU. Importers are unlikely to absorb the full additional cost, meaning prices are likely to rise—particularly for goods that rely heavily on steel, aluminium, or cement. This could mean Europe sees higher costs for cars, home appliances, electronics, building materials, and, indirectly, food production (through fertilizers).

At the same time, CBAM may bring more transparency. Because importers must report the emissions embedded in their goods, consumers may eventually have clearer information about the climate impact of what they buy.

The mechanism will also generate EU revenues from certificate sales. These are expected to support vulnerable households in many European countries, as well as funding clean technologies and improving energy efficiency. How the funds are used will be crucial to public acceptance of Europe’s new carbon tax.

Even before full implementation, CBAM is already reshaping supply chains and influencing government policies far beyond Europe’s borders. It may trigger trade disputes, push exporters to adopt carbon pricing, and highlight the need for more climate finance to support developing countries undergoing green industrial transitions.

For many European consumers, it’s likely to mean gradual price increases—and potentially, more climate-conscious purchasing decisions. Behind the scenes, it marks a significant shift in how global trade accounts for carbon—and how climate policy reaches into people’s everyday lives.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/12/google-lobs-lawsuit-at-search-result-scraping-firm-serpapi/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google has filed a lawsuit to protect its search results, targeting a firm called SerpApi that has turned Google’s 10 blue links into a business. According to Google, SerpApi ignores established law and Google’s terms to scrape and resell its search engine results pages (SERPs). This is not the first action against SerpApi, but Google’s decision to go after a scraper could signal a new, more aggressive stance on protecting its search data.

SerpApi and similar firms do fulfill a need, but they sit in a legal gray area. Google does not provide an API for its search results, which are based on the world’s largest and most comprehensive web index. That makes Google’s SERPs especially valuable in the age of AI. A chatbot can’t summarize web links if it can’t find them, which has led companies like Perplexity to pay for SerpApi’s second-hand Google data. That prompted Reddit to file a lawsuit against SerpApi and Perplexity for grabbing its data from Google results.

Google is echoing many of the things Reddit said when it publicized its lawsuit earlier this year. The search giant claims it’s not just doing this to protect itself—it’s also about protecting the websites it indexes. In Google’s blog post on the legal action, it says SerpApi “violates the choices of websites and rightsholders about who should have access to their content.”

It’s worth noting that Google has a partnership with Reddit that pipes data directly into Gemini. As a result, you’ll often see Reddit pages cited in the chatbot’s outputs. As Google points out, it abides by “industry-standard crawling protocols” to collect the data that appears on its SERPs, but those sites didn’t agree to let SerpApi scrape their data from Google. So while you could reasonably argue that Google’s lawsuit helps protect the rights of web publishers, it also explicitly protects Google’s business interests.

The kind of data scraping that SerpApi uses is not new—Google has simply put up with it until now. However, the company claims that SerpApi’s deceptive behavior, like spoofing user agents and hammering sites with armies of bots, has increased significantly over the past year. That may have something to do with the ever-growing hunger for search data in the AI era.

Google is coming out of its antitrust cases relatively unscathed so far, which affects the availability of its data. It has avoided the harshest remedies, like the government’s demand that Google offer search data to competitors. That might have turned businesses like SerpApi legit, but with that no longer an option, Google may feel emboldened to unleash the lawyers.

While Google paints this as a benevolent action, it stands to benefit by stopping SERP scrapers. However, this may make some of Google’s competitors happy, too. Since the search giant doesn’t offer an official API for search (and the courts declined to force the issue), SERP scraping provides a way for companies to get Google’s search data on the down-low. This reduces demand for the handful of other web indexes that do have APIs, including Brave and Bing. Without illicit search APIs, chatbots may have to lean on official data sources.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The trade-off between quality and quantity is a fundamental economic dilemma. Now, a team of British, American, and Japanese researchers describes how it applies to biology, as well. They have discovered that this dilemma most likely shaped the evolutionary trajectory of ants, one of Earth’s most successful groups of organisms.

Their study reveals that, as ant societies grew in complexity and numbers, they didn’t just make their workers smaller—they also made them cheaper.

In the insect world, the exoskeleton known as the cuticle serves as a protective barrier against predators, pathogens, and desiccation, while providing the structural framework for muscle attachment. But this protection comes at a price. Building a robust cuticle requires significant amounts of nitrogen and rare minerals like zinc and manganese. While skimping on armor for an individual insect may be a death sentence, the evolution of ants apparently found a way around it.

“There’s this question in biology of what happens to individuals as societies they are in get more complex?” said Evan Economo, an entomologist at the University of Maryland and co-author of the study. “For example, the individuals may themselves become simpler because tasks that a solitary organism would need to complete can be handled by a collective.”

Economo’s team hypothesized that the metabolic balance behind investing in cuticles in social insects like ants could favor the collective over the individual. The idea was that a colony of 10,000 workers could lose a few individuals to a predator without much consequence, so investing heavily in each worker’s defenses would seem like a waste of precious nutrients. To test this hypothesis, they examined whether ant lineages that maintain massive, specialized workforces reduce the investment in their individual workers’ exoskeletons.

To test this idea, the researchers needed to pull off a comparative study on the anatomy of ants at an unprecedented scale. “We worked with scans of ant specimens and species from all over the world to capture the global diversity of ants,” Economo says. The team used a massive database called Antscan, which contains three-dimensional X-ray microtomography imaging of ants from around the globe.

Microtomography works similarly to medical CT scans, but at a vastly higher resolution. Still, on its own, the technique could only generate lots of precise data—it still had to be interpreted. Parsing through 3D imagery of over 880 specimens, including workers, queens, and males belonging to over 500 different species, was another challenge. “The 3D scanning itself is a very advanced technology,” says Arthur Matte, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the study. “But once you have the ants in three dimensions, it’s still very hard to segment manually every tissue you’re interested in.”

To solve this, Matte developed a computer vision algorithm for “unsupervised segmentation.” Because the cuticle is always the outermost tissue of an arthropod, the algorithm could automatically identify and measure the volume of the exoskeleton across all ants in the dataset.

The first thing scientists noticed when the results poured in was that cuticle investment varied wildly, ranging from 6 percent to 35 percent of an ant’s total body volume. So, the next thing they focused on was figuring out the reasons behind these variations.

The team started checking how factors like diet, temperature, humidity, and foraging style correlated with the size of the cuticle. To get a handle on this, segmented 3D scans were fed into evolutionary models. “One of the most insightful things we did was to individually remove such variables from the models to estimate their contributions to the final cuticle investment,” Matte explains. This way, scientists learned that temperature was responsible for just 12 percent of variation in cuticle size and diet—especially its nitrogen content—explained another 37 percent. But the factor that had the strongest impact on the model was the colony size.

Ants that invested less in their cuticle tended to have significantly larger colony sizes. More surprisingly, this reduction in cuticle investment and the resulting increase in colony size appeared to be associated with higher diversification rates. In biological terms, squishier ants could evolve to occupy new niches much faster than their heavily armored cousins. “Requiring less nitrogen could make these ants more versatile and able to conquer new environments,” Matte suggests. This efficiency may have allowed ants to transition from a diet of high-protein prey to more abundant but less nutritious liquid sugar sources, like honeydew or floral nectar.

“Ants reduce per-worker investment in one of the most nutritionally expensive tissues for the good of the collective,” Matte explains. “They’re shifting from self-investment toward a distributed workforce.”

The researchers think the pattern they observed in ants reflects a more universal trend in the evolution of societal complexity. The transition from solitary life to complex societies echoes the transition from single-celled organisms to multicellular ones.

In a single-celled organism, a cell must be a “jack-of-all-trades,” performing every function necessary for survival. In a multicellular animal, however, individual cells often become simpler and more specialized, relying on the collective for protection and resources.

“It’s a pattern that echoes the evolution of multicellularity, where cooperative units can be individually simpler than a solitary cell, yet collectively capable of far greater complexity,” says Matte. Still, the question of whether underinvesting in individuals to boost the collective makes sense for creatures other than ants remains open, and it most likely isn’t as much about nutritional economics as it is about sex.

The study focused on ants that already have a reproductive division of labor, one where workers do not reproduce. This social structure is likely the key prerequisite for the cheap worker strategy. For the team, this is the reason we haven’t, at least so far, found similar evolutionary patterns in more complex social organisms like wolves, which live in packs—or humans with their amazingly complex societies. Wolves and people are both social, but maintain a high degree of individual self-interest regarding reproduction. Ant workers could be made expendable because they don’t pass their own genes—they are essentially extensions of the queen’s reproductive strategy.

Before looking for signs of ant-like approaches to quality versus quantity dilemmas in other species, the team wants to take an even closer look at ants. Economo, Matte, and their colleagues seek to expand their analysis to other ant tissues, such as the nervous system and muscles, to see if the cheapening of individuals extends beyond the exoskeleton. They are also looking at ant genomes to see what genetic innovations allowed for the shift from quality to quantity.  “We still need a lot of work to understand ants’ evolution,” Matte says.

            <h2>Rats Successfully Trained to Shoot Demons in “Doom”</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-21</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 2020, Hungarian software engineer and neuroscientist Viktor Tóth came up with a fascinating experiment. With the use of a bootstrap experimental setup consisting of a large polystyrene ball, a curved computer monitor, and a small straw that dispenses sugar water, Tóth managed to teach a rat how to play the classic 1994 video game Doom II.

The rat’s movements translated into rotations of the ball, which were then translated into movement inside the iconic first-person shooter. The sugar water served as a treat whenever the rat completed a milestone, like walking down a corridor.

Half a decade later, Tóth’s setup has received a major upgrade, giving the daring demon-slaying rats an entirely newfound level of immersion. That’s in large part thanks to a small, foldable AMOLED screen that stretches across 180 degrees of the rat’s vision — and a plethora of custom, 3D printed parts.

An image Tóth and his collaborators — electrical engineer Sándor Makra and student Ákos Blaschek — shared on the project’s website, ratsplaydoom.com, shows a black and white rat cowering on the ball while staring at a VR goggles-like screen warped around most of its head that “maximizes immersion without obstructing whisker space.”

Best of all, the V2 system now allows the rats to shoot at demons in the video game thanks to a “custom-built hand-operated lever” which the rodents can pull “with their paws to fire.”

After the major upgrade, the rats “successfully learned to navigate the virtual environment and trigger the shooting mechanism,” according to the project’s website. “Habituation took approximately two weeks per rat.”

To simulate the rat plowing into walls inside the video game, the team even installed two small air nozzles to deliver “targeted air puffs on command.”

In case you were wondering at this point why they’re doing all of this, there unfortunately isn’t a clear answer. For one, this strictly isn’t an advanced brain computer interface (BCI) experiment that involves scanning the rat’s brain waves.

“The idea just came out of basically nowhere,” Tóth told Futurism back in 2021. “I was just like, ‘Why not?&#39;”

Nonetheless, he argued that the experiment is “very relevant” to BCIs, a space he’s “trying to get into in the long run.”

As for why he chose Doom II specifically, Tóth told Futurism at the time that the game has a “very easy to edit map” that can be modified for the rats to take on.

For now, he acknowledges, the rats still have a lot of learning to do before they can take on the game’s single-player campaign.

“While advanced training wasn’t completed due to time constraints, initial data showed promising engagement with the system,” the website notes.

However, the rats may need a break every once in a while, as the “impact of prolonged VR exposure on rat well-being needs further research.”

            <h2>YouTube Now Shutting Down Channels Posting AI Slop</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">YouTube’s janitors are swooping in to mop up the slop.

As reported by Deadline, the Google-owned video platform has terminated two massive YouTube channels that peddled fake, AI-generated movie trailers, in what is one of the most high profile actions it’s taken against the AI spam polluting the platform.

Combined, the channels — called Screen Culture, based in India, and KH Studio, based in the US — boasted over two million subscribers and more than one billion views.

“The monster was defeated,” one YouTuber told Deadline after the slop channels were taken down.

Whatever your thoughts on AI imagery, these channels weren’t using the tech to innocently envision some fanboy’s dream casting. They were unquestionably farming engagement by using AI shots spliced together with actual copyrighted movie footage to trick viewers, per Deadline, and then posting the fake trailers early to drown out the real ones. In March, for example, Screen Culture churned out an outrageous 23 different trailers for “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” with some of them outranking the official trailer, Deadline found.

Why is YouTube banning them now? The channels, apparently, had gotten cocky. YouTube had quietly suspended their ability to make ad revenue after a Deadline investigation earlier this year, but were able to claw back ad money after adding “fan trailer,” “parody,” and “concept trailer” to their video titles. But, for reasons unknown, both slop slingers stopped including those disclaimers in recent months, thus inviting the ban hammer.

The decision comes as AI continues to make inroads into the actual movie industry — and as AI-spoofed trailers become a hot button issue. Users of OpenAI’s video generating app Sora have been churning out loads of AI-spoofed Disney trailers, including a Pixar-style animation about Jeffrey Epstein inviting children to his “amazing” island — a trend that didn’t seem to bother Disney when it announced it would invest $1 billion into OpenAI and officially license its characters for Sora last week.

What this means for the rest of all the other slop polluting YouTube is unclear. The platform is still overrun with AI-generated music, hours-long informational videos presented in a “boring” or “sleepy” style, and even veritable snuff films. Some are using AI to impersonate public figures, garnering hundreds of thousands of views. What probably happened here is that the AI movie trailer channels simply played fast and loose with copyright laws for too long, ticked off the wrong IP owners, and got kicked to the curb. And good riddance.

            <div id="article-text">In 2025, there seem to be as many narratives about AI as there are startups peddling the stuff. Will it transform society into a utopia, freeing us from all responsibilities, or will it come to life and kill us all? And who benefits from those outcomes, anyway?

According to esteemed sociologist Tressie McMillan Cottom, the answer is clear: no matter which way you slice it, the AI future is for the rich.

“When people try to sell you on the idea that the future is already settled, it’s because it is deeply unsettled,” Cottom said in a recent panel at the Urban Consulate in Detroit. “I think that, y’know this promise of an artificial intelligence future, is really just a collective anxiety that very wealthy, powerful people have about how well they’re gonna be able to control us.”

“If they can get us to accept that the future is already settled — AI is already here, the end is already here — then we will create that for them,” Cottom continued. “My most daring idea is to refuse,” she said to applause.

Cottom cuts to the heart of an issue that both AI doomers and AI boosters seem to take for granted: that an AI-dominated future isn’t inevitable.

Given the development plateau tech companies seem to be running into these days, a future built on large language models (LLMs) is far from a lock. (Consider, for example, the fact that after a very recent December update, ChatGPT couldn’t even generate an accurate alphabet poster for preschoolers.)

“The proposal for a post-human future is one where there will be human beings who will just be treated inhumanely,” Cottom said. “We’re not going to stop making people or humans, they’re just saying we’re not going to treat you as humans. And I refuse. And I think that we all can.”

Cottom points to the historical record — for example, the fact that chattel slavery was at one time seen as a preordained fact of life, a myth spread by the wealthiest members of that bygone age. “I think that being Black is an act of refusal, I think we know how to refuse,” she told the audience. “I think that everybody else needs to learn it from us.”

And while Cottom’s contention is a bleak one — the idea that the most powerful billionaires in the world are using AI to seize total control of humanity — she isn’t short on hope. “I think refusing is actually the more hopeful, expansion vision of the future, than the one that is telling us that the future is already settled and decided. That’s my daring idea.”

            <h2>Israel’s famed VC Jon Medved, diagnosed with ALS, backed the tech that will improve his life</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/21/israels-famed-vc-jon-medved-diagnosed-with-als-backed-the-tech-that-will-improve-his-life/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Years ago, when venture capitalist Jon Medved took an interest in backing various health tech startups, he had no idea that one day, he would need them to improve his own quality of life.

Israel tight-knit startup community received a blow in October when Medved, one of its most famous VCs, announced he was retiring immediately. He was forced to step down from the firm he founded, OurCrowd, after he was diagnosed with the debilitating disease of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS,) also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.

“This has come rather sudden,” he told TechCrunch in an audibly hoarse voice — a symptom of ALS — on what could be his last interview.

“I had been feeling a little weird before and they didn’t know what was ailing me,” he explained. “I was in the hospital for several weeks recovering, and that’s when they tested me and said, ‘You’ve got ALS,’ which is a horrible disease, the worst you can imagine.”

ALS is a condition that degrades the brain’s motor neurons, leading to loss of muscle control, eventually impairing walking, talking, eating, and breathing. He didn’t have the classic symptoms, as his voice was attacked first, not his extremities, he said. But he knows that the condition will worsen, and there is no cure, only therapies.

Medved is considered one of the fathers of Israel’s startup ecosystem — often called “Startup Nation” after the decades-old best-selling book of the same name. He helped usher it in, having moved from California to Israel in his 20s, then founding and selling several tech companies before turning to investing.

In 2013, he founded OurCrowd. While Israel has many powerful home-grown VC firms, as well as branches of global firms like Bessemer, OurCrowd essentially invented crowdsourced venture capital, where a limited partnership was open to any accredited investor.

The firm’s roster attracted LPs from Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America, growing a network of 240,000 accredited investor LPs in 195 countries, the firm says. Many of them are doctors, lawyers, and ordinary people who not only help their investment companies, but would have otherwise been cut out of the wealth generation that VCs experience.

OurCrowd has backed names like Anthropic, Beyond Meat and Lemonade.

Medved describes OurCrowd as now a “significant player” backing about 500 portfolio companies with about 74 exits, including an exit a couple of weeks ago when its infrastructure planning startup Locusview sold for $525 million to Itron.

Despite Israel’s conflict with Gaza, which has impacted its citizens and put the nation in global crosshairs over the Palestinian humanitarian crisis, its startup ecosystem has remained strong.

As the “startup nation,” Israel remains a key player for cybersecurity and defense tech as well as AI, microchips, enterprise software, food tech, health tech — the whole tech stack. For example, in November, there was “$800 million invested in the Israeli venture ecosystem in one week,” Medved said. The country now has nearly 100 unicorns and over the year, he estimates that between $15 billion and $16 billion was invested in the country in venture deals.

Now the tech of some of these startups will help him navigate life with an incurable condition.

For instance, he’s had an avatar made of himself that preserves his voice, face and mannerisms. (The photo/video realistic digital twin is pictured and the full video can be seen here.) OurCrowd AI portfolio company D-ID, maker of agents and avatars, partnered with voice AI startup ElevenLabs and other companies through the ALS-focused Scott-Morgan Foundation to create an avatar system designed for people with ALS.

He just experienced this tech during a Zoom call with another person who has ALS who was using the avatar to communicate.

“So this stuff has become very, very personal to me,” Medved said. “It will preserve my voice when it goes.”

But he said there will be a variety of startups tech he will lean on.

“We’ve made 60, 70 healthcare investments in good companies that help people. We’ve got a company called OncoHost, which uses AI to help select what kind of immunotherapy will actually work for you …  We have companies doing next-generation sequencing for the genome. We have companies doing chronic condition management,” he catalogs.

“I tell you now as a once-healthy person [who took health for granted] I felt human pain and disease, but once you are actually engaged in one of these nasty diseases, it changes your perspective,” Medved shared.

All of this means that, even though he’s given up his position running the company and may be retiring from the public eye, “I’m far from over, ok? I want to continue to contribute, both to OurCrowd and the overall ecosystem. So I fully intend to not go off [quietly] into this good night.”

And in the end, he says “I’m very proud that in a small way, even though all we are is investors, to be part of this movement.” A video featuring Medved’s “digital twin” demonstrates just how realistic his avatar already is.

            <div id="article-text">Law firms representing Google and Apple have warned that employees who need a visa stamp to re-enter the United States should avoid leaving the country due to longer-than-usual visa processing times, according to Business Insider.

BI says it has viewed memos from BAL Immigration Law (which represents Google) and Fragomen (which represents Apple).

“Given the recent updates and the possibility of unpredictable, extended delays when returning to the U.S., we strongly recommend that employees without a valid H-1B visa stamp avoid international travel for now,” the Fragomen memo reportedly said.

A State Department spokesperson told BI that embassies are “now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else.”

Salon also reports that “hundreds” of Indian professionals who traveled home to renew their U.S. work visas in December have had their U.S. embassy appointments canceled or rescheduled due to new requirements for social media vetting.

TechCrunch has reached out to Google and Apple for comment. Both companies, along with other large tech employers, issued similar warnings in September when the White House announced that employers would have to pay a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/20/it-felt-so-wrong-colin-angle-on-irobot-the-ftc-and-the-amazon-deal-that-never-was/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When iRobot filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last Sunday, it marked the end of an era for one of America’s most beloved robotics companies. The Roomba maker, which had sold over 50 million robots since its 2002 launch, had survived 35 years of near-death experiences and technical challenges only to be undone by what founder Colin Angle calls “avoidable” regulatory opposition.

The collapse followed Amazon’s January 2024 decision to scuttle its $1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot after 18 months of investigation by the FTC and European regulators. In this candid conversation, Angle reflects on what he describes as a profoundly frustrating process, the chilling message it sends to entrepreneurs, and his determination to move forward with a new venture in consumer robotics.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

TC: You called the bankruptcy “avoidable” and a “tragedy for consumers.” Walk me through what you think regulators got wrong in blocking the Amazon acquisition.

CA: I think there’s a real lesson around the role of the FTC and the European Commission. The goal, of course, is to avoid the abuses that can happen in monopolies and with the goal of protecting consumer choice and protecting innovation.

What happened was that iRobot and Amazon came together for the expressed purpose of creating more innovation, more consumer choice, at a time when iRobot’s trajectory was honestly different from where it was several years earlier. In the EU, we had a 12% market share [but it was] declining where the number one competitor was only three years old in the market, which is nearly the definition of a vibrant and dynamic marketplace. And in the United States, iRobot’s market share was higher, but it was declining and there were multiple growing competitors bringing outside innovation into the marketplace.

This should have been a no-brainer. This should have been three, four weeks of investigation. What happened instead was a year and a half of pendency, which had a very challenging impact on the ability to operate a company and ultimately having the acquisition blocked.

What was that 18-month process actually like? What were you being asked to do?

The amount of money and time spent was indescribable. I would not be surprised if over 100,000 documents were created and delivered. iRobot invested a significant part of our discretionary earnings against fulfilling the requirements that went along with doing the transaction. Amazon was forced to invest many, many, many times that. There was a whole team, both internal and external employees and lawyers and economists working to try to, in as many different ways as possible — because it seemed like our message was falling on deaf ears — demonstrate that this acquisition was not going to create a monopolistic situation.

There was daily activity for 18 months associated with this. Perhaps most telling, when I was testifying as part of being deposed, I had a chance to walk the halls of the FTC. The examiners on their office doors had printouts of deals blocked, like trophies.

To me, it felt so wrong as an entrepreneur who started this thing literally in my living room and lived six and a half years never having enough money in the bank to make payroll, finally making it through succeeding. Here’s an agency whose stated mission is protecting consumer interests and helping the United States economy, celebrating as victories every time they shut down M&A, which in a very real way is the primary driver of value creation for the innovation economy.

I went into this deposition looking for a friend. It’s like, “Here we are, we’re obviously not in a stronger place, and here’s a great opportunity for us. Are you excited for us?” Maybe this is just my naïve take coming out, but that’s not the reception I got. It was, “Why should we ever let them do this?” It’s like: because it’s good for the consumer — because it’s going to catalyze innovation.

How do you think what happened here changes the calculus for startup founders who see acquisition as their exit strategy? Do you think we’re in a world where American tech companies can’t scale through M&A?

Risk has a chilling effect. If you’re an entrepreneur, your only option is to hope that it doesn’t happen again. The reason you and I are talking is I hope by my words I can make it less likely that it will happen again.

I founded a new company and my outlook on exit strategy and even commercialization strategy is impacted by the experiences I had at iRobot. How can it not be? That precedent creates risk of it happening again, and only through positive experiences do we start to dial down the anxiety that the exits I’m depending on — or as a venture capitalist, the exits I’m investing in assuming will happen — will actually come through. That risk is factored into the willingness to invest, the valuation of deals, and the rate of new company formation.

It’s hard to say there’s X percent fewer entrepreneurial starts or exits as a result of the chilling message, but it certainly didn’t help. Entrepreneurs can use every leg up that we as a nation can provide. It is a rugged journey. When it actually works out, it should be a celebration. The FTC is there as a safeguard against very real examples of things gone too far. I’m a big believer in checks and balances. But when things get out of whack, the country suffers.

Let’s talk about iRobot’s journey. The Roomba didn’t come out for 12 years after the company was founded. Tell me about those early days.

iRobot was a bunch of people in an academic lab saying, “We were promised robots. Where are the robots?” If I could be pissed off that I don’t have the robots we were promised, I should do something about it. If not us, who? If not now, when?

One of the co-founders, my professor Rod Brooks, had pioneered an AI technology which allowed the embedding of machine intelligence in low-cost robotics. The mission of the company was to build cool stuff, deliver a great product, have fun, make money, and change the world.

The first business plan was “private mission to the moon, sell the movie rights.” We were maybe the first company to fail to do exactly that. But the technology we developed led to additions to the Mars Pathfinder mission — my name’s up on Mars. We built robots that went into the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon disaster. We built the PackBot, which was the first robot ever deployed in a combat mission for the US Army, went into caves in Afghanistan, and became the primary methodology for diffusing improvised explosive devices. We would get postcards: “You saved my life today.”

When the Fukushima disaster happened, we donated half a million dollars worth of robots to Japan. We sent six people over to train Tokyo Electric Power Company employees. Those robots were the first inside the reactor doors, mapped out radiation levels, and found a path where an employee could run in, get to the control room, work for a minute and a half, run back out, and only receive a lifetime dose of radiation. We were credited with enabling the shutdown of the reactor.

I had a team that was working on toys, and one of the guys said, “Colin, I think it’s time we can do this. We can finally make the vacuum.” I’m like, “Okay, here’s $15,000. Two weeks. See what you can do.” Two weeks later they came back and said, “Hey, that’s not bad. Maybe there’s something here.” We scraped and found a little bit of money [to build these]. A year and a half later, I convinced my board that we could build 10,000 of these robots and we launched them.

It’s really the media that picked up the story. We had no money for marketing. Reporters were fascinated because we tended to do interesting things that were real, and they couldn’t believe that robot vacuuming could possibly be real. [The reaction was:] “My God, it actually worked.” We ended up selling 70,000 robots in the first three months. Then we nearly went out of business the next year.

Because we screwed up. The press drove this huge initial demand — 70,000 robots. So next year we’re going to do four times that. We made 300,000 robots. We even made a television commercial, but we were a bunch of geek engineers, so it totally failed. After Cyber Monday we were sitting with 250,000 robots in our warehouse like, “Oh my God, the world’s going to end.”

Then something good happened. The guy running our website said, “Why did sales quadruple yesterday?” We hadn’t done anything. What had happened was Pepsi had started running a TV ad with Dave Chappelle. He walks into this beautiful home, picks up a potato chip, and a Roomba comes out. He’s like, “A vacuum cleaner!” He throws down the potato chip, the vacuum eats it, then chases him. His pants are ripped off. He stands up in boxers. A beautiful woman appears, and he says, “Your vacuum cleaner ate my pants.” We sold 250,000 robots in two weeks and realized we knew nothing about marketing.

Wow! You had no idea Pepsi was incorporating your product into its commercial?

No idea. It was wild. You try to do good for so long and you get smacked in the face so many times, and then sometimes something good happens. You could say because of that crazy moment in time, we have robots. When we think about just how fragile a journey it is — cats riding Roombas was a big part of why we succeeded. Does that make any sense? No, not at all. But we certainly didn’t expect tens of billions of views of cats riding Roombas.

At some point you started seeing Chinese competitors like Roborock and Ecovacs adopting lidar navigation years before iRobot. Why did you stick with vision-based navigation for so long?

We explicitly did not put lasers on the robot. We had the technology decades ago because it’s a dead-end technology. Under my strategic direction, we were going to invest every penny of cost against a vision-based nav and situational understanding system. Your Tesla does not have a laser on it. It is all vision-based. At least Elon agrees with me.

Our strategic plan was for Roomba to be much more than just a vacuum cleaner in the home. To do that, it needs to understand more. Lasers are not advanced technology — they’ve been around for decades. They’re an expedient solution to a subset of the problems that a robot at home needs to take on. A laser will never tell you whether you actually cleaned the floor or not.

It is absolutely true that Chinese competition was coming in at lower price points. We were late in building a two-in-one robot — we believed that by separating mopping and vacuuming you could give a better customer experience. The customer voted that we were wrong, and that’s okay. We certainly were first in auto-evac, first in navigation. We were also importantly excluded from the Chinese marketplace, which is the largest market for consumer robotics in the world. That didn’t help.

What learnings from your iRobot experience would you share with other robotics entrepreneurs?

The first thing I tell all robotics entrepreneurs is: make sure you understand your market so that you are building something that delivers more value than it costs to create. Robots are so exciting, so sexy that it’s really easy to convince yourself that you’re doing something that is going to change the world, if only consumers were smart enough to realize it. That’s a pretty tough equation.

Technology is oftentimes in the robot space well ahead of the business plans that can take advantage of the technology. One of the traps is thinking of robotics as a thing as opposed to a toolkit. As soon as you say, “I’m going to build a robot,” and head off building your humanoid — are you really doing it because you understand a problem you’re trying to solve, or are you enamored with building your thing?

When I started iRobot, it was just assumed that robots were going to vacuum floors by building humanoids to push upright vacuum cleaners. When we first built Roomba, we would ask people, “Is that a robot?” People would say, “No, that’s not a robot. A robot has arms and legs and a head.” Yet Roomba at the time cost 10,000 times less than a humanoid pushing an upright vacuum.

The challenge of entrepreneurship is breaking through the romance and opportunity and falling in love with your technology and getting to the application that you’re trying to solve. Understand your consumer, understand the problem you’re trying to solve — because it’s complicated, robotics is expensive, and it takes a lot of energy to get right.

You mentioned you’ve founded a new company. What can you tell me about it?

We’re in stealth mode, but I’ll give you a broad hint. It’s consumer-facing. We’re really looking at the fact that most of the things robots can do to meet outstanding needs require us to interact with other people. So how do we build a robot that actually has sufficient emotional sophistication — not human-level, but enough — to build an enduring co-character that can make sense over time and use that for health and wellness related applications?

It’s going to be awesome. I’m so excited about it. It’s given me enthusiasm and energy to have a chance to use this new toolkit and continue on my journey to build the robots we were promised. I really haven’t changed that much from a grad student in college saying, “Oh my God, we’ve been promised robots and we don’t have the ones that I want yet.” I spent 30 years focused on building the world’s greatest floor care robot, and now I have a chance to do something else.

            <h2>The Island Without Time</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/12/sommaroy-norway-island-time-clock/684894/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the sun rises on May 18 in the small Norwegian fishing village of Sommarøy, located above the Arctic Circle, it doesn’t set again until July 26. Later in the year, it vanishes from November until January.

In the winter, the island is covered in snow. But during the midnight sun, the weather is temperate, even hot. Purple wildflowers stick out of mossy grass, and the electric-blue water and white sand look more Caribbean than Arctic. Walking along the coast around 11 p.m., you might see kayakers paddling on the smooth sea in the distance, or children in pajamas fishing and running along the beach with their catches.

Inspired by the extreme periods of light and dark, in late spring 2019, a group of locals signed a petition to make the village the first “time-free zone,” a place where anyone could buy groceries, cut grass, or eat dinner no matter the time. Their reasoning made sense enough: In a town where the sun shines at 1 a.m. in July and you can see the stars at 1 p.m. in December, the time on the clock is meaningless. International media seized on the time-free zone as a curiosity, and the town leaned into the branding, flaunting its freedom from the clock and inviting others to experience it. The realities of how to run a business, coordinate work, and have a social life without time went unmentioned; what mattered was the fantasy of a time- and stress-free life.

Some semblance of time does exist on Sommarøy. The grocery store, which is the only true store in town, has opening and closing hours, as does the café on the beach. The hotel has regular check-in and check-out times. People have cellphones that tell time.

Yet when I visited in July, the island was deep into its nightless rhythm, and I saw signs that the clock held little sway. When I tried to schedule a meeting with Olivier Pitras—the 65-year-old owner of a bed-and-breakfast and a kayak-rental company that gives midnight tours—he told me to simply drop by his shop and see if he was available. To achieve even further immersion in the time-free life, I obscured the clocks on my phone and my laptop and blocked the time of incoming email. The night I arrived, I walked around the entire island at an easy pace. The colors in the sky resembled sunlight I was familiar with seeing at 7 or 8 o’clock in the morning. But was it actually 8 p.m.? Midnight?

For nine days, I attempted to live outside of time in a white wooden house with a wraparound porch. On any other trip, I would probably sit outside in the evenings and watch the sun set. Instead, the sun moved in a circle over my head, like it was caught in the loop of a spinning lasso.

The desire to get rid of the clock entirely cuts against a very human impulse to control, predict, and measure time. The Babylonians used the moon to mark out a 19-year cycle in which seven years contained 13 months and the others, 12. Ancient Egyptians once kept track of time by the rise and fall of the Nile River. Indigenous groups in Siberia have a loose lunar calendar organized by months with names such as “ducks-and-geese-go-away month.” In the Trobriand Islands, the new year traditionally begins when marine worms swarm on the surface of the water to breed. Near Sommarøy, the Indigenous people who live in northern Norway, the Sámi, have eight seasons that follow reindeer migration.

But the more a society trades and travels, the more it must adapt its time system to be consistent and coordinated. Hours of uniform length were widely adopted only in the 14th century, when clocks could maintain equal durations. (Previously, dividing periods of sunlight into 12 hours, as the Romans did, meant the length of those hours would vary seasonally.) “There are few greater revolutions in human experience than this movement from the seasonal or ‘temporary’ hour to the equal hour,” the historian Daniel J. Boorstin wrote in his book The Discoverers. “Here was man’s declaration of independence from the sun, new proof of his mastery over himself and his surroundings.” In 1967, the clock’s divorce from the natural world was finalized: The International Bureau of Weights and Measures adopted a definition of a second measured by the oscillations of a cesium atom, rather than a fraction of the solar day.

Sommarøy’s time-free zone was, in a sense, an attempt by residents to reclaim their connection to a more natural measure of time. After all, every year, the island experiences roughly 1,656 hours of consecutive daylight. It’s almost as if humans moved to Mercury, where the day—noon to noon—lasts 176 Earth days, but never adjusted their watches.

The idea of tossing clock time out the window clearly had wide appeal: Nearly 1,500 news outlets around the world covered the 2019 petition that proposed the time-free zone. Kjell Ove Hveding, a Sommarøy native, went to Oslo to hand-deliver it to the Norwegian politician Kent Gudmundsen. “There’s no need to know what time it is,” Hveding said in a press release that included a picture of him destroying the face of a clock. Local press published a photo of watches—reportedly abandoned by clock-weary residents—hung on a bridge leading to the island.

Read: We live by a unit of time that doesn’t make sense

But soon after the time-free zone went viral, the story began to crack. An employee at Sommarøy’s only hotel expressed skepticism to the Norwegian public-broadcasting company, NRK, that a functioning business could operate without its clocks. Hveding turned out to be part-owner of said hotel, with something to gain from increasing tourism to the island. An NRK investigation revealed that the petition was funded by a state-owned company, Innovation Norway, that promotes Norwegian businesses. The company paid for additional help from PR agencies in Oslo and London. NRK also reported that the watches on the bridge weren’t a result of swelling support from locals, but belonged to Hveding and a few others. They were removed after the photos were taken. Gudmundsen told NRK that after his photo op, the bundle of papers with signatures was also taken away and never submitted to the government. Innovation Norway issued a public apology.

To this day, Hveding denies that the campaign was a ruse. “This is us, this is how we live,” he insisted to The New York Times in 2019. Later that year, Sommarøy residents took over a Facebook page dedicated to the time-free zone (and no longer affiliated with Innovation Norway), inviting people from “down south on the planet where nights are dark” to see for themselves what living time-free could be like.

Pitras and I never set a precise moment to meet but easily found time on one of the instances I walked past his kayak-rental business. On a cloudless day, we sat at a wooden table behind the shop, facing the water. Pitras put on his sunglasses, while I shielded my eyes and described a theory about time I’d been mulling over.

Since 2011, the researchers Tamar Avnet, at Yeshiva University, and Anne-Laure Sellier, at HEC Paris, have studied people’s preferences for living with time. Clock-timers, as Avnet and Sellier have dubbed them, do things based on what their watches say. But for event-timers, the exact minute or hour doesn’t matter. A clock-timer might wake up each day at 7 a.m., start working at 9 a.m., eat lunch at noon when it’s delivered, and get into bed at 10 p.m. An event-timer rejects the alarm clock, maybe waking up at 6 o’clock, maybe at 9. They’ll stop working when they feel a task is done, or eat when they get hungry, but at no predetermined time.

Listen: Time-management tips from the universe

Sommarøy did seem to have daily rhythms, I told Pitras. I could identify the evenings by the way the town went quiet, most houses’ blackout curtains drawn and their inhabitants sleeping inside. But I wondered aloud whether people in Sommarøy were especially adept at moving in and out of clock time. Pitras certainly was. He has been a sailor for 46 years, he told me. When sailing on a boat alone, he performed tasks when they needed to be done, day or night; when sailing on a crew, he followed strict schedules. Now, when he organizes Arctic expeditions during the midnight sun, the groups enter a shared event time. They go hiking as they collectively please, even if at midnight; come back for dinner at 5 a.m.; go to sleep; then wake up for breakfast at 2 p.m. Pitras said shifting between clock and event time is easier for him without the sun’s clear demarcation between day and night.

Others I spoke with in Sommarøy also described a sense of freedom and agency. Halvar Ludvigsen, a fourth-generation resident of Sommarøy, invited me onto his porch when I approached him. “I work at night, and I don’t care about the time,” Ludvigsen said, in a gruff voice. Neither did his retired neighbor, who told me that when he was growing up in Sommarøy, he worked all day on his family’s farm, then went fishing at midnight and invited the neighbors over for a meal. Yet another event-timer, I thought.

Ludvigsen told me that he and Hveding, not the PR agencies, came up with the idea of the time-free zone. Marianne Solbakken, a 67-year-old who grew up in the region, told me one afternoon that all of the drama over the publicity effort obscured the truth: Time is more flexible in Sommarøy. “The life we live is real,” she told me. “How can you be inside when the sun is shining at 11 o’clock in the evening?” Solbakken went to the original meeting about establishing the time-free zone in June 2019, and even wrote a song about putting her watch away during the summer: “And if we want to paint the house in the middle of the night / Yes, then, we just take out the paintbrush / Then we will call the neighbor and ask him to help us / And you should believe he will come soon.” (The lyrics, which sound better in Norwegian, are set to the melody of a well-known song by Halvdan Sivertsen.)

As my week went on, I participated in a kind of event-time Olympics. I worked when I wanted to, ate when I was hungry, and went hiking at night—until 11 p.m., the record showed later. (My fiancé, who traveled with me, recorded when I ate, slept, wrote, read, and exercised.) I felt a great expansiveness of choice to be in total control of my day, without running out of light.

Time-management styles do seem to influence how people experience the world. In Avnet and Sellier’s studies, at least, clock-timers were more likely to believe that events are steered by fate, not by intention. They are also worse at distinguishing between events that are causally linked and events that are unrelated. Those who follow event time are more likely to say that what happens on a daily basis is a result of their own actions. In one of their experiments, Avnet and Sellier split participants into two types of hot-yoga classes: one in which instructors advised people in a clock-free room to move through poses without attention to how long each was held, and one in which a teacher noted how much time should be spent in each pose. In the clock-time class, students skipped and gave up on more poses than in the event-time class—and were more likely to consider the instructor responsible for these failures. Students had less positive experiences in the clock-time class.

Despite such findings, Avnet and Sellier stressed to me that they don’t regard clock or event time as superior, and in truth, we all engage with both time styles. But it’s clock time that’s imposed on most of us from a young age, Kevin Birth, an anthropologist at CUNY Queens College, told me. Outside of vacation, most people don’t get the chance to embrace event time—even if it might suit them. In his 2015 book, the sociologist Hartmut Rosa wrote that modern humans crave detachment from social acceleration, which he defined as the increasing “experience per unit of time.” Perhaps that’s why so many people were charmed by the idea of a time-free zone. At the southern end of the island, I often stopped at the beach café, where Gjertrud Tvenning Gilberg sells charcuterie, along with homemade cakes, pastries, and soup. “Most people who come here live in cities, and there’s a big rush,” Tvenning Gilberg said. Perhaps Sommarøy isn’t strictly without time, but it offers a temporary respite for those who use the clock to harness their busyness.

As an event-timer doing my best to live in a clock-time world, I expected to thrive in my temporary timelessness. But after just a few days in Sommarøy, the clock began to haunt me. I began to doubt whether I was doing things at the “right” time. I missed the feeling of progressing toward a finish line, and developed strong urges to check the time when no one was watching. I hated relying on my fiancé to tell me that it was time for a work call. Ultimately, I slipped into a routine; later, I learned that it closely resembled my schedule at home.

When we talked upon my return, Avnet guessed that I had been uncomfortable with the 24-hour sun. She said that, paradoxically, pure clock-timers may flourish more in Sommarøy. “A clock like me, I wake up at 7 a.m. regardless if the sun comes up at 5 or if it comes out at 9,” she said. But committed event-timers might struggle without non-clock cues to drive our actions.

There haven’t been studies on time preferences above the Arctic Circle, or how people there view fate and manage their emotions in relation to how they view time. (Avnet and Sellier told me they hope to do research in northern Norway in the future.) But people in northern Norway don’t seem to have higher rates of mental distress during the winter than they do in other seasons, as you might expect of people who spend so many weeks in the dark. Kari Leibowitz, a psychologist who has studied Norwegians in this region, wrote for The Atlantic in 2015 that those who lived farther north had a more positive, and protective, mindset about the wintertime. Another way to look at it is that they are more in control of their activities, regardless of the light levels outside. In Cincinnati in January, you might not go for a run at 10 p.m., because it’s dark. But if it’s dark at 3 p.m. or 10 p.m. in Sommarøy, the lack of light won’t stop you.

I saw Tvenning Gilberg, the café owner, as a role model of routine within timelessness. Every day, winter or summer, she gets up early, reads, writes, and swims in the ocean right outside her door, but not based on the time on the clock. (She told me she uses her clock almost exclusively for baking.) She has hours at the café, but ones she sets herself. She had a career as a meteorologist, she told me, so she more intimately understands the sun’s movements, even when it doesn’t rise or set. In the winter, though the sun doesn’t rise, she recognizes a brightening of the sky during the day. In the summer, the sun will be to the south by midday, and at midnight, to the northwest.

That’s where I should look for the first official sunset of the summer, Tvenning Gilberg told me. It would take place on my last night, at 12:30 a.m.; the sun would rise again just 49 minutes later. I un-hid the time on my phone so I could catch the exact moment—but that night was cloudy. Somewhere underneath the gray mist, I knew the sun had fallen below the horizon. I wished I could have seen it. The day I landed in New York, I made a point of walking to the East River at dusk. I wasn’t quite sure of the time, but I felt immense relief looking at the darkening sky.

Late on the Friday before Christmas, just hours before a deadline mandated by Congress, the Department of Justice released part of the trove of documents known colloquially as the Epstein files. The contents are, at different times, unnerving, enraging, banal, and heavily redacted.

At The Atlantic, we’ve been up, poring over the documents to contextualize what they mean. In this special Galaxy Brain episode, Charlie Warzel is joined by Adrienne LaFrance, The Atlantic’s executive editor, and Isaac Stanley-Becker, a staff writer, to talk about the document dump. They share their findings, address the political fallout, and explore what, if anything, we can learn from what’s been released.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Charlie Warzel: I’m Charlie Warzel, and this is Galaxy Brain. Yesterday, conspiracy theorists, politicians, investigative reporters, concerned bystanders—they all got what they’ve long been asking for, at least, partially: The Department of Justice, as mandated by Congress, has released the Epstein files, which is a massive multimedia tranche of documents. They include files, more than 3,000 photos of Epstein’s homes in New York City and in the Virgin Islands, images of his house filled with art and photographs of nude and half-clothed women. There are photos of Epstein’s jet-setting lifestyle, a number of which depict Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell with former President Bill Clinton. In a statement on X yesterday, a spokesperson for Clinton said, “There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first.”

This information that has been released has been held by different sections of federal law enforcement, and for the last month, according to CNN, lawyers at the Department of Justice’s National Security Division have been poring over these files. They’ve been trying to comply with dueling directives to either release the information for public maximum transparency and to protect the executive and legal privacy of victims and those who haven’t been accused of any wrongdoing.

The redaction process has been described by insiders as chaotic, and these files are heavily redacted. Now that it’s here, though, in the public, everyone from vigilante investigators to journalists like myself can pore over this information in an attempt to better understand the life and crimes of Epstein, who in 2019 was charged with operating a sex-trafficking ring that targeted young women and underage girls.

Prosecutors say he was aided by Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime associate who’s currently serving a prison term. Epstein died in 2019 in his jail cell of reported suicide, and that incident ignited speculation about the particulars of his sex ring and rumors of a reported client list.

It’s worth backing up, though, to briefly explain the timeline of how we all got here. All the way back in February, in an interview with Fox News, Attorney General Pam Bondi was asked about a list of Jeffrey Epstein’s clients, and if the Justice Department was planning to release them. Bondi responded, quote, “It’s sitting on my desk right now to review.” In May, the House Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets requested the release of the files in a letter to Bondi.

Bondi did not respond to the request before the May 16 deadline. The story didn’t really heat back up until July, when [Donald] Trump’s Justice Department issued a memo that claimed there was no Epstein client list. Quote, “While we have labored to provide the public with maximum information regarding Epstein and ensured examination of any evidence in the government’s possession, it is the determination of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”

Bondi noted that when she said the Epstein list was sitting on her desk, she was actually referring to the DOJ files and not a client list. Around the same time, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump’s name appeared multiple times in a set of Epstein files currently in possession of the Justice Department. So later, Democrats in the House Oversight Committee, on numerous occasions, released tranches of documents from Epstein’s estate. In September, they released a 238-page PDF. It was a document of the 50th-birthday book to Jeffrey Epstein that includes a prologue by Maxwell and a page allegedly written by Trump, which Trump denied authoring. In November, it released a trove of emails between Epstein and many prominent figures, some of which referenced Donald Trump, though he was not accused of any wrongdoing.

In recent weeks, the committee has released a series of photographs of Epstein and his associates. Some of those photos include close-ups of what looks to be a woman’s body with passages from the novel Lolita drawn on them. In late November, Congress passed legislation mandating Trump’s DOJ release all Epstein files, with few exceptions. They gave him 30 days. Trump signed the bill into law on the 19th of November.

Now files are here. And let’s be clear: For all the chatter and the intrigue around Epstein for his famous associates, the memes, the wall-to-wall coverage, this is a sordid moment in American history. The release of the files is theoretically this moment of transparency, but it’s worth remembering why the files needed to be released. They depict the life and operations of a prolific sex trafficker, someone who was alleged by on-the-record victim testimony to have abused an unknown number of women, some underage. That these files are so eagerly sought is because of how firmly Epstein was ensconced in the social and political and financial dealings of extremely powerful people all over the world, even after taking a plea deal that made him a registered sex offender. His associations known and unknown, the provenance of his great wealth, the extent of his influence—this is what makes Jeffrey Epstein a newsworthy figure more than six years after his death.

That said, the release of the files are a culmination of sorts. They unite an unlikely conglomeration of interests, from QAnon to House Democrats. And in a politics where conspiracy theorizing has replaced scandals of old, the release of these files is an intentional event without much precedent.

The scattershot release offers anyone a choose-your-own-adventure, “Control-F” search bonanza. People have and will continue to post their findings, often without context, to social media and elsewhere. There will be silly, offensive, and irony-poisoned memes. There will be endless pontification, name-calling, political point-scoring. Releasing the files is an act of transparency, but dumping them on a Friday evening during a holiday week is also something of a chaos agent.

And so there’s a lot to take in here. It will likely take reporters and other investigators months, maybe years, to understand the scope. And this isn’t even all of the files. But what we wanted to do today on Galaxy Brain is to try to walk through this as best that we can. Over the last couple of hours, we at The Atlantic have been up and looking over these documents. We’ve been trying to surround them with the appropriate amount of context.

And so joining me today to talk about the files is Adrienne LaFrance, The Atlantic’s executive editor, and staff writer Isaac Stanley-Becker. They’re going to come on and share a little of what they found and what, if anything, we can learn from what has been released. This is not an exhaustive list of findings. This is an early reaction and a chance to try to ground this extremely grim but important moment, and understand what, if anything, might happen next.

Here’s Adrienne LaFrance and Isaac Stanley-Becker.

Warzel: Adrienne, Isaac. It is very early in the morning where I am. It’s light out where you are. Thank you for joining me to talk about the Epstein files, which are now out in the world. They’ve been released for a few hours. We’ve all looked through them in some capacity, and I’m delighted that you’re all here to talk about it with me.

Warzel: Absolutely. Okay, so I think the first thing that I just want to start with is: This is a partial release of the files. There are hundreds of thousands of documents. Supposedly, the Department of Justice has been working, according to reports, for a long time, trying to redact these things, trying to maintain the privacy of the victims and certain people involved in the files.

On Friday, they noted that they weren’t going to be able to release the absolute full tranche of documents. Instead, we have a partial release. How do we feel about this? Has the Department of Justice complied with this investigation? Isaac, do we feel like this is what Congress wanted to some degree, or is this partial release unsatisfying in terms of the Department of Justice actually giving Congress what it wanted?

Stanley-Becker: I think, plainly, the administration has not complied with the legislation that was passed, which required the release of these files, these documents, by yesterday, Friday. And a partial release is a partial release. It’s not a full release. It doesn’t meet the letter of this legislation that was passed. And we’ve already seen members of Congress on both sides of the aisle make this point and discuss various possibilities of steps they might take, whether it comes to the Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche or Pam Bondi, the attorney general.

I think there’s been some discussions of contempt proceedings. Certainly, Democrats have used the word impeachment. But I think there’s a lot of anger about what happened here. And these are files that have, as you said, been discussed for months, that the attorney general said that she had aspects of them sitting on her desk. So I think people have a right to be asking why it took so long and what the reason for the delay was and what has been withheld in this initial batch.

LaFrance: I was going to say it also colors our ability to understand why they released what they released. So it sort of warps the entire thing in that way.

Warzel: Yeah, and just to be clear, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, saying that the files were under desk—that was back in February of 2025. So, you know, this has been dragging out for a very long time. I think a lot of people don’t remember that first part, who have been paying attention to this. And, you know, this is something that really heated up over the summer. And then that really, you know, started this process. But genuinely, this goes back to almost the first days of the administration, all the way back then.

I want to talk about: Most people, I imagine—these were released on a Friday right before the Christmas holiday, sort of later in the afternoon on the East Coast. I doubt most people in the world have been actually sifting through these files in any capacity. We have. And so what I wanted to kind of do for people is talk about the experience, first and foremost, of going through this, right? This is a lot of—even though it’s a partial release, this is a lot of documents. This is kind of a very classic reporter thing of having to comb through this.

And so I just wanted to start first with you, Isaac. Can you kind of walk me through your process of getting these? You know, accessing these files, how you went through them. Like, what is it like to dive into this? Because I—the Epstein files is something that has just been, you know, obviously, shrouded in secrecy, but something, too, that I think people have really kind of, you know, had to imagine in their heads, right? What is this going to be? I think a lot of people thought they were going to be, like, IRS files or things like that—a lot more sort of nitty-gritty stuff. It was very image-heavy.

Starting with Isaac and then, Adrienne, to your experience of it, what was it like going through this?

Stanley-Becker: Well, there was an anticipation that there was going to be some sort of release yesterday. We didn’t know exactly what kind. And our terrific colleague Sarah Fitzpatrick had some good lines into trying to figure out when and what, and what the administration was telling various people about what they were doing. So there was some sense that at some point during the day, and I think even some indication of the afternoon, eventually. And so I think it was 4:30, 4 o’clock—but, as you say—in the afternoon when this dropped, and it was a link on the DOJ website.

And we didn’t know what to expect. We didn’t know whether it was going to be transcripts, investigative materials, photos. So we just kind of opened it and started clicking around and seeing what it looked like, even seeing sort of how to divide it among those of us reporters who were looking through it, to do it in a kind of concerted way. And so it soon became clear that there was some material that appeared to be new, some old. So we kind of wrapped our hands around the new material. And it was released in batches, like a set; there were sort of four sets.

And I just downloaded—it was a zip file—and started clicking through, as you say, a lot of images, especially where I started. So images of Epstein, of Ghislaine Maxwell, seemingly in various vacation destinations with friends of theirs. And discussing with colleagues: What here has been released? What’s new? Do we recognize this person?

You know, passing it over to Adrienne, one of the points that she made that I think is so important in how we were processing this and making sense of it was, as she said: There was no rhyme or reason to this release versus what remains held back. And I think that that’s right, but that has fueled so much of the suspicion and the cynicism. Because, say, even if we knew that this was some way chronological—like they were releasing the first batch in the investigations, and they hadn’t yet gotten to the later batch, but there was nothing like that—or this was photos, and they were going to get onto other materials in their possession. But for all we know, they picked and chose as they pleased. So that made, I think, the experience really challenging and grounds for a lot of concern and suspicion.

Warzel: Adrienne, what was your experience of this? You’re helping to direct all of our coverage. What was your experience of looking through this or trying to make sense of it?

LaFrance: Right. Well, I mean, it’s what Isaac said, and it’s really just, as journalists, trying to figure out what’s new. Is there anything in here that’s revealed that changes our understanding of the scope of Epstein’s crimes? Obviously, looking for affiliations to other powerful figures—and we can, of course, talk more about that—including multiple presidents, and just trying to understand: What does it mean, and why does it matter?

Because one of the more complicated aspects of all of this is the collision of actual crime and robust conspiracy theorizing. And I kept thinking about something. So I’ve written a lot about conspiracy theories, as you guys know, over the years. And one of the things that always comes to mind for me is: The more I’ve talked to conspiracy theorists, the more I understand that a lot of what draws them to sort of the work of conspiracy theorizing, if you can call it work, is a lot of what journalists love, like combing through difficult, complicated, limited, redacted documents, trying to find meaning. And so when you sort of unleash a document dump on the public in this really, you know, rich conspiracy-laden environment, while also knowing that it’s a hugely important news story with real crimes and real victims, it’s even harder to sort of disentangle and find meaning. And then you layer on possibly a bad-faith political maneuvering. It’s, I mean, it’s extraordinarily complicated.

Stanley-Becker: And in this case, in particular, because: I just think it can’t be emphasized enough that Epstein’s crimes are being arbitrated on the internet because they were never arbitrated in court. And that is one of the many tragedies and wrongs of the fact that he committed suicide in jail, that there was never ever an opportunity to really arbitrate this and get to the facts. And so it’s understandable that people are taking matters into their own hands on the internet, because it was never dealt with carefully and in a methodical way in court. And there’s lots of reasons for that, and lots of failures of our justice system that allowed that to happen. But it just speaks to one of the enduring wrongs and just utter failures of this whole saga.

Warzel: There is a Miami Herald article by Julie K. Brown, who has done a lot of the investigative reporting that broke this story open and really revealed to the public the extent of Epstein’s operation over a long period of time. And she wrote about the files that the House Oversight Committee, Democrats in the House Oversight Committee, released actually on Thursday, just some photographs, but said that, you know, one of the revelations in a lot of these stories is that the FBI never obtained Epstein’s computers in the original investigation, right? That some of what we are seeing here in general, broadly, is stuff that, you know, as you’re saying, Isaac, had the government done its job in other ways, this information would have maybe not been public. But it would have been things that, you know, had been brought to light, at least privately, in terms of the investigation. So I think that that’s a very important way to ground this in general.

I would love to talk a little bit about what’s in here, right. We didn’t get a lot, right? But what did we get?

LaFrance: Well, to your last point, one of, I think, arguably the most important thing—and forgive me because I have not combed through all 13,000 documents, so we are certainly gonna learn more in the coming days and with subsequent releases—but from what we know now, one of the most consequential things in here is this, I think, 1996 tip from someone who had contacted the FBI, asked them to look into Epstein’s affairs, and has said that the FBI did not even respond to her. And so to see evidence of that early complaint is really shocking. And I think, you know, as this person has told other news outlets, validating for her, but I think it speaks to exactly what Isaac was just describing.

Warzel: Yeah, apparently the FBI did not contact the person who made this complaint about child-sex-abuse material and Epstein for a decade, which, yes, I think speaks very highly to how all this unfolded. So, yeah, so let’s get to what—that was in there certainly. That was, I believe, as people were going through it, myself included, but also reported in other places. That seems to be a real revelation there in terms of: That complaint was unearthed.

It was also, it was something where, the way that these files come out, a lot of them are just images that you are downloading on a zip drive and you are rifling through. And when it’s just an image, it’s actually very easy to process, right? You can just see Jeffrey Epstein is on a Jet Ski, there’s someone in a helicopter, there’s someone on a plane, et cetera. When it is some of the photographs of images, or photographs of documents, rather, it can be kind of hard to see and to know what it is that you’re looking at. So that was definitely a revelation.

But let’s start with you, Isaac. What did we get here, and what did you really take away and notice here?

Stanley-Becker: Well, I think we should also emphasize that in addition to this being a partial release, the materials were also heavily, heavily redacted. And that’s another thing that is fueling a lot of the criticism of DOJ’s approach here.

I think maybe most strikingly, there was one file, a grand-jury file, I believe from New York, that was just entirely redacted. People were pointing out that it’s like one of those memes about nontransparency where just everything, every single line is blacked out. And that was literally what the document was.

I mean, I think, stepping back, I would make a couple points. One is that overall, this does not really add much to our understanding of Epstein’s crimes, of the people who enabled Epstein’s crimes, and of the way in which he evaded justice for so long, with the exception of, I think, the really important document that Adrienne pointed out.

And I think the second point I would make is associated with that: that sprinkled throughout here, there are some really troubling and just, frankly, grotesque details about the way in which he went about abusing young women. And details are hints because, again, it’s really hard to understand the full context because of the redactions, because of maybe some of the missing material. But there are a few documents that record phone calls, messages that were intended for Epstein, and one of them says, “I have a female for him.” Just absolutely chilling. There’s a reference at one point to someone not being available because of soccer, potentially a young person, though it’s not clear. So there are some examples of that, and also images of Epstein with what appear to be young women, though there’s a number of, again, redactions of those faces, in that case, most likely to protect victims.

And then I think the third point I would make is that there’s a lot of Bill Clinton in these images and in these files. And one of the things that we did was reach out to a spokesman for former President Clinton about this. And his office hit back pretty hard in saying that this was selectively released, that it was intended to serve a political purpose and distract from all the ways in which we know that President Trump associated with and was friends with Epstein. And also, an argument that they were friendly, there was some traveling together, but that President Clinton knew nothing of Epstein’s crimes. But again, in the way in which all of this is being used and politicized, we saw immediately an effort by White House officials, people in the communications department, to trumpet the Clinton materials, and arguing that this is what the focus should be. So those are the kind of main takeaways that I had.

LaFrance: Well, and I have to say, too, like, it definitely seems clear that the Trump camp is using this opportunity to politically weaponize the Clinton material. And yet it is shocking in its own right. I mean, just within our newsroom, I think those were the photos that were being passed around first, because it’s legitimately shocking to see a president in that capacity, even someone who you know has had inappropriate relationships with young women before.

Warzel: Yeah, those photos, you know, we talked a lot about, like: Was this the—just chronologically, right—like, the first stuff? Again, there’s so much that we don’t know here. Was this chronologically some of the first stuff there? Was it some of the easiest stuff for DOJ lawyers to clear? Because we don’t know what the actual process was here; we don’t have any insight into that.

What was interesting, to me as someone who was going through it but also observing online, was, you know—I think they were released around 1:00, 1:15 [p.m.] my time, Pacific time, so that would be about 4 o’clock eastern time—within two or three minutes on X, I was seeing multiple accounts of all political persuasions immediately going through and posting the photos of Clinton. One which has sort of become, I guess, infamous at this point is him sort of reclining in what looks like either a hot tub or a pool. There is a redacted black square that I guess represents somebody who’s in there. There was something about that, though, the fact that it was so quick to have that be there that I think it led to that feeling, right, of: Is this being weaponized in some way? This has shown up so quickly. And, you know, his presence is so prominent.

And this feeling of, you know, potential weaponization or using these documents for to score political points, I think, is underscored by the fact that, you know, the White House press secretary is reposting that photo and putting an emoji next to it, and saying, “Oh my!” A DOJ spokesperson tweeted and then deleted the tweet, according to reports from Politico, that said, “I wonder why the Biden DOJ refused to release the files.” It really seems like very quickly this just became another way to, you know, snipe on social media. And I think that lended this feeling that, like, What are we seeing? Has this been released selectively?

Stanley-Becker: Well, there’s also no pretense that it’s anything other than political. President Trump directed his attorney general to investigate as the kind of pressure was intensifying on him related to these files. He directed his attorney general to investigate Clinton’s ties to Epstein, along with a number of other prominent Democrats and people he perceives as his enemies. As in many cases, this president’s actions are, sort of, so out in the open. There’s not an effort to kind of hide the way in which they want to amplify the potential downsides for Democrats in these files.

I think the other thing that struck me about the Clinton material because, again, his people had all sorts of arguments about how this was selective and political. They’ve also said that there’s no wrongdoing on the former president’s part. And certainly these images are unsavory, but there’s nothing in them that shows him in a really compromising position with a minor or anything like that.

Warzel: And I should be clear, he said that they—sorry to interrupt you, but also, the Clinton camp said that this was a relationship that was terminated, his relationship with Epstein, as soon as he knew about any of Epstein’s wrongdoing. That’s just, you know, what was said.

Stanley-Becker: Seems like a sort of low bar. Yeah.

But I think it was one more really graphic illustration of a point that’s been made and written about well recently, just about the way this is such an indictment of a kind of elite class that Epstein managed to wrap around his finger. I mean, he was fantastically wealthy. He had lots of fancy associates. But how was he able to weasel himself in so effectively with people as prominent and important as former presidents? I mean, what was the former president doing associating with this individual? What was he getting out of this relationship? I mean, we may learn more about the facts here, but it strikes me as kind of pathetic in addition to everything else.

LaFrance: Right. And I feel this is a really important point, too, that I think you can hold sort of two things to be true at once—that, like, there are legitimate questions to be asked about Bill Clinton and Epstein’s relationship still. Absolutely. Of course, there are legitimate questions to be asked about Trump’s relationship with Epstein. And also, it seems quite apparent that both sides will try to politically weaponize. I mean, certainly, we see Trump’s side trying to politically weaponize Clinton’s appearance in these files. And so, like, is it extremely creepy? Yes. Is it being politically weaponized selectively? Also yes.

Warzel: Yeah. And, you know, I think what’s interesting and also difficult to hold in one’s head, right, is that some of what we know about some of the releases of information that have been, you know, kind of dripped and dropped throughout the fall have come from Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, right? And these are, you know, emails that mention people like Peter Thiel; you know, a lot of correspondence between Donald Trump and Steve Bannon; a lot of mentions from Epstein and other people in Epstein’s circle of Donald Trump.

And then you have the Epstein files released by the Trump administration, which contain very scant mention of Donald Trump. There is, you know, to what I have seen—and again, we’re kind of poring over this—what I have seen at present, there is a photo of Jeffrey Epstein’s desk. And there seems to be what appears to be Donald Trump among a bunch of photos in his desk. There is a complaint from the Southern District of New York, a Jane Doe versus Epstein and Maxwell complaint, that mentions an interaction that Donald Trump had with a 14-year-old girl in the presence of Epstein at Mar-a-Lago. That’s kind of it. There’s not a lot there. And I think that, you know, the fact that you have Democrats on the House Oversight Committee releasing this stuff that shows kind of an extended world or associates of Donald Trump just speaks to the relationships that they have had over the course of their lives, running in similar social circles. And then you have what is supposed to be the be-all, end-all of transparency, and there is this scant mention.

It seems—did that surprise you guys at all?

LaFrance: I mean, yeah, it didn’t necessarily surprise me, but I do feel that there is more that we’re missing. I’ll also point out that Democrats did not seem interested in the Epstein files at all until it became politically convenient for them, which hurts their credibility now. And then the other thing I think we haven’t touched on that’s really important is this question of sort of, like, to what extent is someone guilty by association? Especially when we don’t exactly know what the association is.

Our colleague Liz Bruenig wrote a really thoughtful piece about how there are, you know, because of the sort of dynamic you’ve described where Epstein seemed to sort of collect famous, powerful figures in his life, there are lots of well-known people who have encountered him. And from the very limited information that the public has, it’s really hard to know, is it that Epstein was just wheeling and dealing, and meeting famous people? And yeah, sometimes they got photographed together, and now that looks bad? I mean, you don’t just accidentally get into a hot tub. So that association seems deeper than someone who might’ve just been sitting beside him at an event or something.

But I think there is this real question of, you know: In a culture that rushes to condemn people with limited evidence, you do have to sort of wonder how to contextualize or understand these little snippets or photos that we’re getting that don’t provide adequate information at this point. Does that make sense?

Warzel: Yeah, and I think it also speaks to the difficulties with the redactions, right? Because there are lots of things, as we have mentioned in here, that are redacted, some of them almost perhaps comically, right? Like, you have entire files that are just big black squares; you don’t even really know what the heck is in there. But there’s also a lot of photos and a lot of people online, even journalists that I’ve seen, who are very upset about the number of redactions, right? Like, if you are on what appears to be a private plane with Jeffrey Epstein, why are we redacting you, right?

And there was a report from Fox News that came out sort of early in the day—I’m gonna find it here—after the files were released that said that Fox learned that the same redaction standards were applied to politically exposed individuals and government officials. And that kind of floated around the internet for a while, and it was like, Wait, why are potentially politically exposed people and government officials being treated the same, with the same, you know, privileges as people who have been abused by Jeffrey Epstein? That seemed very, you know, out of place. [Deputy] Attorney General Todd Blanche later said that the Justice Department is, quote, “not redacting the names of any politicians,” and, quote, “There are no redactions of famous people.”

That leaves—that’s a little bit vague in terms of what actually is in there. But I think what’s fascinating, right, is this idea that there is this guilt by association. There is this sense that you could end up at a dinner, not know that Jeffrey Epstein’s there; there’s a photographer or something like that. It gets shown; it’s the only time you’ve ever interacted with this person. And yet, you have been, quote, “put in the Epstein files.” There is this association, as Liz writes in the piece.

And yet at the same time, it seems like we’re also all kind of collectively struggling with this idea of: You don’t just get in a hot tub, as you said, right? And there’s this idea that, like, you don’t just get on the plane. And that’s very different. But all these things get smashed together, especially, I think, because of the way that these files are released, and that just becomes extremely difficult for normal people and concerned people and people who are outraged by, you know, this type of sex trafficking and abuse. It makes it really hard to disentangle.

Stanley-Becker: I think it also speaks to, I mean, there’s now been so much ink spilled on this whole sordid affair. But one of the, in my mind, somewhat unanswered questions is how much Epstein’s globe-trotting life and lifestyle was mixed in with the criminal conduct he was engaged in. How cabined off was it? And I think that goes a long way toward helping us to understand whether all of these associates would have been privy in some way. I think as you both are saying, there’s a big difference between being pictured with him at an event and being pictured in his hot tub. But okay, if you’re on his plane, if you are at one of his homes, what degree of knowledge could you rightfully have been expected to have of what was going on behind closed doors? And I think that’s one of, in my mind, the kind of reporting questions that remains unanswered about all of this.

LaFrance: I totally agree. It’s sort of treated as though it was an open secret all along, and it certainly appears that way for people like us who’ve come to the information much later than these crimes took place. But that’s a real question for me. It’s almost one of the most basic things. Like, who knew? When did they know? What did they know? It’s just, I feel that that’s fundamental.

Stanley-Becker: Well, I was just going to say, mean, maybe there are materials in this cache of documents that will be forthcoming that will help answer this. I guess I’m not really holding my breath, because of all the previous failures. It seems to me like one of the most salient questions—maybe we can get into this—is whether this will satisfy the kind of ferocious right-wing fascination with Epstein, and the kind of beast that Trump and some of his associates created in how they hyped these documents and the kind of unintended consequences they’ve had to face as a result of that. Can that beast be tamed, and will it continue to dog him politically? is, I think, one of the key political questions, aside from the question about, Will victims get their answers? Are there more co-conspirators who can be brought to justice at this phase?

Warzel: I think to your earlier point there, about what people knew and when, obviously, that’s still a huge open question. I think one of the things that was really dissatisfying for me, going through this as someone who’s been writing about and covering this, as opposed to: In early September, House Oversight Democrats released the infamous, I think it was his 50th birthday, Jeffrey Epstein’s 50th-birthday book, right?

And in that, one of the takeaways outside of showing a purported doodle that Donald Trump made, you know, for Epstein that he had previously denied having made— outside of that, what I think what it revealed to me was a lot of winking, you know, and kind of gesturing from these wealthy friends of Jeffrey Epstein towards this idea that, well, he loves, you know, young women, right? Or, as they’re referred to, girls. We don’t know the age of people that we’re being referred to in some of these things. But it was this idea that there is a little bit of that potentially an open secret, right. That he has predilections, and there are people around him who are either okay with that or willing to overlook that or whatever, and even, you know, put that on paper in some capacity.

And I think what we see here in these documents, you have to sort of, like you said, infer, right? You have to, you know, your imagination has to take over on that. And I think that that’s just extremely unhelpful to people. You have to sort of give yourself, Oh, what did Bill Clinton know and when? What is he up to? What did this person know and when? And I think in that sense, you know, it just obfuscates more than anything.

LaFrance: It also points to this much larger sort of cultural question of what people are willing to tolerate. I mean, it’s kind of fascinating and revealing that it hasn’t even yet come up in this conversation, something that we all know, which is that Donald Trump himself has been credibly accused of multiple sexual crimes. And that, I think with the Access Hollywood tape back in 2016, was the moment where it was sort of like, Well, people, not everyone, but many people are just kind of okay with that. And so to me, there is this much larger cultural question. I mean, it goes to your point of: When? What did people know? What were they willing to sort of look away? What was treated as just sort of, He likes girls, whatever—I mean, it’s just, it’s all of a piece in a way that I don’t think anyone has sort of properly contextualized or explained.

Stanley-Becker: Yeah, Adrienne, I was going to make a really similar point, which is that a lot of the really strong reporting about Trump and Epstein’s relationship has focused on their kind of shared pursuit of women and how they competed against each other and participated in this kind of pursuit of women.

And I think that you mentioned the credible accusations against the president, the Access Hollywood tape, and this continues, this kind of language at least, and approach and rhetoric continues to the present day. So amid all of this, the president was delivering remarks in North Carolina last night. And in the course of many other things—Ilhan Omar, et cetera, immigration—he does this routine about Hillary Clinton, talks about how she’s nasty and he wouldn’t want to go home to a woman like that. So the misogyny, and the kind of discussion of women as objects that men are going home to and finding pleasing or not pleasing remains part of his ongoing schtick, which is shocking when you step back and think about it.

LaFrance: Well, and when you look back to that, you know, we talked about that 1996 tip to the FBI about Epstein. That’s taking place around the time shortly before Bill Clinton has an interaction with an intern in the White House. And so there really is this much larger cultural thing where we have to kind of step back and be like: Wait a minute. How are we treating women in this society? And you think about how that was received culturally and how Monica Lewinsky was the butt of all the jokes at the time. I mean, Clinton, to some extent, but far less so. So all of this just feels really of a piece in a way that I think is important.

Warzel: And it also speaks to that political point-scoring, too, right? I reached out in a piece that I wrote yesterday for The Atlantic to the White House. They came back with comment and said—I want to make sure that I get this right—the Trump administration “has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have,” was the big takeaway from that. I was asking whether or not Donald Trump wanted to address that there was this complaint, or that there was a photograph of him. But it was very much this Look what we did, using and referencing the victims, using them as a political object in this.

And I think that something that I saw, speaking to this cultural misogyny and the way that all this is treated: I saw people treating this like the Super Bowl on social media, right? Oh my God, they’re here. It’s Christmas come early. The files are here. When you zoom out, what this actually is: Some of this is crime-scene evidence. Some of this is, you know, evidence of either sexual assault or impropriety or sex trafficking. There’s a lot that we don’t know what it’s even showing, because it’s so heavily redacted. This is monstrous at its core. Like, nothing about this is actually funny. It’s super dramatic. It is culturally extremely relevant. It’s politically extremely relevant because of Epstein’s connections to various elites in the world and powerful people.

But this is all—this is, again, this is like a digital crime scene. And it is being treated as, you know, Well, look what we did for the victims, who, you know, according to the great reporting from our colleague, this is something that has actually left a lot of Epstein’s victims high and dry. They don’t feel like they’ve gotten the transparency and the accountability from this that they were hoping. They didn’t even get a meeting with the attorney general at the end of the day about this ahead of the release of the files.

So I fully agree. I think this is, you know—what has happened culturally as a result of this seems to be even more galling in terms of respecting the victims of sex trafficking and sexual assault. And the way that we talk about this in general just seems to underlie that.

LaFrance: Right, well, it’s sort of—I mean, you’re alluding to one of the great contradictions of the internet, which is: You get a bunch of people on a social platform and let them do whatever they want, and things can be awful and monstrous and glib and all the worst possible qualities you can imagine online. But also, this is a week where a tip on Reddit helped lead to the capture of the Brown shooting suspect. So, yeah, I mean, I think it’s complicated that way. I do wonder if—certainly journalists will be working hard, including many of our colleagues and both of you, to make sense of all of this, but this is one where the collision of conspiracy theory and amateur sleuthing and actual professional journalism can be a force for bad, obviously. But I’d be curious what emerges from ordinary people who are combing over these files too.

Warzel: So, you know, to that point of people going through, I want to talk about the broader conspiracy stuff in a second, or the conspiracy theorizing, rather. Do you all feel the response to this was muted, given how these files had been touted, given that “Release the files” has been a hallmark of Trump’s campaigning in the past? This has been a real load-bearing both meme and political issue for a long time. Do you feel like the reaction was more muted than you thought?

LaFrance: I want to hear what Isaac thinks. What I would just say is, I mean, first of all, you mentioned this earlier, but it’s, like, the granddaddy of Friday-night news dumps, meaning these were released at a time when most people are trying to check out for at least a couple of days. And so that’s a huge factor, I think.

And then the other point I would make is just, like, most people are not extremely online. We are, and people who tend to care about the Epstein files are. But most people really aren’t. And so it’s hard to gauge what we should expect and what muted even means. But I do think, and this is a point you’ve both made, is that this isn’t something that’s gonna go away. Even if it—you can try to bury it the Friday before Christmas, but people are intensely interested in this, and that will continue. But, Isaac, I’m curious what you think.

Stanley-Becker: Yeah, I think that this whole situation is kind of shot through with cynicism. So I think people were primed to expect a cover-up, expect unsatisfying answers. I mean, certainly, we’re hoping for some kind of really scandalous reveal, but I think also very much prepared to be let down in that respect. I guess another way of thinking about this is: Is there any kind of release, is there any kind of document that would put an end to the speculation or would satisfy people’s craving for answers, for accountability, for you name it? And I think basically, no. It’s really hard to imagine what that would be.

Again, it speaks to the way in which this sort of beast has been created, and is really hard to feed or to satisfy. So I think the reaction was somewhat muted for some combination of the reasons you both have mentioned, but it’ll be interesting. And I think some of it will depend on what sort of actions, if any, these lawmakers do take, to what extent the outrage and the response is bipartisan, and whether it forces some additional clean-up by the likes of the attorney general and the deputy attorney general.

Warzel: I’ll just put my own feelings out there on this. I was honestly kind of surprised. I understand that the world does not respond the way that terminally online journalists and people who study conspiracy theories and folks who are interested in the way that stuff travels around the internet or whatever. I understand that most people aren’t like that. But it’s been hard to not turn on a television and see file footage of Jeffrey Epstein’s face over the last six months. It’s been the thing politically that has dogged Donald Trump, right? That the story, as you have put it, that will not go away. And I know that it was a Friday-night news dump. I know that it’s—a big holiday is coming up. That people are checking out for, like, two weeks. You know, this is the actual slowest period of the year. I’m still surprised.

Stanley-Becker: What were you expecting? What did you—I’m just interested. What kind of reaction or response would have, in your mind, fit with that kind of fascination wall-to-wall coverage that you’ve been describing?

Warzel: Honestly, the way that the emails in November, from the tranche of emails that the House Oversight Committee put out. Across all the social-media platforms that I’m on, there was so much screenshotting. There was so much. I know everyone’s feed is different. Everyone, you know, has a different experience on the algorithmic internet. Right. But I felt like that was very much a lot of people reacting to, like: Here is helpful information that contextualizes the Epstein experience, right? Like, here is where we are seeing the way that he interacts and corresponds. And I think that may have had to do with the fact that it was emails, you know. Like, it’s hard to see a photo of Jeffrey Epstein, globe-trotting or, you know, on a Jet Ski and say, Well, now I understand everything. You know? Like, it’s much easier to see correspondence between Jeffrey Epstein and someone else over a long period of time.

Stanley-Becker: It makes—yeah, I don’t know. I guess I see what you mean about that. I see it somewhat differently, and it’s making me think of that [Slavoj] Žižek line. I think it’s Žižek, where he talks about the anticipation always being more satisfying than the fulfillment of the anticipation, like looking forward to something is actually always more enjoyable than experiencing it. And I think that’s so true in this case. Like, isn’t it so much fun and so fantastical to imagine what these files might show, what they might reveal, and to talk with all your friends online about them? And then when they actually drop, it’s like, well, of course they’re going to be dissatisfying and not live up to your expectations.

LaFrance: I also just think it’s such a partisan—I mean, like, this is also partly death of the monoculture and fracturing of informational environments. I mean it’s sort of the most boring but also possibly true explanation, which is: A lot of people are tuned out, everybody’s getting their information from different sources, nobody trusts each other, and it’s very hard for any major news event to capture everybody’s attention at once. We very rarely see that now in a way that we used to even five years ago.

Warzel: Well, think, I think especially to Isaac, to your point: I mean, that’s conspiracy theorizing, right? I have written and a lot of people have also talked about: This is an almost perfect conspiracy theory, right, because it blends real crime, real intrigue, real relationships, real wealth, real power with this idea of something that we can’t see that helps to explain the world. And as soon as we understand it, as soon as we can see it, we will know why, you know, things feel the way that they do, right? Why things are dissatisfying, why certain people have power, why, you know—you name it, right? And that reveal is the fact that we don’t ever know. Like, there’s never been a confirmed report that there is a client list, right, of Jeffrey Epstein. There’s his address book, there’s all sorts of just logistical things in his life, but we don’t have that. And yet the Epstein client list remains this load-bearing conspiracy-theory meme, because that would explain everything, right? That would be the skeleton key to unlock the awful behavior of the global elite, and this is what we don’t know, you know?

Stanley-Becker: But correct me if I’m wrong, Charlie, because you would know the origins of this better. I mean, the person responsible for that is the attorney general, the most powerful law-enforcement official in the country, who said that she had access to that document. So, I mean, yes, there’s this kind of swamp of conspiracy theories. But also, there are people in positions of tremendous authority and power who have fed this and given rise to it.

And I think, you know, amid everything else, one of the kind of trends or dynamics of the first year of the second Trump term that I’m personally fascinated by is this dynamic of kind mudslingers and conspiracy theorists, when they’re outside of government, giving rise to these theories, whipping up fascination, and then coming into government and having the authority to prove it or disprove it, and being kind of unwilling or unable to do that. I mean, suddenly, you have the authority to prove what you have claimed, and what do you do? You’re in a real bind in that situation.

LaFrance: This is such a good point, and it also makes me think it’s important to point out that Donald Trump is like the OG version of this, in the sense that he rose to political power based on the birtherism conspiracy theory. And so I think you’re spot-on there.

Stanley-Becker: And Thomas Massie, who’s been the kind of main Republican voice on this, in passing the other day I saw tweeted, If the 2020 election had been a criminal conspiracy theory, why has no one been arrested over it? And it’s an amazing point. And the fact that the people who believe this, the president’s supporters who believe this, have not been dissatisfied, outraged, and demanded something different from their leader is psychologically fascinating. Sorry, I interrupted you.

LaFrance: No, no, I’m totally with you. I mean, the other thing that it makes me think is, like, in terms of the conspiracy theorizing, this Epstein as a conspiracy theory, setting aside the actual crimes, it has fodder for any conspiracy theorist. And it’s important to point this out. Conspiracy theorizing is not tied to one ideology or another. The qualities that sort of unite the people who are drawn to conspiracy theories are intense distrust for government, but power generally. So, like, anti-establishment views, a sense of being aggrieved, or victimhood sort of status. And so if you look at this from that lens and you think, okay, if you’re a conspiracy theorist, and all you wanna do is prove whatever your conspiracy theory about Donald Trump is, you’ve got plenty of fodder there. If you’re an anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist, this is total fodder for that, sort of, the global elite with a powerful Jewish man. So that squarely fits onto that conspiracy theory. And you sort of tick down the list of all of the most potent and dangerous conspiracy theories, and you can see how it maps onto Epstein. And so I feel like that’s a huge part of this as well.

Warzel: I think that’s very true. There is this dynamic, Isaac, also, as you said. I mean, I guess one could say “Don’t put podcasters in charge of the government” is one part of this. But it’s also this: It is so easy to crusade against the government, against the people in power, right, and use that and leverage that.

And what we’ve seemed to be seeing time and again in this administration is: Once you get in that position of power, it becomes really hard to deal with this, right? Like, Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, the FBI, have on some of these other sort of smaller issues have said, You know, now I’ve looked at this thing. You know, it’s not what you think, because just trust me. And that’s really hard position for anyone to be in.

But I think you’re right. The flames of all of this were fanned by this administration, starting with Bondi, you know, referring to a client list. She then later said, I should note, that she was just referring to some of what we looked at over the past day, the files, not the actual client list. But it’s also very clear that back in February, a lot of people probably don’t remember, the administration made binders of information about Jeffrey Epstein and invited a whole bunch of right-wing influencers to come and collect them. And then, again, they’ve denied that this is what they did, but walked them out the door of the White House in front of a pool of press photographers; all the influencers were holding up the binders of this. This has certainly been played up by the administration.

LaFrance: Totally. Well, and the other thing is, with any major mainstream conspiracy theory, you always have to think about the true believers, because there are people who truly believe conspiracy theories and truly worry about victims in cases where there aren’t any. Obviously, there are victims in this case. You think about Pizzagate, which was someone who believed that there was a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor where they were abusing children. There was no evidence that that was true. I actually go to this pizza place all the time. It’s great.

And someone came in with a gun on a crusade. And so, you know, that’s a true believer. You have true believers on all kinds of conspiracy theories. But conspiracy theories also attract grifters and people who are opportunists and using them for political gain, as you point out, that we’ve seen within the Trump administration.

And so the other thing that I think we should watch very carefully going forward is this sort of: As more information comes out, as people are able to watch the administration’s handling of this, you’re going to see more of a divide between the true believers and the grifters. And some true believers may tie themselves in knots, justifying why they still trust Donald Trump or why they still trust Pam Bondi or whoever. But I think it gets harder and harder to have it all hold together when the grifters show themselves so obviously to be grifting.

Warzel: So that’s a great bridge to how I want to kind of tie a bow on this at the end. Which is, do we think this is going to fan the flames? Is this only going to make the conspiracy theory stronger? Do you think in some sense, you know, there’s a little bit of fatigue that might set in here, even politically, right? Like, this is something that also has—it’s tough to capture people’s attention for a long period of time. This story has, for quite a long time. And now with the release of this—I’ll start with you, Isaac—do you see this ramping up, ramping down? Or is this just gonna drag out in a very unsatisfying way for the next forever? What are you thinking in regards to that?

Stanley-Becker: Yeah, I’m sort of torn on this, actually. It has shown remarkable staying power, more so than other dynamics. And I think it’s been one of the areas where President Trump has this kind of Teflon political character, where issues that would be very damaging for others seem to kind of bounce right off of him. I think he has sustained some political damage from this. And I think that as we’ve been discussing, this release was deeply unsatisfying, and there’s a lot of grounds for continued suspicion and concern and attacks. But I also do think that there may be somewhat of a fatigue factor setting in. I think fatigue is—it’s the word I was going to use as well, and the one you used. And maybe that was responsible for some of the muted reaction last night as well, is that people are ready for their kind of fresh outrage, fresh conspiracy theory, fresh kind of gamified experience.

Warzel: And I think also, too, it becomes: The more we know, the more unsatisfying, right? Like, the more that your team is in power, it becomes a little harder to leverage this, right? I think part of the reason that some of the reaction was muted is also because it’s less—there are people who realize that you don’t want to get out over your skis on this, right? Because you don’t know what&#39;s coming next. I feel that there are people, you know, who might want to score political points.

I’ll just say: There’s a lot of right-wing influencers on the internet that I saw who are, like, kind of remarkably quiet, right? Even though, the fact that, I mean, there were some mentions of Bill Clinton, but it wasn’t their Super Bowl of conspiracy theorizing or anything like that. And I think there is, for some of those people, potentially this idea of, like, you don’t know what’s around the corner. You don’t know what’s going to be there. And I think there are more people, strangely enough for 2025, like, playing it a little bit safe with regards to that.

LaFrance: Well, and I’ll just add: I think what all three of us know acutely from being journalists is that something is the biggest story in the world until the next biggest story in the world comes along. And so I think what we’re probably likely to see is this sort of ebbing and flowing. And there’ll be moments where it’s less prominent, and potentially, depending on what the public is able to learn, moments where it comes back again. And so that’s sort of what I think we’ll be watching for and, obviously, trying to report out.

Stanley-Becker: I think also that—I was just gonna say: The theme isn’t going away, of the kind of selective release and weaponization of information by this administration. Adrienne mentioned Pizzagate, and the right-wing influencer responsible for propagating that conspiracy theory, Jack Posobiec, is totally tied in with the administration, with DHS in particular, accompanying Kristi Noem on raids. So I think the administration sees a lot of benefit in some of this conspiracy theorizing. So I expect it to continue, whether it’s about the Epstein files or other issues.

Warzel: So last thing to land this plane: What did we learn? Did we learn anything? If either of you are going to offer a high-level takeaway to somebody who is blissfully enjoying their holiday break and not combing through Department of Justice files over the weekend. Like, Adrienne, I’ll start with you. And then, Isaac, what did you learn?

LaFrance: This is maybe a cop-out, but I don’t know. I don’t think we know yet. I mean, we know there were crimes committed. We know Epstein had associations with powerful people, including at least two presidents. But I think our society could use more people saying “I don’t know.” And so I’m going to say, I don’t know. And I think we need to keep asking questions about it. But yeah, I think we’re very much in the midst of trying to figure this out.

Stanley-Becker: Yeah, no, no, no. Gosh, it’s really tough because there were small bits and pieces, the 1996 tip to the FBI, that to those on the inside of this or tracking it matter. They matter a great deal to understanding why this happened and why victims weren’t believed. But zooming way, way out, I do think it’s a kind of X-ray look at why our politics and society are so broken, because it’s got everything. It’s got the failure of accountability. It’s got the distrust. It’s got the politicization of everything. So I think that’s the bleak takeaway, is that it really is a window into how askew things are in our country and have been for a while.

Warzel: I’m going to be glib, and I’m going to say I learned that the government cannot build a search function that works properly.

Warzel: The website of it all was underwhelming in that sense. No, I think that that’s actually a really good way to end this and to think about this in general, is that if you do zoom out far enough, this is, in some ways, not just this dump of documents, but the whole saga. It feels a little bit like a skeleton key to understanding the frustrations that so many people have, right? The reason why there is a lot of distrust in institutions can be very much explained by the fact that there are wealthy and powerful people, people who currently occupy positions of power who have been seen associating with this person in some capacity, either before or in some cases after this person was a convicted sex offender, right? I think that there is a way that you can look at these things and really get an understanding of, as you said, why a lot of people feel so cynical about government and politics and elites, you know, to use that word in general. I think that is a good takeaway in this.

LaFrance: Can I offer one hopeful note?  Warzel: Oh wow! Hopeful note! Please!

LaFrance: I have hope. What I would say is, it also shows that the truth matters, and people won’t be satisfied until they get the truth. And sometimes the truth is elusive, and that’s very hard. But to me, there is some glimmer of hope that the intense focus on this means that people care about the truth and that people will seek it and report it. And that really does matter. So I’ll just throw that out there.

Warzel: Hell, yeah. Adrienne LaFrance, Isaac Stanley-Becker, thank you for coming on Galaxy Brain. Thank you for taking time out of your holiday break and also trying to make sense of this for all of us. Because, again, this does matter. This is something that is of great importance. So thank you all for your time and your reporting.

LaFrance: Thank you. And I hope the sun comes up soon over there. Is it dawn yet?

Warzel: No. We got like two hours to go here.

Something about getting older makes it easier to say “No, thank you.” On average, older Americans score higher on well-being than younger adults, and much of this is thanks to developing a clearer sense of what’s worth time and attention. At 61 years old, Arthur C. Brooks writes in his recent column, “I will go to considerable personal effort to serve causes that I care about, and I will discuss matters of spiritual depth or scientific importance for hours on end. But small talk in a noisy bar? No chance.”

The idea of saving your energy for what really matters seems obvious, even cliché. But as life’s pressures mount, it can be hard to sift through and make those decisions. Today’s newsletter offers some tips for making the tough choices that will ultimately help life feel more joyful.

Fire up simh (or your real PDP-11) and step back in time.

Because with his collection of old hardware, I think he would enjoy getting it to run.

Or even better, get Unix v0 and boot in on your old trusty PDP-7 (or again, use SIMH).

I&#39;d be really, REALLY surprised if this image isn&#39;t chock full o&#39; flipped bits and other random garbage.

Some brands of tape fare better than others over the years. I&#39;ve had 7 track tapes from the late 60s still be readable.

There were two &quot;bad blocks,&quot; and both have been recovered.

i am curious of the condition of the tape. was this a situation where we got one shot to read the tape? did it self-destruct as it ran past the read head?

there&#39;s a video in the summary, you could try to guess the condition from it: https://discuss.systems/@ricci... [discuss.systems]

Since we&#39;re stepping back in time, I’m going there. Imagine a Beowulf cluster of tape readers! Ignoring if a cluster of tape readers even makes sense.

Nope. they store that tape in a climate-controlled environment...

It&#39;s great that they managed to restore this. Aside from the purely historic interest, early Unix had some fascinating tools - translators for B and SNOBOL and other languages, a text to speech converter, the m6 macro processor, the tmg compiler generator, and the early versions of roff/nroff/troff are very interesting too.

Yet the article cites a recent Stanford University study that found employment among software developers aged 22 to 25 dropped nearly 20% between 2022 and 2025, &quot;coinciding with the rise of AI-powered coding tools.&quot;  


The story is part of MIT Technology Review&#39;s new Hype Correction series of articles about AI.

It depends on your skills level. For trivial beginner stuff, it&#39;s OK but then again.

For anything out of mainstream which no or very few examples are available for the model to train, it&#39;s pretty much useless.

As much as I hate seeing a brute-force approach burn huge amounts of electricity to enable morally dubious applications based on inputs that are often corrupt or illegal, I think the AI bubble is as likely to pop as the Bitcoin bubble.

(You might ask: &quot;Do you mean that AI is a brute-force approach that burns huge amounts of electricity, etc., or that Bitcoin is?&quot;  To which I answer: &quot;Yes.&quot;)

Bitcoin doesn&#39;t lie on what it is and what it does. AI companies on the other hand ...

Well, plenty of blockchain proponents and companies do/did.

As much as I hate seeing a brute-force approach burn huge amounts of electricity to enable morally dubious applications based on inputs that are often corrupt or illegal, I think the AI bubble is as likely to pop as the Bitcoin bubble.

The bicoin bubble popped nearly a decade ago. You might remember that time when an iced tea beverage company changed their name to blockchain and shot up in value.

Just because bitcoin&#39;s still around doesn&#39;t mean it hasn&#39;t popped - does the existence of Amazon, Microsoft, Googl

Right now we are in the “first hit is free” phase of trying to get everyone hooked on this AI crap.  All these upstarts are trying to get marketshare and get some spaghetti to stick to the wall and the usage is heavily subsidized by all the startup money gushing in.  Once the influx peters out and these places have to pay their own rent we will see the reality of which companies are able to actually survive and which of the horde are houses of cards.

I fully expect there to be plenty of actual applications, but it will peter out to much more mundane than currently advertised.

That&#39;s just what the LLM is trained on, rather than anyone&#39;s skill at using the LLM.

Here is what keeps happening to me. I keep falling into the same trap.

I throw various simple things at the AI, sort of a Google replacement, and it gives me what I want. I&#39;ll have several successes. And then it will lead me down the wrong rabbit hole, misdirect me, refuse to break out of it&#39;s mistaken path, and waste way way way too much of my time chasing my tail.

Eventually, I&#39;ll arrive at my destination and I&#39;ll ask it why the fuck it took such a circuitous route full of errors and straight up lies to get to the simple and correct answer. It&#39;ll respond saying that it&#39;s complicated and that it doesn&#39;t have all the answers, sorry.

Tomorrow, I&#39;ll start with it all over again like a crack addict.

Yep, this is when the context is full. Nuke the chat and start again.

My current favourite is &quot;Oh, now I understand completely what&#39;s happening&quot; (for the seventeenth time in a row - all of which were too-hasty.

Yeah, one of the things I like about Claude (and Gemini 3 as opposed to 2.5) is that they really clamped down on the use of &quot;Oh, now I&#39;ve got it! This is absolutely the FINAL fix to the problem, we&#39;ve totally solved it now! Here, let me write out FIX_FINAL_SOLVED.md&quot; with some half-arse solution.  And yep, the answer to going in circles is usually either &quot;nuke the chat&quot; or &quot;switch models&quot;.

The key here is that it helps, but it can&#39;t replace you.  Not that I care whether you get replaced, but there are a couple trillion bubble bux riding on whether you can be replaced, so it&#39;s a big deal.

I have mostly experience with a large app that I have been building lately. I use VSC with Claude. I have some background in coding but I do not do it for a living. As a tool, AI works best when there is a plan to follow and a master document for it to update to record progress. Starting from a proof of concept first and then expanding from there provides clarity. Sometimes I have used another AI to create a refined method to be implemented by another AI.

What I do not like about AI coding: the intellectual

AI companies should pivot to predicting  Anthropogenic Global Warming, I&#39;m sure it will be perfect for that.

All that matters is they have everyone&#39;s money, can influence elections and are too big to fail. Give them a break - AI is hard.

Professional dev in my third decade of experience speaking here. At first, these products really did assist quite a bit. In 2023 and 2024, I found the tools to be pretty decent at offering suggestions for small to medium snippets of code.

Something changed late last year. It may just be that the shine is wearing off, but I find most of the AI products producing less quality results than they did previously.

I rarely ever reach for them anymore. I sure would not rely on them over even an inexperienced junior dev, either.

Where chatGPT is an enormous help, is in the following:

AI seems to be feeding the bloat habit instead of trimming it. It&#39;s becoming an auto-bloater.

Very few in the industry are interested in parsimony. Devs would rather collect buzzwords for their resume rather than try to trim out layers and eye-candy toys. It&#39;s kind of like letting surgeons also be your general doctor, they&#39;d recommend surgery more often than you really need it.

The principles of typical biz/admin CRUD haven&#39;t really changed much since client/server came on the scene in the early 90&#39;s. Yet the layers and verbosity seem to keep growing. An ever smaller portion of time is spent on domain issues and ever more on the tech layers and parts to support the domain. Something is wrong but nobody is motivated to do anything about it because bloat is job security.

YAGNI and KISS are still important, but is dismissed because it reduces one&#39;s resume buzzword count. The obsession with scaling for normal apps is an example of such insanity: there&#39;s only like a 1 in 50k chance your app or company will ever become FANG-sized, yet too many devs want to  use a &quot;webscale&quot; stack. You&#39;re almost as likely to get struck by lightning while coding it. They patients are running the asylum.

Very few in the industry are interested in parsimony.I&#39;ve come to accept that this as true, and further conjecture that bloat is often a corporate/institutional goal. 
This seems to be a joke [zerobugsan...faster.net], but in reality corporate incentives are aligned to make things more bloated. If you&#39;re a manager, then the more people you have under you, the more power you have. This means you want your people to go slower so you have to hire more of them.  
I don&#39;t have a solution but there must be one.

Eliminate wages, assuming the result still works, would be classed as a productivity gain.

In this, it is decent, and need to be something you actually understand as a result so you can proof read it.But letting it loose on the big code at large is pretty dumb.

But letting it loose on the big code at large is pretty dumb.I do this frequently, with both packaged agents and my modifications to them, just to see what comes out the other side.
Sometimes it&#39;s great, sometimes it&#39;s pretty bad.
I do it as a side job, not my regular work, so the consequences of the failure are minimal- I just throw it away and try again with another modification.
If it were my actual main workflow... I think that would stress me the fuck out- each failure being significant wasted time and money.

If you let it write code freely, you can spend hours or days trying to figure out what the f**k it&#39;s done and why it&#39;s not done what you asked or why it randomly introduces a complete re-write for a single-line fix.

Quite frankly, I don&#39;t want to talk to anyone all day, including an agent. And it&#39;s not really about being anti-social. As most people know, we have two primary brains - logical and emotional. I find that trying to explain what needs to be done the model engages my emotional/social brain too much, and the logical part can&#39;t focus on getting the job done. In order to do quality work, I need to completely ignore the emotional side of my brain and let the logical brain get into the state of flow, where I can accurate track the state of what I&#39;m working on and follow logical workflows only. Talking to an agent all day engages my social side too much to do quality work.

I wonder what you think about pair programming. Sounds like that would not match your style either. And some agent/human interactions are thought to be similar to that, either the agent monitors if you mistype something, or you review each step of the agent before letting it continue.

Right.. it&#39;s &quot;as near as he can tell&quot;... and you know what? I think it probably works too.  But if it doesn&#39;t the bug will be slippery as shit and tracking it down is as much work as rewriting most of the program.

and there&#39;s also the case it cranks out something broken and when you ask it to fix line 17 it&#39;s a coin flip if it goes &quot;oh silly me!&quot; and fixes it or goes &quot;oh wow silly me!&quot; and spits out an identical line.

I&#39;ve been saying this since oh chatgpt3,  you gotta give it small problems the same as if yo

I came across some Emacs elisp code I&#39;d written about 25 years ago, and it looked pretty useful.  Emacs didn&#39;t like it.  I researched the functions and variables and they apparently had been rejiggered about 5 years later.  I said to myself, Self, sez I, this could be an interesting AI test.  I could probably make this do what I want in a few minutes now if I did it from scratch, but that wouldn&#39;t help me understand why it was written that way 25 years ago.

So I asked Grok.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it understood 25 year old elisp code just fine, explained when and how they had been rejiggered, and rewrite it for the current standards.  That was more than I had expected and well worth the time invested.

One other time Grok surprised me was asking how much of FDR&#39;s New Deal legislation would have passed if it had required 2/3 passage instead of just 1/2.  Not only did it name the legislation which would not have passed, it also named all the legislation which had passed by voice vote and there was no way to know if 2/3 had voted for it.  The couple of bills I checked did match and were not hallucinations.  The voice vote business was a nice surprise.

I program now for fun, not professionally.  The idea of &quot;offshoring&quot; the fun to AI doesn&#39;t interest me.  But trying to find 25-year-old documentation and when it changed doesn&#39;t sound like fun, and I&#39;m glad to know I can offshore at least some of the dreary parts.

Huh, what are the odds that MIT releases yet another paper with subjective contrarian views on productivity with AI?

There is a MASSIVE conflict of interest with these MIT papers here, and nobody&#39;s calling it out.So yeah, okay, sure, MIT thinks:

- AI makes you dumber (with methodology nobody without a dedicated lab can duplicate)
 - 95% of ai projects fail (using extremely rigid metrics and ignoring norms in the larger industry to reach conclusions, while including prototypes and showboat projec

I&#39;ve worked for myself as an independent developer for more than a decade now.Apps and websites and I do well working on my own.I&#39;m getting old though that the saying &quot;can&#39;t teach an old dog new tricks&quot;, is starting to make sense.AI couldn&#39;t have come at a better time in my life.As I&#39;ve always warned youth thinking of getting into tech at higher education, the older you are the less valuable you become. The complete opposite of the other white collar grad workers. You want the old experienced doctor, lawyer, accountant etc. Not the fresh faced grad; unless you are hiring software devs.Since I started using AI I&#39;ve found I&#39;m a magnitude more productive in my output and my overall success.It&#39;s such a time saver my home looks fab this summer (I&#39;m in NZ) as I&#39;ve had so much spare time to enjoy gardening.AI has knowledge. What it doesn&#39;t have is wisdom.As long as you remember that and have the wisdom and intuition to know when it is wrong you can&#39;t lose.Which gives me hope as an old timer in this game.Maybe after all I have what the other white collar grad workers have that is most valuable.Experience and wisdom which is why AI is no threat to any of us right now.

As a human, AI workflows let me have a life. I can let the agents knock out the easy things while I&#39;m working on other tasks. I still need design out what&#39;s to be worked on, review the code, fix bone mistakes they make, etc. It&#39;s basically like having a junior developer assigned to you.Every time I see someone talking about AI being a junior developer, I am quite certain they have never worked with a junior developer.

I really do think coding using AI tools is a bit faster, at least it seems that way to me.  As most of the morning but lengthy work can be done faster by AI.

But I am also pretty sure it&#39;s VERY easy to rapidly incur technical debt, especially if you are telling AI to review its own work.  Yeah it will do some stuff but who is to say post review fixes it&#39;s really better?

More than ever I think the right approach to coding with AI is to build up carefully crafted frameworks that are solid (maybe use AI to help

AI might make newbies faster at producing... something.  Probably something full of bugs and security holes.

But it won&#39;t help non-newbies with software development, of which &quot;coding&quot; is a relatively minor part.

Still, people like to concentrate on coding -- probably because software matures a

I&#39;ve been playing with these genAI system both as code producer but as helper on various tasks.And overall, I find the models quite brittle unless they are fine tuned on the precise task that you want.

The main problem that I see is that the tool is fundamentally a string in string out. But the strings could be absolutely anything including completely insane things without proper fine tuning.

Today, I am writing a simple automatic typo correction tool. The difficult bits are making sure that the tool didn&#39;t crap out. I mean, it is easy to check you actually got an answer from the tool. The problem is that sometimes the tools will tell you: &quot;Sure, I can fix typos. Here is your text corrected: &quot;. Ans so you have to toss that output out probably. But how do you figure out that it shat the bed? Well, you can&#39;t really, it is just as hard as the original task in some cases. So you bake various heuristics, or you get a different LLM to check the work of the first one.

At the end of the day, you really can&#39;t trust anything these tools do. They are way to erratic and unpredictible. And you should treat any of these tools as being possibly adversarial. It&#39;s exhausting to use really.

These wild swings between AI thinning out the workforce and making all our jerbs obsolete to not being sure if AI is even useful is giving me a headache.

It&#39;ll do both... dumb management and bean-counter types will replace people with AI, and the AI will suck at actually getting work done.

Been using the Claude CLI the last few weeks and it has definitely been a great assistant in working with Qt 6, C++, and QML.  The CLI interface is one of the best interfaces I have evey seen, and it&#39;s native use of markdown is ideal.  I am still writing 90% of the code but Claude&#39;s a great way to get information on some aspects of the library that I&#39;m not as familiar with.  I&#39;m not ready to set it loose with nothing but a specifications document yet.

When using AI to quickly mock up small chunks of code I find it an accelerator.  And I do mean small.

But when code scales up simple systems or API&#39;s it falls apart pretty quickly.  As the scale of the system grows the requirements grow even faster.  GDPR, PII, FIRB, NIST, all start to pile up on as code bases grow.  AI lacks the understand of the &quot;business&quot; need.  So you get this blob of code out and then you have to spend large amounts of time understanding it so you can re-factor it because the AI engine

I use AI regularly, at least once or twice a week. It&#39;s a real productivity boost. It&#39;s completely replaced searching for me. It&#39;s basically an API expert I can talk to and get answers from in 20 seconds. Good stuff.

Example: I&#39;m working on a bad code base of a legacy application. The backend is quite a mess which I don&#39;t really like to touch, so I push a lot of my new logic into our Postgres DB. I don&#39;t really like SQL and anything beyond one or two joins I&#39;d usually avoid. With progbuddy AI I&#39;m doing trigg

Perhaps waylandx [github.com] could help?  Might not work for a whole desktop, though.

Remote access of computers is more important than ever. There was one brief moment in history where it seemed obsolete that the computer you were using was not on your desktop. Today virtually every Linux computer is in a data center somewhere. Getting rid of X is pants on head retarded, and even if it were the right move it should have been done for technical reasons not intentionally causing X to die through lack of maintenance. The Xlibre guy is doing God&#39;s work.

That&#39;s why I linked to waylandx, not xwayland.  I agree that getting rid of X is retarded, and that wayland is not a fit replacement.

There are well-intentioned people who write code using the newest API (as that&#39;s usually the right thing to do) thus good programs that require wayland start popping up, that&#39;s what waylandx is for.  There are also severely misguided folks who drop X like KDE; I don&#39;t use KDE myself thus I can&#39;t comment on the details.

It looks like X will indeed die due to lack of maintenance,

You know that it is much easier to write remote desktop software using Wayland? You can implement it as a compositor and you&#39;re done. No need for Xdummy servers and similar crude workarounds to get programs run in background. You just provide a compositor that renders to a remote computer instead of to a display.

Sadly shade doesn&#39;t work current with kwin on Wayland.  It&#39;s very annoying. Also focus follows mouse is quirky on Wayland.  Other than that KDE on Wayland is pretty fantastic.

Wayland intentionally sabotaged focus-follows-mouse by making clicking on a window raise it unconditionally. Gnome did the same thing (for a while there was an option to turn off the raise, but they made it also ignore any requests from the program itself to raise the window so you could not actually rearrange windows except by closing and opening them again).

There does appear to be a large faction that wants focus-follows-mouse to go away and will do anything they can to achieve it.

Quite a few WMs (without attached DEs) have shade features. But the unique feature of kwin is focus steal prevention. Never seen that in another WM.

> It has its own set of defaults but in no way is it superior to any other window manager

KDE isn&#39;t just a window manager, it&#39;s the whole desktop experience...

For me it&#39;s mainly when I get an idea about how my usage could be more comfortable, so I rearrange stuff, change a few options and experiment.Now I do have trouble using computers that aren&#39;t mine...

Mate was a straight fork of Gnome 2, as such it&#39;s a 2 decade old time capsule.

Gnome 3 then made a series of idiosyncratic UI design choices which polarized the Linux community.

And if work imposes Windows 11 for my day job, I find XFCE/Debian on my home machine to be the least drama in terms of paradigms.

MATE is outdated (but good for resource constrained systems) and GNOME is dumbed down and hard to get good results from, you need a whole bunch of add-ins just to get where KDE is. KDE was very bad in the past, but it&#39;s really come quite a long way. GNOME was really quite good in the past, but it&#39;s really gone the wrong way. I&#39;m not against having a simple mode but I don&#39;t want oversimplification to infest everything.

I&#39;ve been hearing this a bit from very traditional greybeard linux users (I mostly just use linux at work and I&#39;m very much a terminal jocky. tmux is my &quot;terminal manager&quot;.) who have come around to KDE from being strong dislikers of it in the past. That Mate is just crusty and old, Gnome hasn&#39;t really been fun for a while but KDE has solved most of its nonsense problems and is now a quite complete and useable system, so its become their daily driver.

I just want to get alpine functional again so I can revert

The problem is, developers sometimes get too full of themselves and then start making changes that actively get in the way - which is where Gnome appears to be right now, for instance.

I want a window manager that lets me do what I need but mostly stays out of my way. Right now, for me, that&#39;s cinnamon.

This is why I first went to fluxbox without taskbar/decorations (on Debian) and later bare openbox (on Devuan) because the ctrl key stuck too often after switching workspaces.

There&#39;s nothing else but the programs and the unintrusive osd clock on my screen. It&#39;s the best &quot;desktop experience&quot; I&#39;ve had in decades of computer use.

I already realised during the Windows days that while changing colours and wallpaper is fun, it&#39;s mostly useless when 99.99% of the time the actually used programs obscure everything.

Went from Ubuntu with Gnome 2 on my first private laptop to Debian/KDE to now Devuan/openbox because all I need is the graphical part to display the programs I use. Everything else (taskbar, wallpaper, even window decorations) don&#39;t add anything to my &quot;desktop experience&quot; because it either takes up space or can&#39;t be seen anyway. The most fancy thing is picom making inactive windows slightly transparent to put more emphasis on the active window.

On Thursday, the board of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts voted to rename the center “the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” Weirdly, the board of the center, mostly picked by President Donald Trump, does not seem to understand that a “memorial” center is named for someone who is deceased, and thus the new name implies that Trump is dead. By Friday, Trump’s name was physically added to the building at the behest of his handpicked board. Don’t be fooled by the absurdity of Trump’s vanity and the obsequiousness of these government officials: This is not an at all an innocuous move.

American political culture has long rejected he idea that sitting officer holders, or even living persons, should be honored with buildings or institutions named for them, or have their names and faces on currency, coins, or postage stamps. This sort of behavior is alien to a republic and a democracy. It is common, however, in dictatorships. Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Francisco Franco had heir faces on stamps, currency, and coins during their respective despotic reigns. Josef Stalin appeared on numerous stamps while he was the dictator of the Soviet Union and renamed a major city Stalingrad, after himself. Kim Jong-un sometimes appears on North Korean stamps.

The first United States stamps featured Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, many decades after their deaths. Our coins reflect this tradition as well, with Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John F. Kennedy, Dwight Eisenhower, Susan B. Anthony, and Sacagawea getting their faces on coinage posthumously. The tyrannical Confederate government, on the other hand, put its leaders on stamps and currency, breaking with the long United States tradition of not honoring living people in these ways.

The traditions around the naming of buildings and institutions in our democracy have been similar. And the names are often the result of nonpolitical, bipartisan decisions. Our nation’s capital was called the District of Columbia until 1802—three years after the death of George Washington—when the city of Washington was chartered. By this time Washington was seen as the “father” of our country, but his political party, the Federalist Party, was no longer in power. The Democratic-Republican Party of Thomas Jefferson supported the name change. Dulles airport in Washington was named for the deceased Republican Secretary of State John Foster Dulles during the Democratic administration of Kennedy. When it opened, there was talk about changing the name, but the Kennedy administration kept it. Mayor Fiorello La Guardia was responsible for the creation of New York Municipal Airport, which opened in 1939. Shortly before he died of cancer, and after he was no longer mayor, the city named the airport for him. Similarly, Congress renamed Washington National Airport for Ronald Reagan in 1998, long after Reagan had left politics, and four years after he had announced that he was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease—and with Democrat Bill Clinton in the White House. O’Hare International Airport in Chicago was named for Edward Henry “Butch” O’Hare, the first Navy pilot to win the Medal of Honor, who died in combat in 1943.

Cultural institutions are often named for those who donated to them, were leaders of them, or used their influence to create them. The Smithsonian is named for James Smithson, a British scientist who endowed the museum with a gift in his will. Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History began in 1893 but was renamed in 1905, a year before its main benefactor, Marshall Field, passed away. New York City’s Hayden Planetarium was named for a banker, Charles Hayden, who funded its creation, and passed away two years after it opened.

Which brings us to the Kennedy Center. The idea of a national cultural center had bounced around American politics for three decades before President John F. Kennedy pushed for legislation to create it, using both public and private money. The center opened in 1971, nearly eight years after JFK was assassinated. It was formally named the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Richard Nixon, a Republican, was president when it opened. In fact, Kennedy had beaten Nixon in the 1960 presidential election, but Nixon did not try to change the name. He did attend a performance there in the Eisenhower Theater, which also opened in 1971. Bipartisanship and honoring deceased leaders were etched into the building, literally.

Now Trump has physically etched a different, more sinister tradition into its walls.

The bottom line here is simple. For nearly 250 years the United States has not “honored” sitting political leaders by naming buildings or cultural institutions for them. Presidents have never appointed a board to an institution and then pressured that board to rename the institution for the president. Presidents have not signed bills, or issued executive orders, to name things after themselves. Dictators, emperors, führers, czars, kings, and “dear leaders” do such things, because it makes them feel good, powerful, and strokes their fragile egos. Presidents of a republic do not act in this way.

It is unseemly, it is childish, and it is thoroughly un-American. But it is also a warning of a path we must not continue to travel down.

Judges around the country have begun to show a simmering fury at the conduct of federal agents, including those carrying out the increasingly brutal immigration crackdowns in predominantly blue cities nationwide. At the same time, many of the same judges have begun to balk at being extravagantly and shamelessly deceived by Justice Department lawyers defending that conduct in their courtrooms. On Thursday, another federal district court judge, Gary R. Brown, lit into the Trump administration for effectively torturing immigrants in a manner that “shocks the conscience.” His 24-page ruling also castigated both Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and government lawyers for submitting “evasive and demonstrably false” claims to the court under oath. Brown, a Donald Trump appointee, also raised the serious possibility of imminent contempt proceedings against those who lied to him.

On this week’s Slate Plus bonus episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed lower court judges’ escalating efforts to hold government officials accountable for shameless fabrications, contemptuous behavior, and egregious violations of immigrants’ constitutional rights. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: This picks up themes from our main show with the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt, who warned us that during Trump 1.0, the lawyering could be sloppy, but it at least conformed to norms and basic rules of truth. Now the obligation of candor is simply gone, and lying to a judge’s face is a-OK. Can you tell us what happened in Judge Brown’s court?

Mark Joseph Stern: Judge Brown explained why he ordered the release of Erron Anthony Clarke, a noncitizen whom ICE detained even though he legally entered the country and has no criminal record whatsoever. ICE accused Clarke of overstaying his visa and arrested him. Brown wrote that agents may have arrested him without securing the necessary charging documents or identifying probable cause, then fudged the paperwork to obscure the fact that they acted before they had lawful authority to do so.

But set that aside. ICE then locked Clarke up at the Central Islip federal courthouse, placing him in a tiny cell designed for one person along with eight other men. They had no access to bunks, bedding, soap, showers, toothbrushes, or clean clothes. The cell was literally freezing cold. The lights stayed on 24 hours a day. The detainees had to sleep on the floor, crowded around an open toilet that reeked of urine.

Clarke challenged his detention, arguing due process violations. When it first appeared that Judge Brown was going to release him, ICE transferred him to a different facility in Newark. Brown still ordered him released immediately. ICE blatantly defied the order, holding Clarke overnight. Brown then demanded more information about Clarke’s confinement. On Thursday, he said that what ICE provided was “preposterous,” “rank hearsay,” “evasive and demonstrably false,” and filled with “material misstatements.” He accused ICE agents of lying repeatedly—quite possibly to make it seem like Clarke spent less time in torturous conditions than he did, or to cover up its effort to evade the court’s orders by transferring him to other locations. Brown also said that ICE refused to provide key details about the holding cell at the Islip courthouse. He warned that ICE has started exploiting these holding cells to cram multiple detainees into tiny spaces for long periods, subjecting them to what is essentially torture.

Brown asked for a photo of the Islip cell, but ICE would not even provide it on the grounds that doing so would “create privacy concerns” for detainees. He was having none of this. As he wrote on Thursday: “After nearly 35 years of experience with federal law enforcement in this judicial district, encompassing service as a prosecutor and a judge, I have never encountered anything like this. ICE’s seeming disregard of procedural requisites, combined with the chillingly brutal conditions of confinement to which Petitioner has been, and presumably would continue to be subjected, cries out for immediate remedy.” And so he found that there were “extraordinary circumstances” here that required him to grant bail and release Clarke.

I want to unpeel the onion for one quick second. It’s not just the horrifying misconduct on the part of ICE. It’s the lying. And in that sense, it feels again like we’re back in Judge James Boasberg’s courtroom with a judge who is confronted with blatant misrepresentations. According to Brown, ICE claimed that it moved Clarke from a facility to another in eight minutes, but it’s a 35-minute drive. So unless there’s an ICE rocket ship we don’t know about, these are just blatant falsifications. It does raise this question, which is the same question Judge Boasberg is exploring in D.C.: Is there some possibility that there could be consequences?

Yes, there are. This was not just a cri de coeur against ICE. There is a real possibility of consequences. Judge Brown ordered counsel for ICE to tell him why he shouldn’t enter an order of contempt as punishment for ICE’s defiance of his orders. That means he is strongly considering contempt—maybe civil, maybe criminal—against ICE agents who lied to him repeatedly and conspired to defy his orders.

Crucially, Judge Brown isn’t just considering contempt because of conduct that occurred outside his courtroom. He’s looking at ICE’s defiance of his own orders by lying to him in declarations submitted to his court, lies evidently abetted by DOJ attorneys. That actually takes this beyond Judge Boasberg’s saga, because this seems to involve cut-and-dry, eminently demonstrable perjury. I know there are a lot of hurdles that Brown would have to overcome to bring a contempt proceeding with teeth, but I do think he has a good reason to try. This case could easily escalate into the next judicial attempt to hold people accountable who absolutely need to be in order for us to protect the rule of law.

In mid-March of 2025, ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt and his colleagues started hearing that the Trump administration might attempt a flagrantly lawless publicity stunt, involving migrant men, secret flights to El Salvador, a notorious gulag, and a total disregard for due process. Despite getting word that something was about to happen, and rushing into a Saturday night hearing, and then securing a TRO from DC judge James Boasberg, Lee and his colleagues were unable to prevent more than 250 men from being renditioned from Texas to the CECOT torture prison in El Salvador. The legal cases spawned by the dramatic events of March 15th 2025 haven’t gone away, indeed they are reaching crucial milestones in the courts, raising foundational questions about the abuse of statutes and what it means to defy court orders. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick is joined by the ACLU’s Lee Gelernt who is litigating these cases, to discuss the very high stakes of a set of cases that may have fallen off your radar in the shuffle.

How these cases play out will dictate much of what happens for the rest of Trump’s term in office by answering democracy-defining questions such as whether the antiquated and radical wartime powers of the Alien Enemies Act can be unleashed on people the government deems enemies domestically, whether court orders are actually directives the Trump DoJ is bound  to follow, whether the district courts can require Pam Bondi’s justice department to assist in the finding of fact, and whether the ancient legal concepts protecting liberty of due process and habeas corpus have the force of law in Trump’s America.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Interview &quot;I think everybody is adopting AI irresponsibly and I think it&#39;s going to have a net negative outcome on the socio-economic standing of the world,&quot; said Bars Juhasz. &quot;So let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t pitch more of a win-win future.&quot;

Juhasz, CEO of no-code automation biz WorkBeaver, told The Register in an interview that he hopes to encourage the adoption of AI-based automation – agents – from the demand side rather than the supply side, from the perspective of the office worker rather than management.

Around August 2024, he said, he sold most of his shares in Undetectable.ai, a company he co-founded, and found himself in a position to work on whatever he wanted.

Given his background in machine learning, he said, he started thinking about AI agents – AI models given access to tools – and how they&#39;re likely to affect society. The result was WorkBeaver.

&quot;We think companies are going to rush in, they&#39;re going to adopt AI too quickly, lay off people as a result of that, realize they messed up, and have to bring people back in,&quot; said Juhasz. &quot;And wouldn&#39;t you know it? Here we are a year later, and it&#39;s played out almost to the T of how we hoped they wouldn&#39;t go, but here we are.&quot;

Juhasz expects that within five to ten years workers will have to demonstrate some level of AI proficiency appropriate to their roles, a view evident in Purdue University&#39;s new AI competency requirement as a condition of graduation. But, he said, &quot;a lot of people are just not going to be able to do that. They&#39;re just not in that position.&quot; Maybe they&#39;re non-technical, he said, or they&#39;re just resisting the technology.

Taking it slowly may be anathema in an industry that celebrates the Zuckerbergian zeal to &quot;move fast and break things.&quot; However, the consequence of urgent AI adoption imperatives is that someone has to deal with the mess.

&quot;Now we&#39;ve got these stories coming out of having to backtrack, of AI janitors, right?&quot; Juhasz mused. &quot;A whole new career dedicated just to cleaning up messes left by this rush.&quot;

WorkBeaver, said Juhasz, represents an attempt to help people become comfortable with AI, regardless of their level of technical competency.

&quot;So instead of focusing on the business side of the equation, the supply side, what if we focused on the demand side?&quot; he said. &quot;What if we focused on the people who are set to be displaced, who otherwise realistically have very little fighting chance to be in the competitive workforce in the next five to ten years?&quot;

WorkBeaver presently functions by using a menu-driven interface that asks users for prompt-based descriptions of tasks. The underlying AI agent then attempts to carry out the described task as if it were the human user, without requiring code or APIs.

The company website contains a variety of use cases designed to help people understand the sorts of tasks its tech can handle, because people don&#39;t necessarily see how AI technology can help them accomplish things. Examples include automated form filling, reminder setting, appointment setting, email sending, data gathering, and data entry.

&quot;Some of the people using WorkBeaver to create agentic automations don&#39;t even use ChatGPT,&quot; said Juhasz. &quot;That&#39;s the level of non-technical we&#39;re targeting.&quot;

Juhasz said WorkBeaver&#39;s approach differs from other companies selling agentic tools through its focus on staff and what workers find helpful, rather than top-down directives to use AI without much understanding of the work being done.

&quot;For example, I spoke with reporters at Reuters and they have top-down mandates from managers who are not editors, who are not journalists, coming in saying: &#39;Okay, you guys have to use these tools X amount of times per week.&#39; To me, they&#39;re KPIs [key performance indicators], right? And the tools they&#39;re asking them to use are literally replacing the critical thinking process of the job. It&#39;s like put in the story, put in the sources, and it&#39;ll spin differently. Obviously, as you can imagine, they&#39;re not too happy about it. They don&#39;t believe that&#39;s where automation should be taking place.&quot;

WorkBeaver launched its private alpha in January this year and reached open beta in September. The company now has close to 4,000 users, according to Juhasz, primarily among small-and medium-sized enterprises. Customers are a mix of individuals paying out of their own pockets and of teams buying multiple licenses. Juhasz is also working on a deal with a laptop maker to have WorkBeaver preinstalled on business laptops in South America.

Juhasz said the company is a commercial success but has fallen short as a social enterprise that helps people become comfortable with AI.

One reason, he explained, is that deploying agents requires user education.

&quot;Education is required for prompting,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re about three to six months ahead of even OpenAI and Anthropic in this space. They&#39;re about to find out what we found out three months ago, which is the education requirement to make an agent do what you wanted it to do effectively by prompting is going to immediately cut out a lot of normal people.&quot;

The other reason, he said, is that &quot;People just didn&#39;t know what to automate.&quot;

WorkBeaver’s next release will address that issue. Due this month, the next iteration of the service replaces the menu-driven prompting process with an agent monitoring screen, mouse, and keyboard interactions as a way to learn the tasks users undertake and then repeat them.

&quot;What we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve created a very unique user experience where anybody, non-technical user, is able to create automations, agentic automations, with no prompting, no drag and drop,&quot; explained Juhasz. &quot;The way it works is you sit down with the agent and you collaboratively work through a task together. So basically anything you do on your computer, the agent should be able to take over.&quot;

The collaborative training process is the key – the agent can catch and correct potential points of failure as the worker is walking through the task. This avoids the frustrating experience of creating an agent-based automation that fails at runtime and requires a technical person to revisit the code or the configuration process.

Juhasz said WorkBeaver built its tech using Google Cloud Vertex AI. But the agent is model-agnostic and can, with a bit of training, work with any of the foundation models and can run in enterprise private clouds.

&quot;We are very much on the privacy end of the spectrum,&quot; said Juhasz. &quot;Literally, the only things we store on our servers about you is your email address and your account balance. That&#39;s it. I don&#39;t need liability, so everything is stored locally on the users&#39; devices, fully encrypted. We learned from Microsoft&#39;s mistakes.&quot;

Juhasz added that WorkBeaver has a zero data retention agreement with Google Cloud. &quot;Your data lives and dies in ephemeral memory for a fraction of a second at most,&quot; he said.

Allowing an AI agent to control your computer is a security risk, one that Juhasz readily acknowledges.

&quot;I don&#39;t want an agent being able to access stuff it shouldn&#39;t have access to,&quot; he said.

WorkBeaver addresses this concern through application and folder allow-listing, alongside a few additional security measures.

The litmus test, said Juhasz, will be whether, when the new version is released in a week or two, non-technical people use the technology in a way that makes them happier at work. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A staffer at the USA’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) tried to disable backup generators powering some of its Network Time Protocol infrastructure, after a power outage around Boulder, Colorado, led to errors.

As explained in a mailing list post by Jeffrey Sherman, a NIST supervisory physicist who maintains the institute’s atomic clocks, “The atomic ensemble time scale at our Boulder campus has failed due to a prolonged utility power outage.”

Sherman, whose LinkedIn bio proclaims he is “One of the few federal employee actually paid to watch the clocks all day,” says one impact of the incident “is that the Boulder Internet Time Services no longer have an accurate time reference.”

That’s bad because one of the things NIST uses its atomic clocks for is to provide a Network Time Protocol service, the authoritative source of timing information that the computing world relies on so that diverse systems can synchronize events. If NTP isn’t working, outcomes can include difficulties authenticating between systems, meaning applications can become unstable.

At this point, readers might wonder why NIST can’t just turn off the inaccurate service. Sherman said a backup generator kicked in and kept the servers running.

“I will attempt to disable them [the generators] to avoid disseminating incorrect time,” he wrote.

But the storms that caused the outage were so severe, only emergency services personnel are allowed to visit the site.

His post says he has seen “strong evidence one of the crucial generators has failed. In the downstream path is the primary signal distribution chain, including to the Boulder Internet Time Service.”

“Another campus building houses additional clocks backed up by a different power generator; if these survive it will allow us to re-align the primary time scale when site stability returns without making use of external clocks or reference signals,” he added.

Xcel Energy, the local utility, blamed the outage on strong winds and as of Saturday night local time (7:00PM MT Dec 20, 2:00AM UTC Dec 21) advised most customers would have power again within three hours.

However at the time of writing – 00:15 MT Dec 21 – NIST’s status page states the Boulder site is experiencing “Facility outages” and a “< 4.8us clock error.” That’s about four microseconds.

NIST told CBS News it warned users such as telcos and aerospace organizations that weather around Boulder could cause problems, and advised them to tap the org’s other sources of time information.

That’s sound advice as best practice for using NTP is to specify multiple servers, and failover from troubled sources of time info to accurate ones. This incident therefore shouldn’t trouble the prudent, but may leave some NTP feed users unawares if they rely solely on the Boulder facility’s time feeds. ®

            <div id="article-text">If you were hoping for some relief from stratospheric memory pricing, don&#39;t hold your breath. DRAM prices aren&#39;t expected to peak until at least 2026, TechInsights analyst James Sanders tells El Reg.

DRAM is an incredibly broad category and includes everything from the DDR5 found in desktops and servers to the GDDR7 and HBM used by graphics cards and AI accelerators.

The market is also notoriously volatile and prone to wild swings in pricing, spiking as inventories are drawn down and cratering as new capacity is brought online, Sanders explains.

According to TechInsights, memory pricing was already on the rise in 2024, growing 88 percent from a rather steep valley the year prior. Based on previous DRAM booms, one might expect it to grow at a slower pace in 2025, before contracting in 2026 or 2027.

However, Sanders tells us that&#39;s unlikely to happen this time around. &quot;I think we&#39;re looking at the peak in 2026,&quot; he said, adding that even then he only expects DRAM prices to settle in 2027 before rising again in 2028.

So what&#39;s to blame for the sky-high memory prices? Well, as you might have already guessed, it&#39;s AI. But it&#39;s not the full story. Timing is also a factor.

According to Sanders, the AI boom kicked off at what was very possibly the worst time for memory vendors. &quot;This demand started in the Valley for the DRAM industry. That makes financially trying to build additional capacity really challenging,&quot; he said. &quot;If you&#39;re rushing, the time to bring additional capacity online is about three years. It&#39;s a quirk of bad timing that&#39;s led to the circumstances that we&#39;re in now.&quot;

More realistically, DRAM vendors, like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron, are looking at four or five years to ramp production at a new fab, at which time the market conditions could have changed considerably.

Timing is also why the DRAM shortage is hitting some harder than others. &quot;The consumer market is in the stratosphere, whereas OEMs are about a year out, and they&#39;re not getting heartburn quite yet,&quot; he explained.

In other words, giant hardware vendors like Dell and HP aren&#39;t suffering nearly as much because they tend to lock in their orders early, while smaller vendors are at the mercy of spot pricing. In fact, ahead of the Christmas holiday, G.Skill, a supplier of memory for gamers, issued a statement pinning the blame for jacking the price of its products on AI.

&quot;DRAM prices are experiencing significant industry-wide volatility, due to severe global supply constraints and shortages, driven by unprecedented high demand from the AI industry,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;As a result, G.Skill procurement and sourcing costs have substantially increased. G.Skill pricing reflects industry-wide component cost increases from IC suppliers and is subject to change without notice based on market conditions.&quot;

What&#39;s more, AI is driving demand for a different class of memory that, unlike traditional DRAM, isn&#39;t much use in most consumer applications.

&quot;This is a little bit different from previous boom-bust cycles, in that wafers are being redirected toward HBM and away from consumer-grade memory,&quot; Sanders said.

High-bandwidth memory consists of multiple layers of DRAM, which as the name implies, enables it to achieve much higher bandwidth than a typical DRAM module you might find in a notebook or RDIMM. With HBM3e, it&#39;s not uncommon to see a single 36 GB chip deliver 1 TB/s of bandwidth. By comparison, a single 8 GB LPDDR5x module might be able to achieve 140 GB/s.

HBM is used almost exclusively in high-end datacenter GPUs and AI accelerators, like Nvidia&#39;s B300, AMD&#39;s MI355X, or Amazon&#39;s Trainium3. Because of this, Sanders says, the memory market is rapidly diverging.

&quot;Because there&#39;s no consumer demand for HBM — the consumer market can&#39;t bear that price at all — it is really becoming two markets that are detached from each other,&quot; he said.

Memory vendors are currently in the midst of a memory transition as they prepare to ramp production of HBM4 modules, which will power chips like Nvidia&#39;s Vera Rubin and AMD&#39;s MI400s starting next year. Initially, Sanders says these chips will command a price premium.

And while TechInsights does expect the memory market to settle in 2027, it won&#39;t last. As you may recall, Nvidia plans to cram 576 Rubin-Ultra GPUs each equipped with a terabyte of HBM4e memory into a single rack starting in, that&#39;s right, 2027.

This might explain why Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra recently told investors that due to strong AI datacenter demand, &quot;aggregate industry supply will remain substantially short of the demand for the foreseeable future.&quot;

Not that he&#39;s really complaining. While end customers are grappling with memory prices that have gone up 3x in just a few months, the memory fabs are raking in the cash. In Micron&#39;s Q1 2026 earnings call this month, the company saw revenues rise 56 percent while net income more than doubled from $1.87 billion this time last year to $5.24 billion.

And while memory vendors may now have the capital necessary to finance additional fabs, it&#39;ll be at least three more years before they enter production. And even when they do, the bulk of capacity is likely to be allocated toward HBM and other enterprise products.

One wildcard in all of this is China&#39;s CXMT, Sanders explains.

&quot;CXMT doesn&#39;t necessarily play by the same set of rules that everyone else does,&quot; he explained.

For one, they don&#39;t have any meaningful HBM output at this time. Second, many had expected the company to focus heavily on DDR4, but instead, Sanders says the company now appears to be transitioning to DDR5.

Today, CXMT isn&#39;t a very large player in the DRAM business. It certainly doesn&#39;t help that the company is subject to United States export controls. Despite this, TechInsights expects the company to grow considerably by the end of the decade from five to 10 percent of the market, which should in theory help grow the supply of DDR5 overall. ®

The follow-up to Nintendo’s hybrid console hasn’t disappointed.

I waited for the Nintendo Switch 2 for a long time. Rumors of an allegedly-real-but-never-released Switch Pro swirled around for years as I watched fewer and fewer AAA third-party games make their way to Nintendo’s little console that could. There were always enough first-party titles and indie games to tide me over, but I watched with some envy as games like Elden Ring took the world by storm, knowing I’d have to wait until Nintendo’s next generation hardware arrived to add them to my Switch library. Now, finally, it’s here.

The Switch 2’s core strength for me boils down to it being a better version of the original Switch. Its 7.9-inch 120Hz 1080P screen looks sharp — yes, an OLED display would have been nicer, but I’m not complaining — and its ability to output at up to 4K, or up to 120Hz at lower resolutions, is a welcome improvement. It can play most original Nintendo Switch games, some of which have been updated through free or paid patches to run at a higher frame rate or resolution.

The only native Switch 2 game I’ve played so far is Mario Kart World, which I picked up as part of a bundle with the system. My most-played game is the original Switch title The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which runs at 4K and 60 frames per second if you get the Switch 2 edition for $10 (it’s a free download if you have an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription). That subscription also allows me to play a growing number of GameCube games available as Nintendo Classics, including titles I didn’t get to play when I was a kid.

I specifically put off playing games from my backlog, including titles going back several years, until I could play them on a larger display in handheld mode, and I don’t regret my decision. Putting dozens of hours into Octopath Traveler while chilling on the couch with the big-screen handheld was a heck of a lot of fun. Nintendo and third-party developers have also been pretty generous with releasing free demos of Nintendo Switch 2 titles, including Donkey Kong Bananza and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, so it’s possible to sample bigger titles before deciding to pick them up.

My only real complaint with the Nintendo Switch 2 is its 256GB of internal storage, which isn’t enough for folks like me who’ve built up a large digital library of Switch games. Adding more requires you to pop in a microSD Express card, which can be twice the price of than the regular microSD cards used by the original Switch. My hope is that if a hardware revision comes down the line it’ll include an OLED display and at least 512GB of storage. By that time microSD Express cards will have hopefully become more affordable.

The console’s $449.99 starting price came as a shock to many, but it seems fair given its tech specs, and an escalating tariff situation that delayed the Switch 2’s preorder timing in North America and compelled Nintendo to raise the price of the original Nintendo Switch. Nintendo recently announced that it “will shift our primary development focus to Nintendo Switch 2 and expand our business around this new platform.” I’ll continue to look forward to exclusive titles making their way to my new console of choice, along with ports of third-party games that I haven’t gotten around to yet.

On Version History: the long reign of AOL Instant Messenger, the messaging app that maybe never should have existed at all.

If you were an internet user around the turn of the century, there’s a good chance I could play a one-second long sound of a door opening and memories would immediately come flooding back. Memories of running home from school and logging onto AOL Instant Messenger to chat with your friends or your crush. Maybe memories of how AIM changed the way your company did business. Certainly memories of your old screen name, and the angsty song lyrics you put into your away message.

AIM was, for a time, the most important chat app on the internet. It also barely managed to continue to exist. The app was created by a semi-rogue team inside of AOL, and was loathed by the executives who wanted to keep AOL as the all-powerful walled garden it once was. But as soon as AIM launched, it became practically undeniable. AOL never figured out how to make money from AIM, or to pivot its strategy around its hugely influential messaging service, but AIM became an internet icon anyway.

On this episode of Version History, we tell the story of AIM’s rise, its importance for multiple generations of internet users, and its ultimate inability to keep up with social networks, texting, and other messaging apps. David Pierce, Victoria Song, and author and journalist Kyle Chayka document the platform’s creation inside of AOL, try to make sense of why it was so vital to internet life for a while, and wonder what might have happened if AIM had stuck around.

We take a look back at 13 of our favorite projects from 2025.

The Verge art team’s favorite projects this year spanned the circus surrounding DOGE, the myths of the Vietnam War, the privacy crisis for trans people online, the vast surveillance network aimed at tracking down Iranian military dissidents, and much more. We built a kaleidoscope to showcase some standout products from The Verge’s gift guides, sent an illustrator to the crowded halls of the courthouse to draw Luigi Mangione fans and spectators live, and dug deep into the confusing world of News Daddy to create collages about how college students get their news. Here’s a look back at some of what we made this year.

Wikipedia is infected by the woke mind virus one of the few remaining reliable institutions in these trying times, kept steady and stabilized by its processes for deciding disputes and its faithful pool of tens of thousands of Wikipedia editors across the globe. I was inspired by old encyclopedias, neoclassical architecture, and the DK kids books, the latter of which have random images in a stream-of-consciousness explosion that reminds me a lot of the strange little blue hyperlink pathways that might end you up on the Wikipedia page for Grouvellinus leonardodicaprioi. — Cath Virginia, art director

Image by Tran Nguyen, Kristen Radtke / The Verge

For this package commemorating the 50-year anniversary of the fall of Saigon, Kristen Radtke designed a split-screen hub to collect all the stories, reflecting the conflicting narratives and myths of the Vietnam War. Engineer Graham MacAree brought everything to life, while it was brilliantly illustrated by Tran Nguyen. — Kristen Radtke, creative director

Image by Cath Virginia, Taehee Yoonseul for The Verge

Things seem to get scarier all the time, especially for trans people, but I wanted to use the design of this package to express the otherworldly and unforeseen futures that are possible, without being overly hopeful or pessimistic. We don’t know what the future holds, but I know that trans people are going to be the ones helping to shape it for the better. Grateful for the works of Taehee Yoonseul, who created the looping background animation, and Sasha Cherepanov, who licensed her beautiful font Transgender Grotesk to us for use in this design. — Cath Virginia, art director

Assigning art for Luigi Mangione’s pretrial hearing to Molly Crabapple was a stroke of genius by editor Sarah Jeong. This installment of the trial was particularly chaotic, and we were unsure if Crabapple (or our reporter Mia Sato) would even make it into the courtroom, but Crabapple made use of the downtime by drawing hordes of Mangione fans and spectators from the floor of the courthouse hallway. — Kristen Radtke, creative director

For this package about influencers and their reach and creep across the internet, I created a poppy, loud scheme across each feature and a hub that lightly mimics the scroll of TikTok. The animated collages from each story, all by different artists, give each story a distinctive flair while still coalescing into a consistent vibe. — Kristen Radtke, creative director

In order to create a kaleidoscope effect captured entirely in camera for this year’s set of gift guides, I built a simple mirrored structure that was placed on top of a very large TV. Art director Cath Virginia and I placed the selected items inside the mirrored triangle, and I photographed while she created wonderful backgrounds. It was the most fun I’ve had in the studio all year. — Amelia Holowaty Krales, senior photo editor

This gut-punch of a gorgeous comic by Matt Huynh about a US military psyop that tried to scare Viet Cong soldiers with tape recordings of Vietnamese “ghosts” is both a look at a globally underknown piece of history and a gorgeous personal narrative. Huynh’s brushwork is emotive and lush, and his command of narrative builds into one of the best comics The Verge has ever published. — Kristen Radtke, creative director

Illustration by Ariel Davis for The Verge

We’re forever obsessed with this Ariel Davis illustration of Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and JD Vance as a DOGE Cerberus, which perfectly encapsulates the apocalyptic and also absurd vibe of Trump’s first 100 days. — Cath Virginia, art director

Illustration by Jovana Mugosa for The Verge

Jovana Mugosa did an incredible job on these crime noir illustrations for this story about a former Iranian military officer who was targeted by kidnappers paid by the Iranian government. The dark olive green and lavender, along with the grainy background texture, really pull you into the dark world of this predator-versus-prey account. — Cath Virginia, art director

Collage by Ian Woods / Photos by Eva Alicia Lépiz for The Verge

I’m in love with the handmade feel of these collaged portraits Ian Woods made for this beautiful piece of writing about fatherhood through the lens of Final Fantasy. The organic shapes featuring art from the game series frame the faces of Joseph Earl Thomas and his children so perfectly and reflect the blended world between real life and gaming. — Cath Virginia, art director

Workers employed in fabrication factories in the early days of Silicon Valley experienced toxic conditions that affected their health and, in many cases, their children’s lives deeply. I am grateful to have photographed two of the women who are holding these companies accountable and telling the story as a warning for the future of chip production in Justine Calma’s amazing story. — Amelia Holowaty Krales, senior photo editor

The idea of the infinite fringe was hard enough to describe in words without feeling like I was just spewing nonsense. But the artwork worked because it literally illustrated what I was trying to describe: a kaleidoscope of racist conspiracy memes that you can’t stop watching and somehow just… fell into. — Tina Nguyen, senior reporter

Image by Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images

The headline. The image. Perfect. — Kristen Radtke, creative director

One of my favorite images from all year by Benny, who perfectly encapsulated the “nightmare blunt rotation” vibe of JD Vance and Mark Zuckerberg at the Bitcoin Conference this year. — Cath Virginia, art director

China figured out how to sell EVs. Now it has to bury their batteries.

In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road. Read the full story.—Caiwei Chen

It’s a weird time to be an AI doomer.This small but influential community believes, in the simplest terms, that AI could get so good it could be bad—very, very bad—for humanity.The doomer crowd has had some notable success over the past several years: including helping shape AI policy coming from the Biden administration. But a number of developments over the past six months have put them on the back foot. Talk of an AI bubble has overwhelmed the discourse as tech companies continue to invest in multiple Manhattan Projects’ worth of data centers without any certainty that future demand will match what they’re building.So where does this leave the doomers? We decided to ask some of the movement’s biggest names to see if the recent setbacks and general vibe shift had altered their views. See what they had to say in our story.—Garrison Lovely

Synthesia’s AI clones are more expressive than ever. Soon they’ll be able to talk back.

Earlier this summer, I visited the AI company Synthesia to create a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar of me. The company’s avatars are a decent barometer of just how dizzying progress has been in AI over the past few years, so I was curious just how accurately its latest AI model, introduced last month, could replicate me.I found my avatar as unnerving as it is technically impressive. It’s slick enough to pass as a high-definition recording of a chirpy corporate speech, and if you didn’t know me, you’d probably think that’s exactly what it was.My avatar shows how it’s becoming ever-harder to distinguish the artificial from the real. And before long, these avatars will even be able to talk back to us. But how much better can they get? And what might interacting with AI clones do to us? Read the full story.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In August 2025, Wang Lei decided it was finally time to say goodbye to his electric vehicle.

Wang, who is 39, had bought the car in 2016, when EVs still felt experimental in Beijing. It was a compact Chinese brand. The subsidies were good, and the salesman talked about “supporting domestic innovation.” At the time, only a few people around him were driving on batteries. He liked being early.

But now, the car’s range had started to shrink as the battery’s health declined. He could have replaced the battery, but the warranty had expired; the cost and trouble no longer felt worth it. He also wanted an upgrade, so selling became the obvious choice.

His vague plans turned into action after he started seeing ads on Douyin from local battery recyclers. He asked around at a few recycling places, and the highest offer came from a smaller shop on the outskirts of town. He added the contact on WeChat, and the next day someone drove over to pick up his car. He got paid 8,000 yuan. With the additional automobile scrappage subsidy offered by the Chinese government, Wang ultimately pocketed about 28,000 yuan.

Wang is part of a much larger trend. In the past decade, China has seen an EV boom, thanks in part to government support. Buying an electric car has gone from a novel decision to a routine one; by late 2025, nearly 60% of new cars sold were electric or plug-in hybrids.

But as the batteries in China’s first wave of EVs reach the end of their useful life, early owners are starting to retire their cars, and the country is now under pressure to figure out what to do with those aging components.

The issue is putting strain on China’s still-developing battery recycling industry and has given rise to a gray market that often cuts corners on safety and environmental standards. National regulators and commercial players are also stepping in, building out formal recycling networks and take-back programs, but so far these efforts have struggled to keep pace with the flood of batteries coming off the road.

Like the batteries in our phones and laptops, those in EVs today are mostly lithium-ion packs. Their capacity drops a little every year, making the car slower to charge, shorter in range, and more prone to safety issues. Three professionals who work in EV retail and battery recycling told MIT Technology Review that a battery is often considered to be ready to retire from a car after its capacity has degraded to under 80%. The research institution EVtank estimates that the year’s total volume of retired EV batteries in China will come in at 820,000 tons, with annual totals climbing toward 1 million tons by 2030.

In China, this growing pile of aging batteries is starting to test a recycling ecosystem that is still far from fully built out but is rapidly growing. By the end of November 2025, China had close to 180,000 enterprises involved in battery recycling, and more than 30,000 of them had been registered since January 2025. Over 60% of the firms were founded within the past three years. This does not even include the unregulated gray market of small workshops.

Typically, one of two things happens when an EV’s battery is retired. One is called cascade utilization, in which usable battery packs are tested and repurposed for slower applications like energy storage or low-speed vehicles. The other is full recycling: Cells are dismantled and processed to recover metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, which are then reused to manufacture new batteries. Both these processes, if done properly, take significant upfront investment that is often not available to small players.

But smaller, illicit battery recycling centers can offer higher prices to consumers because they ignore costs that formal recyclers can’t avoid, like environmental protection, fire safety, wastewater treatment, compliance, and taxes, according to the three battery recycling professionals MIT Technology Review spoke to.

“They [workers] crack them open, rearrange the cells into new packs, and repackage them to sell,” says Gary Lin, a battery recycling worker who worked in several unlicensed shops from 2022 to 2024. Sometimes, the refurbished batteries are even sold as “new” to buyers, he says. When the batteries are too old or damaged, workers simply crush them and sell them by weight to rare-metal extractors. “It’s all done in a very brute-force way. The wastewater used to soak the batteries is often just dumped straight into the sewer,” he says.

This poorly managed battery waste can release toxic substances, contaminate water and soil, and create risks of fire and explosion. That is why the Chinese government has been trying to steer batteries into certified facilities. Since 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued five “white lists” of approved power-battery recyclers, now totaling 156 companies. Despite this, formal recycling rates remain low compared with the rapidly growing volume of waste batteries.

China is not only the world’s largest EV market; it has also become the main global manufacturing hub for EVs and the batteries that power them. In 2024, the country accounted for more than 70% of global electric-car production and more than half of global EV sales, and firms like CATL and BYD together control close to half of global EV battery output, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. These companies are stepping in to offer solutions to customers wishing to offload their old batteries. Through their dealers and 4S stores, many carmakers now offer take-back schemes or opportunities to trade in old batteries for discount when owners scrap a vehicle or buy a new one.

BYD runs its own recycling operations that process thousands of end-of-life packs a year and has launched dedicated programs with specialist recyclers to recover materials from its batteries. Geely has built a “circular manufacturing” system that combines disassembly of scrapped vehicles, cascade use of power batteries, and high recovery rates for metals and other materials.

CATL, China’s biggest EV maker, has created one of the industry’s most developed recycling systems through its subsidiary Brunp, with more than 240 collection depots, an annual disposal capacity of about 270,000 tons of waste batteries, and metal recovery rates above 99% for nickel, cobalt, and manganese.

“No one is better equipped to handle these batteries than the companies that make them,” says Alex Li, a battery engineer based in Shanghai. That’s because they already understand the chemistry, the supply chain, and the uses the recovered materials can be put to next. Carmakers and battery makers “need to create a closed loop eventually,” he says.

But not every consumer can receive that support from the maker of their EV, because many of those manufacturers have ceased to exist. In the past five years, over 400 smaller EV brands and startups have gone bankrupt as the price war made it hard to stay afloat, leaving only 100 active brands today.

Analysts expect many more used batteries to hit the market in the coming years, as the first big wave of EVs bought under generous subsidies reach retirement age. Li says, “China is going to need to move much faster toward a comprehensive end-of-life system for EV batteries—one that can trace, reuse and recycle them at scale, instead of leaving so many to disappear into the gray market.”

            <div id="article-text">Most engineering leaders cannot answer the one question their CFO is about to ask: “Can you prove this AI spend is changing outcomes, not just activity?”

Every December, roadmaps get locked, budgets get approved, and board decks are polished until everything looks precise and under control. Underneath, many CTOs and VPs are still working with partial visibility. They have a feel for their teams, but not a reliable view of how work moves through the system, how AI is really changing delivery, or where time and money actually go.

For a while, that was survivable. Experience, pattern recognition, and cheap capital covered the gaps. You could hire around bottlenecks, overstaff critical teams, or quietly pivot away from the messiest parts of the system. Then AI showed up and became the perfect distraction. Pilots, PoCs, Copilot seats, and “AI initiatives” created visible activity and bought time.

In 2026, that grace period ends. Boards and CFOs are shifting from “show me you are experimenting” to “show me measurable impact, this year.” Not because they stopped believing in AI, but because the market no longer rewards vague promises. Every AI dollar will need a traceable path to productivity, quality, or customer value.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

If you run engineering, you probably recognise this scene. You present a slide with AI highlights. Adoption is up. Developers say they like the tools. You share a few anecdotes about faster coding and smoother reviews. Then the CFO asks a simple question: “Exactly how is this budget changing output and outcomes?”

What is almost always missing is a clear breakdown of:

So the conversation slips back to learning curves, compounding benefits, and talent attraction. All true, but too soft for a tough budget review. That will not be enough.

AI vendors love task-level numbers. A coding task completed 55 percent faster looks impressive on a slide. But once you zoom out to teams and systems, the picture changes.

Large datasets across thousands of developers show a consistent pattern:

The problem is not the tools. It is the lack of a system for where the “extra” capacity goes.

Most organisations still frame AI productivity in terms of speed: more story points, more tickets, higher deployment frequency. That misses the bigger question:

How much of our engineering capacity goes to net new value versus maintenance, incidents, and rework, and is AI improving that mix?

High-level benchmarks are blunt but helpful. On average, about 45 percent of developer time is spent on maintenance, minor enhancements, and bug fixes rather than on genuinely new, customer-facing work. If AI helps you produce more code inside an unchanged system, you risk:

That is how you end up with impressive local metrics and a leadership team that still feels like engineering is slowing down.

If you want to walk into a 2026 budget conversation with objective evidence, you need to be deliberate about how AI-driven time savings are used. Two moves matter.

AI is already good at boilerplate, tests, documentation, and simple refactors. The trap is treating the saved time as unstructured “extra” capacity that disappears into the noise. Instead:

When teams systematically reduce technical debt and improve tests around critical flows, they cut future incidents and rework. Over a year, that frees more capacity for new work than shaving a few minutes off each ticket ever will.

2. Point AI at the ugly, high-friction work that commonly blows up roadmaps

The biggest productivity wins are not in everyday code generation. They are in:

These activities steal weeks or months of capacity and stall strategic initiatives. Using AI to understand legacy code faster, propose refactoring plans, generate migration scaffolding, and highlight recurring failure patterns can dramatically compress timelines for this work.

In parallel, there is real leverage upstream in the problem space. Teams that reach higher levels of AI adoption report better gains when they:

That reduces wasted builds and focuses effort on changes customers actually care about. The most significant gains do not come from replacing human creativity, but from amplifying it and aiming it at better-defined problems.

DORA metrics are not the enemy. Deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate remain among the best signals we have for delivery performance. The risk is mistaking them for the whole picture.

Leading organisations are already expanding their scorecard to include:

In 2026, the question in the boardroom will shift from “Are we elite on DORA?” to “How much of our capacity is going into things customers notice, and is AI improving that mix or not?” To answer that cleanly, DORA is necessary but not sufficient. You need a way to connect AI usage, workflow, quality, and business outcomes across the system.

This is where engineering intelligence platforms move from a nice-to-have to mandatory. The organisations that win in 2026 will not do it with one more AI tool or one more disconnected dashboard. They will do it by pulling together data they already have but rarely use in one coherent view:

From there, leaders can answer the questions that actually matter:

Instead of defending AI spend with anecdotes, you walk in with:

That is the difference between “we believe in AI” and “here is how AI changed our delivery engine in measurable ways.”

To be ready for the more complex questions coming next year, use this planning cycle to do four things.

Do this, and you will not just have “AI activity” to show in 2026. You will have a credible, data-backed story from AI spend to business outcomes.

The leaders who thrive next year will not be the ones with the flashiest AI demos or the loudest “AI strategy” slide. They will be the ones who:

Engineering intelligence platforms is a key part of that shift. They give you the complex data to show where time and money go, how AI is really changing delivery, and whether your current pace is sustainable. The shift to data-backed engineering leadership is happening either way.

The gap in 2026 will be between teams still guessing and teams that can prove, in detail, how their engineering organisation works.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard!

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you. We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
