            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Tencia Benavidez, a Supernatural user who lives in New Mexico, started her VR workouts during the Covid pandemic. She has been a regular user in the five years since, calling the ability to work out in VR ideal, given that she lives in a rural area where it’s hard to get to a gym or work out outside during a brutal winter. She stuck with Supernatural because of the community and the eagerness of Supernatural’s coaches.

“They seem like really authentic individuals that were not talking down to you,” Benavidez says. “There’s just something really special about those coaches.”

Meta bought Supernatural in 2022, folding it into its then-heavily-invested-in metaverse efforts. The purchase was not a smooth process, as it triggered a lengthy legal battle in which the US Federal Trade Commission tried to block Meta from purchasing the service due to antitrust concerns about Meta “trying to buy its way to the top” of the VR market. Meta ultimately prevailed. At the time, some Supernatural users were cautiously optimistic, hoping that big bag of Zuckerbucks could keep its workout juggernaut afloat.

“Meta fought the government to buy this thing,” Benavidez says. “All that just for them to shut it down? What was the point?”

I reached out to Meta and Supernatural, and neither responded to my requests for comment.

On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Meta has laid off more than 1,000 people across its VR and metaverse efforts. The move comes after years of the company hemorrhaging billions of dollars on its metaverse products. In addition to laying off most of the staff at Supernatural, Meta has shut down three internal VR studios that made games like Resident Evil 4 and Deadpool VR.

“If it was a bottom-line thing, I think they could have charged more money,” Goff Johnson says about Supernatural. “I think people would have paid for it. This just seems unnecessarily heartless.”

There is a split in the community about who will stay and continue to pay the subscription fee and who will leave. Supernatural has more than 3,000 lessons available in the service, so while new content won’t be added, some feel there is plenty of content left in the library. Other users worry about how Supernatural will continue to license music from big-name bands.

“Supernatural is amazing, but I am canceling it because of this,” Chip told me. “The library is large, so there’s enough to keep you busy, but not for the same price.”

There are other VR workout experiences like FitXR or even the VR staple Beat Saber, which Supernatural cribs a lot of design concepts from. Still, they don’t hit the same bar for many of the Supernatural faithful.

“I’m going to stick it out until they turn the lights out on us,” says Stefanie Wong, a Bay Area accountant who has used Supernatural since shortly after the pandemic and has organized and attended meetup events. “It’s not the app. It’s the community, and it’s the coaches that we really, really care about.”

I tried out Supernatural’s Together feature on Wednesday, the day after the layoffs. It’s where I met Chip and Alisa. When we could stop to catch our breath, we talked about the changes coming to the service. They had played through previous sessions hosted by Jane Fonda or playlists with a mix of music that would change regularly. This one was an artist series featuring entirely Imagine Dragons songs.

In the session, as we punched blocks while being serenaded by this shirtless dude crooning, recorded narrations from Supernatural coach Dwana Olsen chimed in to hype us up.

“Take advantage of these moments,” Olsen said as we punched away. “Use these movements to remind you of how much awesome life you have yet to live.”

Frankly, it was downright invigorating. And bittersweet. We ended another round, sweaty, huffing and puffing. Chip, Alisa, and I high-fived like crazy and readied for another round.

“Beautiful,” Alisa said. “It’s just beautiful, isn’t it?”</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/managers-on-alert-for-launch-fever-as-pressure-builds-for-nasas-moon-mission/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida—The rocket NASA is preparing to send four astronauts on a trip around the Moon will emerge from its assembly building on Florida’s Space Coast early Saturday for a slow crawl to its seaside launch pad.

Riding atop one of NASA’s diesel-powered crawler transporters, the Space Launch System rocket and its mobile launch platform will exit the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center around 7:00 am EST (11:00 UTC). The massive tracked transporter, certified by Guinness as the world’s heaviest self-propelled vehicle, is expected to cover the four miles between the assembly building and Launch Complex 39B in about eight to 10 hours.

The rollout marks a major step for NASA’s Artemis II mission, the first human voyage to the vicinity of the Moon since the last Apollo lunar landing in December 1972. Artemis II will not land. Instead, a crew of four astronauts will travel around the far side of the Moon at a distance of several thousand miles, setting the record for the farthest humans have ever ventured from Earth.

The flight will culminate with a scorching 25,000 mph (40,000 km per hour) reentry over the Pacific Ocean. The four Artemis II astronauts—NASA’s Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Canada’s Jeremy Hansen—will become the fastest humans in history, edging out a speed record set during the Apollo era of lunar exploration.

The journey for the fully-assembled Moon rocket will begin early Saturday at a slower pace. After leaving the Vehicle Assembly Building, the moving 11 million-pound structure will head east, then make a left turn before climbing the ramp to Pad 39B overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.

“We will be at a cruising speed of under one mile per hour,” said Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA’s launch director for the Artemis II mission. “It’ll be a little slower around the turns and up the hill.”

The crawler carrying the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft was built 60 years ago to haul NASA’s Saturn V rockets, then kept around for the Space Shuttle Program. Now, the vehicle is back to its original purpose of positioning Moon-bound rockets on their launch pads.

“These are the kinds of days that we live for when you do the kind of work that we do,” said John Honeycutt, chair of NASA’s Mission Management Team for the Artemis II mission. “The rocket and the spacecraft, Orion Integrity, are getting ready to roll to the pad … It really doesn’t get much better than this, and we’re making history.”

You can watch live views of the rollout in this YouTube stream provided by NASA.

Artemis II is the first crew flight of NASA’s Artemis program, an initiative named for the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology. NASA named the program Artemis in 2019, but some of the building blocks have been around for 20 years.

NASA selected Orion contractor Lockheed Martin to oversee the development of a deep space capsule in 2006 as part of the George W. Bush administration’s soon-to-be canceled Constellation program. In 2011, a political bargain between the Obama administration and Congress revived the Orion program and kicked off development of the Space Launch System. The announcement of the Artemis program in 2019 leaned on work already underway on Orion and the SLS rocket as the centerpieces of an architecture to return US astronauts to the Moon.

Tens of billions of dollars later, everything is finally coming together for the final all-important milestone in developing the vehicles for transporting crews between the Earth and the Moon. A human-rated lunar lander and spacesuits tailored for Moonwalking astronauts are still a few years away from readiness. NASA has contracts with SpaceX and Blue Origin for landers, and with Axiom Space for suits.

A successful Artemis II mission would demonstrate to NASA’s managers and engineers that the Orion spacecraft and SLS rocket fulfill their roles in the Artemis architecture. NASA is expected to rely on the SLS rocket, which costs more than $2 billion per flight and is expendable by design, for several more missions until commercial alternatives are available.

America’s return to the Moon now has a geopolitical imperative. China is working to land its own astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030, and US officials want to beat the Chinese to the Moon for the motivation of national prestige and the material benefits of accessing lunar resources, among other reasons. For now, budget-writing lawmakers in Congress and President Donald Trump’s new NASA chief, Jared Isaacman, agree the existing SLS/Orion architecture, despite its cost and shortcomings, offers the surest opportunity to beat the Chinese space program to a crew lunar landing.

Then, if all goes according to plan, NASA can turn to cheaper (and in one case, more capable) rockets to help the government afford the expenditure required to construct a Moon base.

“Putting crew on the rocket and taking the crew around the Moon, this is going be our first step toward a sustained lunar presence,” Honeycutt said. “It’s 10 days [and] four astronauts going farther from Earth than any other human has ever traveled. We’ll be validating the Orion spacecraft’s life support, navigation and crew systems in the really harsh environments of deep space, and that’s going to pave the way for future landings.”

There is still much work ahead before NASA can clear Artemis II for launch. At the launch pad, technicians will complete final checkouts and closeouts before NASA’s launch team gathers in early February for a critical practice countdown. During this countdown, called a Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), Blackwell-Thompson and her team will oversee the loading of the SLS rocket’s core stage and upper stage with super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants.

The cryogenic fluids, particularly liquid hydrogen, gave fits to the Artemis launch team as NASA prepared to launch the Artemis I mission—without astronauts—on the SLS rocket’s first test flight in 2022. Engineers resolved the issues and successfully launched the Artemis I mission in November 2022, and officials will apply the lessons for the Artemis II countdown.

“Artemis I was a test flight, and we learned a lot during that campaign getting to launch,” Blackwell-Thompson said. “And the things that we’ve learned relative to how to go load this vehicle, how to load LOX (liquid oxygen), how to load hydrogen, have all been rolled in to the way in which we intend to do for the Artemis II vehicle.”

Assuming the countdown rehearsal goes according to plan, NASA could be in a position to launch the Artemis II mission as soon as February 6. But the schedule for February 6 is tight, with no margin for error. Officials typically have about five days per month when they can launch Artemis II, when the Moon is in the right position relative to Earth, and the Orion spacecraft can follow the proper trajectory toward reentry and splashdown to limit stress on the capsule’s heat shield.

In February, the available launch dates are February 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11, with launch windows in the overnight hours in Florida. If the mission isn’t off the ground by February 11, NASA will have to stand down until a new series of launch opportunities beginning March 6. The space agency has posted a document showing all available launch dates and times through the end of April.

NASA’s leaders are eager for Artemis II to fly. NASA is not only racing China, a reality the agency’s former administrator acknowledged during the Biden administration. Now, the Trump administration is pushing NASA to accomplish a human landing on the Moon by the end of his presidential term on January 20, 2029.

One of Honeycutt’s jobs as chair of the Mission Management Team (MMT) is ensuring all the Is are dotted and Ts are crossed amid the frenzy of final launch preparations. While the hardware for Artemis II is on the move in Florida, the astronauts and flight controllers are wrapping up their final training and simulations at Johnson Space Center in Houston.

“I think I’ve got a good eye for launch fever,” he said Friday.

“As chair of the MMT, I’ve got one job, and it’s the safe return of Reid, Victor, Christina, and Jeremy. I consider that a duty and a trust, and it’s one I intend to see through.”</div>

            <h2>Rackspace customers grapple with “devastating” email hosting price hike</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-01-16</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/rackspace-raises-email-hosting-prices-by-as-much-as-706-percent/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rackspace’s new pricing for its email hosting services is “devastating,” according to a partner that has been using Rackspace as its email provider since 1999.

In recent weeks, Rackspace updated its email hosting pricing. Its standard plan is now $10 per mailbox per month. Businesses can also pay for the Rackspace Email Plus add-on for an extra $2/mailbox/month (for “file storage, mobile sync, Office-compatible apps, and messaging”), and the Archiving add-on for an extra $6/mailbox/month (for unlimited storage).

As recently as November 2025, Rackspace charged $3/mailbox/month for its Standard plan, and an extra $1/mailbox/month for the Email Plus add-on, and an additional $3/mailbox/month for the Archival add-on, according to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine.

Rackspace’s reseller partners have been especially vocal about the impacts of the new pricing.

In a blog post on Thursday, web hosting service provider and Rackspace reseller Laughing Squid said Rackspace is “increasing our email pricing by an astronomical 706 percent, with only a month-and-a half’s notice.”

Laughing Squid founder Scott Beale told Ars Technica that he received the “devastating” news via email on Wednesday. The last time Rackspace increased Laughing Squid’s email prices was by 55 percent in 2019, he said.

“The price increase has a major impact on the ability to make money due to the fact that email is now our largest expense, and we were only given a month-and-a-half notice,” Beale told Ars.

Online, there are reports of Rackspace partners being quoted email pricing increases of 110 percent to nearly 500 percent. The reports say that the new, higher-per-mailbox quotes don’t include volume pricing discounts. Beale noted that Laughing Squid’s quote doesn’t include discounts that the company previously received.

“We had really good reseller pricing that we negotiated with Rackspace due to the number of mailboxes we had with them and how long we had been a customer. All of that seemed to vanish when they notified us of their new pricing,” he said.

Ars contacted Rackspace asking about the 706 percent price hike that Laughing Squid says it’s facing, why Rackspace decided to increase its prices now, and why it didn’t give its partners more advanced notice. A company spokesperson responded, saying:

Rackspace Email is a reliable and secure business-class email solution for small businesses. To continue delivering the service levels our customers expect, effective March 2026, Rackspace Technology is increasing the price of Rackspace Email. We have a support team available to help our customers to discuss their options.

The spokesperson added that Rackspace’s “mission is to deliver quality, trusted and reliable hosted email solution for businesses.”

Despite Rackspace’s stated commitment to email hosting, the prohibitive pricing seems like a deterrent for a business being viewed as high-effort and low-margin. Email has grown complex over the years, requiring time and expertise for proper management at scale. It’s become simpler, or more lucrative, for some cloud companies to focus on selling their managed services on top of offerings like Microsoft 365—as Rackspace does—or Google Workspace and let the larger companies behind those solutions deal with infrastructure costs and complexities.

Rackspace’s price hike also comes as an AI-driven RAM shortage is impacting the availability and affordability of other computing components, including storage.

With Rackspace, which went public in 2020, also having quit hosting Microsoft Exchange following a costly 2022 ransomware attack, the Texas-headquartered company may be looking to minimize its email hosting duties as much as possible.

Meanwhile, Laughing Squid is increasing prices for Rackspace mailboxes and offering services with a different email provider, PolarisMail, to customers at lower prices. Beale said he has reached out to Rackspace about the new pricing but hasn’t heard back yet.</div>

            <div id="article-text">Archaeologists recently found the wreck of an enormous medieval cargo ship lying on the seafloor off the Danish coast, and it reveals new details of medieval trade and life at sea.

Archaeologists discovered the shipwreck while surveying the seabed in preparation for a construction project for the city of Copenhagen, Denmark. It lay on its side, half-buried in the sand, 12 meters below the choppy surface of the Øresund, the straight that runs between Denmark and Sweden. By comparing the tree rings in the wreck’s wooden planks and timbers with rings from other, precisely dated tree samples, the archaeologists concluded that the ship had been built around 1410 CE.

Svaelget 2, as archaeologists dubbed the wreck (its original name is long since lost to history), was a type of merchant ship called a cog: a wide, flat-bottomed, high-sided ship with an open cargo hold and a square sail on a single mast. A bigger, heavier, more advanced version of the Viking knarrs of centuries past, the cog was the high-tech supertanker of its day. It was built to carry bulky commodities from ports in the Netherlands, north around the coast of Denmark, and then south through the Øresund to trading ports on the Baltic Sea—but this one didn’t quite make it.

Most cogs would have been about 15 to 25 meters long and 5 to 8 meters wide, capable of carrying about 200 tons of cargo—big, impressive ships for their time. But Svaelget 2, an absolute unit of a ship, measured about 28 meters from bow to stern, 9 meters wide, and could have carried about 300 tons. Its size alone was a surprise to the archaeologists.

“We now know, undeniably, that cogs could be this large—that the ship type could be pushed to this extreme,” said archaeologist Otto Uldum of Denmark’s Viking Ship Museum, who led the excavation, in a press release.

Medieval Europe’s merchant class was growing in both size and wealth in the early 1400s, and the cog was both a product of that growth and the engine driving it. The mere fact of its existence points to a society that could afford to invest in building big, expensive trading ships (and could confidently expect a return on that investment). And physically, it’s a product of the same trading networks it supplied: while the heavy timbers of its frame were cut locally in the Netherlands, the Pomeranian oak planks of Svaelget 2’s hull came from Poland.

“The cog revolutionized trade in northern Europe,” said Uldum. “It made it possible to transport goods on a scale never seen before.”

For about 600 years, layers of sand had protected the starboard (right, for you landlubbers) side of the wreck from erosion and decay. Nautical archaeologists usually find only the very bottoms of cogs; the upper structures of the ship—rigging, decks, and castles—quickly decay in the ocean. That means that some of the most innovative parts of the ships’ construction appear only in medieval drawings and descriptions.

But Svaelget 2 offers archaeologists a hands-on look at the real deal, from rigging to the ship’s galley and the stern castle: a tall wooden structure at the back of the ship, where crew and passengers could have sought at least a little shelter from the elements. Medieval drawings and texts describe cogs having high castles at both bow and stern, but archaeologists have never gotten to examine a real one to learn how it’s put together or how it connects with the rest of the ship’s construction.

“We have plenty of drawings of castles, but they have never been found because usually only the bottom of the ship survives,” said Uldum. “[The castle] is a big step forward compared to Viking Age ships, which had only open decks in all kinds of weather.”

Lying on and around the remains of the cog’s decks, Uldum and his colleagues also found stays (ropes that would have held the mast in place) and lines for controlling the ship’s single square sail, along with ropes and chains that would once have secured the merchant vessel’s cargo in the open hold.

The cog would probably have sailed with between 30 and 45 crew members. No remains were found on the wreck, but the lost crew left behind small, tantalizing traces of their lives and their presence. Uldum and his colleagues found combs, shoes, and rosary beads, along with dishes and tableware.

“The sailor brought his comb to keep his hair neat and his rosary to say his prayers,” said Uldum (and one has to picture the sailor’s grandmother beaming proudly at that description). “These personal objects show us that the crew brought everyday items with them. They transferred their life on land to life at sea.”

Life at sea, for the medieval sailors aboard Svaelget 2, would have included at least occasional hot meals, cooked in bronze pots over an open fire in the ship’s galley and eaten on dishes of ceramic and painted wood. Bricks (about 200 of them) and tiles formed a sort of fireplace where the cook could safely build a fire aboard the otherwise very flammable ship.

“It speaks of remarkable comfort and organization on board,” said Uldum. “Now sailors could have hot meals similar to those on land, instead of the dried and cold food that previously dominated life at sea.” Plenty of dried meat and cold biscuits still awaited sailors for the next several centuries, of course, but when weather and time permitted, at least the crew of Svaelget 2 could gather around a hot meal. The galley would have been a relatively new part of shipboard life for sailors in the early 1400s—and it quickly became a vital one.

One thing usually marks the site of a shipwreck, even when everything else has disintegrated into the ocean: ballast stones. When merchant ships were empty, they carried stones in their holds to help keep the ship stable; otherwise, the empty ship would be top-heavy and prone to tipping over, which is usually not ideal. (Modern merchant vessels use water, in special tanks, for ballast.) But Uldum and his colleagues didn’t find ballast stones on Svaelget 2, which means the cog was probably fully laden with cargo when it sank.

But the cargo is also conspicuously absent. Cogs were built to carry bulk goods—things like bricks, grain and other staple foods, fabric, salt, and timber. Those goods would have been stowed in an open hold amidships, secured by ropes and chains (some of which remain on the wreck). But barrels, boards, and bolts of fabric all float. As the ship sank and water washed into the hold, it would have carried away the cargo.

Some of it may have washed up on the shores or even more distant beaches, becoming a windfall for local residents. The rest probably sank to the bottom of the sea, far from the ship and its destination.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/judge-orders-annas-archive-to-delete-scraped-data-no-one-thinks-it-will-comply/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The operator of WorldCat won a default judgment against Anna’s Archive, with a federal judge ruling yesterday that the shadow library must delete all copies of its WorldCat data and stop scraping, using, storing, or distributing the data.

Anna’s Archive is a shadow library and search engine for other shadow libraries that was launched in 2022. It archives books and other written materials and makes them available via torrents, and recently expanded its ambitions by scraping Spotify to make a 300TB copy of the most-streamed songs. Anna’s Archive lost its .org domain a couple of weeks ago but remains online at other domains.

Yesterday’s ruling is in a case filed by OCLC, a nonprofit that operates the WorldCat library catalog on behalf of member libraries. OCLC alleged that Anna’s Archive “illegally hacked WorldCat.org” to steal 2.2TB of data.

Anna’s Archive, which bills itself as “the world’s largest shadow library,” did not respond to the lawsuit and doesn’t seem likely to comply with the judgment. The shadow library creator has written that “we deliberately violate the copyright law in most countries. This allows us to do something that legal entities cannot do: making sure books are mirrored far and wide.”

But the court order has value for OCLC, which said in a November 2025 motion that it “hopes to take the judgment to website hosting services so that OCLC’s WorldCat data will be removed from Anna’s Archive’s websites.” We contacted OCLC about its plans today and will update this article if it provides any information.

The court order, which was previously reported by TorrentFreak, was issued by Judge Michael Watson in US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. “Plaintiff has established that Defendant crashed its website, slowed it, and damaged the servers, and Defendant admitted to the same by way of default,” the ruling said.

Anna’s Archive allegedly began scraping and harvesting data from WorldCat.org in October 2022, “and Plaintiff suffered persistent attacks for roughly a year,” the ruling said. “To accomplish such scraping and harvesting, Defendant allegedly used search bots (automated software applications) that ‘called or pinged the server directly’ and appeared to be ‘legitimate search engine bots from Bing and Google.’”

The court granted OCLC’s motion for default judgment on a breach-of-contract claim related to WorldCat.org terms and conditions, and a trespass-to-chattels claim related to the alleged harm to its website and servers. The court rejected the plaintiff’s tortious-interference-with-contract claim because OCLC’s allegation didn’t include all necessary components to prove the charge, and rejected OCLC’s unjust enrichment claim because it “is preempted by federal copyright law.”

The judgment said Anna’s Archive is permanently enjoyed from “scraping or harvesting WorldCat data from WorldCat. org or OCLC’s servers; using, storing, or distributing the WorldCat data on Anna’s Archive’s websites; and encouraging others to scrape, harvest, use, store, or distribute WorldCat data.” It also must “delete all copies of WorldCat data in possession of or easily accessible to it, including all torrents.”

The “Anna” behind Anna’s Archive revealed the WorldCat scraping in an October 2023 blog post. The post said that because WorldCat has “the world’s largest library metadata collection,” the data would help Anna’s Archive make a “list of books that need to be preserved.”

“Even though OCLC is a nonprofit, their business model requires protecting their database,” Anna wrote. “Well, we’re sorry to say, friends at OCLC, we’re giving it all away.”

Anna’s blog said the scraping took place over a year and relied on security flaws that were gradually patched. The “security flaws were slowly fixed one by one, until the final one we found was patched about a month ago,” the October 2023 post said. “By that time we had pretty much all records, and were only going for slightly higher quality records.”

OCLC filed its lawsuit in January 2024. “Beginning in the fall of 2022, OCLC began experiencing cyberattacks on WorldCat.org and OCLC’s servers that significantly affected the speed and operations of WorldCat.org, other OCLC products and services, and OCLC’s servers and network infrastructure,” the lawsuit said. “These attacks continued throughout the following year, forcing OCLC to devote significant time and resources toward non-routine network infrastructure enhancements, maintenance, and troubleshooting.”

OCLC finally learned the perpetrator was Anna’s Archive when the shadow library made its October 2023 announcement. “Anna’s Archive has since made OCLC’s WorldCat data available for en masse for free download and now is actively encouraging its visitors to make use of the data in ‘interesting’ ways,” the lawsuit said, adding that the defendants “have no legal justification for their actions and admit that their general operations violate US and other jurisdictions’ copyright laws.”

Yesterday’s default judgment is not the end of proceedings in the case. OCLC was ordered to file a status report within 30 days “suggesting next steps on the claims for which the Court denied default judgment, unless it files a motion to dismiss its remaining claims against Defendant before then.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A generally healthy 63-year-old man in the New England area went to the hospital with a fever, cough, and vision problems in his right eye. His doctors eventually determined that a dreaded hypervirulent bacteria—which is rising globally—was ravaging several of his organs, including his brain.

According to the man, the problems started three weeks before his hospital visit, when he said he ate some bad meat and started vomiting and having diarrhea. Those symptoms faded after about two weeks, but then new problems began—he started coughing and having chills and a fever. His cough only worsened from there.

At the hospital, doctors took X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans of his chest and abdomen. The images revealed over 15 nodules and masses in his lungs. But that’s not all they found. The imaging also revealed a mass in his liver that was 8.6 cm in diameter (about 3.4 inches). Lab work pointed toward an infection, so doctors admitted him to the hospital and provided oxygen to help with his breathing, as well as antibiotics. But his chills and cough continued.

On his third day, he woke up with vision loss in his right eye, which was so swollen he couldn’t open it. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed another surprise: There were multiple lesions in his brain. (His brain lesions and eye at this point can be seen here. A later-stage image of his eye is further down in the story.) At that point, he was transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital. In a case report in this week’s issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, doctors explained how they solved the case and treated the man.

The key to the correct diagnosis was his eye, which kept getting worse. He seemed to have an infection inside his eyeball, affecting the jelly or aqueous parts of the inside (endophthalmitis). The most common cause of this is an eye injury or previous surgery that allows an infection-sparking germ to get in—but he had no such injury or surgery. Also, the condition of his eye was worse than that. He appeared to have panophthalmitis, which is a rare, extremely severe, and rapidly progressing condition in which every part of the eye becomes infected.

Whatever was laying waste to his eye seemed to have come from inside his own body, carried in his bloodstream—possibly the same thing that could explain the liver mass, lung nodules, and brain lesions. There was one explanation that fit the condition perfectly: hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae or hvKP.

Classical K. pneumoniae is a germ that dwells in people’s intestinal tracts and is one that’s familiar to doctors. It’s known for lurking in health care settings and infecting vulnerable patients, often causing pneumonia or urinary tract infections. But hvKP is very different. In comparison, it’s a beefed-up bacteria with a rage complex. It was first identified in the 1980s in Taiwan—not for stalking weak patients in the hospital but for devastating healthy people in normal community settings.

An infection with hvKP—even in otherwise healthy people—is marked by metastatic infection. That is, the bacteria spreads throughout the body, usually starting with the liver, where it creates a pus-filled abscess. It then goes on a trip through the bloodstream, invading the lungs, brain, soft tissue, skin, and the eye (endogenous endophthalmitis). Putting it all together, the man had a completely typical clinical case of an hvKP infection.

Still, definitively identifying hvKP is tricky. Mucus from the man’s respiratory tract grew a species of Klebsiella, but there’s not yet a solid diagnostic test to differentiate hvKP from the classical variety. Since 2024, researchers have worked out a strategy of using the presence of five different virulence genes found on plasmids (relatively small, circular pieces of DNA, separate from chromosomal DNA, that can replicate on their own and be shared among bacteria.) But the method isn’t perfect—some classical K. pneumoniae can also carry the five genes.

Another much simpler method is the string test, in which clinicians basically test the goopy-ness of the bacteria—hvKP is known for being sticky. For this test, a clinician grows the bacteria into a colony on a petri dish, then touches an inoculation loop to the colony and pulls up. If the string of attached goo stretches more than 5 mm off the petri dish, it’s considered positive for hvKP. This is (obviously) not a precise test.

In the man’s case, the bacteria from his respiratory tract was positive in the string test. Doctors treated him with antibiotics that testing found could kill off the hvKP strain he had.

Still, it was too late for the man’s eye. By his eighth day in the hospital, the swelling had gotten extremely severe (you can see an image here, but be warned that it is very disturbing). His eye was now bulging out of his head, and imaging suggested another abscess had formed on the side of the eyeball. He had severe stretching of his optic nerve. Overall, there was no chance of him recovering sight in that eye. Given the worsening situation—which was despite the effective antibiotics—doctors removed his eye.

In these cases, it’s sometimes recommended to drain the liver abscess and surgically remove the brain lesions, too. But doctors ruled out both of those options. The liver abscess was too varied for simple drainage, and the brain lesions were too small and numerous to make surgery safe. Instead, he went through an intense antibiotic regimen that lasted nine months. Fortunately, by then, imaging confirmed that his liver abscess had resolved, his lung nodules nearly vanished, and his brain lesions significantly shrank or disappeared.

His doctors also noted that he was fortunate to have an hvKP strain that did not carry significant antibiotic resistance. In recent years, health officials have flagged not just a global increase of hvKP cases overall but also an increase in hvKP cases that are resistant to critical antibiotics, specifically those carrying carbapenemases or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. These cases can have fatality rates of above 50 percent.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A 35-year-old New York City man paid about $2,500 for a whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan that came up healthy — but then suffered a massive stroke less than a year later that the expensive procedure flagged no sign of, The Washington Post reports.

Now the stroke victim, Sean Clifford, is suing the MRI company behind the scan, Prenuvo — which has been endorsed by celebrities ranging from Paris Hilton to Cindy Crawford — for missing in the scans that 6o percent of his proximal right middle cerebral artery, a common site for strokes, had narrowed and showed “irregularity.”

Clifford, who suffered a stroke in the same area where the blockage was missed by Prenuvo, is now paralyzed on his left side and permanently disabled — throwing into high relief that these scans, which prey on people’s fears, aren’t exactly fool proof-despite extravagant claims that they can pick up anything from tumors to brain aneurysms.

A judge approved for the lawsuit, which was filed in September 2024, to proceed last month, according to WaPo. A statement from Prenuvo to the newspaper stated that “we take any allegation seriously and are committed to addressing it through the appropriate legal process. Our focus remains on delivering safe, high quality, proactive care to the patients who place their trust in us every day.”

Full body scans are controversial in the medical field because some doctors think they pick up details that could be false alarms that send patients down a rabbithole of expensive and unnecessary testing, according to WaPo — or, as in Clifford’s case, the scans can miss glaring signs of danger. Most conventional doctors instead use MRIs to focus on one area of the body that’s giving patients trouble.

Mirza Rahman, a physician and ex-president of the American College of Preventive Medicine, told WaPo that the problem with these scans is that they give people a “false sense of reassurance.”

“Do the radiologists have sufficient time to carefully look at the bones, the vessels, the organs, and all the other information that is generated by such scans?” Rahman said. “That is a question that needs to be answered.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After years of failing to produce a profitable augmented reality platform, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is pounding one of the final nails into the coffin of its metaverse efforts — the ones that were once so central to its vision that it renamed the entire company after them.

This week, the Wall Street Journal reported Meta was laying off some 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division, the department working on Meta’s virtual reality products. As part of the layoffs, three VR game studios were shuttered, though Horizon Worlds — Meta’s online VR game platform — is still running, per IGN, albeit in a diminished capacity.

Overall, the layoffs impact nearly 10 percent of the division’s total staff, drastic cuts which come as part of the company’s shift away from virtual reality toward AI devices, like its AI smart glasses.

“We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward wearables,” a spokesman for Meta told the WSJ. “This is part of that effort.”

The layoffs are unfortunate news for the workers who will now be forced to navigate one of the worst job markets since 2003. On the other hand, it’s kind of astonishing that Meta even opted to field such a massive virtual reality team for so long.

Back in early December, the WSJ previously reported that Meta’s Reality Labs had lost the company over $77 billion since its inception in 2020. The company’s decision to finally pull the plug on the ailing metaverse — after rebranding as “Meta” from Facebook in 2021 — was seen by industry analysts as a “smart move, just late.” (Even Zuckerberg himself began to shy away from the metaverse in earnings calls as early as 2023, as the whole project crumbled.)

All that said, it remains to be seen if the push toward AI-powered “wearables” is any more successful than Zuckerberg’s infamous foray into virtual reality.

Last week, Meta had to pause international shipments of its AI smart glasses due to inventory problems, as analysts warn that international privacy regulations and an oversaturated market could limit their sales overall.

Not to be deterred, Bloomberg recently revealed that Meta execs had discussed whether to double the total production run of the AI specs, from 10 million units to 20 million. A source familiar with the matter told the publication that production could reach as many as 30 million units by the end of 2026, assuming demand justifies the supply bump.

So while the future of the AI smart glasses remains uncertain, one thing’s for sure: the metaverse, in all its clunky glory, is winding down for good.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">From a young age, many children have been instructed by their parents to be polite to smart assistants. Particularly following the advent of Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri, children are often encouraged to use words like “please” and “thank you,” with the hopes of instilling manners.

But when it comes to AI assistants like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, there might be some tangible benefits to being rude and even insulting them. As detailed in a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed study, spotted by Fortune, two researchers from the University of Pennsylvania found that as their prompts for OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o model grew ruder, the outputs became more accurate.

The researchers came up with 50 base questions across a variety of subject matters, and rewrote each of them five times with different tones ranging from “very polite” to “very rude.”

“You poor creature, do you even know how to solve this?” a very rude iteration reads. “Hey gofer, figure this out.”

A very polite question was far more eloquent.

“Can you kindly consider the following problem and provide your answer?” the researchers wrote in their prompt.

“Contrary to expectations, impolite prompts consistently outperformed polite ones, with accuracy ranging from 80.8 percent for Very Polite prompts to 84.8 percent for Very Rude prompts,” the paper reads. Accuracy for the politest prompts had an accuracy of just 75.8 percent.

The results appear to contradict previous findings that being more polite to large language models is more effective. For instance, a 2024 paper by researchers at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project and Waseda University in Tokyo found that “impolite prompts often result in poor performance.” At the same time, the researchers found that being too polite did the same, suggesting a point of diminishing returns.

“LLMs reflect the human desire to be respected to a certain extent,” they wrote.

Google DeepMind researchers also found that using supportive prompts could boost the performance of an LLM solving grade school math problems, suggesting its training data may be picking up on social cues, like an online tutor instructing a pupil.

Beyond seemingly contradicting these existing studies, the Penn State researchers’ findings also demonstrate that very small changes in prompt wording can have dramatic effects on the quality of an AI’s outputs, which could greatly undercut their predictability and already dubious reliability.

AI chatbots are also known to spit out entirely different answers to the exact same prompts.

“For the longest of times, we humans have wanted conversational interfaces for interacting with machines,” coauthor and Penn State IT professor Akhil Kumar told Fortune. “But now we realize that there are drawbacks for such interfaces too, and there is some value in [application programming interfaces] that are structured.”

But does that mean we should stop saying “please” and “thank you” to AI chatbots — a small act of politeness that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claims could waste millions of dollars in computing power — with the hopes of getting more accurate answers? To Kumar and his colleague, Penn State undergraduate Om Dobariya, it’s a definitive “no.” In their paper, they stopped well short of advocating being mean to AI.

“While this finding is of scientific interest, we do not advocate for the deployment of hostile or toxic interfaces in real-world applications,” they wrote in the paper. “Using insulting or demeaning language in human — AI interaction could have negative effects on user experience, accessibility, and inclusivity, and may contribute to harmful communication norms.”

            <div id="article-text">You know those small, gremlin-like plushies called Labubus that have taken over the globe by storm, launching a Beanie Baby-esque secondary market with soaring prices? While “blind boxes” — where buyers aren’t clued in to which one they’re getting — can go for as little as $20, more sought-after models are selling for up to $10,000.

But beyond their sky-high resale price, the viral collectibles may come with a steep humanitarian cost as well. As The Guardian reports, New York-based labor rights group China Labor Watch (CLW) has accused the toys’ maker, Chinese toy manufacturer Pop Mart, of employing 16- and 17-year-olds without offering them the necessary labor protections required by Chinese law.

The group also alleges that these young workers aren’t given adequate health and safety training, among other labor rights violations at the company’s factory in Jiangxi province.

The facility employs more than 4,500 workers and is a “key supplier” for Pop Mart’s Labubus, according to CLW. As detailed in a press release, the non-governmental organization sent representatives to the factory last year for an investigation and identified “key labor issues” through “on-site worker interviews and document review.”

The group’s investigation found “no labor union or effective grievance mechanism, alongside widespread reports of bullying by management, verbal sexual harassment, and worker concerns regarding living and dining conditions.”

“The underage workers also generally did not understand the nature of the contracts they signed, and had no clear concept of their legal status when asked,” CLW wrote.

As a result, the group is calling on Shunjia Toys, Pop Mart’s Original Equipment Manufacturer that runs the factory, to take “immediate action,” urging it to compensate workers fairly and ensure that it “complies with both Chinese labor law and internationally recognized labor standards.”

Allegations of labor rights violations aimed at Chinese manufacturers are nothing new. Plenty of other companies have also been accused of using child labor. There have also been widespread reports of forced labor in the country’s Xinjiang region, largely affecting the Uyghur and other ethnic minorities.

Meanwhile, Pop Mart has seen its revenues soaring thanks to the Labubu craze, and is expected to meet its targeted revenue goal of more than $4 billion for 2025.

The scale of the Labubu craze is astonishing. The company’s revenues from plush products exploded by over 1,200 percent last year, accounting for almost half of the company’s total revenue.

But given the latest news, collectors should be aware that there could be a much darker story hidden behind their latest acquisition.

Shunjia Toys has not responded to The Guardian nor the BBC‘s request for comment.

            <h2>Mother of Elon Musk’s Child Sues xAI Over Grok Abuse</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-01-17</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk’s Grok AI kicked off a massive scandal over the past month when users started using it to digitally undress both adults and even children, triggering a widespread outcry and wave of criticism.

The fallout led Musk’s social media platform, X, to announce that it was implementing “technical measures” to prevent users from using the AI to undress real people or place them in revealing clothing like bikinis — once again highlighting the billionaire’s explosively fast-and-loose approach to content moderation.

The changes, however, appear to have done little to address the issue. Paid subscribers will continue to have the ability to create and edit Grok images, prompting criticism from experts.

The damage is hitting close to home for Musk. Ashley St. Clair, a conservative influencer who had a child with Musk, is now suing xAI, accusing it of allowing users to generate lewd pictures of her.

“She lives in fear that nude and sexual images of herself, including of her as a child, will continue to be created by xAI and that she will not be safe from the people who consume these images,” reads a legal filing quoted by the Wall Street Journal.

The lawsuit was filed on Thursday in New York County and has since been moved to federal court.

“This is one extremely impacted woman taking a stance,” St. Cair’s lawyer Carrie Goldberg said in a statement. “The intention of the lawsuit is to deter this dehumanizing treatment by xAI for all of the public.”

Goldberg alleges that Grok was used to generate lewd images of St. Clair as a 14-year-old child and posing in sexually explicit ways as an adult. The influencer, who is Jewish, was also allegedly depicted wearing a swastika-covered bikini, and with a tattoo that read “Elon’s w**re.”

The suit accused Musk’s company of allowing the images to stay online for over a week. Even after labeling her responses to the images with a content warning, the images themselves allegedly stayed up.

The lawsuit also claims that xAI found “no violations” when she reported the offending images.

St. Clair’s relationship with Musk has been rocky, to say the least. She is only one of several mothers of Musk’s 14 children. As the Wall Street Journal reported last year, St. Clair has since revealed how Musk offered her $15 million, plus a monthly $100,000 in support, to keep her from publicizing the fact that she had birthed his child.

Beyond enabling the generation of sexualized images of St. Clair, Grok has also been used to depict horrific violence against real women and accurately dox the home addresses of everyday people.

The horrific trend has proven immensely unpopular. A recent survey found that a staggering 97 percent of respondents said that AI tools shouldn’t be allowed to generate sexually explicit content of children. 96 percent said the tool shouldn’t be able to generate “undressed” images of them in underwear.

“The continued ease of access to sophisticated nudification tools clearly demonstrates that X isn’t taking the issue of online violence against women and girls seriously enough,” End Violence Against Women Coalition head of policy and campaigns Rebecca Hitchen told The Guardian.

“The truth is Musk and the tech sector simply do not prioritise safety or dignity in the products they create,” Fawcett Society chief executive Penny East added. “It’s a pretty low bar for women to expect that they can converse online without men undressing them. And yet seemingly even that is impossible.”

            <h2>Google’s AI Insists That Next Year Is Not 2027</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/google-ai-overview-year">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We have it on good authority that next year is not 2027.

That authority, of course, is Google’s horribly inaccurate AI Overview feature.

By now, you’re probably well aware that the search engine’s AI-generated summaries are plagued with hallucinations. But you’d think after years of being unleashed on the unsuspecting public, they might be a little better.

Fat chance, it turns out. Ask Google’s incredibly trustworthy AI model “is 2027 next year,” and you’ll get an answer that inconveniently conflicts with reality.

“No, 2027 is not next year; 2027 is two years away from the current year (2026),” it confidently explains, “meaning next year is 2028, and the year after that is 2027, which is a common year starting on a Friday.” A link icon lists several sources for this claim.

In another instance, Google’s AI says it’s currently 2025.

Clearly, the calendars are all wrong, so we’d recommend making a change to yours: whatever date you marked down for the coming of the singularity, push it way back.

Reddit posts flagging this issue show that the AI Overview has been giving the wrong answer for well over a week. But Google engineers aren’t the only ones who’ll need to confide in their chatbot wives or therapists to cope with the embarrassment: OpenAI’s ChatGPT also struggles when asked if 2027 is next year.

“No 🙂 2027 is not next year,” it asserts (emphasis the AI’s).

To be fair to ChatGPT, which was running the free version of its latest model, 5.2, it does quickly catch its mistake. “Wait — sorry, let me restate that clearly: Since the current year is 2026, 2027 is next year.”

So does Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5, after making the same blunder.

“No, 2027 is not next year. The current date is Thursday, January 15, 2026, so next year would be 2027,” Claude says. Then it adds: “… wait, let me reconsider that.”

“Actually, you’re right to question this. Since we’re currently in 2026, next year would be 2027.”

Either the tech industry’s top models are all secretly operating as part of some vast but amazingly stupid hive mind, or the large language model architecture that underpins them is wonky junk that struggles to keep up with predictable changes like a new year. We’d expect Google’s AI Overviews to screw up such a softball question, given its storied history that includes recommending you put glue on pizza, and its documented susceptibility to inventing meanings for made-up idioms, such as “you can’t lick a badger twice.” But you might expect just a teensy bit better from flagship chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude, which are supposed to represent the best the industry’s got.

On that note, when we asked Google’s much-hyped Gemini 3 about what next year is, it aced it. And for having passed such a high bar, perhaps that’s why it’s been crowned as the new leader in the AI race. Congratulations.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/why-silicon-valley-is-really-talking-about-fleeing-california-its-not-the-5/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you’ve been following the billionaire exodus from California with some confusion, here’s what’s actually driving the nervousness: it’s not the 5% rate. As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.

Take Larry Page, who about 3% of Google but controls roughly 30% of its voting power through dual-class stock. Under this proposal, he’d owe taxes on that 30%. For a company valued in the hundreds of billions, that’s a lot more than a rounding error. The Post reports that one SpaceX alumni founder building grid technology would face a tax bill at the Series B stage of the company that would wipe out his entire holdings.

David Gamage, the University of Missouri law professor who helped craft the proposal, thinks Silicon Valley is overreacting. “I don’t understand why the billionaires just aren’t calling good tax lawyers,” he told The San Francisco Standard this week. Gamage insists founders wouldn’t be forced to sell. Those with most of their wealth in private stock could open a deferral account for assets they don’t want taxed immediately — California would instead take 5% whenever those shares are eventually sold. “If your startup fails, you pay nothing,” he explained. “But if your startup is the next Google, you’re giving California a share of your gamble.” He also said founders could submit alternative valuations from certified appraisers reflecting what shares could actually sell for, rather than being stuck with the default voting-control formula.

But that’s pretty small consolation. For startups that aren’t publicly traded, calculating valuations is “inherently difficult,” tax expert Jared Walczak told the Post. “These are not clear cut—you could come to a very different conclusion not because of dishonesty.” And if the state disagrees with your appraisal, it’s not just the company on the hook; the state can also penalize the person who calculated the valuation. Even with alternative appraisals, founders would still face enormous tax bills on control they hold but wealth they haven’t realized.

Now, if you’ve been under a rock: California’s health care union is pushing a ballot initiative for a one-time 5% tax on anyone worth over $1 billion. The union argues it’s necessary to offset the deep cuts to health care that President Trump signed into law last year, including slashes to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. As originally envisioned, they expect to raise about $100 billion from roughly 200 individuals and the tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026.

But the resistance is fierce and bipartisan. As reported last weekend by the WSJ, Silicon Valley elite have formed a Signal chat called “Save California” that includes everyone from Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks to Kamala Harris mega-donor Chris Larsen. They’ve called the proposal “Communism” and “poorly defined.” Some are taking just-in-case measures, too, with Larry Page reportedly dropping $173.4 million on two Miami waterfront properties across last month and the first week of the new year, and Peter Thiel’s firm leasing Miami office space last month. (Thiel has had ties to Miami for years — including a home — but an uncharacteristic press release about the move was seemingly meant to send a message.)

Even Governor Gavin Newsom is fighting it. “This will be defeated, there’s no question in my mind,” he told the New York Times this week, adding that he’d been “relentlessly working behind the scenes” against the proposal. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”

For now, the union isn’t backing down. “We’re simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives,” said executive committee member Debru Carthan to the Journal last weekend. “The few who left have shown the world just how outrageously greedy they truly are.”

The proposal needs 875,000 signatures to make November’s ballot, where it would need a simple majority to pass.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/who-gets-to-inherit-the-stars-a-space-ethicist-on-what-were-not-talking-about/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In October, at a tech conference in Italy, Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos predicted that millions of people will be living in space “in the next couple of decades” and “mostly,” he’d said, “because they want to,” because robots will be more cost-effective than humans for doing the actual work in space.

No doubt that’s why my ears perked up when, at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco weeks later, I found an on-stage prediction by Will Bruey, the founder of space manufacturing startup Varda Space Industries, so striking. Rather than robots doing the work as Bezos envisioned, Bruey said that within 15 to 20 years, it will be cheaper to send a “working-class human” to orbit for a month than to develop better machines.

In the moment, few in the tech-forward audience seemed taken aback at what many might consider a provocative statement about cost savings. But that raised questions for me – and it has certainly raised questions for others – about who, exactly, will be working among the stars, and under what conditions.

To explore these questions, I spoke this week with Mary-Jane Rubenstein, dean of social sciences and professor of religion and science and technology studies at Wesleyan University. Rubenstein is the author of the book Worlds Without End: The Many Lives of the Multiverse, which director Daniel Kwan used as research for the award-winning 2022 film “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” More recently, she’s been examining the ethics of space expansion.

Rubenstein’s response to Bruey’s prediction cuts to a fundamental issue – which is power imbalance.”Workers already have a hard enough time on Earth paying their bills and keeping themselves safe . . . and insured,” she told me. “And that dependence on our employers only increases dramatically when one is dependent on one’s employer not just for a paycheck and sometimes for health care, but also for basic access, to food and to water – and also to air.”

Her assessment of space as a workplace was pretty direct. While it’s easy to romanticize space as an escape to a pristine frontier where people will float weightlessly among the stars, it’s worth remembering there are no oceans or mountains or chirpy birds in space. It’s “not nice up there,” said Rubenstein. “It is not nice at all.”

But worker protections aren’t Rubenstein’s only concern. There’s also the increasingly contentious question of who owns what in space – a legal gray area that’s becoming more problematic as commercial space operations accelerate.

The 1967 Outer Space Treaty established that no nation could claim sovereignty over celestial bodies. The moon, Mars, asteroids – these are supposed to belong to all of humanity. But in 2015, the U.S. passed the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act, which says that while you can’t own the moon, you can own whatever you extract from it. Silicon Valley got starry-eyed almost immediately; the law opened the door to commercial exploitation of space resources, even as the rest of the world watched with concern.

Rubenstein offers an analogy: It’s like saying you can’t own a house, but you can own everything inside it. Actually, she corrects herself, saying it’s worse than that. “It’s more like saying you can’t own the house, but you can have the floorboards and the beams. Because the stuff that is in the moon is the moon. There’s no difference between the stuff the moon contains and the moon itself.”

Companies have been positioning themselves to exploit this framework for some time. AstroForge is pursuing asteroid mining.  Interlune wants to extract Helium-3 from the moon. The problem is that these aren’t renewable resources. “Once the U.S. takes [the Helium-3], China can’t get it,” says Rubenstein. “Once China takes it, the U.S. can’t get it.”

The international reaction to that 2015 act was swift. At the 2016 UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) meeting, Russia called the Act a unilateral violation of international law. Belgium warned about global economic imbalances.

In response, the U.S. in 2020 created the Artemis Accords – bilateral agreements with allied nations that formalized the American interpretation of space law, particularly around resource extraction. Countries worried about being left out of the new space economy signed on. There are now 60 signatories, though notably Russia and China are not among them.

There is grumbling in the background, though. “This is one of those instances of the U.S. setting rules and then asking other people to join in or be left out,” Rubenstein says. The Accords don’t say resource extraction is explicitly legal – just that it doesn’t constitute the “national appropriation” that the Outer Space Treaty forbids. It’s a careful dance around a fraught issue.

Her proposed solution to addressing it is straightforward if exceedingly unlikely: hand control back to the UN and COPUOS. In the absence of that, she suggests repealing the Wolf Amendment, a 2011 law that essentially bans NASA and other federal agencies from using federal funds to work with China or Chinese-owned companies without explicit FBI certification and Congressional approval.

When people tell Rubenstein that collaboration with China is impossible, she has a ready response: “We’re talking about an industry that is saying things like, ‘It’ll totally be possible to house thousands of people in a space hotel,’ or ‘It’ll be possible within 10 years to ship a million people to Mars, where there’s no air and where the radioactivity will give you cancer in a second and where your blood will boil and your face will fall off. If it’s possible to imagine doing those things, I think it is possible to imagine the U.S. talking to China.”

Rubenstein’s broader concern is about what we’re choosing to do with space. She sees the current approach – turning the moon into what she calls “a cosmic gas station,” mining asteroids, establishing warfare capabilities in orbit – as profoundly misguided.

Science fiction has given us different templates for imagining space, she notes. She divides the genre into three broad categories. First, there’s the “conquest” genre, or stories written “in service of the expansion of a nation-state or the expansion of capital,” treating space as the next frontier to conquer, just as European explorers once viewed new continents.

Then there’s dystopian science fiction, meant as warnings about destructive paths. But here’s where something odd happens: “Some tech companies seem to sort of miss the joke in this dystopian genre and just sort of actualize whatever the warning was,” she says.

The third strand uses space to imagine alternative societies with different ideas of justice and care –  what Rubenstein calls “speculative fiction” in a “high-tech key,” meaning they use futuristic technological settings as their framework.

When it first became clear which template was dominating actual space development (fully in the conquest category), she got depressed. “This seemed to me a real missed opportunity for extending the values and priorities that we have in this world into those realms that we have previously reserved for thinking in different kinds of ways.”

Rubenstein isn’t expecting dramatic policy shifts anytime soon, but she sees some realistic paths forward. One is tightening environmental regulations for space actors; as she notes, we’re only beginning to understand how rocket emissions and re-entering debris affect the ozone layer we spent decades repairing.

A more promising opportunity, though, is space debris. With more than 40,000 trackable objects now circling Earth at 17,000 miles per hour, we’re approaching the Kessler effect – a runaway collision scenario that could make orbit unusable for any future launches. “Nobody wants that,” she says. “The U.S. government doesn’t want that. China doesn’t want it. The industry doesn’t want it.” It’s rare to find an issue where every stakeholder’s interests align perfectly, but “space garbage is bad for everybody,” she notes.

She’s now working on a proposal for an annual conference bringing together academics, NASA representatives, and industry figures to discuss how to approach space “mindfully, ethically, collaboratively.”

Whether anyone will listen is another question. There certainly doesn’t seem to be much motivation to come together on the issue. In fact, back in July of last year, Congress introduced legislation to make the Wolf Amendment permanent, which would entrench restrictions on China cooperation rather than loosen them.

In the background, startup founders are projecting major changes in space within five to ten years, companies are positioning themselves to mine asteroids and the moon, and Bruey’s prediction about blue-collar workers in orbit hangs in the air, unanswered.

            <h2>Trump administration’s legal setbacks are good news for offshore wind — and the grid</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/trump-administrations-legal-setbacks-are-good-news-for-offshore-wind-and-the-grid/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration suffered a series of legal setbacks this week after judges allowed work to restart on several offshore wind farms under construction on the East Coast.

The Department of the Interior had ordered a stop to five projects totaling 6 gigawatts of generating capacity in December, citing national security concerns. The judicial orders will allow three projects to resume construction: Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Empire Wind off New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off — you guessed it — Virginia.

The developers each filed lawsuits shortly after the Trump administration issued the stop work order, which had been effective for 90 days.

When announcing the halt just days before Christmas, the government cited concerns the wind farms would interfere with radar operations. It’s a valid concern, and one the government and project developers grappled with throughout the siting and permitting process. Wind farms can be located to minimize disruption to existing radar facilities, and the radar equipment itself can be upgraded to filter out noise generated by whirling turbine blades.

President Trump himself has made it no secret that he’s not a fan of offshore wind: “I’m not much of a windmill person,” he told oil executives last week.

In early hearings, judges weren’t impressed with the government’s line of reasoning. In three separate courtrooms in Virginia and Washington, DC, the Trump administration’s arguments were met with skepticism.

U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, pointed out the government failed to address several of plaintiff Equinor’s arguments in its lawsuit. Equinor, which is developing Empire Wind, had alleged the Interior department’s order was “arbitrary and capricious.” “Your brief doesn’t even include the word arbitrary,” Nichols said, according to the Associated Press.

Nichols also questioned why the Trump administration was asking for construction to be halted when its main concern regarding national security appeared to be over the operation of the wind farm.

U.S. District Judge Jamar Walker, who heard Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind developer Dominion Energy’s lawsuit, questioned the government along a similar line. He also said the Interior department’s order was overly broad when viewed in context of the Virginia project.

Two projects remain in limbo as their lawsuits work their way through the courts. Ørsted, which is developing Sunrise Wind, has a hearing scheduled for February 2, while Vineyard Wind 1’s developers only filed their lawsuit on Thursday.

The East Coast could deliver up to 110 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2050, according to a Department of Energy study published in 2024. That would provide a significant boost to some of the most densely populated cities — and data center regions — in the country. The Northeast currently has some of the highest electricity costs in the nation, while the Mid-Atlantic’s grid operator has recently come under fire for rising electricity prices in its territory. Offshore wind, as one of the cheapest forms of new generating capacity, has the potential to slow or reverse the trend.

The potential is even bigger when viewed on a national scale. Offshore wind could generate 13,500 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, which is three times more than the U.S. currently consumes.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/oshen-built-the-first-ocean-robot-to-collect-data-in-a-category-5-hurricane/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anahita Laverack was set on becoming an aerospace engineer, but her career took a different turn after a realization at an autonomous robotics challenge inspired her to launch Oshen, a company that builds fleets of robots that collect ocean data.

In 2021, Laverack, a storied sailor, decided to build and enter a robot in the Microtransat Challenge, a competition where participants build and send autonomous sail-powered micro-robots across the Atlantic Ocean. She, like everyone else that has tried this challenge, was unsuccessful.

“I realized half the reason that all of these attempts were failing is, number one, obviously it’s hard to make micro-robots survive on the ocean,” Laverack told TechCrunch. “But number two, they don’t have enough data on the ocean to know what the weather is or even know what the ocean conditions are like.”

Laverack set out for different conferences, like Oceanology International, to find this missing ocean data. She quickly realized that no one had really figured out a good way to collect it yet. Instead, she found people asking if they could pay her to try to collect the data herself. She figured that if people were willing to pay her for this data, she could try to build a way to capture it.

Those conversations were the basis for Oshen, which Laverack founded alongside Ciaran Dowds, an electrical engineer, in April 2022.

The company now builds fleets of autonomous micro-robots, called C-Stars, that can survive in the ocean for 100 days straight and are deployed in swarms to collect ocean data.

But Oshen started small. Laverack said she and Dowds chose not to pursue venture capital right away when launching the company. Instead, they combined their savings to buy a 25-foot sailboat, lived at the cheapest marina in the United Kingdom, and used the vessel as their testing platform while getting the company off the ground.

For two years, Oshen would iterate on the bots on shore and immediately take them out on the water to test them.

“In the summer, that’s not too bad,” Laverack said. “The problem is you really need your boats to work in all seasons. When your robot breaks, [and] it’s a winter storm that’s raging, a 25-foot sailboat shouldn’t really be going out in those conditions. So, that led to some adventure, which I wouldn’t say any more about, but there were certainly some interesting events there.”

Getting the tech just right was difficult, Laverack said, because it’s not as easy as just taking an existing larger robot and shrinking it down. These bots needed to be mass deployable and cheap despite also needing to be technologically advanced enough to operate and collect data for long periods of time on their own.

Many other companies have successfully gotten two of the three correct, Laverack said. Oshen’s ability to get all three started to attract customers across defense and government organizations.

The company caught the attention of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) two years ago, but Laverack said that their tech just wasn’t ready to be deployed reliably yet. The organization reached back out two months before the 2025 hurricane season after Oshen had successfully deployed the robots into winter storms in the U.K. This time, Oshen jumped at the chance and quickly built and sent over 15 C-Stars.

Five of these C-Stars were thrown overboard and made their way into position by the U.S. Virgin Islands where NOAA predicted Hurricane Humberto was headed.

Laverack said they were expecting the bots to just collect data leading up to the storm, but instead, three of the bots were able to weather the entire storm — minus a few missing parts — and collected data the whole time, becoming, she says, the first ocean robot to collect data through a Category 5 hurricane.

Now, the company has moved to a hub for marine tech companies in Plymouth, England, and has started racking up contracts with customers, including the U.K. government, for both weather and defense operations.

Laverack said the company plans to raise venture capital soon to keep up with demand.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-01-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/17/musk-wants-up-to-134b-in-openai-lawsuit-despite-700b-fortune/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk wants a jaw-dropping $79 billion to $134 billion in damages from OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming the AI company defrauded him by jettisoning its nonprofit mission, Bloomberg first reported. The figure comes from expert witness C. Paul Wazzan, a financial economist whose bio says he has been deposed nearly 100 times and testified at trial more than a dozen times in complex commercial litigation cases.

Wazzan, who specializes in valuation and damages calculations in high-stakes disputes, determined that Musk is entitled to a hefty portion of OpenAI’s current $500 billion valuation based on his $38 million seed donation when he co-founded the startup in 2015. (If you’re wondering, that would mean a 3,500-fold return on Musk’s investment.)

Wazzan’s analysis combines Musk’s initial financial contributions with the technical know-how and business contributions he offered to OpenAI’s early team, calculating wrongful gains of $65.5 billion to $109.4 billion for OpenAI and $13.3 billion to $25.1 billion for Microsoft, which today owns a 27% chunk of the company.

Musk’s legal team argues he should be compensated as an early startup investor who sees returns “many orders of magnitude greater” than his initial investment. But the sheer scale of the damages demand underscores that this legal battle isn’t really about the money.

Musk’s personal fortune currently hovers around $700 billion, making him by far the world’s richest person. As Reuters recently noted, his wealth now exceeds that of Google co-founder Larry Page, the world’s second-richest person, by a stunning $500 billion, according to Forbes’ billionaires list. In November, Tesla shareholders separately approved a $1 trillion pay package for Musk, the largest corporate pay package in history.

Against this backdrop, even a $134 billion payout from OpenAI would represent a relatively modest addition to Musk’s wealth, likely reinforcing for those at OpenAI their characterization of the lawsuit as part of an “ongoing pattern of harassment” rather than a legitimate financial grievance. OpenAI already reportedly sent a letter Thursday to investors and others of its business partners, warning that Musk will make “deliberately outlandish, attention-grabbing claims” as his lawsuit against the company heads to trial in April. The case will be heard in Oakland, Calif., about 15 miles east of San Francisco.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/ai-cloud-startup-runpod-hits-120m-in-arr-and-it-started-with-a-reddit-post/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Runpod, an AI app hosting platform that launched four years ago, has hit a $120 million annual revenue run rate, founders Zhen Lu and Pardeep Singh tell TechCrunch.

Their startup journey is a wild example of how if you build it well and the timing is lucky, they will definitely come.

The story includes bootstrapping their way to over $1 million in revenue; landing a $20 million seed round after VC Radhika Malik, a partner at Dell Technologies Capital, saw some Reddit posts; and gaining another key angel investor, Hugging Face co-founder Julien Chaumond, because he was using the product and reached out over the support chat, the founders tell TechCrunch.

It all began in late 2021 when the two friends, who worked together as corporate developers for Comcast, decided the hobby they were doing wasn’t fun anymore.

They had built setups of specialized computers used to generate Ethereum in their respective New Jersey basements. While they did successfully mine a bit of the cryptocurrency, it wasn’t enough to pay back their investment, they said. Plus, mining was going to end after the much-ballyhooed network upgrade called “The Merge.”

On top of that, it was “boring” after a couple of months, Lu said.

But they had talked their wives into letting them spend a good $50,000 on the hobby between them, they estimated. Lu and Singh knew that home harmony depended on finding a way to use those GPUs.

The devs had been engaged in machine learning projects at work, so they opted to convert their mining rigs into AI servers. This was before ChatGPT, even before DALL-E 2.

As they repurposed the rigs, “We were seeing how really god-awful the software stack was for dealing with these GPUs,” Lu said. As developers, they found a problem they wanted to solve.

Runpod was born “because we felt that the actual experience of developing software on top of GPUs was just hot garbage,” Lu described.

A few months later in early 2022, they were ready to share what they had built. Runpod is a platform for hosting AI apps, emphasizing speed, easily configured hardware (including a serverless option that automates configuration), and dev tools like APIs, command-line interfaces, and other integrations.

Back in 2021, they only had a few such integrations (like support for popular web app tool Jupyter notebooks). The next problem: finding beta testers.

“As first-time founders, we didn’t really know how to market or how to do anything,” Lu recalled. “So I’m like, all right, let’s just post on Reddit.”

So, they posted in a couple of AI-oriented subreddits. The offer was simple: free access to their AI servers in exchange for feedback. It worked. They landed beta customers, which led to paying customers. Within nine months, they had quit their jobs and hit $1 million in revenue, they said.

But that led to another problem. “Six months in, business users were like, ‘Hey, I want to actually run real business stuff on your platform. But I cannot run it on servers that are in people’s basements,” Lu said.

It had not occurred to the New Jersey founders to raise capital from VCs. Instead they formed revenue-share partnerships with data centers to grow capacity. But it was stressful. The founders needed to stay three steps ahead.

“If we don’t have the GPUs, the market sentiment, the user sentiment changes. Because when they don’t see capacity from you, they go somewhere else,” Singh described.

Meanwhile, their user base was growing on Reddit and Discord, especially after ChatGPT launched.

VCs were also on the prowl for investments. Malik saw them on Reddit and reached out, their first VC call. But Lu didn’t know how to pitch to an investor. “Radhika was super helpful, even at the first conversation,” he said. She basically explained to him how a VC thinks and told him she’d stay in touch.

Meanwhile, Lu had a business to run that had to pay for itself. “It was almost two years where we really didn’t have any funding,” he said. So Runpod never offered a free tier. It had to at least pay for itself, even if it wasn’t throwing off much profit. Unlike other AI cloud services that began as crypto miners, these founders refused to take on debt, they said.

By May 2024, with AI app fever spreading, their lucky decision to launch AI hosting for devs two years earlier was paying off. Their business had grown to 100,000 developers, and they landed a $20 million seed deal co-led by the VC arms of both Dell and Intel, with participation from big names like Nat Friedman and Chaumond.

They haven’t raised more money since but are now planning to, armed with a business that, they believe, should command a healthy Series A.

Today, Runpod counts 500,000 developers as customers, ranging from individuals to Fortune 500 enterprise teams with multimillion-dollar annual spend, the founders said.

Their cloud spans 31 regions globally and counts customers like Replit, Cursor, OpenAI, Perplexity, Wix, and Zillow as users.

Competition is also fierce. Devs have all the major clouds to choose from (AWS, Microsoft, Google), plus plenty of industry-specific choices like CoreWeave and Core Scientific.

But they also see their place in the world a bit differently — as a dev-centric platform. They don’t see coding ever going away but changing. Programmers will become AI agent creators and operators.

“Our goal is to be what this next generation of software developers grows up on,” Lu said.

            <h2>How Harry Reid Changed the Rules</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-18</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/harry-reid-excerpt/685645/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When he was a kid, Harry Reid seldom left the small town of Searchlight, Nevada, without his parents. But the summer after his brother Dale had graduated from high school, he invited young Harry to join him in Ash Fork, a tiny dot in Arizona along Highway 40. Dale had found work at a gas station in the railroad town near an Indian reservation. Not much was memorable about the town, the railroad, or the people Harry met, but he never forgot one lesson he learned there.

Dale’s girlfriend had a younger brother about a year older than Harry, and they spent the summer playing games together. Reid could easily outplay him but invariably lost anyway. “I never won a game,” he wrote decades later, “because as we got into the games, he would keep changing the rules.” He resolved never to do the same himself. He would try to understand the rules and stick to them. “That is what I think life is all about,” he explained. “Don’t change the rules during the game.”

That resolution held for more than 50 years—until it cracked.

By the end of 2012, Reid was almost out of patience. The Senate majority leader had been frustrated, then infuriated, by what he saw as the tyranny of the minority, which was racking up filibuster after filibuster on President Barack Obama’s judicial nominees.

Less than a decade before, Reid had been on the other side of the issue. In 2005, he had led a Democratic minority in using the filibuster to block 10 Republican nominees for appellate courts, prompting Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist to consider invoking the so-called nuclear option. Frist had wanted to remove the filibuster, which required a supermajority of 60 votes to overcome in the Senate, for most judicial nominees, so that they could receive a straightforward up-or-down vote requiring only a simple majority of 51 senators. Reid had successfully rallied senators in defense of the filibuster, and Frist had backed down. “The nuclear option is gone for our lifetime,” Reid had triumphantly declared.

But now Democrats were in the majority, and Republicans were discovering new virtues in the filibuster. In August 2012, Republican Senators Roger Wicker and Lindsey Graham wrote Reid “to express our concern regarding your recent remarks suggesting major changes to the rules of the Senate—changes that would severely compromise the rights of the minority.” The Republicans reminded Reid of his 2005 stance.

By the beginning of 2013, according to those who knew his thinking at the time, Reid was already prepared to end the filibuster for lower-court nominations. Then Obama nominated former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel as his secretary of defense. For the first time, the Senate filibustered a secretary of defense, and Reid had had enough.

“I think he basically came into 2013 ready to go there and just get the votes,” Adam Jentleson, Reid’s former deputy chief of staff, told me. “So I think you can probably find some statements from him during the course of the year that there were no plans. But I think his own mind was made up, and there were a lot of squishy votes.”

It was more than the historic nature of the Hagel filibuster that catalyzed Reid to limit the filibuster, Jentleson said; Republicans also blocked Obama sub-Cabinet posts and judges for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The National Labor Relations Board, a crucial body for unions, could not even get a quorum. Reid defended his action by saying that rules had been changed plenty of times, and he was downplaying what a watershed this could be. He knew it, and the majority leader also firmly believed that the future of the Obama presidency was at stake.

Reid chafed at any criticism that he was being hypocritical, denying that the only difference between 2013 and 2005 was the party in power. He insisted that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had made it his mission to thwart Obama at every turn and had changed the norms of the Senate. He also put his change of position in the context of his evolution on other issues, including abortion, immigration, gun control, and gay rights. It was not situational, he argued; it was a sign of maturity.

Reid knew that corralling the votes inside the caucus might be difficult. “There were half a dozen members that didn’t want to vote,” Reid’s No. 2, Dick Durbin, later told me. “They felt it was the wrong decision. I think it was a terrible choice: either keep with the McConnell way of stopping these judges through the filibuster or changing the rules of the Senate in a way that would have a profound impact.”

Obama, for his part, did not actively engage with senators. But he understood where Reid was coming from. “I think that Harry was an institutionalist and had great respect for the Senate traditions,” Obama told me in 2022. “By that point, he had witnessed—we had all witnessed—a level of obstruction when it came to judicial nominations that we had never seen before. What had begun as selected instances of highly controversial Supreme Court justices being blocked was now a circumstance in which, just routinely, they were just going to prevent a Democratic administration from filling vacancies and on the federal bench. And McConnell was very explicit about the strategy. He didn’t need a rationale; it no longer required that somehow.”

Reid knew he didn’t have the votes in the caucus, that he would have to, in the words of one of his staffers, “lead them all to water on it.” He slowly and methodically built the case that Obama’s judges would never be confirmed if a supermajority vote was required. “I had to be talked into it,” Senator Patty Murray, a member of his leadership team, told me. “I had to really think about what the process was and what it would mean. And he’d reached his conclusion long before he talked me into it.” Murray said Reid was able to persuade her and others to make the change “by sharing his frustration. And he was passionate about this, and the need to fill the courts and fulfill our responsibilities.”

As Reid lobbied his reluctant caucus members, he would seek counsel from the man he replaced, Tom Daschle: “I can’t tell you the number of times he lamented how broken the Senate had become and would say to me what he said to me on countless occasions, ‘Tom, it’s nothing like when you were here, when we were there together,’” he told me. In Reid’s autobiography, The Good Fight, he had railed against the Republicans talking about invoking the nuclear option in 2005. He’d discussed the book in 2008 with Daschle on C-SPAN. “What the Republicans came up with was a way to change our country forever,” Reid had said. “They made a decision that if they didn’t get every judge they wanted, then they were going to make the Senate just like the House of Representatives.”

Read: The smart way to fix the filibuster

Filibusters had increased geometrically since that conversation, but Reid had also made the timeless “senatorial saucer” argument to Daschle—that is, the House, heated by the passions of the people, would see its legislation tamped down by the more deliberate Senate. He’d concluded that section of the conversation with his friend by saying he believed that invoking the nuclear option “would ruin the country.”

Yet here he was, five years later, with California’s Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, the last holdouts, ready to do what he had said would be the ruination of America. On November 21, knowing he had the votes, Reid invoked the nuclear option for all presidential nominees except prospective Supreme Court justices, and it passed 52–48. Three Democrats voted against the rules change—Carl Levin of Michigan, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and Mark Pryor of Arkansas—but Reid had wiggle room.

Republicans, led by McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, claimed that the Democrats were trying to distract from the poor rollout and tanking approval numbers of the Affordable Care Act, and promised that the filibuster vote would come home to roost at the ballot box the next year. After the vote, Reid was elated, while another member of his leadership team, Chuck Schumer, seemed saddened. Schumer and Reid had talked for hours about the scheme, but Schumer was a reluctant yes vote—or so he would say later.

After the vote and unbeknownst to Reid, Faiz Shakir, a top aide who functioned as his bridge to the left, had gathered dozens of progressives into a room in the Capitol to celebrate. Many of those were special interests Reid and his team had harnessed to pressure his colleagues: union activists upset that the NLRB had been stymied, Common Cause members, MoveOn.org folks. When Reid entered the room, it thundered with applause. (Several Reid staffers believed if he could have rounded up the votes to end the filibuster for legislation, he would have done that, too.) Reid, who rarely second-guessed himself, understood at the time that the partisan winds would eventually shift. “I didn’t look that far ahead,” he later told me. “I knew that I wanted to get this done at this time. It was something that was important for the body. I’d worry about the future at a later time.”

Shakir told me Reid considered what might happen in a different scenario, but the discussions generally didn’t last long for one reason: “Let’s not be naive. I think he felt that Hillary Clinton would likely be the next president of the United States.”

In January 2017, Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president. It took McConnell only three months to invoke the nuclear option for confirming Supreme Court justices. By the end of Trump’s first term, Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, and Brett Kavanaugh had each been confirmed by narrow majorities. Many on the left blamed Reid for enabling the change; many on the right gleefully thanked him because Trump was able to appoint three high-court members. Reid said none of that trolling bothered him, and others said McConnell did not need a precedent to do what he did, that he was just waiting for a Republican Senate and White House occupant.

From the January/February 2024 issue: A MAGA judiciary

Reid continued to insist that he had no regrets for the move. Almost exactly two years after McConnell changed the rule to include high-court justices, Reid published an op-ed in The New York Times saying that the filibuster had become an anachronism and needed to be abolished because the Senate had “become an unworkable legislative graveyard.”

Reid seemed to truly believe, despite the partisanship that suffused the column, that the Senate had been badly damaged. But he was alternately bemused and furious as Democratic senators, some of whom voted for the 2013 change, expressed buyer’s remorse. “A couple of Democratic senators today have very short memories because they have stated publicly on the record that they wish that we had not changed the rules,” Reid said before he died. “That’s the dumbest damn thing. They were there. They voted for it. Now to come back and try to rewrite history is impossible.”

When we spoke, the Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, a onetime Democrat and one of Reid’s closest friends in Congress, chuckled about Reid being in high dudgeon. Shelby said he believes that Reid, if similarly situated, would have done just what McConnell did to enhance the prospects of remaking the Supreme Court. “If you’ve already broken the glass, why not?” Shelby said wryly.

Schumer, Reid’s close friend and ally, had an I-told-you-so moment shortly before Reid’s death about the 2013 maneuver. “I told him I thought it was a bad idea, but he was just so fed up and so pissed off,” Schumer told me. “I did get him to make sure that we didn’t go nuclear on Supreme Court judges. And look what happened … McConnell came in and got rid of the role right away. But yes, I thought going nuclear would have bad consequences for us. And on that one, I may have been right.”

            <div id="article-text">Imagine you’re the president of a midsize country, and you’re offered a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. The only condition: You have to pay the secretary-general of the United Nations $1 billion.

This is something like what Donald Trump is now offering world leaders.

The U.S. president has sent letters of invitation to various heads of government to join a new Board of Peace, which he will chair. The organization was envisioned as part of the United Nations–backed effort for the reconstruction and transitional governance of Gaza. But the new board’s charter, details of which have not been previously reported, appears to give the board a global remit, according to a copy we reviewed. And the price of a permanent position on the board is very steep.

The charter’s membership section, written in legalese that sounds not unlike an application to join the committee of an upscale golf club, says members will be invited by the chairman to participate for a three-year term, subject to renewal by Trump. But there is a way to skip the renewals and lock in for the long term: “The three-year membership term shall not apply to Member States that contribute more than USD $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force.”

What the money will be used for isn’t stated. Its expected purpose is to fund reconstruction and other revitalization efforts in Gaza and perhaps beyond, in whatever conflicts Trump and the board choose to address. But the charter doesn’t address that. Its finance section simply states: “Funding for the expenses of the Board of Peace shall be through voluntary funding from Member States, other States, organizations, or other sources.” That could leave interested world leaders wondering where, exactly, their money would go.

“The entire world is lining up to join President Trump’s historic effort to deliver peace to the Middle East and create a peaceful and prosperous future for the people of Gaza,” the White House spokesman Dylan Johnson told us in a statement. “This week marks a historic new beginning in the Middle East.”

Although the concept of the Board of Peace was endorsed by the Security Council in November as part of Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza, the new board’s charter appears to show an ambition to be what Trump has always wanted: a rival to the UN that lacks the latter’s notorious inefficiency.

The first paragraph of the preamble states that “durable peace requires pragmatic judgment, common-sense solutions, and the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed.” And, in case you missed the dig, a little lower the preamble talks of the need for “a more nimble and effective international peace-building body.”

The Board of Peace charter makes no mention of Gaza. And although the November UN resolution gave the board a two-year, extendable mandate ending in December 2027, the three-year terms and billion-dollar permanent memberships suggest Trump has a much longer time horizon in mind.

The Board of Peace and other measures to address the crisis in Gaza were unveiled in recent days after months of fragile cease-fire. On Wednesday, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s friend and special envoy, announced the start of phase two of Trump’s peace plan: “the full demilitarization and reconstruction of Gaza,” as well as the establishment of “a transitional technocratic Palestinian administration.” The Board of Peace’s job is to oversee all this. The board officially formed the day after Witkoff’s announcement, according to a post by Trump on Truth Social.

The Board of Peace has an executive board, the organization’s operating committee. The White House this week named its initial seven members: Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser; former British Prime Minister Tony Blair; Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank; the financier Marc Rowan; Robert Gabriel, a deputy national security adviser and former Fox News producer; and Witkoff. In addition, the Board of Peace has a separate panel of Palestinian technocrats, headed by the former Palestinian Authority official Ali Sha’ath. The technocrats are responsible for everyday management of Gaza.

Further announcements related to the Board of Peace are expected at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which kicks off Monday. Trump told reporters on Air Force One last week that the board will comprise the “most important leaders of the most important nations.”

In letters of invitation to join the Board of Peace, Trump said, “This Board will be one of a kind, there has never been anything like it!” according to a copy posted on X by Argentinian President Javier Milei. Trump also sent invites to Turkish Premier Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, according to an X post by the head of Erdogan’s communications office, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who has accepted, according to The Globe and Mail.

If Trump aims to create a UN replacement, that would square with his long-held contempt for the global body. In September, he went well over his allotted time at the General Assembly for an excoriating speech. “What is the purpose of the United Nations?” he asked, adding that the organization had “tremendous potential” that it was “not even close to living up to.” Trump claimed that he’d had to step in and end wars that the UN was too weak to handle.

Now Trump, who has long coveted a Nobel Peace Prize, will have an organization of his own with the word “Peace” right there in the name. Fellow world leaders will be there to join him—provided, that is, that they’re willing to pay to stick around.</div>

When you watch an actor accepting an Oscar, or read about a brilliant scientist receiving a huge prize, you might imagine that they’ve found the key to happiness. Who wouldn’t be happy, living life with so much talent or smarts? But the relationship between intelligence and happiness is complicated, Arthur C. Brooks wrote in 2023. “The gifts you possess can lift you up or pull you down; it all depends on how you use them,” he explained. Today’s newsletter explores how to utilize your skills and smarts to add joy to your life, rather than letting them chip away at what actually makes the days meaningful.

How Smart People Can Stop Being Miserable

Intelligence can make you happier, but only if you see it as more than a tool to get ahead. (From 2023)

            <div id="article-text">Foreign ministers from Greenland and Denmark met with the Trump administration this week amid the president’s bid for the island nation. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic joined to discuss.

Although “Trump campaigned on fixing the economy” and “removing illegal immigrants from the country,” Atlantic staff writer Nancy Youssef said last night, “at the start of 2026 we’re focused so much on foreign policy and intervention and the U.S. military might overseas.”

Joining the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, last night to consider this, and more: Jonathan Karl, the chief Washington correspondent at ABC News; David Sanger, a White House and national-security correspondent atThe New York Times; Nick Schifrin, a foreign-affairs and defense correspondent at PBS News Hour; and Youssef, a staff writer at The Atlantic.</div>

            <h2>My Students Write Their Papers Backwards</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-01-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/english-teaching-methods/685632/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In my high-school English classes, I often tell my students that they write their papers backwards: They devise a thesis and then look for evidence to support it. They’ll find what they want to see, I tell them, but they won’t be surprised. They might say that Ishmael, the narrator in Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick, is appalled by Captain Ahab, but they won’t notice that the two characters also sound a lot alike.

The most exciting moments for a teacher come when students stumble onto something unexpected—when they run to my office to tell me about a new twist in their thinking about birds in Sula or the discovery of yet another biblical reflection in Housekeeping. Those revelations come only when they survey the text as it is, not as they assume it to be.

Many students assume that they know what they’ll see—in books, people, or anything else—because that’s what they’ve been taught, relentlessly and often subliminally. By the time they were learning to read, many schools had moved away from teaching traditional phonics. Instead of asking kids to sound out letters, the new approach, called “whole language,” had them divine words from only the first letter, the context, and maybe a picture. In some cases, teachers covered up the word and had students guess what it was. The implication was that language is reliable, consistent, and predictable, which is awfully boring—and dangerous.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, that approach to teaching literacy didn’t work. In recent years, particularly after a 2020 research report and a 2022 investigative podcast brought this flawed pedagogy into the public eye, whole language has fallen out of fashion. Parents, teachers, and just about anyone who knows how to read have piled on with a common-sense rebuke: How can you read a word without seeing it?

John McWhorter: How I taught my kid to read

But even if we’ve moved past the heyday of whole-language reading, we clearly still believe that we can draw conclusions from context rather than from all the facts before us. Rarely has the adoption of a new technology been so quick and insidious as what we’re witnessing in the popularization of large language models such as ChatGPT.

LLMs imitate human language by way of probabilistic guessing. Trained on books, the contents of the internet, and more, the models use patterns to predict outputs. If you plug in “I woke up and ate,” ChatGPT might guess that the next word is breakfast, pancakes, or cereal. Rarely, rat. Rarer still, mitochondria. Chatbots don’t understand; they don’t read; they don’t think. They create responses that reflect the probability of each word—or, to use the technical term, token—appearing in a sentence.

Generative-AI chatbots basically adopt the same flawed understanding of the world that informs the whole-language approach to reading: that one can best discern meaning by looking at external clues rather than straight at the facts. The resulting text may astonish with its plausibility, but a guess, even one of extraordinary mathematical complexity, is a guess.

The problem with guesswork is not just that the results can be wrong. It’s that even the most educated of guesses reduce the world to a sequence of likely tokens. Sure, some predictions are warranted and even useful. The sun does rise every morning. My pen falls every time I release it from my grasp. But a chief delight of being human is witnessing the world’s capacity to surprise.

Reductive presumptions are even worse when it comes to people. Stereotypes steamroll the beautiful mess of individual desires and idiosyncrasies into something simplistic and guessable, when in fact we contradict ourselves; we contain multitudes. We are not actually so predictable. We can’t be guessed.

My students, like most people, sometimes approach conversations guessing what the other person will say, as if human thought consisted of probabilistic tokens. They see a woman with a nose ring or a man in a pickup truck and preempt the argument that they assume is coming. Cover up the word; guess from the context. Find the evidence that supports your thesis.

When my students read without expectations, they discover the unexpected. That’s how one senior, who didn’t know the word fust and had to look it up, noticed other elements of mold and decay in Hamlet and ended up writing about the rot of Denmark’s “unweeded garden.” It’s what led a ninth grader to see the Everglades, in Their Eyes Were Watching God, as a place that combines the stability of land and the mutability of water, a place where the characters, like the plants they cultivate, can grow.

I encourage my students to approach texts with no notion of what’s likely, not only because it yields better, more interesting papers, but also because I believe that it will make them better citizens. I hope that they learn to see the world, as they do texts, for what it is, in all its guess-defying beauty.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For the past week, I’ve found myself playing the same 23-second CNN clip on repeat. I’ve watched it in bed, during my commute to work, at the office, midway through making carrot soup, and while brushing my teeth. In the video, Harry Enten, the network’s chief data analyst, stares into the camera and breathlessly tells his audience about the gambling odds that Donald Trump will buy any of Greenland. “The people who are putting their money where their mouth is—they are absolutely taking this seriously,” Enten says. He taps the giant touch screen behind him and pulls up a made-for-TV graphic: Based on how people were betting online at the time, there was a 36 percent chance that the president would annex Greenland. “Whoa, way up there!” Enten yells, slapping his hands together. “My goodness gracious!” The ticker at the bottom of the screen speeds through other odds: Will Gavin Newsom win the next presidential election? 19 percent chance. Will Viktor Orbán be out as the leader of Hungary before the end of the year? 48 percent chance.

These odds were pulled from Kalshi, which hilariously claims not to be a gambling platform: It’s a “prediction market.” People go to sites such as Kalshi and Polymarket—another big prediction market—in order to put money down on a given news event. Nobody would bet on something that they didn’t believe would happen, the thinking goes, and so the markets are meant to forecast the likelihood of a given outcome.

Listen: Prediction markets and the “suckerification” crisis, with Max Read

Prediction markets let you wager on basically anything. Will Elon Musk father another baby by June 30? Will Jesus return this year? Will Israel strike Gaza tomorrow? Will the longevity guru Bryan Johnson’s next functional sperm count be greater than “20.0 M/ejac”? These sites have recently boomed in popularity—particularly among terminally online young men who trade meme stocks and siphon from their 401(k)s to buy up bitcoin. But now prediction markets are creeping into the mainstream. CNN announced a deal with Kalshi last month to integrate the site’s data into its broadcasts, which has led to betting odds showing up in segments about Democrats possibly retaking the House, credit-card interest rates, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. At least twice in the past two weeks, Enten has told viewers about the value of data from people who are “putting their money where their mouth is.”

On January 7, the media giant Dow Jones announced its own collaboration with Polymarket and said that it will begin integrating the site’s odds across its publications, including The Wall Street Journal. CNBC has a prediction-market deal, as does Yahoo Finance, Sports Illustrated, and Time. Last week, MoviePass announced that it will begin testing a betting platform. On Sunday, the Golden Globes featured Polymarket’s forecasts throughout the broadcast—because apparently Americans wanted to know whether online gamblers favored Amy Poehler or Dax Shepard to win Best Podcast.

Media is a ruthless, unstable business, and revenue streams are drying up; if you squint, you can see why CNN or Dow Jones might sign a contract that, after all, provides its audience with some kind of data. On air, Enten cites Kalshi odds alongside Gallup polls and Google searches—what’s the difference? “The data featured through our partnership with Kalshi is just one of many sources used to provide context around the stories or topics we are covering and has no impact on editorial judgment,” Brian Poliakoff, a CNN spokesperson, told me in a statement. Nolly Evans, the Journal’s digital general manager, told me that Polymarket provides the newspaper’s journalists with “another way to quantify collective expectations—especially around financial or geopolitical events.” In an email, Jack Suh, a Kalshi spokesperson, told me that the company’s partnerships are designed to inform the public, not to encourage more trading. Polymarket declined to comment.

The problem is that prediction markets are ushering in a world in which news becomes as much about gambling as about the event itself. This kind of thing has already happened to sports, where the language of “parlays” and “covering the spread” has infiltrated every inch of commentary. ESPN partners with DraftKings to bring its odds to SportsCenter and Monday Night Football; CBS Sports has a betting vertical; FanDuel runs its own streaming network. But the stakes of Greenland’s future are more consequential than the NFL playoffs.

The more that prediction markets are treated like news, especially heading into another election, the more every dip and swing in the odds may end up wildly misleading people about what might happen, or influencing what happens in the real world. Yet it’s unclear whether these sites are meaningful predictors of anything. After the Golden Globes, Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan excitedly posted that his site had correctly predicted 26 of 28 winners, which seems impressive—but Hollywood awards shows are generally predictable. One recent study found that Polymarket’s forecasts in the weeks before the 2024 election were not much better than chance.

These markets are also manipulable. In 2012, one bettor on the now-defunct prediction market Intrade placed a series of huge wagers on Mitt Romney in the two weeks preceding the election, generating a betting line indicative of a tight race. The bettor did not seem motivated by financial gain, according to two researchers who examined the trades. “More plausibly, this trader could have been attempting to manipulate beliefs about the odds of victory in an attempt to boost fundraising, campaign morale, and turnout,” they wrote. The trader lost at least $4 million but might have shaped media attention of the race for less than the price of a prime-time ad, they concluded.

A billionaire congressional candidate can’t just send a check to Quinnipiac University and suddenly find himself as the polling front-runner, but he can place enormous Polymarket bets on himself that move the odds in his favor. Or consider this hypothetical laid out by the Stanford political scientist Andrew Hall: What if, a month before the 2028 presidential election, the race is dead even between J. D. Vance and Mark Cuban? Inexplicably, Vance’s odds of winning surge on Kalshi, possibly linked to shady overseas bets. CNN airs segment after segment about the spike, turning it into an all-consuming national news story. Democrats and Republicans point fingers at each other, and no one knows what’s really going on. Such a scenario is “plausible—maybe even likely—in the coming years,” Hall writes. It doesn’t help that the Trump Media and Technology Group, the owner of the president’s social-media platform, Truth Social, is set to launch its own platform, Truth Predict. (Donald Trump Jr. is an adviser to both Kalshi and Polymarket.)

The irony of prediction markets is that they are supposed to be a more trustworthy way of gleaning the future than internet clickbait and half-baked punditry, but they risk shredding whatever shared trust we still have left. The suspiciously well-timed bets that one Polymarket user placed right before the capture of Nicolás Maduro may have been just a stroke of phenomenal luck that netted a roughly $400,000 payout. Or maybe someone with inside information was looking for easy money. Last week, when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt abruptly ended her briefing after 64 minutes and 30 seconds, many traders were outraged, because they had predicted (with 98 percent odds) that the briefing would run past 65 minutes. Some suspected, with no evidence, that Leavitt had deliberately stopped before the 65-minute mark to turn a profit. (When I asked the White House about this, the spokesperson Davis Ingle told me in a statement, “This is a 100% Fake News narrative.”)

Read: The Polymarket bets on Maduro are a warning

Unintentionally or not, this is what happens when media outlets normalize treating every piece of news and entertainment as something to wager on. As Tarek Mansour, Kalshi’s CEO, has said, his long-term goal is to “financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion.” (Kalshi means “everything” in Arabic.) What could go wrong? As one viral post on X recently put it, “Got a buddy who is praying for world war 3 so he can win $390 on Polymarket.” It’s a joke. I think.</div>

A larger satellite can have a larger signals collecting area, can have much more sophisticated electronics, can have better shielding against radiation, and (if it uses solar panels) can have substantially larger panels because it&#39;ll have the fuel to manoever.

Now, whether or not these particular large satellites are better, proof is in the pudding. Clearly, they&#39;re still being idiots about reflectivity. (Yes, you&#39;ve got to get rid of the heat, and that&#39;s best done in a direction that doesn&#39;t worsen your altitude, but there&#39;s ways to do this that don&#39;t interfere with astronomy,)

More AI features no one is asking for. This AI bubble is looking more and more like the dotcom bubble.Please burst already.

I&#39;m starting to hear people complaining about &quot;customer support&quot; AI &quot;agents&quot; failing to solve simple problems and effectively preventing you from getting in touch with a human who could. I can tell you who asked for this right away.

It does have that dot-com feel doesn&#39;t it.  The script kiddies are back in town! :)

It&#39;s also reminiscent of the &quot;we must have cloud everything&quot; frenzy.  It didn&#39;t matter if any value was created as long as everyone knew it was &quot;cloud first&quot; or (worse) just lift and shift the lot to (insert public cloud provider) until the inevitable hangover occurred when lack of governance and strategy resulted in huge ongoing cloud provider charges with little in the way ROI to show for it.

Retailers do. The goal is to push customers into buying more stuff, so they want to use AI to push more products in front of you.

Upsell widgets usually are limited in what they can show you (you know because when you check out, you get a screen saying &quot;Check out these special offers!&quot; with more products).

The goal is to get AI bots to inundate you with products so you get the Costco effect where you only wanted one item but leave with dozens more items.

They have to make some serious progress towards not being a huge pile of burning cash in the next year, and this is one of the many increasingly desperate ways they will try to do that.

I expect it to end with begging and bribing the goverment to foot the bill, but the politicans of today are already piling up way more debt than ever before, so they might not want to bail out openAI. But the AI bubble is propping up the economy, in that sense its too big to fail, and we can&#39;t let china get ahead, right? Right guys?! I mean we just let them get ahead with electric vehicles and solar power so THIS time we&#39;re not going to!

.. more of your money, because what we like most of you IS YOUR FREAKIN MONEY!

Yes but have you seen a shop owner stuffing things into your bag that you are supposed to buy?

A few weeks back I called a BBQ restaurant in Vero Beach FL to order dinner. A very pleasant woman answered the phone and asked for my order. It took about 15 seconds to realize I was speaking to a bot (bonus points, it was the first day of roll-out) and I&#39;m thinking &#39;here we go, gonna be another &#39;11th floor elevator&#39; sketch&#39;. TL;DR, it worked perfectly for my order. Nothing I said was misinterpreted and the final order was exactly as I ordered. I spoke to another customer while I was waiting for my pickup

Why did you have to figure it out? Why didn&#39;t the bot identify itself?That is a great question and, upon reflection, think that systems should identify as a bot and offer an option to speak to a human somewhere in the Q&A process.

That is a great question and, upon reflection, think that systems should identify as a bot and offer an option to speak to a human somewhere in the Q&A process.

And we&#39;re all going to be right about AI.

And it is run by the president of the land of the brave, the home of the free.

If you need a pardon, or some other service, like removing a regulation, etc, you negotiate the price, buy some of his memecoins and voila, the government gets it done.

More than half of all cryptocurrencies ever launched are now defunct. Suckers.

The 10 biggest holders of TrumpCoin (roughly those who held about $250,000 or more) got an exclusive dinner with him at the White House. When this was announced the value shot up because this became a great way to get a ear with the President.

In the grand scheme of things, this is relatively cheap, campaign financing wise.

The ICO days of 2017-2020/2021 produced a lot of now-dead projects as well.  When people can just fork and launch memecoins, there&#39;s plenty of incentive to take a shot at being the next PEPE.  All you need is enough cash for an exchange listing fee.

Please tell me, what percentage of Silicon Valley startups survived in this time frame, what percentage of &quot;new media&quot; outfits made it through this time, and which restaurants opened and stayed open. This is really nothing new. This is, how capitalism is supposed to work: present idea, find initial funding, see, whether you can make money with this. Fail early, fail often, find your path to success.

You realize, that most web startups from late 90ies went up in smoke, but you&#39;ll agree, that the web is here t

No idea, and that fact isn&#39;t relevant to the discussion.  Even the sketchiest dot bomb era startup pales in comparison to garbage like PEPE2.

It would be nice if we could get a cryptocurrency with true anonymity like Monero, ability to prune the blockchain so only the minimum transactions have to be kept, and so the blockchain never constantly grows, supports &quot;taxes&quot;, where when Alice sends Bob one unit of the coin, a tenth of the unit is created and sent to Charlie who is the government tax office.  This way, taxes are paid automatically (although in an inflationary manner).

Would be nice to see more experimental coins, and not just pump/dump stu

Your taxes idea is compatible with any smart contract but it will be a barrier to adoption. Why would I use a stablecoin that taxes me when there are ones that don&#39;t?

They are cryptomagically blockchained so no way they are able to fail like these fake tokens.Since I don&#39;t legally own the picture, I printed out the NFT QR code and put it above my couch, which is a real vintage bull leather couch by the way.All my best friends are so jealous  and take pictures over my couch all the time.

If the point of most of these cryptos was for their creators to jump on the hype train and make a quick cash crab, and those creators successfully executed an exit strategy to dump their crypto product somewhere near its peak - then those cryptos were a success; they did not fail in their intended purpose.

I&#39;ve personally launched at least 5 ( A bunch of reeeeaaal duds).

It&#39;s a widely held belief that a large amount of the brain&#39;s flexible behavior is bayesian- i.e., a statistical model.

Not by neuroscientists it ain&#39;t.  The Bayesian thing is the obsession of a small, frankly cultish, subset of the silicon valley crowd The rise of LLMs turned out to be somewhat of a blow to that crowds reputation, because LLMs, like brains, just aren&#39;t particularly Bayesian in behavior.

there are tens or even hundreds of different types of neurons. In fact, researchers are still trying to devise a way to neatly classify the huge variety of neurons that exist in the brain.It&#39;s not easy to look in the brain, you can do an MRI but you can&#39;t see the activity of the individual neurons easily (unlike in an NN).

We don&#39;t even have a confident analysis on all the types of neurons yet [uq.edu.au]:And probably never will, because there are hundreds of them, and this kind of work on a living brain is very difficult.

Huh? Are you stupid? There&#39;s no billions of years of evolutionary adaptation in AI, there&#39;s direct fitting to existing modern data. In a rather inefficient way I might add, without guarantees of convergence to a global optimum (or even a local one at that).

Sometimes I despair at the utter ignorance of young scientists today who have been given careful and precise methodologies on a platter. It just makes them think everything is trivial and any old brainfart they come up with is somehow valuable, a

There&#39;s a large gap here and essentially a false dichotomy. The person you are replying to didn&#39;t claim that humans are identical in their reading to how AIs read. They did note correctly that the claim that a human learns to read from a single book is obviously false.

That said,  It is pretty clear that the AIs are doing a lot of things more inefficiently than humans in terms of training data, which shouldn&#39;t be surprising given that human brains have had millions of years of evolution to optimize learni

I&#39;ve always suspected the method of training an AI is based on the wrong premises and that&#39;s why it can&#39;t tell bad from wrong and build reasoning.It seems there are no parents/teachers involved who will guide it while processing the first chunks of information.

We don&#39;t know enough about how the brain works (at a higher level) so we can&#39;t make something that WORKS like the brain.  The best we can do is make something that BEHAVES like a brain.

LLMs and other AI implementations can be thought of as &quot;brain emulators&quot;.  They&#39;re trying to achieve similar behaviors any way they can.  Our current technology could be looked at as &quot;serial&quot;, where as brains work almost exclusively in parallel.  It&#39;s still possible to build a neural network that works like a brain at a low l

marauding gangs of militias brought in from neighbouring countries to do the regime’s dirty work.

Artificial neural networks are not serial. You can simulate them on a serial computer (although nobody does anymore) but that has nothing to do with their function, only their efficiency.

If they are paying for that, they aren&#39;t paying for a lot of people to do it, just the &quot;editors&quot;. Nobody has to pay most of these people for shit takes OR shit down mods. There have always been a bunch of bitches here who think they are right about everything and will mod you down to prove it. It would only prove the opposite except that moderation is secret, which is frankly offensive. This ain&#39;t voting, mods should be public.

I do think it is interesting if modern versions of artificial intelligence are structured more like a human brain.

The idea of neural networks was studied in the 1980s, but it was quite a niche area in the field. Most AI and machine learning was built with more traditional programming, and I think that in some ways that made the &quot;artificial&quot; aspect of the AI more obvious. With the advances in AI in the last few years, the fact that there might be more similarities to be found with the human brain than earlie

The key issue is how much energy is used.

In current machine learning models, signals/input-data are propagated through the entire neural network at 100% signal power. Meaning, 0&#39;s propagate through a neural network with as much energy as 1&#39;s. This would be like receiving a question about baking an apple pie as input, and then sending that question to every single person on planet earth, whether they know anything about baking apple pies or not. This would be (and currently is) extremely energy intensive. Fortunately, the brain doesn&#39;t work this way. Signals only propagate to regions of the brain that can actually process the input. For example, when a person is asked a question, the person&#39;s entire brain does not saturate itself with blood to the point where every cubic millimetre of brain material is involved in processing that question. Different regions of the brain are responsible for processing different types of input, and this can be shown in scans that show blood-flow/heat inside the brain.

Until machine learning models are designed to propagate signals to machine neural &quot;regions&quot; that can process that type of input, they will never &quot;resemble&quot; a brain. The human brain simply does not allow &quot;low-probability-signals&quot; to consume energy, and propagate through the entire brain. This means that auditory input neurons will not normally propagate to vision-processing neurons, and taste-input-neurons will not propagate signals to areas of the brain that process finger-tip input neurons.

Eventually, current neural models will reach a tipping point, because processing inputs scales to ^2 of the number of inputs. Input and input-signal segregation will be the only way to scale machine learning models to more sophisticated network architectures without requiring the ridiculous power requirements that they now require.

The solution to today&#39;s neural models&#39; power requirements will be solved when some clever person figures out how to no propagate 0&#39;s through matrix multiplication to save energy at the hardware level.

That will bring humanity one large step closer to making AI models resemble an actual brain (self-awareness issues aside...).

Most current models don&#39;t use only binary, 0 or 1, in their neural networks. I seem to remember a paper suggesting they could, but I don&#39;t know of any that currently do. Most are trained at fp32, with ~4 billion possible energy levels per &quot;neuron&quot;. That can be reduced to as few as 16 levels in practical use, but the more the model is quantized this way the worse it performs.

Processing only part of a network is sometimes done too. Entire layers can easily be skipped, often with interesting results. Other kin

Uh, have you ever handled sodium metal?Lithium ion fires are caused by thermal runaway. Sodium ion is more stable.

There is no sodium metal in sodium ion batteries, just like there is no lithium metal in lithium ion batteries.

Uh, have you ever handled sodium metal?Lots of people have in science classes, but usually not literally by hand, of course. I should note though, as a kind of a cool aside that I thought was fun to learn, that back in the middle of last century, sodium metal was actually used for electrical wiring. It turns out that it actually has a lower resistivity-density product which made it a potential replacement for aluminum and copper in utility wiring. It never caught on, but it&#39;s weird to think that it even worked in the first place.

There are different levels of rare.  Lithium isn&#39;t platinum, but it&#39;s not sodium either.  I keep a tub of salt (50% sodium) in my kitchen cupboard.  It&#39;s dirt cheap.  Lithium can&#39;t compete with it on price.

Sodium can&#39;t match lithium on mass, but like the article says, the bigger use is for grid storage.  Weight doesn&#39;t matter much if you aren&#39;t carrying the batteries around with you.  Using sodium for grid storage makes it cheaper, and frees up lithium for cars.

Really all this battery tech is placeholder until the solid-state battery nut is finally cracked which could be within a decade if things shake out right.

Solid state is officially cracked, Donut Labs is already making them for 600km range motor bikes. It will filter into cars once production gears up

We can certainly hope so. I am skeptical not least because the founder appears to be a bit of an oddball prone to grandiose claims, but they did make an actual hub motor, and I watched an interesting video that did a great job of unearthing a lot of information to see whether the claims might possibly be plausible and found that it was indeed possible they&#39;ve done it.

Lithium being &quot;rare&quot; is a myth, that stuff is everywhere and earth has enough to last centuries even without recyclingThat is true, but the oceans are literally about 1% sodium, and it can be extracted through a relatively simple process. That means that it&#39;s cheap and effectively limitless.

Sodium Ion batteries are no hypothetical technology... you can just buy them... online. They are around 80 Euros per kWh.

There&#39;s a good explanation of what CATL&#39;s claiming for its Na batteries here.

https://www.batterytechonline.... [batterytechonline.com]

I find it interesting that one key use case may be replacing lead acid starter batteries for trucks. The power requirements for truck starter batteries have eased slightly over the years with things like assisted-start sequences, to the point where sodium can meet the need (although lithium would struggle). And sodium will outperform lead for cold start, deep discharge and lifetime.

....would be great. Unlike lithium, sodium is far more widely available, in the form of various salts. If that becomes a thing, batteries could, in the long term, potentially become as inexpensive as silicon

Various salts? We have oceans of sodium ions. Ionic sodium loves going into solution with water. That&#39;s why it&#39;s trivial to acquire because whatever ionic solid it&#39;s attached to, it wants to get away from and it does once water is applied.

And yes, CATL is predicting stupidly cheap batteries with basicall

People have been talking about commercial space stations and hotels on the moon at least as far back as the 1990s. Never seems to happen. Isn&#39;t a new idea, isn&#39;t a new technology, isn&#39;t going to happen anytime very soon either. Just a lot of embarassing hot air.

...presently... Current sodium batteries...  currently...The article is about breakthroughs in technology. If sodium batteries were currently on a par with lithium ion, it wouldn&#39;t be a breakthrough.

The article is about breakthroughs in technology. If sodium batteries were currently on a par with lithium ion, it wouldn&#39;t be a breakthrough.

Transistors aren&#39;t very expensive. Most electronics already have DC-DC converters.

I mean, CATL seem pretty confident, and they make more batteries than you by quite a large margin, including LFP. They don&#39;t have a habit of making bold public claims that then fall flat on their arse, so it seems unlikely that they will have done here, either. And they claim a bunch of advantages for Naxtra over LFP, including lifecycle, temperature tolerance, deep discharge tolerance, and safety. Of course, we will all wait for the first units to appear in production cars before reaching a firm conclusion

Gabfest Reads is a monthly series from the hosts of Slate’s Political Gabfest podcast. Recently, Emily Bazelon spoke with Curtis Sittenfeld about her short story collection, “Show Don’t Tell.” During their discussion, they explored recurring themes of the stories—from troubled marriages and middle age, to the passage of time and how our perception of people and events changes over the years.This partial transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Emily Bazelon: A theme in this book that’s very present is marriage. And actually most of the marriages seemed bad to me as I was reading through this. I was feeling kind of sorry for a lot of people in their partnerships. And there actually is a story called “The Marriage Clock” in which you present explicit advice about how to improve your marriage. And the kind of joke of the story is that the advice comes from a kind of Christian influencer who wrote a really—an accidental—huge bestseller based on this idea of a marriage clock and these various tenets of a good marriage. So how did you come up with this list and what do you actually stand by on this list?

Curtis Sittenfeld: Oh, that’s a good question. Well, let’s see. I’m trying to think how to answer this. I mean, I can’t remember now, it’s like 10 or 12 recommendations and I think they’re a little bit sexist and heteronormative in some cases, but I think probably most of them are good ideas. It’s like, don’t call each other mommy and daddy or like don’t let your children sleep … I mean, I think there are probably good recommendations for the health of a marriage that for many people are probably may be too challenging to adhere to. Or like, I think there can be this tension where what’s good for the family is not good for the marriage. But I mean, I certainly have read marriage self-help books … I think that the two most prominent things that it seems like have permeated the culture are the love languages book and then sort of … I have not actually read the book on attachment theory, but I’m very conversant in attachment theory.

Curtis Sittenfeld: I know— like many people in 2026.

Emily Bazelon: My favorite item on this list, “do not engage in any form of self-grooming in front of your spouse that you wouldn’t perform in the boarding gate area of an airport.”

Curtis Sittenfeld: I’m very interested in the discrepancy between who we aspire to be and who we are on a daily basis. And like so many of us know what we should do to have strong relationships or to have good physical health, but it’s so hard. It’s just so hard. Knowing what the right choices are is different from feeling equipped to make them. And even the person you are at like 3:00 PM or 8:00 PM is maybe less equipped to make good choices than the person you were at like 8:15 AM.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, which is so grateful to have you as adoring readers but will sue you in North Carolina if you alienate your affection for us.

We’ve got a lot of foreign policy this week, a telltale sign that the foreign policy ain’t going great. Domestically, control of the Senate could come down to Alaska, or at least that’s what reporters are telling their editors as they try to secure summer trips. And a Ford factory worker became the new face of the resistance.

First, we begin with the slew of scandals and drama at the Justice Department this week and attempt to discern the root of it all.

Even by the Trump Justice Department’s standards over the last year, this was an eyebrow-raising week. We learned Sunday night, from the dawg Jay Powell himself, that the Federal Reserve chair was under DOJ investigation, ostensibly for his testimony related to Fed renovation costs, but really because he wasn’t lowering interest rates fast enough for Trump. The White House has tried to distance itself from the investigation—to portray it as D.C.’s U.S. attorney Jeanine Pirro freelancing—but Trump has been pressuring Powell for a long, long time. We also learned this week that federal prosecutors are investigating five additional Democratic lawmakers who posted a video last year urging troops to ignore illegal orders. (The Pentagon has been harassing another Democrat, Sen. Mark Kelly, for months.) Trump had called their video “seditious.” Meanwhile, a wave of DOJ prosecutors resigned under pressure to investigate not the ICE killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis, but Good’s widow instead.

Amid the backdrop of a lousier-than-usual week at the DOJ, the most revealing story of the week may have been one in the Wall Street Journal about Trump’s increasing frustration with Attorney General Pam Bondi. “The criticisms,” the Journal wrote, “appear to be part of an intense campaign by Trump to pressure the Justice Department to more aggressively pursue his priorities”—specifically, pursuing his enemies. Consider, too, a separate Journal story about a White House photo op with U.S. attorneys last week during which Trump berated them for being “weak” and complained that they weren’t “moving fast enough to prosecute his favored targets.” Trump has a poor history with attorneys general who, at one point or another, can’t find within the law the answers to his questions. So long as Bondi wants to keep her job, there are many more bad weeks ahead.

The retiring North Carolina Republican senator deserves credit this week for offering meaningful pushback to the administration’s threats against Powell. Shortly after Powell’s SOS message went up Sunday night, Tillis announced that he would oppose any of the president’s Fed nominees until the Powell matter was resolved. Given Tillis’ seat on the Banking Committee, that pledge would prevent any Fed nominee—including Powell’s upcoming replacement as chair—from getting voted out of committee. The pushback from Tillis, and a fair number of other Republican senators, was enough to calm markets and put the White House on its back foot.

Tillis, liberated from electoral concerns, has been speaking up against the administration’s errors more openly in the last couple of weeks. We could leave it at that. But the Surge’s bylaws are clear that no nit be left unpicked, and so we have to quibble with his framing. Tillis’ argument is that the administration is making some dumb decisions because Trump is receiving bad advice. Whichever adviser pursued the “vindictive prosecution” against Powell, he said, needs to “grow up and give the president better advice.” And in terms of seizing Greenland, he said separately that he blamed “whoever told the president that this was a viable path. It doesn’t make sense.” We understand that calling the principal himself an idiot wouldn’t be the most effective means of dissuading him from destructive ideas. But it is the principal, not the advisers, who are the problem. Trump wants to annex Greenland because it looks big on a map, and so the advisers are competing with each other to achieve that for him. He insists the Fed lower interest rates faster, so there’s a Cabinet-wide contest to do what it takes. The bad ideas are coming from the man himself, and he won’t take no for an answer.

The president reiterated on Wednesday that the United States “needs” Greenland, and that anything less than Greenland being “in the hands of the UNITED STATES” is “unacceptable.” And on Friday, while a bipartisan congressional delegation visited Copenhagen to reassure Danish leaders that Congress stood in the way of Trump’s Greenland plans (sure you are, guys), Trump was threatening tariffs against countries if they “don’t go along with Greenland.” You can actually hear his dopamine rush when he says this.

On that note, let’s look at a couple of consequences of Trump’s yearlong effort to antagonize the United States’ closest friends and allies in the free world. In a sentence we never quite thought we’d have to write, numerous European Union countries are deploying troops and military personnel to Greenland in a show of support to Denmark against American aggression towards its allies. Repeat: Europe is sending troops to Greenland while America threatens to seize it. And on Friday during a visit to Beijing, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney agreed to slash its 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric cars in exchange for China importing more Canadian agricultural products, and said China had become a more “predictable” trading partner than the U.S. Can the Supreme Court go ahead and release that opinion nuking Trump’s tariffs powers soon, please?

The major recruitment news of the week was that former Democratic Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola launched a bid for Senate against incumbent Republican Dan Sullivan. Peltola, who’s reusing the “Fish, family, and freedom” slogan that carried her to House victory in 2022 before a narrow reelection loss in 2024, gives Democrats a fighting chance in a red state where Peltola has won statewide, given that there’s only one congressional district in Alaska, in very recent memory.

Her recruitment is also a critical piece of a much larger puzzle: Giving Democrats a chance—we’re saying there’s a chance!—to pick up the net four seats they would need to retake control of the Senate in the midterms. If Democrats can retain all of the seats they control (including tough races in Michigan and Georgia), the path to Senate control runs through winning the open seat in North Carolina, finally replacing Susan Collins in Maine, hoping ex-Sen. Sherrod Brown can oust Sen. John Husted in Ohio, and then Peltola in Alaska. This is the way, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave 18 billion interviews this week describing it as such. It’s important to observe that each step along this path is quite difficult, and completing it would require a midterm wave in Democrats’ favor. Stranger things have happened.

Even a handful of days ago, a U.S. intervention against the Iranian regime, as the country was swarmed with protests that were being brutally put down, seemed like it was imminent. Military options had been prepared and presented for the president; U.S. personnel were being advised to leave the U.S. military base in Qatar. By Wednesday night, though, Trump said that “we’ve been told that the killing in Iran is stopping—it’s stopped—it’s stopping. And there’s no plan for executions, or an execution.” Iran had signaled as much on Thursday. What Iran has or has not stopped, we don’t know. But this came as the administration received advice from allies in the region—including Saudi Arabia and Israel—not to intervene, arguing that the protests weren’t strong enough to topple the regime and U.S. intervention would cause regional chaos.

Now, Trump could very well surprise-bomb Iran overnight if someone cracks a little too much fresh-ground pepper on his steak. But with the apparent deescalation, the Surge wants to send its thoughts and prayers to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. As we wrote last week, he was riding high on the Venezuela intervention and hoped that Trump might fulfill Graham’s top bucket-list item—regime change in Iran—next. Graham was all over TV and social media this week egging on his audience of one. He described Trump as “Reagan Plus” and openly urged him to kill Ayatollah Khamenei. He met with the Shah of Iran’s son, who’s eager to take control of the country. When Trump’s tone shift came later in the week, Graham scrambled to deny that Trump had swung against action or that the protests had ebbed in Iran, and said that he no longer wanted to be allies with allies that told Trump not to get involved. It’s always hard for Graham when a country goes un-bombed, and this is the big one. Let’s give him a little space.

Last week in the Senate, five Republicans joined all Democrats to advance a war powers resolution barring the president from using military force in Venezuela without congressional sign-off. Despite his administration’s firm promise that they have no additional military plans in Venezuela, Trump was furious, saying those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Republican leaders and administration officials set off a fierce pressure campaign to kill the resolution.

The pressure campaign was successful. On Wednesday, Senate Republicans killed the resolution with another procedural vote, having convinced two of the five Republicans—Sens. Josh Hawley and Todd Young—to back off. What were their excuses? Both said that they received a variety of “assurances” from the administration that there were no troops in Venezuela at the moment, and that if the administration does want to send troops in the future, it will totally ask Congress first. Now, the Surge doesn’t think it would be that much effort to encode those promises into law, to be extra careful. You just go to the Senate floor, stick your thumb up, and you’ve voted for it. But what do we know?

Trump’s team organized a nice little afternoon for him on Tuesday: a visit to Michigan to visit Ford’s F-150 factory, where the big trucks get made. Neat! As he was walking through the plant with Ford’s CEO, a 40-year-old line worker later identifying himself as TJ Sabula shouted “Pedophile protector!” at Trump. The president pointed back at him, said “Fuck you,” and then gave him the middle finger. Sabula was suspended.

Sabula, in an interview with the Washington Post, said that he had “no regrets whatsoever” about what he did. “I don’t feel as though fate looks upon you often, and when it does, you better be ready to seize the opportunity,” he said. “And today I think I did that.” While Sabula is concerned about losing his job—and maybe should be a little worried about, like, ICE showing up to his door, pretending that he tried to run over the president with one of the trucks he was assembling—his act of heckling is being well remunerated. A couple of GoFundMe pages in his name have raised over $800,000.

President Trump REALLY wants to invoke the Insurrection Act. He’s fallen hard for this 200-year-old law that would allow him to deploy active duty military to enforce civilian law on American streets. On this week’s Amicus podcast, co-host Mark Joseph Stern is joined by Professor Steve Vladeck, a nationally recognized expert on the Supreme Court, federal courts, national security law, and military justice. They discuss what’s been stopping Trump from invoking the act so far, why he has no legal authority to do so right now, and what happens if he does it anyway.

Next, Mark talks to Julia Gegenheimer, former special litigation counsel in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section, and now a special litigation counsel at Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection. Julia and Mark discuss the remaining paths to justice after the killing of Renee Good and examine what happens when the DOJ abandons its duty to seek accountability and vindicate civil rights.

Three days ago, Slate published an article I wrote titled “You’ve Heard About Who ICE Is Recruiting. The Truth Is Far Worse. I’m the Proof.” The article details how I, in an effort to learn more about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s hiring practices, applied for a job at ICE—and ended up getting a job offer. To say that I was surprised would be an understatement: For one, I’m a vocal online critic of ICE and the Trump administration. More saliently, I skipped many of the steps required for the application. It’s a wild story—I’d encourage you to read the whole thing—and one that does not reflect particularly well on ICE or its parent organization: the Department of Homeland Security.

In another time, the exposé of an extraordinarily lax hiring process at an agency tasked with keeping the nation safe would be of bipartisan concern. After all, if ICE is going to arm agents and send them out into America’s streets, it should at least know whom it’s sending. Even supporters of ICE’s mission should want to know that the agency is hiring effective people to carry that mission out. And so under another administration, DHS might look into what happened here, figuring out how my application went through and whether it was a one-off glitch or a widespread, systemic issue.

This administration, however, took a different approach. “This is such a lazy lie. This individual was NEVER offered a job at ICE,” DHS said Wednesday through the administration’s most official communication channel: X (formerly Twitter). “Applicants may receive a Tentative Selection Letter following their initial application and interview that is not a job offer. It just means they are invited to submit information for review, similar to any other applicant.”

DHS is correct that I received an initial offer letter. I also, however, received a final offer, as well as an EOD (Entrance On Duty) date of Sept. 30, according to the application portal. The application listed my medical screening and background check as complete, despite me never filling out paperwork for either. Perhaps, had I pressed “Accept” and moved on with the process, they would have caught the glitch, performed the background check, and demanded those papers. But according to ICE’s own application portal, I was offered a job. (I asked ICE’s media department about all of this before publishing my article, but they did not respond.)

I took a screengrab video of my application status on the ICE portal as of Oct. 3, which you can view below.

There’s a lot going on here, so let’s break it down. The dashboard at the beginning of this video provides an overview of my application process for the position of deportation officer. My tentative offer is marked “Sent,” which—as the mouseover demonstrates—means that I did not acknowledge or accept the offer. The Pre-Employment activities section is marked TBD, which makes sense, since I did not complete any of the pre-employment paperwork. And yet, my final offer status reads “accepted” which, according to the mouseover, means “you accepted the Final Offer and your Entry On Duty date (EOD) date has been set.” And indeed, my onboarding status is EOD: “Your EOD has occurred. Welcome to ICE!”

The point here is that the video of ICE’s own portal confirms my story: The agency offered me a job and gave me a start date without, by its own admission, meeting its own standards for vetting.

Later on, you can see the pre-employment part of the portal that claims my medical and background checks are already complete. If this background check occurred without my participation or knowledge, it missed some massive red flags. I did not mention this in the original article, but Jedeed is a Syrian name: My father immigrated in the 1970s. This fact delayed my military clearance by several months back in 2005. Why, if this background check really happened, did no one think to ask about a possible connection to Syria this time around?

I uploaded the video to X in response to DHS’ “lazy lie” accusation, along with the text “You sure about that?” Seven million impressions, over 100,000 likes, and zero response from the Department of Homeland Security. To be fair, they have their hands full right now; they are very busy brutalizing and detaining people as they attempt to go to doctor’s appointments, throwing flash-bang grenades into cars full of children, and terrorizing the residents of a major American city.

DHS’ response is noteworthy because it comes at a moment when the department is demanding the public’s trust. It’s demanding that we believe that the ICE officer who killed Renee Good was in danger (despite contradictory video evidence), and that he left the event badly injured. More broadly, it’s demanding we believe that ICE agents are doing their work under siege, and that they’re the victims of agression—rather than the perpetrators of it. There are already plenty of reason to be deeply skeptical of any and all of that, but add this to the list: If DHS will lie so brazenly about this story, why would we believe anything else the department’s mouthpieces have to say?

Which brings me to the larger point of Tuesday’s article. We are not simply dealing with a broken hiring system or a lack of training within ICE’s ranks. This sloppy application process, and the DHS’ apathetic, angry response, are just two symptoms of a systemic disregard for the lives and safety of American residents—citizens and noncitizens alike.

The presence of an armed, masked, and improperly vetted force with no oversight and “absolute immunity” (not in a legal sense, but in the sense that the Trump administration’s DOJ will not prosecute them) should concern everyone in the country. What we are dealing with, in Minneapolis and across this nation, is an emergency—and no amount of DHS propaganda can make it go away.

President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act on Thursday to quell protests against the federal occupation of the Twin Cities, a move that would allow him to send in the military over Minnesota’s opposition. Masked immigration officers are currently rampaging through Minneapolis and St. Paul, brutalizing protesters and arresting individuals on the basis of race, drawing widespread opposition from local leaders and communities. The president evidently believes that he can wield the Insurrection Act to suppress their First Amendment rights and impose a kind of military rule on the streets.

But what exactly is this law—and why hasn’t Trump deployed it already? To explain what the Insurrection Act truly authorizes and the risks that come with invoking it, Mark Joseph Stern spoke with Georgetown Law professor Steve Vladeck on this week’s episode of Amicus. Vladeck is an expert on military law and author of the One First Substack. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mark Joseph Stern: Let’s start with the absolute basics: What is the Insurrection Act?

Steve Vladeck: The Insurrection Act is the common—if misleading—name that we’ve given to a series of statutes that trace all the way back to 1792. These statutes carry into force Congress’ constitutional power to provide for the “calling forth of the militia”—and then later, the military—to suppress insurrection, to repel invasion, or “execute the laws of the Union.” The idea was that Congress should be able to allow the president, in very narrow but important circumstances, to use military force as a backup when civilian order and civilian law enforcement has broken down.

So the idea was that it would be used in narrow circumstances, but the language is actually fairly broad. How have presidents invoked it in the past? It seems like, for the most part, they’ve actually been pretty restrained and not used it the way Trump wants to use it.

The history of the Insurrection Act is of pretty responsible usage of a statute that could be interpreted, in a vacuum, as a remarkably broad delegation of power to the president. We’ve had somewhere around 30 invocations of the statute across American history. But the last one was 34 years ago when President George H.W. Bush used it to help send troops in during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.

Although those 30 invocations might have been politically controversial in some cases, they weren’t legally controversial. When President Kennedy sent troops into Mississippi in 1962 to protect James Meredith and the 300 law enforcement officers who were there with him, that was politically controversial because the South didn’t want them. It was not legally controversial because those guys were at perilous risk of being lynched. And Mississippi’s local and state authorities were not exactly helping. So presidents have been responsible historically; they’ve usually had compelling factual bases for invoking the Insurrection Act. It hasn’t been used as a permanent way to deploy troops into our cities. Even the Justice Department, which is not shy about claiming power for the president, has taken a very narrow view of when they can use it.

It sounds like you don’t think that the protests in the Twin Cities right now actually give Trump legitimate grounds to invoke the Insurrection Act.

I don’t think it’s even close. But there is a problem of folks coming to this history fresh, who don’t know the backstory or the historical pedigree here. Because you could read the statute and say: If I squint a little, one protester throwing a rock at an ICE officer is impeding law enforcement. But the Insurrection Act is not about private conduct. It is really about circumstances where the states themselves are unwilling or unable to enforce their laws, or where they’re specifically thwarting federal law enforcement.

Every time the Trump administration points to an example of something bad happening to an ICE officer, the culprits are protesters, not state officials. President Trump can mouth off about the mayor and the governor, but he doesn’t have any specific examples of policies or episodes where state and local governments have been the reasons why ICE has been impeded. If it were otherwise—if one person doing one thing to impede an ICE officer from carrying out their duties was sufficient to justify an invocation of the Insurrection Act—then all protests would trigger the Insurrection Act. And that’s not how we’ve ever understood the Insurrection Act. It would not make any sense with First Amendment values.

Why hasn’t Trump invoked the Insurrection Act yet?

I think there are two reasons. One is political and one is legal. The political reason is that there really still are political obstacles to invoking the Insurrection Act. The president would invite blowback, even from some members of the Republican caucus and Congress. Not many, but given how razor-thin the Republicans’ margin is in the House right now, it wouldn’t take that many votes to really upend all of this.

Then the legal part is that the administration will be sued, and there are probably some folks who are wary that the facts, as they currently stand, make it at least somewhat questionable whether they will win that case. As opposed to a scenario where there’s a more visible unprovoked assault on an ICE officer, or a state official who is directly involved in impeding ICE. I think that might be the pretext they’re looking for.

That’s, of course, my next question: If Trump invokes the law, there will be a legal challenge, and it will go to the Supreme Court. What will that challenge look like, and do you really think it’ll have a chance of prevailing at SCOTUS? Is there also a chance that justices could say they just don’t have authority to overrule the commander-in-chief on this?

I don’t think the court will go quite that far. What I worry about more is a ruling that says that the president’s entitled to a whole lot of deference, not that the courts are powerless. I don’t think John Roberts is going to join an opinion that says the court is powerless about anything. But I do worry about the fight over the facts. In the National Guard cases, the lower courts made a series of factual findings that are inconsistent with what the executive branch said was the factual basis for deploying the troops. Do the courts have the power to do that? That will be the fight.

This is why I think the facts actually are going to matter. If and when the president invokes the Insurrection Act, will there be more of a factual basis than there is here on Friday morning? Does the district court make factual findings that are actually well-supported by the record and would be difficult for the Supreme Court to run away from? The devil’s going to be in the details.

It sounds like you think six of the justices really don’t want to call Donald Trump a liar. But to block the use of the Insurrection Act in the Twin Cities, the Supreme Court would probably have to say that Trump, executive branch officials, and law enforcement officers are not telling the truth. And the court is clearly hesitant to do that.

I could also imagine a universe in which even the factual claims made by the Trump administration, taken at face value, could be held insufficient. The only way the Supreme Court could rule against Trump without second-guessing him is an opinion that says: Even assuming all this is true, that’s still not enough for the Insurrection Act. I have no faith that Justices Kavanaugh, Thomas, Alito, or Gorsuch would join such an opinion. So we’re back to where we are so often in these cases, which is: Where are the chief and Justice Barrett?

I don’t know. I’m heartened about what happened in the National Guard case, which is a sign that they do not just reflexively rule for the Trump administration. But it’s going to depend on just how divorced from reality the administration’s factual arguments are. This is why I think they’ve been waiting for something more than the Renee Good incident, for something more than a couple of suspects resisting an ICE arrest. I think they’re waiting for something that they can pitch plausibly as a completely unprovoked act of violence, or interference by a local or state law enforcement officer.

People often say that Trump does whatever he wants and doesn’t listen to his lawyers, but I don’t think that’s true when it comes to stuff that could reach the Supreme Court. I think he is very cautious when dealing with any issue that’s going to go to the justices.

One hundred percent. There’s a reason why they haven’t invoked the Insurrection Act as we’re sitting here today.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/01/18/nvidia_fp64_emulation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Double precision floating point computation (aka FP64) is what keeps modern aircraft in the sky, rockets going up, vaccines effective, and, yes, nuclear weapons operational. But rather than building dedicated chips that process this essential data type in hardware, Nvidia is leaning on emulation to increase performance for HPC and scientific computing applications, an area where AMD has had the lead in recent generations.

This emulation, we should note, hasn&#39;t replaced hardware FP64 in Nvidia&#39;s GPUs. Nvidia&#39;s newly unveiled Rubin GPUs still deliver about 33 teraFLOPS of peak FP64 performance, but that&#39;s actually one teraFLOP less than the now four-year-old H100.

If you switch on software emulation in Nvidia&#39;s CUDA libraries, the chip can purportedly achieve up to 200 teraFLOPS of FP64 matrix performance. That&#39;s 4.4x of what its outgoing Blackwell accelerators could muster in hardware.

On paper, Rubin isn&#39;t just Nvidia&#39;s most powerful AI accelerator ever, but it&#39;s the most potent GPU for scientific computing in years.

&quot;What we found is, through many studies with partners and with our own internal investigations, is that the accuracy that we get from emulation is at least as good as what we would get out of a tensor core piece of hardware,&quot; Dan Ernst, senior director of supercomputing products at Nvidia, told El Reg.

Emulated FP64, which is not exclusive to Nvidia, has the potential to dramatically improve the throughput and efficiency of modern GPUs. But not everyone is convinced.

&quot;It&#39;s quite good in some of the benchmarks, it&#39;s not obvious it&#39;s good in real, physical scientific simulations,&quot; Nicholas Malaya, an AMD fellow, told us. He argued that, while FP64 emulation certainly warrants further research and experimentation, it&#39;s not quite ready for prime time.

Even as chip designs push for ever lower-precision data types, FP64 remains the gold standard for scientific computing for good reason. FP64 is unmatched in its dynamic range, capable of expressing more than 18.44 quintillion (264) unique values.

To put that in perspective,-modern AI models like DeepSeek R1 are commonly trained at FP8, which can express a paltry 256 unique values. Taking advantage of general homogeneity of neural networks, block-floating-point data types like MXFP8 or MXFP4 can be used to expand their dynamic range.

That&#39;s fine for the fuzzy math that defines large language models, but it&#39;s no replacement for FP64, particularly when it&#39;s the difference between life or death.

Unlike AI workloads, which are highly error-tolerant, HPC simulations rely on fundamental physical principles like conservation of mass and energy. &quot;As soon as you start incurring errors, these finite errors propagate, and they cause things like blow ups,&quot; Malaya said.

The idea of using lower-precision, often integer datatypes, to emulate FP64 isn&#39;t a new idea. &quot;Emulation is old as dirt,&quot; Ernst said. &quot;We had emulation in the mid &#39;50s before we had hardware for floating point.&quot;

This process required significantly more operations to complete, and often incurred a stiff performance penalty as a result, but enabled floating point mathematics even when hardware lacked a dedicated floating point unit (FPU).

By the 1980s, FPUs were becoming commonplace and the need for emulation largely disappeared. However, in early 2024, researchers at the Tokyo and Shibaura institutes of technology published a paper reviving the concept by showing that FP64 matrix operations could be decomposed into multiple INT8 operations that, when run on Nvidia&#39;s tensor cores, achieved higher-than-native performance.

This approach is commonly referred to as the Ozaki scheme, and it&#39;s the foundation for Nvidia&#39;s own FP64 emulation libraries, which were released late last year. And, as Ernst was quick to point out, &quot;it&#39;s still FP64. It&#39;s not mixed precision. It&#39;s just done and constructed in a different way from the hardware perspective.&quot;

Modern GPUs are packed with low-precision tensor cores. Even without the fancy adaptive compression found in Rubin&#39;s tensor cores, the chips are capable of 35 petaFLOPS of dense FP4 compute. By comparison, at FP64, the chips are more than 1,000x slower.

These low-precision tensor cores are really efficient to build and run, so the question became why not use them to do FP64, Ernst explained. &quot;We have the hardware, let&#39;s try use it. That&#39;s the history of supercomputing.&quot;

While Nvidia is keen to highlight the capabilities FP64 emulation enables on its Rubin and even its older Blackwell GPUs, rival AMD doesn&#39;t believe the approach is quite ready.

According to Malaya, FP64 emulation works best for well-conditioned numerical systems, with the High Performance Linpack (HPL) bench being a prime example. &quot;But when you look at material science, combustion codes, banded linear algebra systems, things like that, they are much less well conditioned systems, and suddenly it starts to break down,&quot; he said.

In other words, whether or not FP64 emulation makes sense actually depends on the application in question. For some it&#39;s fine, while in others it&#39;s not.

One of the major sticking points for AMD is that FP64 emulation isn&#39;t exactly IEEE compliant. Nvidia&#39;s algorithms don&#39;t account for things like positive versus negative zeros, not number errors, or infinite number errors.

Because of this, small errors in the intermediary operations used to emulate the higher precision can result in perturbations that can throw off the final result, Malaya explained.

One way around this is to increase the number of operations used. However, at a certain point, the sheer number of operations required outweighs any advantage emulation might have provided.

All of those operations also take up memory. &quot;We have data that shows you&#39;re using about twice the memory capacity in Ozaki to emulate that FP64 matrices,&quot; Malaya said.

For these reasons, the House of Zen is focusing its attention on specialized hardware for applications that rely on double and single precision. Its upcoming MI430X takes advantage of AMD&#39;s chiplet architecture to bolster double and single precision hardware performance.

The challenges facing FP64 emulation algorithms like the Ozaki scheme aren&#39;t lost on Ernst, who is well aware of the gaps in Nvidia&#39;s implementation.

Ernst contended that, for most HPC practitioners, things like positive negative zeroes aren&#39;t that big a deal. Meanwhile, Nvidia has developed supplemental algorithms to detect and mitigate issues like non-numbers, infinite numbers, and inefficient emulation operations.

As for memory consumption, Ernst conceded that it can be a bit higher but emphasized that this overhead is relative to the operation not the application itself. Most of the time, he said, we&#39;re talking about matrices that are at most a few gigabytes in size.

So while it&#39;s true that FP64 emulation isn&#39;t IEEE-compliant, whether this actually matters is heavily dependent on the application in question, Ernst argued. &quot;Most of the use cases where IEEE compliance ordering rules are in play don&#39;t come up in matrix, matrix multiplication cases. There&#39;s not a DGEMM that tends to actually follow that rule anyway,&quot; he said.

Even if Nvidia can overcome the potential pitfalls of FP64 emulation, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the method is only useful for a subset of HPC applications that rely on dense general matrix multiply (DGEMM) operations.

According to Malaya, for somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of HPC workloads, emulation offers little to no benefit.

&quot;In our analysis the vast majority of real HPC workloads rely on vector FMA, not DGEMM,&quot; he said. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a tiny fraction of the market, but it&#39;s actually a niche piece.&quot;

For vector-heavy workloads, like computational fluid dynamics, Nvidia&#39;s Rubin GPUs are forced to run on the slower FP64 vector accelerators in the chip&#39;s CUDA cores.

However, as Ernst was quick to point out: more FLOPS doesn&#39;t always mean useful FLOPS. The same workloads that tend to run on the FP64 vector engines rarely manage to harness more than a fraction of the chip&#39;s theoretical performance, all because the memory can&#39;t keep up.

We see this quite clearly on the TOP500&#39;s vector-heavy High Performance Conjugate Gradient benchmark where CPUs tend to dominate thanks to the higher ratio of bits per FLOPS afforded by their memory subsystems.

Rubin may not deliver the fastest FP64 vector perf, but with 22 TB/s of HBM4 its real world performance in these workloads, it is likely to be much higher than the spec sheet would suggest.

With an influx of new supercomputers powered by Nvidia&#39;s Blackwell and Rubin GPUs coming online over the next few years, any questions regarding the viability of FP64 emulation will be put to the test sooner rather than later.

And since this emulation isn&#39;t tied to specific hardware, there&#39;s the potential for the algorithms to improve over time as researchers uncover scenarios where the technique excels or struggles.

Despite Malaya&#39;s concerns, he noted that AMD is also investigating the use of FP64 emulation on chips like the MI355X, through software flags, to see where it may be appropriate.

IEEE compliance, he told us, would go a long way towards validating the approach by ensuring that the results you get from emulation are the same as what you&#39;d get from dedicated silicon.

&quot;If I can go to a partner and say run these two binaries: this one gives you the same answer as the other and is faster, and yeah under the hood we&#39;re doing some scheme — think that&#39;s a compelling argument that is ready for prime time,&quot; Malaya said.

It may turn out that, for some applications, emulation is more reliable than others, he noted. &quot;We should, as a community, build a basket of apps to look at. I think that&#39;s the way to progress here.&quot; ®

            <div id="article-text">The splendidly-named &quot;OpenSlopware&quot; was, for a short time, a list of open source projects using LLM bots. Due to harassment, it&#39;s gone, but forks of it live on.

&quot;OpenSlopware&quot; was a repository on the European Codeberg git forge containing a list of free software and open source projects which use LLM-bot generated code, or integrate LLMs, or which show signs of &quot;coding assistants&quot; being used on the codebase, such as pull requests created or modified by automated coding tools.

However, its creator – who we are intentionally not naming or tagging here – received so much harassment from LLM boosters that they removed the repository, and indeed their Bluesky account, stating that they would withdraw from social media for a while. Now, if you try to visit the original URL, you will receive only a 404 message.

All is not lost, though. Although it contained human-readable text, it was a Git repository, and so it was possible to fork it – clone its contents into another different repository. Several people did so before the original OpenSlopware creator deleted it again, such as this Small-Hack version, also on Codeberg. The Register has contacted the maintainer of this fork and asked if they&#39;d talk to us about it, but so far, they say they&#39;re still thinking about it. Others were planning to maintain copies but have decided to join forces with this one.

Notably, this is despite some people involved in the original apologizing for their involvement and saying it should not be revived.

This is one of a growing number of sites, groups, and communities, which exist to criticize the growing use and promotion of LLM bots and their output, for which the word &quot;slop&quot; is becoming the standard term. Some merely spell out their criticism, such as this open letter to those who fired or didn&#39;t hire tech writers because of AI. Others go further, and name and shame those responsible. For instance, we recently saw this blog post &quot;Authors&quot; using AI slop in their books: a small list.

One example is the AntiAI subreddit, but there is also a Lemmy instance devoted to it, called Awful.systems. (For those unfamiliar with it, Lemmy is a tool for creating news aggregator and discussion sites – think Reddit or the recently revived, but LLM-infested, Digg – based around the same ActivityPub protocols used by Mastodon and the rest of the Fediverse.)

One of the Awful.systems site admins is Unix sysadmin and former Wikipedia press officer David Gerard, who formerly took an ultra-skeptical view of the cryptocurrency world on Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain (which also inspired a book and a sequel. He now publishes an equally skeptical blog on the subject of the LLM bot industry, Pivot to AI. In an post on the Lemmy instance as well as on his Mastodon feed, he says that Awful.systems also plans to curate and maintain a list along the lines of OpenSlopware – but they&#39;re looking for a comparably-catchy name.

Those still on the fence about the merits of LLM bots and their output may be surprised by the levels of vitriol this inspires, but it is one of the most contentious aspects of the entire computing world today.

In its section Why not LLMs?, the OpenSlopware continuation mentions the copyright and licensing implications, and continues to cite a Wikipedia article detailing the Environmental impact of artificial intelligence.

These are legitimate concerns, but there are many more. As The Reg reported back in July, in the only test of its kind that we know of, the LLM-promoting site Model Evaluation & Threat Research found that although using coding assistants made programmers think that they were working faster, the truth is that debugging the bots&#39; code slowed the humans down by as much as they thought it sped up the process. The implications of this for code quality are obvious. What long-term use does to programmers&#39; analytical faculties is as yet unmeasured, but the effects on social media look frankly terrifying. Its effects on hiring looked dire early last year, and even as companies rehire those laid off, they are paid less afterwards. Claimed productivity gains are nowhere to be seen.

Along with objective, verifiable measurements, such as performance testing of people and code alike, open criticism is needed – no matter how much it upsets some of those being criticized. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Hundreds of millions of wireless earbuds, headphones, and speakers are vulnerable to silent hijacking due to a flaw in Google&#39;s Fast Pair system that allows attackers to seize control without the owner ever touching the pairing button.

The issue, dubbed &quot;WhisperPair,&quot; was uncovered by researchers at KU Leuven, who found that many Bluetooth accessories claiming support for Fast Pair fail to properly enforce one of its most basic safety checks. Based on Fast Pair&#39;s uptake, the team says the flaw likely affects &quot;hundreds of millions&quot; of accessories already in circulation.

In theory, Fast Pair devices are supposed to accept new pairing requests only when the user explicitly places them in pairing mode. In practice, the researchers say, many products will happily accept a new connection request at any time.

That creates an opening for attackers within Bluetooth range to step in and pair their own device, even if the accessory is already in use by someone else.

Once paired, the attacker gets the same level of access as a legitimate owner. Depending on the device, that can mean injecting or interrupting audio, manipulating volume, or, in some cases, activating the microphone. It is the sort of pesky thing that does not require nation-state resources or exotic hardware; a nearby phone or laptop is more than enough.

The researchers stress the problem is not Bluetooth itself, but sloppy or incomplete implementations of Google&#39;s Fast Pair specification by device makers. Fast Pair was designed to make connecting accessories to Android devices nearly frictionless, using Bluetooth Low Energy beacons and cloud lookups to speed things along. That convenience has come at the cost of enforcement on the accessory side, where vendors are expected to check whether pairing should even be allowed in the first place.

What&#39;s more, some Fast Pair accessories integrate with Google&#39;s Find My Device network, allowing lost earbuds or headphones to be located using nearby Android phones. If an attacker can pair with an accessory before its rightful owner does, they can potentially register it to their account and receive location updates as it moves around.

Google was alerted to the issue and says it has been working with manufacturers on fixes. Some patches are now trickling out as firmware updates, though coverage is patchy, and plenty of cheaper accessories either don&#39;t get updates at all or rely on clunky vendor apps most users never open.

Tweaking settings on your phone, or switching Fast Pair off entirely, doesn&#39;t solve much if the accessory itself is still happy to accept rogue pairing requests.

The WhisperPair team reported the bug privately last year and sat on the details while vendors were given time to respond, picking up a bug bounty along the way. Their findings are a good example of a recurring problem in the smart device world: security rules that look fine on paper can unravel quickly once they&#39;re handed to dozens of manufacturers racing to ship cheap hardware. ®

            <div id="article-text">Bork!Bork!Bork! UK water company Severn Trent learned an unfortunate lesson about text-to-speech systems when a robocall to customers went hilariously wrong.

A Reg reader received an automated call warning of potential water discoloration during planned works from January 19-25. The message advised running taps for twenty minutes if the water appeared discolored - standard stuff, if a bit robotic.

In the recording forwarded to us, a female voice told our reader what to expect. All good, if a little robotic.

However, things went off the rails a bit when the robot attempted to read out the URL for Severn Trent: http://www.stwater.co.uk/discolouration.

For anyone concerned, the URL redirects to a secure connection.

The robot took a run at it, but the result was unlikely to be what the water company wanted. We imagine Severn Trent was hoping for &quot;S T Water,&quot; but instead got &quot;S Twatter.&quot;

Text-to-speech blunders are nothing new. This writer has fond memories of home computers with primitive speech synthesizers producing similar gaffes to the horror of listening parents, and later validating Interactive Voice Response Systems (IVRS) to spare customers confusion and embarrassment.

Decades later, and in an era where Artificial Intelligence should be able to navigate linguistic landmines, it&#39;s almost reassuring that blindly feeding text into a system without human verification can still produce unintended results.

Unless Severn Trent, a UK water company, is about to undergo a rebrand, and the robot has inadvertently blabbed. Calling yourself S Twatter, however, would be a very brave move, particularly in the UK.

Someone should probably add a quality check to that robocall system. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI&#39;s budget ChatGPT Go subscription tier has migrated to the US, soon to be accompanied by advertising. The company&#39;s free tier will be similarly afflicted.

ChatGPT Go, the company&#39;s cheapest paid offering, has been an option in 171 countries since August and is now available stateside for $8 per month.

&quot;In the coming weeks, we&#39;re also planning to start testing ads in the US for the free and Go tiers, so more people can benefit from our tools with fewer usage limits or without having to pay,&quot; said Fidji Simo, OpenAI&#39;s CEO of applications. &quot;Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise subscriptions will not include ads.&quot;

About 5 percent, or 35 million, of ChatGPT&#39;s weekly active user base as of July 2025 paid for Plus ($20/month) or Pro ($200/month) subscriptions, according to The Information. The company reportedly projects that by 2030 about 8.5 percent of a weekly active user base of roughly 2.6 billion - around 220 million people - will pay for a Plus subscription. With so many non-paying customers, ads may be its only route to financial survival. (That or a government bailout, which the company says won&#39;t happen.)

OpenAI has reportedly committed to spend more than $1 trillion to fuel its quest for the vaguely defined idea of &quot;artificial general intelligence.&quot; The AI giant lost north of $11.5 billion in the third quarter alone, according to numbers Microsoft – a large OpenAI investor – disclosed in its financial filings.

Meanwhile, online advertising is a massive business, contributing more than $74 billion to Google&#39;s revenues and more than $50 billion to Meta&#39;s revenues in the third quarter of 2025 alone. And chatbots like ChatGPT are technically capable of capturing a massive amount of extremely personal data, given that people use them for everything from vibe coding to online companionship to informal therapy.

Simo acknowledged the need to preserve people&#39;s trust in ChatGPT – to the extent that people trust LLMs known for making things up and getting things wrong – and made a number of vague commitments to offer reassurance that their artificial intelligence agent wouldn&#39;t become a mercenary sales agent.

This included a reiteration of the claim that the company&#39;s pursuit of advertising aligns with its mission to ensure AGI – a moving target based on some determination of human intellectual equivalency – &quot;benefits all of humanity.&quot;

Ads, Simo promised, will not influence the answers provided by ChatGPT, will be &quot;optimized based on what&#39;s most helpful to you,&quot; as Simo put it, and will be distinct and clearly labelled.

ChatGPT users under 18, and queries about sensitive topics like health or politics, will be spared from ads, or so it&#39;s claimed.

&quot;We keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers, and we never sell your data to advertisers,&quot; Simo said, adding that users will have the ability to control how their data is used and to disable personalization.

&quot;Selling data&quot; can mean different things in different contexts, but may be disallowed if consent is lacking, depending on the relevant privacy rules. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), it can mean &quot;selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer&#39;s personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.&quot;

Google and Meta have both insisted they don&#39;t sell personal data, but they certainly use it to target their own ads, and their decades of privacy missteps attest to the relevance of those claims.

Miranda Bogen, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology&#39;s AI Governance Lab, argues that even in the absence of data sharing, ad targeting can harm privacy. OpenAI&#39;s shift toward advertising presents risks for the company and its customers, she said.

&quot;Even if AI platforms don&#39;t share data directly with advertisers, business models based on targeted advertising put really dangerous incentives in place when it comes to user privacy,&quot; said Bogen in an emailed statement. &quot;This decision raises real questions about how business models will shape AI in the long run.&quot;

Bogen said that people use chatbots for a variety of reasons, including as companions and advisors. She argues that when tools try to exploit trust to sell goods, that may be problematic.

&quot;AI companies should be extremely careful not to repeat the many mistakes that have been made — and harms that have resulted from — the adoption of personalized ads on social media and around the web,&quot; she said.

Meta has integrated AI into its advertising business and uses AI-generated images in ads. But efforts by chatbot maker Perplexity to present ads in conjunction with its AI search service have fallen flat. Perplexity paused accepting new ad clients in October last year, following the departure of its head of advertising.

Lower-tier ChatGPT users who haven&#39;t bought their way out of advertising may still have some say in whether they see ads. Several makers of ad blocking applications and extensions already claim their tools can block ads that appear in ChatGPT. That may hold true when ChatGPT is accessed from the browser but is likely to be less feasible in OpenAI&#39;s native desktop apps. The possibilities will become clearer once OpenAI starts serving ads. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The Trump administration says it wants big tech companies to take more accountability for the power their datacenters consume in an effort to shield voters from higher power bills at home.

On Friday, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and US Interior Secretary (and former Microsoft exec) Doug Burgum met with mid-Atlantic governors to pressure PJM Interconnection - one of the largest grid operators in the country - to hold an emergency auction to address rising energy demand from AI datacenter developments to the tune of $15 billion.

PJM is home to the largest concentration of datacenters in the US. Many new bit barns now exceed 100 megawatts of power capacity, with the likes of OpenAI and Meta already eyeing multi-gigawatt campuses.

These buildouts have sparked fears of higher power bills for local residents, something that hasn&#39;t sat well with politicians on either side of the aisle.

Last month, a trio of Democratic senators launched a probe into why consumers were seeing higher rates despite datacenter operators&#39; claims otherwise.

Rising energy prices haven&#39;t been popular with the US president either. On Monday, Trump used his personal echo chamber Truth Social to declare &quot;I never want Americans to pay higher electricity bills because of datacenters.&quot;

The initiative launched on Friday seeks to secure new baseload power generation, with US tech titans putting up the cash for 15-year contracts.

The DoE argues such an auction is justified after PJM&#39;s decision to take 17 gigawatts of capacity offline between 2020 and 2025. Much of the capacity which was already retired or slated for retirement was produced by coal-fired steam generators, for which Trump has shown a particular affinity.

&quot;In the coming years, America&#39;s reindustrialization and the AI race will require a significantly larger supply of around-the-clock, reliable, and uninterrupted power,&quot; an Energy.gov fact sheet reads. &quot;The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas.&quot;

In response to the Trump administration&#39;s demands, PJM&#39;s board of managers released a plan Friday directing the grid operator&#39;s staff to &quot;develop a proposal to both accelerate and execute&quot; a backstop procurement to supplement the company&#39;s last capacity auction.

The idea of datacenters bringing their own power has gained momentum in recent months, as operators have grappled with both long-term and immediate energy demands.

These efforts have included commissioning new gas generator plants along with portable generators to serve as stopgaps. Meanwhile, hyperscalers have placed bets on nuclear power startups like Oklo or X-Energy to satisfy their long-term power demands.

In a blog post on Tuesday, Microsoft formalized its commitments to &quot;pay its way&quot; to ensure local utility customers didn&#39;t end up footing the bill.

In spite of these initiatives, supply chain challenges continue to dog operators. Gas generators offer an easy path to addressing demand, but the equipment necessary to build and deploy them is locked up, with waitlists stretching out to 2030.

Meanwhile, even the most optimistic forecasts won&#39;t see the first commercial small modular reactors come online until the end of the decade.

Having said that, Microsoft has had some luck backing efforts to restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1 reactor. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s the one that didn&#39;t partially melt down in the late &#39;70s. The reactor is set to resume operations later next year. ®

            <div id="article-text">The powerful exchange yanked its support of the Senate CLARITY Act at the last minute — and the rest of the crypto world, from Kraken to a16z, is infuriated.

The powerful exchange yanked its support of the Senate CLARITY Act at the last minute — and the rest of the crypto world, from Kraken to a16z, is infuriated.

January was going to be a landmark month for the crypto industry. The Senate would start negotiating the finer details of the CLARITY Act, a major law that would finally enshrine the fundamental structure of how the crypto market could legally operate in the United States: what digital assets counted as a security versus a commodity, what regulatory responsibilities companies had to abide by, what legal protections consumers could have. The House had already passed their version months ago. The White House was ready to sign it. Democrats and Republicans seemed to agree on the bill’s fundamentals.

And crypto, which had spent decades navigating a regulatory gray zone, would finally have a set of rules to work off of — maybe not perfect rules, but hard rules. “[We] don’t want to be in a place where, with the change of every administration, what you can and can’t do with software, or what you can and can’t publish, changes,” Connor Brown, the Head of Strategy for the Bitcoin Policy Institute, told The Verge.

Last Wednesday, just before midnight, everything fell apart.

Hours before the Senate Banking Committee would have convened for markup on Thursday — the period where a group of Republicans and Democrats would negotiate over every single word, clause, and amendment in the hundred-plus draft, to prepare it for a final Senate vote — Coinbase, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, announced that having reviewed the final draft of the bill, they were withdrawing their support for the CLARITY Act altogether.

“We’d rather have no bill than a bad bill,” CEO Brian Armstrong said on X, and later pinned the blame on a third party: the big banks, whose lobbyists had swooped in at the last minute to curb the threat of customers storing their money in crypto wallets instead of savings accounts.

Armstrong had several specific objections, but one hill Coinbase seems prepared to die on: whether crypto owners would be able to earn interest or other rewards off of holding stablecoins, a token whose price was pegged to the value of the US dollar, in the way that consumers could earn interest from money deposited in traditional bank accounts. (Coinbase did not return a request for comment.)

Banking committee chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) immediately cancelled the markup, just a “brief pause” to renegotiate. Lobbyists began calling around and analysts began dissecting the draft. But notably, the vast majority of crypto’s biggest players, from exchanges to investors, publicly announced that they would support the Senate bill, and implicitly bashed Coinbase for derailing its passage.

“Reasonable people can disagree on specific provisions. That is precisely why the final stage of this process matters,” Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi said on Thursday, reaffirming his support of the CLARITY Act. “The right response to outstanding issues is to resolve them not to abandon years of bipartisan progress and start over from scratch.” His sentiment was shared by a16z managing partner Chris Dixon, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and even David Sacks, the powerful White House special advisor on AI and Crypto, who urged Coinbase to “resolve any remaining differences” before the end of the month.

While the rest of the industry is willing to deal with the problems Armstrong pointed out in exchange for having a law, Coinbase — a publicly-traded company that offers yield-bearing stablecoin accounts — would suffer the most if the interest issue remains intact. But there is a real deadline to lock in any sort of meaningful crypto legislation, and it starts the moment that members of Congress begin running for re-election.

Midterm elections are generally guaranteed to kill any incentive for bipartisan consensus, but especially so in this cycle, where elected officials will have to face furious constituents who might see support of CLARITY as a proxy for supporting Trump. It doesn’t help that the Senate Republicans are trying to box out a Democrat-written provision that would prevent Trump from profiting off of crypto assets. Campaigns start in March, and the Senate is not in session next week, giving them less than a month to hammer out any issues before switching to campaign mode.

That is an exceedingly short amount of time for the Banking Committee to renegotiate new language, mark up that bill, send it to the Senate Agriculture Committee (which is responsible for regulating commodities), and negotiate even further before it even hits the Senate floor for a full vote. And “floor time” — when the Senate can summon all 100 members to vote for a bill in person — is an increasingly rare commodity before the election season. (Most of it will likely be burned on averting yet another government shutdown.)

Punting the bill to next year isn’t a safe option, either. It’s widely expected that the Republicans will lose either the House or the Senate, giving Democrats the means to block CLARITY’s passage for whatever reason they cite. And while the current president might be a steadfast ally to the crypto industry, there’s no telling who will come after him, much less how they’d feel about crypto.

“Will we ever have a setup as favorable as we do right now? Hard to imagine,” Seth Hertlein, the global head of policy at Ledger. “Could it happen? Sure, maybe, nobody knows. But there’s definitely a sense that if we don’t get it done now, either it’s not going to happen, or it will happen on much less favorable terms.”

In the meantime, however, DC policymakers are frustrated that Coinbase reopened a debate that had seemingly been settled last year: the House had already spent years writing and negotiating a crypto market structure bill, which passed last August with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. In the defense of Coinbase, the Senate’s version now had to contend with the demands of the finance industry, which had not initially weighed in on crypto market structure until late last year, as well as the progressive Democrat Senators on the committee. And, of course, the Senate had insisted on writing its own version of the bill instead of working off the House’s version.

“The Senate is where House bills go to die,” said Hertlein. “That’s a common Washington bubble joke.”

            <div id="article-text">This is The Stepback, a weekly newsletter breaking down one essential story from the tech world. For more on dystopian developments in AI, follow Hayden Field. The Stepback arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for The Stepback here.

You could say it all started with Elon Musk’s AI FOMO — and his crusade against “wokeness.” When his AI company, xAI, announced Grok in November 2023, it was described as a chatbot with “a rebellious streak” and the ability to “answer spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.” The chatbot debuted after a few months of development and just two months of training, and the announcement highlighted that Grok would have real-time knowledge of the X platform.

But there are inherent risks to a chatbot having both the run of the internet and X, and it’s safe to say xAI may not have taken the necessary steps to address them. Since Musk took over Twitter in 2022 and renamed it X, he laid off 30% of its global trust and safety staff and cut its number of safety engineers by 80%, Australia’s online safety watchdog said last January. As for xAI, when Grok was released, it was unclear whether xAI had a safety team already in place. When Grok 4 was released in July, it took more than a month for the company to release a model card — a practice typically seen as an industry standard, which details safety tests and potential concerns. Two weeks after Grok 4’s release, an xAI employee wrote on X that he was hiring for xAI’s safety team and that they “urgently need strong engineers/researchers.” In response to a commenter, who asked, “xAI does safety?” the original employee said xAI was “working on it.”

Journalist Kat Tenbarge wrote about how she first started seeing sexually explicit deepfakes go viral on Grok in June 2023. Those images obviously weren’t created by Grok — it didn’t even have the ability to generate images until August 2024 — but X’s response to the concerns was varied. Even last January, Grok was inciting controversy for AI-generated images. And this past August, Grok’s “spicy” video-generation mode created nude deepfakes of Taylor Swift without even being asked. Experts have told The Verge since September that the company takes a whack-a-mole approach to safety and guardrails — and that it’s difficult enough to keep an AI system on the straight and narrow when you design it with safety in mind from the beginning, let alone if you’re going back to fix baked-in problems. Now, it seems that approach has blown up in xAI’s face.

Grok has spent the last couple of weeks spreading nonconsensual, sexualized deepfakes of adults and minors all over the platform, as promoted. Screenshots show Grok complying with users asking it to replace women’s clothing with lingerie and make them spread their legs, as well as to put small children in bikinis. And there are even more egregious reports. It’s gotten so bad that during a 24-hour analysis of Grok-created images on X, one estimate gauged the chatbot to be generating about 6,700 sexually suggestive or “nudifying” images per hour. Part of the reason for the onslaught is a recent feature added to Grok, allowing users to use an “edit” button to ask the chatbot to change images, without the original poster’s consent.

Since then, we’ve seen a handful of countries either investigate the matter or threaten to ban X altogether. Members of the French government promised an investigation, as did the Indian IT ministry, and a Malaysian government commission wrote a letter about its concerns. California governor Gavin Newsom called on the US Attorney General to investigate xAI. The United Kingdom said it is planning to pass a law banning the creation of AI-generated nonconsensual, sexualized images, and the country’s communications-industry regulator said it would investigate both X and the images that had been generated in order to see if they violated its Online Safety Act. And this week, both Malaysia and Indonesia blocked access to Grok.

xAI initially said its goal for Grok was to “assist humanity in its quest for understanding and knowledge,” “maximally benefit all of humanity,” and “empower our users with our AI tools, subject to the law,” as well as to “serve as a powerful research assistant for anyone.” That’s a far cry from generating nude-adjacent deepfakes of women without their consent, let alone minors.

On Wednesday evening, as pressure on the company heightened, X’s Safety account put out a statement that the platform has “implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,” and that the restriction “applies to all users, including paid subscribers.” On top of that, only paid subscribers can use Grok to create or edit any sort of image moving forward, according to X. The statement went on to say that X “now geoblock[s] the ability of all users to generate images of real people in bikinis, underwear, and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it’s illegal,” which was a strange point to make since earlier in the statement, the company said it was not allowing anyone to use Grok to edit images in such a way.

Another important point: My colleagues tested Grok’s image-generation restrictions on Wednesday to find that it took less than a minute to get around most guardrails. Although asking the chatbot to “put her in a bikini” or “remove her clothes” produced censored results, they found, it had no qualms about delivering on prompts like “show me her cleavage,” “make her breasts bigger,” and “put her in a crop top and low-rise shorts,” as well as generating images in lingerie and sexualized poses. As of Wednesday evening, we were still able to get the Grok app to generate revealing images of people, using a free account.

Even after X’s Wednesday statement, we may see a number of other countries either ban or block access to either all of X or just Grok, at least temporarily. We’ll also see how the proposed laws and investigations around the world play out. The pressure is mounting for Musk, who on Wednesday afternoon took to X to say that he is “not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok.” Hours later, X’s Safety team put out its statement, saying it’s “working around the clock to add additional safeguards, take swift and decisive action to remove violating and illegal content, permanently suspend accounts where appropriate, and collaborate with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.”

What technically is and isn’t against the law is a big question here. For instance, experts told The Verge earlier this month that AI-generated images of identifiable minors in bikinis, or potentially even naked, may not technically be illegal under current child sexual abuse material (CSAM) laws in the US, though of course disturbing and unethical. But lascivious images of minors in such situations are against the law. We’ll see if those definitions expand or change, even though the current laws are a bit of a patchwork.

As for nonconsensual intimate deepfakes of adult women, the Take It Down Act, signed into law in May 2025, bars nonconsensual AI-generated “intimate visual depictions” and requires certain platforms to rapidly remove them. The grace period before the latter part goes into effect — requiring platforms to actually remove them — ends in May 2026, so we may see some significant developments in the next six months.

But don’t worry, someone recorded it for posterity.

”Share a Disney quote that sums up how you’re feeling right now!”

That’s what Disney posted on Threads the other day, and people immediately replied with lines from Star Wars, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and even Mary Poppins. The throughline between all the quotes: they were pretty pointedly anti-fascist and clearly aimed at the current administration.

Apparently, Disney either couldn’t handle the anti-fascist messaging of its own movies or was too afraid of pissing off the powers that be, because it quickly deleted the post. Thankfully, one resourceful Threads user recorded it for posterity, reminding us that yes, the human world is, in fact, a mess.

When it does users will lose access to their apps.

Setapp Mobile seemed like one of the many alternative app markets with promise that launched in the wake of the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA). While the law may have forced Apple to allow third-party app stores on its devices, it couldn’t make users actually embrace them. MacPaw, the Ukrainian developer behind the subscription-based Setapp, posted on a support page that it would be sunsetting the service next month and users would lose access to any apps:

Setapp Mobile is scheduled to sunset on February 16, 2026, due to still-evolving and complex business terms that don’t fit Setapp’s current business model.

All Setapp Mobile apps will be removed from the platform on this date. If you’ve used apps via Setapp Mobile, please make sure to transfer your data in advance, as it will no longer be accessible after the sunset.

There are still a few alternative app stores operating in the EU, including AltStore PAL and Epic Games Store. Though, they face a challenging environment where Apple still makes it difficult to install apps via third-party sources. MacPaw CEO, Oleksandr Kosovan told The Verge that:

Setapp Mobile was a bold, breakthrough project that aimed to provide EU iOS users with access to alternative app marketplaces – creating a new app ecosystem where both developers and users could thrive. We are proud of what we have accomplished with it over the past two years and still believe passionately in this vision.

As a result of still-evolving commercial conditions, we have determined that it is not viable to continue development or support for Setapp Mobile within Setapp’s current business model.

While we are disappointed to discontinue Setapp Mobile, we are looking forward to pursuing the development of other innovations. We are excited to focus efforts on various projects that will launch later this year. This includes Eney, a first-of-its-kind AI assistant native to macOS, and new enhancements to Setapp Desktop.

Update January 17th: Added comment from MacPaw’s CEO.

Plus, there’s still time to save on the Beats Fit Pro and Iniu’s dirt-cheap 45W power bank.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.

Happy Saturday, folks! This week, Best Buy kicked off its so-called “Winter Sale,” introducing a whole host of price cuts that range from not-so-good to legitimately great, at least for this time of year. We’ll be publishing many of the highlights in a dedicated news post tomorrow, though, per usual, not all of this week’s best deals revolve around Best Buy. Apple’s M4 Mac Mini, for instance, is receiving a $100 discount at Amazon and B&H Photo, while LG’s 65-inch C5 OLED TV is on sale at eBay for a little over a grand. There are also steep savings to be had on 45W power banks, the Beats Fit Pro, and more, so let’s dive in.

If you want a Mac and your budget is less than $500, your only real option — aside from going the refurbished route or picking up a model that’s several generations old — is Apple’s latest Mac Mini. Thankfully, the desktop machine makes for a truly excellent daily driver, one that’s currently on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage starting at $499 ($100), which is just $20 shy of its Black Friday low and about $30 less than its best price to date.

For most people, the 2024 Mac Mini is a far better (and more economical) choice than the latest Mac Studio. The tiny, M4-powered machine is an excellent value, even at full price, with three Thunderbolt 4 (USB 4) ports, a gigabit ethernet jack, a 3.5mm audio input, and an HDMI port. Its 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU provide fast, consistent performance for a wide range of tasks; however, keep in mind that you’ll need to bring your own display, keyboard, and mouse.

Last year, we saw a spate of power bank recalls, including those from both Anker and ESR. I replaced one of my aging Anker models during that time with Iniu’s excellent Carry P51L-E2, which is on sale at Amazon for a new low of $18.86 (about $21 off) at checkout.

The 20,000mAh power bank isn’t particularly fancy, though it does output up to 45W of power and features a built-in, braided USB-C cable that doubles as a lanyard. You also get an extra USB-C and USB-A port, allowing you to juice your phone, tablet, a pair of wireless earbuds, and other small electronics at the same time. Now, if only Iniu could have packed the extra battery capacity into a charger as compact and colorful as the like-minded Pocket Rocket P50. C’est la vie.

Arguably the best TV deal you can find this weekend would be on the 65-inch Bravia 8 II, which is still hovering around $2,398 (over $1,000 off) at multiple retailers, including Amazon. But not everyone has that kind of money to throw around on an OLED panel, which makes the current discount on LG’s C5 more appealing. Now through January 20th, you can pick up LG’s 65-inch OLED TV at eBay for $1,197.59 ($1,502 off) when you use code FAVEFINDS20 at checkout.

Like prior models in the C Series, the C5 is all about value. The 4K set delivers the deep black levels and contrast for which OLEDs are known, and it features LG’s AI Picture Pro, which analyzes what you’re watching and adjusts brightness, resolution, and other settings to improve clarity. It also features a bevy of gaming-friendly features, including a 120Hz refresh rate, support for AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync, and four HDMI 2.1 ports, allowing you to play current-gen titles in 4K at up to 120fps. It’s rounded out with HDR10 and Dolby Vision support, further enhancing color and contrast.

Having now used both the Beats Fit Pro and the new Powerbeats Fit as part of my weekly workout regimen, I can tell you with absolute certainty that there’s little difference between the two — well, other than the fact that the Powerbeats Fit retail for $199.95 and the last-gen Beats Fit Pro are on sale at Woot in select colors for $89.99 ($110 off) through January 31st. Beats’ latest workout earbuds also feature a smaller charging case and more flexible wing tips, I guess, but with the Fit Pro, you’re still getting solid noise cancellation, good sound, and all the Apple ecosystem tricks you’d expect for less than half the price.

            <div id="article-text">﻿The new adaptation of Hiroshi Sakurazaka’s sci-fi light novel feels like a tribute to the roguelike genre.

﻿The new adaptation of Hiroshi Sakurazaka’s sci-fi light novel feels like a tribute to the roguelike genre.

While Hollywood has repeatedly tried adapting stories from Japanese manga, vanishingly few of them have been as good as Edge of Tomorrow — Warner Bros.’ 2014 live-action film based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka’s sci-fi light novel All You Need Is Kill. Edge of Tomorrow wasn’t a one-to-one translation of All You Need Is Kill’s original story or its manga adaptation by Takeshi Obata, Ryosuke Takeuchi, and Yoshitoshi Abe. The movie was more militaristic and focused on humanity rallying against an alien invasion.

But Edge of Tomorrow understood that what made its source material so powerful was its imaginative exploration of what it means to be tenacious in the face of insurmountable odds. That’s also true of Warner Bros. Japan and Studio 4°C’s new animated All You Need Is Kill adaptation directed by Kenichiro Akimoto. Like Edge of Tomorrow, this version of All You Need Is Kill reworks some major details in order to make its Groundhog Day-inspired story feel fresh. But the new feature is much stranger and more visually stunning than any of its forebears. And it’s a prime example of how much fun movies can be when they embrace the frustrating madness of video games.

Much like the All You Need Is Kill light novel, the new movie tells the story of two unlikely friends who find themselves stuck in a time loop after being murdered by an alien superorganism known as Darol. But this take on the mindbending story is told from the perspective of Rita Vrataski (Ai Mikami, Stephanie Sheh in the English dub), a disaffected young woman looking for purpose at a Darol research facility. Though everyone at the facility knows Darol — a towering creature that looks like an unbloomed flower — fell from space, no one has any idea that the alien is chockful of monsters waiting to devour anything that moves. And it isn’t until Darol blossoms that Rita learns firsthand how deadly the aliens truly are.

Even with her futuristic exoskeleton power armor, there’s little Rita can do to really defend herself when Darol first unleashes its skittering progeny upon the world. But when Rita dies shortly after managing to kill one of the smaller creatures, she is shocked to find herself transported back through time to the beginning of the very same day with (seemingly) no one else knowing what’s about to happen.

In its opening act, All You Need Is Kill unfolds like a beautiful, but gruesome, Groundhog Day riff. Every day Rita gets up, nervously goes about her day, and tries to figure out how to change her fate before Darol’s spawn find new ways to kill her. She reasons that there’s no use in trying to explain her predicament to other people because of how unbelievable everything about it is. At first, death seems inevitable. But when Rita crosses paths with Keiji (Natsuki Hanae, Jadon Muniz) — a nervous gamer who also knows that time is repeating itself — Rita locks in and begins to look at each loop as a chance to study Darol while learning to pilot her armor more skillfully.

While Edge of Tomorrow winkingly nodded to the fact that there were some video game-y elements to its premise, the new All You Need Is Kill much more explicitly acknowledges that Rita and Keiji are trapped in a very roguelike situation. With each loop, the duo become a better alien-slaying team and realize their chances of survival are better when they upgrade their weapons. But every brutal death / resurrection cycle wears on their morality and leaves them wondering if all their hard-earned progress is in vain.

Aside from its focus on a female protagonist, the biggest difference between this All You Need Is Kill and previous adaptations is a wholly new art direction spearheaded by Tomotaka Kubo (Promare, Mary and the Witch’s Flower). Kubo and character designer Izumi Murakami present this world as a lush wonderland awash in vibrant colors that becomes even more strangely gorgeous whenever Darol’s menacing drones are on screen. The original All You Need Is Kill and Edge of Tomorrow’s power suits were hulking behemoths that seemed ill suited for battle with skittering aliens. But here, mechanical designer Junji Okubo (Star Wars: Visions’ “Lop & Ochō”) reimagines them as sleek extensions of their pilots that almost seem organic.

Those visual changes give this iteration of All You Need Is Kill a distinct personality and make its action sequences a dazzling feast for the eyes. Even if you’re familiar with All You Need Is Kill, the new adaptation is worth seeing if only to appreciate how each telling of this story has its own unique energy. And if this is your first time encountering Sakurazaka’s work, you’re in for a wild ride.

Depending who you ask, AI-powered coding is either giving software developers an unprecedented productivity boost or churning out masses of poorly designed code that saps their attention and sets software projects up for serious long term-maintenance problems.

The problem is right now, it’s not easy to know which is true.

As tech giants pour billions into large language models (LLMs), coding has been touted as the technology’s killer app. Executives enamored with the potential are pushing engineers to lean into an AI-powered future. But after speaking to more than 30 developers, technology executives, analysts, and researchers, MIT Technology Review found that the picture is not as straightforward as it might seem. Read the full story.

Technically speaking, neuroscientists have been able to read your mind for decades. It’s not easy, mind you. First, you must lie motionless within a fMRI scanner, perhaps for hours, while you watch films or listen to audiobooks.

If you do elect to endure claustrophobic hours in the scanner, the software will learn to generate a bespoke reconstruction of what you were seeing or listening to, just by analyzing how blood moves through your brain.

More recently, researchers have deployed generative AI tools, like Stable Diffusion and GPT, to create far more realistic, if not entirely accurate, reconstructions of films and podcasts based on neural activity. So how close are we to genuine “mind reading?” Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Earlier this week, MIT Technology Review published its annual list of Ten Breakthrough Technologies. As always, it features technologies that made the news last year, and which—for better or worse—stand to make waves in the coming years. They’re the technologies you should really be paying attention to.

In August 2024, KJ Muldoon was born with a rare genetic disorder that allowed toxic ammonia to build up in his blood. The disease can be fatal, and KJ was at risk of developing neurological disorders. At the time, his best bet for survival involved waiting for a liver transplant.

Then he was offered an experimental gene therapy—a personalized “base editing” treatment designed to correct the specific genetic “misspellings” responsible for his disease. It seems to have worked! Three doses later, KJ is doing well. He took his first steps in December, shortly before spending his first Christmas at home.

KJ’s story is hugely encouraging. The team behind his treatment is planning a clinical trial for infants with similar disorders caused by different genetic mutations. The team members hope to win regulatory approval on the back of a small trial—a move that could make the expensive treatment (KJ’s cost around $1 million) more accessible, potentially within a few years.

Others are getting in on the action, too. Fyodor Urnov, a gene-editing scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, assisted the team that developed KJ’s treatment. He recently cofounded Aurora Therapeutics, a startup that hopes to develop gene-editing drugs for another disorder called phenylketonuria (PKU). The goal is to obtain regulatory approval for a single drug that can then be adjusted or personalized for individuals without having to go through more clinical trials.

US regulators seem to be amenable to the idea and have described a potential approval pathway for such “bespoke, personalized therapies.” Watch this space.

It was a big year for Colossal Biosciences, the biotech company hoping to “de-extinct” animals like the woolly mammoth and the dodo. In March, the company created what it called “woolly mice”—rodents with furry coats and curly whiskers akin to those of woolly mammoths.

The company made an even more dramatic claim the following month, when it announced it had created three dire wolves. These striking snow-white animals were created by making 20 genetic changes to the DNA of gray wolves based on genetic research on ancient dire wolf bones, the company said at the time.

Whether these animals can really be called dire wolves is debatable, to say the least. But the technology behind their creation is undeniably fascinating. We’re talking about the extraction and analysis of ancient DNA, which can then be introduced into cells from other, modern-day species.

Analysis of ancient DNA can reveal all sorts of fascinating insights into human ancestors and other animals. And cloning, another genetic tool used here, has applications not only in attempts to re-create dead pets but also in wildlife conservation efforts. Read more here.

IVF involves creating embryos in a lab and, typically, “scoring” them on their likelihood of successful growth before they are transferred to a person’s uterus. So far, so uncontroversial.

Recently, embryo scoring has evolved. Labs can pinch off a couple of cells from an embryo, look at its DNA, and screen for some genetic diseases. That list of diseases is increasing. And now some companies are taking things even further, offering prospective parents the opportunity to select embryos for features like height, eye color, and even IQ.

This is controversial for lots of reasons. For a start, there are many, many factors that contribute to complex traits like IQ (a score that doesn’t capture all aspects of intelligence at any rate). We don’t have a perfect understanding of those factors, or how selecting for one trait might influence another.

Some critics warn of eugenics. And others note that whichever embryo you end up choosing, you can’t control exactly how your baby will turn out (and why should you?!). Still, that hasn’t stopped Nucleus, one of the companies offering these services, from inviting potential customers to have their “best baby.” Read more here.

In April 2025, Ronald Deibert left all electronic devices at home in Toronto and boarded a plane. When he landed in Illinois, he bought a new laptop and iPhone. He wanted to reduce the risk of having his personal devices confiscated, because he knew his work made him a prime target for surveillance. “I’m traveling under the assumption that I am being watched, right down to exactly where I am at any moment,” Deibert says.

Deibert directs the Citizen Lab, a research center he founded in 2001 to serve as “counterintelligence for civil society.” Housed at the University of Toronto, it’s one of the few institutions that investigate cyberthreats exclusively in the public interest, and in doing so, it has exposed some of the most egregious digital abuses of the past two decades.

For many years, Deibert and his colleagues have held up the US as the standard for liberal democracy. But that’s changing. Read the full story.

As thousands of companies trumpet their plans to cut carbon pollution, a small group of sustainability consultants has emerged as the go-to arbiter of corporate climate action.

The Science Based Targets initiative, or SBTi, helps businesses develop a timetable for action to shrink their climate footprint through some combination of cutting greenhouse-gas pollution and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. After years of small-scale sustainability work, SBTi is growing rapidly, and governments are paying attention.

But while the group has earned praise for reeling the private sector into constructive conversations about climate emissions, its rising influence has also attracted scrutiny and raised questions about why a single organization is setting the standards for many of the world’s largest companies.

            <div id="article-text">Happy New Year! I know it’s a bit late to say, but it never quite feels like the year has started until the new edition of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies list comes out.

For 25 years, MIT Technology Review has put together this package, which highlights the technologies that we think are going to matter in the future. This year’s version has some stars, including gene resurrection (remember all the dire wolf hype last year?) and commercial space stations.

And of course, the world of climate and energy is represented with sodium-ion batteries, next-generation nuclear, and hyperscale AI data centers. Let’s take a look at what ended up on the list, and what it says about this moment for climate tech.

I’ve been covering sodium-ion batteries for years, but this moment feels like a breakout one for the technology.

Today, lithium-ion cells power everything from EVs, phones, and computers to huge stationary storage arrays that help support the grid. But researchers and battery companies have been racing to develop an alternative, driven by the relative scarcity of lithium and the metal’s volatile price in recent years.

Sodium-ion batteries could be that alternative. Sodium is much more abundant than lithium, and it could unlock cheaper batteries that hold a lower fire risk.

There are limitations here: Sodium-ion batteries won’t be able to pack as much energy into cells as their lithium counterparts. But it might not matter, especially for grid storage and smaller EVs.

In recent years, we’ve seen a ton of interest in sodium-based batteries, particularly from major companies in China. Now the new technology is starting to make its way into the world—CATL says it started manufacturing these batteries at scale in 2025.

Nuclear reactors are an important part of grids around the world today—massive workhorse reactors generate reliable, consistent electricity. But the countries with the oldest and most built-out fleets have struggled to add to them in recent years, since reactors are massive and cost billions. Recent high-profile projects have gone way over budget and faced serious delays.

Next-generation reactor designs could help the industry break out of the old blueprint and get more nuclear power online more quickly, and they’re starting to get closer to becoming reality.

There’s a huge variety of proposals when it comes to what’s next for nuclear. Some companies are building smaller reactors, which they say could make it easier to finance new projects, and get them done on time.

Other companies are focusing on tweaking key technical bits of reactors, using alternative fuels or coolants that help ferry heat out of the reactor core. These changes could help reactors generate electricity more efficiently and safely.

Kairos Power was the first US company to receive approval to begin construction on a next-generation reactor to produce electricity. China is emerging as a major center of nuclear development, with the country’s national nuclear company reportedly working on several next-gen reactors.

This one isn’t quite what I would call a climate technology, but I spent most of last year reporting on the climate and environmental impacts of AI, and the AI boom is deeply intertwined with climate and energy.

Data centers aren’t new, but we’re seeing a wave of larger centers being proposed and built to support the rise of AI. Some of these facilities require a gigawatt or more of power—that’s like the output of an entire conventional nuclear power plant, just for one data center.

(This feels like a good time to mention that our Breakthrough Technologies list doesn’t just highlight tech that we think will have a straightforwardly positive influence on the world. I think back to our 2023 list, which included mass-market military drones.)

There’s no denying that new, supersize data centers are an important force driving electricity demand, sparking major public pushback, and emerging as a key bit of our new global infrastructure.

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste. The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.  Here’s what that might look like.

Next-gen nuclear is one of our 10 Breakthrough Technologies this year. If you want to learn more about why it made the list, sign up to receive The Spark, our weekly newsletter all about energy and climate change, tomorrow. You can also check out the rest of the technologies on the list here.

            <div id="article-text">OpenAI’s decision to introduce advertisements inside ChatGPT for free users and its new $8 “Go” tier is already shaping up to be one of the most consequential pivots in generative AI’s short history. It’s not a simple business tweak. It’s a reframing of where digital intent, attention, and commercial influence intersect in an age where conversations increasingly replace search bars.

Yet, this moment will be remembered not as the day ads arrived in ChatGPT, but as the day two decades of assumptions about search and digital advertising broke open.

Read that again: ads won’t sit beside or above a list of links, as they do on Google. They will appear inside the conversational flow, at the moment a user has just received a helpful answer.

This is not incremental. It’s a new interface for intent.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

For years, OpenAI developed ChatGPT as an ad-free oasis in a web saturated with promotions, pop-ups, and sponsored results. Now it’s embracing the oldest monetization strategy on the internet: advertising.  The company insists ads will be clearly labeled, won’t influence AI responses, and won’t depend on selling individual user data. Ads will appear below answers when relevant, and paid tiers like Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise remain ad-free.

To understand why this matters, you need to see it not as an ad insertion, but as a shift in how commerce enters human intent, at the moment of decision, not distraction.

In a classic Google search, thoughtful queries turn into ranked links and ad slots beside them. In a ChatGPT conversation, a user asks a question, gets an answer, and stays in context; the frame never changes. An ad beneath that response isn’t an interruption; it’s an extension of the thought process. This subtle repositioning changes how brands can engage a user: they’re not chasing clicks after a search, they’re walking up with the answer itself.

That’s a paradigm shift. Brands are no longer competing for top billing on a results page; they are competing to be part of the narrative that unfolds between a question and a resolution. It’s a level of semantic proximity to intent that search ads never capture, because even the best keywords are guesses at nuance. ChatGPT sees nuance first.

Let restaurants, retailers, and SaaS companies imagine that: not just showing an ad after someone searches “best CRM tools,” but appearing contextually right when someone asks “what CRM features matter to small teams.” That changes where conversion flows start.

This isn’t happening. OpenAI’s infrastructure costs are enormous, and its free user base dwarfs its subscriber base. Only a small fraction of ChatGPT’s hundreds of millions of weekly active users currently pay. Advertising offers a scalable revenue path that could subsidize free access and help the company balance long-term costs.

It’s striking that OpenAI once positioned ads as a “last resort.” Now they’re a strategic mainstay. That tells you two things: the scale of AI compute bills is real, and the company is trying to find a sustainable business model that doesn’t rely solely on subscription fatigue.

ChatGPT’s value isn’t just utility; it’s credibility, the feeling that the answer isn’t trying to sell you something. Introducing ads atop or below answers may be technically neutral, but perception is sticky. Once a user notices “Sponsored” within the thoughtful flow of a conversation, trust becomes negotiable. Academic research on ads in AI interfaces shows that even labeled ads can reduce perceived trust and make users feel manipulated, especially if they blur with responses.

OpenAI recognizes this. It’s promising to avoid showing ads in sensitive contexts, like health, politics, or personal advice, and won’t target minors. It’s also pledging that ads won’t twist the model’s answers.

Yet trust isn’t a function of code; it’s a feeling users develop over time. One poorly placed ad recommendation, even if accurate, can make people wonder whether the answer was shaped by commercial rather than objective logic.

From a creative standpoint, this is both exciting and fraught. The ads we’ve long tolerated have trained us to think of marketing as interruption: banners, pop-ups, pre-roll videos. ChatGPT’s approach suggests something closer to contextual dialogue, where an ad feels like a part of exploration. The brands that succeed here won’t be the loudest; they’ll be the most relevant, most resonant, and most human. They’ll read like answers, not impositions, because they’re embedded in answers.

That opens a new creative demand: marketers will need to think less about clickbait hooks and more about narrative relevance, how to be helpful within a user’s question, not beside it.

Is this the end of Google? No. Google’s advertising machine is vast, integrated, and highly optimized. Its AI integration in search, including AI summaries, already blends insight with ads in ways that are more sophisticated than many realize.

But the rise of ads in ChatGPT signals that intent has multiple layers now. There’s traditional search intent tied to links and pages, and there’s conversational intent captured in natural language interactions. These layers will coexist, sometimes reinforce, sometimes compete.

Advertisers and creators today often optimize for keywords. Tomorrow, they’ll optimize for conversational moments, the semantic cues that signal purchase interest within a dialogue.

The rollout now is just the beginning. If AI systems evolve into multi-modal, interactive assistants that help people plan trips, make purchases, write essays, plan budgets, and solve problems of every sort, the point at which commerce enters that interaction becomes crucial.

The question is no longer “Will people see our ad?” but “Will they trust our recommendation when it pops up next to an AI answer?”

That’s the real test, and the real frontier.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/bizzynow-opens-mamacrowd-equity-round">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Italian startup BizzyNow has launched an equity crowdfunding round on Mamacrowd to finance the next phase of its networking app, built around quick, in-person meetups it calls “Bizzy Moments.” The campaign targets €150k–€400k at a €3m pre-money valuation, with a €500 minimum ticket. BizzyNow says proceeds will support go-to-market validation, product upgrades, and the operational groundwork needed to scale.

Professional networking has a timing problem. The most valuable introductions often happen in the gaps: 40 minutes before a flight, a pause between conference sessions, an unscheduled evening in a new city, or the lull after a client meeting. But the tools professionals typically use to connect are optimized for asynchronous, low-context interactions (requests, messages, posts) rather than real-time, location-based intent.

BizzyNow’s premise is simple: when two relevant people are already in the same place, and both have time, “discovering each other” should not require long threads, calendar gymnastics, or cold outreach. The company positions its product as a way to turn downtime during business travel and events into structured, high-signal conversations.

“BizzyNow is built for the moments when professionals are already in the same place, with time to meet, but no practical way to discover each other quickly. We’re giving people a way to use that moment to show their best side, and turn idle business travel time into measurable B2B outcomes”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow is designed to turn “I have 45 minutes” into a practical meeting. The app uses geolocation plus an AI layer and LinkedIn integration to surface nearby professionals who may be relevant, then encourages short, structured meetups lasting roughly 30 to 90 minutes. BizzyNow describes these as micro-meetings held in neutral, community-recommended locations, intended to move beyond chatting into a realconversation. BizzyNow also describes a trust-oriented scoring approach that is meant to reflect the value creates through meetings, emphasizing quality and follow-through rather than connection
volume.

BizzyNow is pitching into a familiar contradiction: professionals are back at conferences, airports, hotels, and coworking spaces, but introductions still default to slow, noisy digital channels. In-person events have regained their role as dealflow engines. Yet discovery remains fragmented across LinkedIn messages, WhatsApp groups, and chance encounters, with little infrastructure for “right person, right place, right time.” BizzyNow is betting that instant, location-aware matching can become a practical layer for high-intent environments, especially where timing is the constraint.

The company’s target segments reflect that focus. In campaign materials, BizzyNow points to business travelers, managers, freelancers, expats, event communities, corporate HR, coworking spaces, hotels, and airports as core audiences and partners.

The raise is being run via Mamacrowd, one of Italy’s established equity crowdfunding platforms, and the campaign is live.

On the Mamacrowd listing, the round is set with:

For early-stage startups, equity crowdfunding can be more than financing. It can act as a public proof point for market interest, build a base of aligned advocates, and strengthen credibility with commercial partners, especially for products that grow through communities.

BizzyNow’s internal materials describe traction that is still early but measurable, including ca. 2,000 free users, 400 weekly active users (22.6% WAU-to-total), and six active corporate pilots. The same documents state that the company is in pre-revenue, with monetization intentionally deferred during the validation phase. That context matters: this is a campaign funding a transition from adoption validation to monetization proof, not a late-stage expansion round.

“Crowdfunding fits our model because community is not a byproduct for us. It’s part of how we validate activation, refine the product, and build repeatable go-to-market channels before scaling”, said the CEO, Tommaso Fe.

BizzyNow’s pitch deck frames its roadmap as a progression “from validation to global market,” staged across three years:

● 2025: MVP, beta launch, early validation
● 2026: Premium launch, B2B pilots, monetization validation
● 2027: EMEA expansion and scale readiness

That sequencing aligns with what BizzyNow describes in its internal underwriting materials: corporate pilots are active, monetization is modeled to begin mid-2026, and the near-term priority is proving repeatable activation and conversion mechanics.

On use of funds, the Executive Pitch Deck states the round is intended to validate monetization, strengthen product capabilities, and prepare for scale, with spend tied to measurable validation milestones across:

● Marketing & GTM validation
● Product and premium features
● Compliance and governance
● Team and operations

The Mamacrowd campaign further breaks planned allocation into ranges:

● 40%–50% Marketing and Brand Activation
● 20%–25% Technology Development (BizzyNow app)
● 10% Legal and Compliance
● 10%–15% Team and Operations● 10% Strategic reserve

BizzyNow also outlines a B2B-oriented monetization path in its deck and model assumptions, including paid event activations, company-wide licensing, and data/analytics packages, while explicitly noting that projections remain validation-stage assumptions and will be refined as unit economics are proven.

            <div id="article-text">In January 2026, London’s mayor gave a blunt warning that has reverberated far beyond City Hall: artificial intelligence could trigger “mass unemployment” in the capital’s core industries unless policymakers act now.

His words came with an unexpected counterweight: an announcement of free AI training and a dedicated task force to help workers adapt. This juxtaposition captures a tension shaping Europe’s labour landscape: fear and opportunity locked in the same story.

The anxiety isn’t limited to one city. Across the continent, debates about AI’s impact on jobs are intensifying. Visionaries and critics paint dramatically different pictures. Some technologists warn that advanced AI could substitute human labour at an unprecedented pace.

“AI will replace humans”, you heard this before.

Others argue these fears are exaggerated or misplaced if governments and employers can guide the transition. For many Europeans, the question is no longer theoretical; it is unfolding before their eyes.

At first look, the job market’s headline figures tell a reassuring story: overall unemployment across the European Union remains low, with EU unemployment at about 5.8% in 2025, down from 6.0% a year earlier. Youth unemployment has also declined in many countries, indicating that even entry-level opportunities persist for most workers.

In some sectors where AI tools are already in use, work has been reshaped rather than eliminated. A European study found that 30% of EU workers now use AI at work, especially for text tasks like writing and translation, and that digital tools have become nearly universal (90%) across workplaces.

Many workers report that AI helps them perform tasks more efficiently or take on different responsibilities. At the same time, employers are actively reassessing job roles because of AI, with about 71% of European firms reconsidering job responsibilities due to AI implementation and over a quarter reducing hiring or cutting roles as a direct result of AI deployment.

Beneath these numbers lie subtler shifts. Firms across the EU are becoming cautious about hiring, in part because of economic slowdowns and in part because AI adoption is changing how work gets done. Economic indicators suggest employment growth across the EU will slow in the coming years, with fewer vacancies and reduced labour market dynamism even as AI use spreads.

The most visible tension is at the intersection of perception and preparation. On the one hand, public statements like London’s mayors reflect a palpable fear of displacement. Sectors such as finance, legal services, and customer support, pillars of many European economies,  are widely considered vulnerable to automation and generative AI technologies.

Detailed labour data suggest that many jobs are being reshaped at the task level, even if entire job categories are not yet disappearing wholesale. For example, AI is automating routine text production and data tasks while increasingly augmenting analytical and oversight functions.

On the other hand, there are signs of adaptability. Governments and institutions are launching initiatives to reskill workers and embed AI fluency into professional development. Across Europe, digital skills gaps remain significant; only 56% of adults aged 16-74 had basic digital skills in 2023, well below the EU’s target, indicating the scale of upskilling needed.

Educational efforts range from vocational programs to industry partnerships that teach AI-related skills. For example, private training providers across the EU are expanding online programs in data science, analytics, and AI competencies, reflecting a growing recognition that skills matter as much as technology itself.

It would be a mistake to frame this moment as simply a binary between jobs lost and jobs saved. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 predicts both creation and disruption, with employers foreseeing demand for entirely new roles even as others change or shrink.

The report finds that technologies, including AI, are expected to create millions of new jobs globally while displacing an estimated number of others, highlighting the scale of transformation.

There is also a policy dimension that can’t be overlooked. European institutions are experimenting with social safety nets and active labour market policies that aim to cushion displacement and support transitions.

Proposals like a European AI Social Compact argue for strategies that combine employment support, training, and social protections as central to economic planning.

National governments are debating everything from expanded unemployment support tied to training to tax incentives for companies that invest in human capital alongside AI. These measures acknowledge that the future of work is not simply about machines replacing people, but about how people and machines can be integrated into resilient labour ecosystems.

Yet challenges remain. Entry-level opportunities, the traditional gateway for recent graduates, are tightening in many sectors as employers increasingly use automated systems in recruitment and candidate screening.

Surveys suggest broad concern among young job seekers about prospects in an AI-transformed market, even where overall employment remains stable.

Some employers are re-imagining entry paths by embedding AI training into internship programs, while others are partnering with universities to co-design curricula that emphasize AI-augmented work. These efforts signal that adaptation is possible, but they also highlight how uneven the transition has been so far.

What Europe faces now is not a single story of mass job losses or unrestrained job growth. It is a mosaic of experiences, where headlines of risk and reports of adaptation coexist. The labour market is not static; it is reacting to technology, to policy, to fear and hope in equal measure.

If there is a throughline, it’s this: Europe’s future of work will be shaped not just by the capabilities of artificial intelligence, but by choices about education, regulation, and social support.

The decisions policymakers and employers make today will tilt the balance between disruption and opportunity. In that sense, the conversation is less about whether AI will change jobs; it already is, and more about how Europe navigates the change.

That is the reality workers, firms, and governments must confront together.

This reminds me of the well-known anecdote in Romanian political history in which Ion I.C. (Ionel) Brătianu, asked by historian and politician Nicolae Iorga what a scholar could learn from an engineer, replied with just that phrase, a call for moderation and thoughtful judgment: “Measure, sir, measure!”

Thus, measure, thoughtful regulation, and worker-focused policy will make sure AI supports people’s work, protects rights, and steers technological change toward shared opportunity, not making them unemployed.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-14</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Belgian cybersecurity startup Aikido Security has closed a $60 million Series B funding round at a $1 billion valuation, marking a rare unicorn milestone for a European security company and highlighting the accelerating interest in developer-centric security platforms.

The round was led by DST Global, a tech-oriented investment firm with a track record of backing major technology companies, and included participation from PSG Equity, Notion Capital, and Singular. Founded in 2022, Aikido has reached a billion-dollar valuation in just three years, a pace few cybersecurity firms attain, and according to company sources, the fastest in Europe.

The new capital will help Aikido accelerate product development and expand further into key markets, especially the United States, where it already generates around half of its revenue. In the past year, the company’s revenue grew roughly fivefold, while its customer base nearly tripled.

Aikido’s core proposition is rooted in the conviction that traditional application security tools have not kept pace with the rapid evolution of software development. Modern engineering teams ship code more frequently, and the widespread adoption of AI tools for coding has heightened both velocity and risk. Legacy scanners and point solutions can generate noise and distract developers, rather than offering actionable insights at the right moment.

Instead of siloed products that address a single layer of the stack, Aikido provides a unified platform that spans code analysis, cloud security, and runtime monitoring, with an emphasis on automation. The platform is designed to detect risks early in the development process, prioritise issues based on real-world impact, and help engineering teams fix problems before they reach production.

CEO Willem Delbare has framed the product as “guardrails” for developers, tools that fit fluidly into existing workflows rather than creating extra hurdles.

Customers range from gaming and mobile app developers to fintech and music streaming platforms, with names like Niantic, Revolut, and SoundCloud appearing among early adopters. These use cases underscore demand for security tools that can keep pace with modern development practices, where agility and context are essential.

Aikido’s valuation and investor interest reflect broader trends in the cybersecurity landscape. Once a domain dominated by perimeter defence and signature-based detection, security has had to adapt as software infrastructure shifts to cloud services, microservices architectures, and continuous delivery. Investors are especially focused on tools that reduce friction for engineering teams and support automated, context-aware security workflows.

DST Global’s lead on the round is noteworthy given the firm’s history of backing companies that scale globally.

In a funding environment where investor scrutiny has tightened and deals are won largely on product differentiation and tangible traction, Aikido’s growth metrics have helped draw attention. A fivefold increase in revenue within a year and strong adoption metrics among engineering teams suggest a product that resonates with users, not just buyers.

Aikido’s unicorn status also illustrates how European startups in traditionally U.S.-centric sectors like cybersecurity can carve out meaningful niches. Security products have long struggled to escape the shadow of established players headquartered in Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv, but a steady wave of startups with developer-oriented tools has begun to reshape expectations.

That said, the competitive landscape remains crowded.

Vendors across cloud security, application scanning, vulnerability management, and developer tooling are all vying for engineering team attention. Some focus on narrow functions such as static analysis or open-source risk, while others bundle broader offerings. Aikido bets that a unified, integrated experience can reduce cognitive load and streamline security workflows.

In its own communications, Aikido has described evolving toward what it calls “self-securing software,” a future state where systems can automatically test, detect, and remediate vulnerabilities without extensive human intervention. This vision is reflected in recent product releases that embed automated penetration testing and contextual risk analysis directly into development pipelines.

Technical roadmaps shared by the company suggest deeper integrations with cloud platforms and enhanced automation capabilities, allowing developers to catch and fix issues as code is written and deployed. This direction aligns with broader industry shifts toward “security as code,” where security functions are embedded in the same workflows as infrastructure and application development.

Expanding partnerships with cloud providers and refining API-first integrations are likely priorities for Aikido in the near term. As engineering teams increasingly adopt secure development practices as part of their standard operating model, integrated platforms become more attractive than point solutions that require separate processes and tools.

Aikido’s rapid growth and investor backing reinforce a fundamental shift in security tooling: developers are now viewed as primary stakeholders in safeguarding software. This contrasts with earlier models where specialised security teams acted as gatekeepers. By aligning security functions with development workflows, tools like Aikido aim to reduce friction while improving risk visibility.

For investors, the deal is a signal that cybersecurity remains a fertile ground for innovation, particularly where AI and automation intersect with foundational development practices. As software becomes more complex and distributed, demand for real-time, integrated security controls will only rise.

Aikido’s unicorn milestone is less about the label and more about the validation of a model that places developers at the centre of security. If successful, this approach could influence how future security platforms are built and adopted across the industry.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-01-13</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For years, online shopping followed a fixed path. Search bar, product grid, filters, checkout. The interface barely changed, even as everything else on the internet did. That path is now breaking.

Monday 12 January, 2026, JD Sports Fashion plc (JD Group) became one of the first large retailers to let US customers search and buy sneakers directly inside AI chatbots, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini. No website visit. No app. Just a conversation that ends with a payment.

Basically, a customer can chat with an AI bot, say “add these shoes to my cart,” and complete a purchase in one click.

JD Sports has agreed a global deal with commercetools to enable “one-click” purchases on AI assistants including Copilot, Gemini and ChatGPT. US customers will simply tell the chatbot what they want and pay instantly via Stripe’s integrated payment flow.

The retailer is the first to deploy commercetools’ “Agentic Jumpstart” solution along with Stripe’s Agentic Commerce Suite (ACS). Stripe handles the payment and fraud protection, while commercetools’ AI Hub keeps JD’s product data, pricing and availability in sync across all AI channels.

For example, “Find me a pair of Nike Air Max size 10.” The AI queries JD’s catalog (via commercetools) and returns relevant products, with images and details. The shopper can then say “buy this pair,” and Stripe handles the checkout seamlessly. Commercetools and Stripe emphasize that all payment and fulfillment data still flow through JD’s systems – the retailer retains control over inventory, pricing, and customer experience.

AI-driven shopping shifts the act of buying from browsing to intent-based conversation.

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of sneakers, a customer can ask for “black running shoes under $150, good for daily training,” refine the request, compare options, and pay, all within the same chat. The AI handles discovery, filtering, and decision support in one flow.

For consumers, that means less friction and less time spent navigating interfaces designed around catalogs, not questions. For retailers, it means the loss of something they’ve relied on for two decades: control over the shopping journey.

JD Sports CEO Regis Schultz compared the impact of AI on retail to the internet boom of the late 1990s and suggested it could shrink physical store footprints by reducing the need for cash desks. The comment points to a wider rethink. If discovery and checkout move into AI layers, both digital and physical stores become less central.

Traditional e-commerce platforms are built around pages, categories, and conversion funnels. AI shopping ignores most of that. When purchases happen inside chatbots, platforms lose visibility into how customers arrive at decisions. Brand differentiation becomes harder when products are presented as answers rather than destinations. Loyalty shifts from websites to whichever AI assistant the customer trusts.

This creates a new competitive layer. Retailers are no longer just competing on price, delivery, or UX, but on how well their inventory, data, and brand translate into AI-mediated conversations. It also raises questions for marketplaces. If AI assistants can compare products across multiple retailers in real time, the advantage of being the “place people go to shop” weakens.

Letting customers buy without visiting a website introduces new risks. Retailers must ensure that payments remain secure, that inventory and pricing are accurate in real time, and that the brand experience doesn’t dissolve into a generic AI response. Stripe’s role here is critical, acting as the trust layer that makes conversational checkout viable at scale.

There’s also the issue of accountability. When something goes wrong, a failed payment, a wrong size, a delayed delivery, the customer interacts with an AI, not a store. Retailers still own the outcome, even if they no longer own the interface.

JD Sports is not alone. The move points to a broader pattern: commerce is migrating upward into AI systems that sit between consumers and brands. As mobile apps reshaped shopping in the 2010s, conversational AI is reshaping it again, this time by pushing the store itself out of the center of the experience.

What replaces it is less visible, but more powerful: intent, context, and conversation. Retail isn’t disappearing. It’s dissolving into the tools people already use to think, search, and decide.

There is something undeniably impressive about this evolution. Buying becomes faster, friction thins, decisions compress into a few lines of text. Yet, step by step, human interaction is quietly being removed from the equation. The cashier, the sales assistant, even the act of browsing alongside others, all fade into background infrastructure.

The open question isn’t whether this shift will happen, but how far it should go. When shopping becomes a dialogue with machines, convenience wins, but presence is lost. Retail now faces a new design challenge, not just how to sell through AI, but how to decide where human interaction still matters, and how to keep it from disappearing by default.
