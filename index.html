            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/man-sues-cops-who-jailed-him-for-37-days-for-trolling-a-charlie-kirk-vigil/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Larry Bushart, a man who was jailed for 37 days for reposting a Trump meme, has now sued the cops who allegedly schemed to keep him imprisoned for as long as possible simply because they disagreed with his point of view.

Bushart is a former cop who lost his post-retirement job after a seemingly vengeful sheriff jailed him for trolling a Charlie Kirk vigil post in a Facebook group. Upset that Kirk’s death commanded more attention than other victims of gun violence, Bushart posted a string of memes, among which was an image of Trump with an actual quote saying “We have to get over it” about a 2024 school shooting.

Perry County sheriff Nick Weems has since acknowledged that he “knew” that the meme referenced a prior school shooting. However, the entire time that Bushart was detained, Weems maintained that Bushart’s post incited “mass hysteria” from parents concerned that he was threatening violence at a local high school. Painting Bushart as indifferent to the supposed hysteria, Weems justified his arrest, as well as the $2 million bond ensuring Bushart couldn’t afford bail and remained behind bars.

None of the commenters on the Facebook thread interpreted Bushart’s meme as threatening a school shooting, Bushart’s lawsuit alleged. And so far, no public records show any concerned citizens flagging the meme as violating laws protecting schools. A request to the school district turned up no records, and so far, police have not produced any evidence of the hysteria, either, Bushart alleged.

Instead, it’s alleged that Weems was personally offended by Bushart’s memes, as someone who was using his Facebook account to promote the Kirk vigil that Weems was trolling. Allegedly violating Bushart’s First Amendment rights, Weems sought to use his power as sheriff to punish Bushart for his views, seemingly first angling to have the posts taken down and then allegedly doubling down and pushing for a false arrest.

To get Bushart jailed, Weems allegedly collaborated with an investigator, Jason Morrow, to omit a key detail from the affidavit that served as the entire basis of his arrest. Morrow supposedly left out the fact that the meme referred to a 2024 school shooting, allegedly helping Weems manufacture probable cause. Including that detail would’ve made Bushart’s arrest less likely, as the reviewing magistrate—a nonlawyer who has no legal education—would’ve possibly understood that cops were trying to arrest Bushart for protected speech, his complaint said.

While there’s no evidence of anyone interpreting the meme as a violent threat to school kids, there was a “national uproar” when Bushart’s story started spreading online, his complaint noted. Bushart credits media attention for helping to secure his release. The very next day after a local news station pressed Weems in a TV interview to admit he knew the meme wasn’t referencing his county’s high school and confirm that no one ever asked Bushart to clarify his online remarks, charges were dropped, and Bushart was set free.

Morrow and Weems have been sued in their personal capacities and could “be on the hook for monetary damages,” a press release from Bushart’s legal team at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) said. Perry County, Tennessee, is also a defendant since it’s liable for unconstitutional acts of its sheriffs.

Perry County officials did not immediately respond to Ars’ request to comment.

For Bushart, the arrest has shaken up his life. As the primary breadwinner, he’s worried about how he will support himself and his wife after losing his job while in jail. The arrest was particularly “humiliating,” his complaint said, “given his former role as a law enforcement officer.” And despite his release, fear of arrest has chilled his speech, impacting how he expresses his views online.

“I spent over three decades in law enforcement, and have the utmost respect for the law,” Bushart said. “But I also know my rights, and I was arrested for nothing more than refusing to be bullied into censorship.”

Bushart is seeking punitive damages, alleging that cops acted “willfully and maliciously” to omit information from his arrest affidavit that would’ve prevented his detention. One of his lawyers, FIRE senior attorney Adam Steinbaugh, said that a win would protect all social media meme posters from police censorship.

“If police can come to your door in the middle of the night and put you behind bars based on nothing more than an entirely false and contrived interpretation of a Facebook post, no one’s First Amendment rights are safe,” Steinbaugh said.</div>

            <h2>FCC chair scrubs website after learning it called FCC an “independent agency”</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/fcc-deletes-independent-agency-from-website-as-carr-defends-allegiance-to-trump/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr today faced blistering criticism in a Senate hearing for his September threats to revoke ABC station licenses over comments made by Jimmy Kimmel. While Democrats provided nearly all the criticism, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said that Congress should act to restrict the FCC’s power to intimidate news broadcasters.

As an immediate result of today’s hearing, the FCC removed a statement from its website that said it is an independent agency. Carr, who has embraced President Trump’s declaration that independent agencies may no longer operate independently from the White House, apparently didn’t realize that the website still called the FCC an independent agency.

“Yes or no, is the FCC an independent agency?” Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) asked. Carr answered that the FCC is not independent, prompting Luján to point to a statement on the FCC website calling the FCC “an independent US government agency overseen by Congress.”

“Just so you know, Brendan, on your website, it just simply says, man, the FCC is independent. This isn’t a trick question… Is your website wrong? Is your website lying?” Luján asked.

“Possibly. The FCC is not an independent agency,” Carr answered. The website still included the statement of independence when Luján asked the question, but it’s now gone.

Carr, who argued during the Biden years that the FCC must remain independent from the White House and accused Biden of improperly pressuring the agency, said today that it isn’t independent because the Communications Act does not give commissioners protection from removal by the president.

“The president can remove any member of the commission for any reason or no reason,” Carr said. Carr said his new position is a result of “a sea change in the law” related to an ongoing case involving the Federal Trade Commission, in which the Supreme Court appears likely to approve Trump’s firing of an FTC Democrat.

“I think it comes as no surprise that I’m aligned with President Trump on policy, I think that’s why he designated me as chairman… I can be fired by the president,” Carr said. Carr also said, “The Constitution is clear that all executive power is vested in the president, and Congress can’t change that by legislation.”

Changing the FCC website doesn’t change the law, of course. US law specifically lists 19 federal agencies, including the FCC, that are classified as “independent regulatory agencies.” Indications of the FCC’s independence include that it has commissioners with specified tenures, a multimember structure, partisan balance, and adjudication authority. Trump could test that historical independence by firing an FCC commissioner and waiting to see if the Supreme Court allows it, as he did with the FTC.

Carr’s statements on independence came toward the end of an FCC oversight hearing that lasted nearly three hours. Democrats on the Senate Commerce Committee spent much of the time accusing Carr of censoring broadcast stations, while Carr and Committee Chairman Cruz spent more time lobbing allegations of censorship at the Biden administration. But Cruz made it clear that he still thinks Carr shouldn’t have threatened ABC and suggested that Congress reduce the FCC’s power.

Cruz alleged that Democrats supported Biden administration censorship, but in the next sentence, he said the FCC shouldn’t have the legal authority that Carr has used to threaten broadcasters. Cruz said:

If my colleagues across the aisle do what many expect and hammer the chairman over their newfound religion on the First Amendment and free speech, I will be obliged to point out that those concerns were miraculously absent when the Biden administration was pressuring Big Tech to silence Americans for wrongthink on COVID and election security. It will underscore a simple truth, that the public interest standard and its wretched offspring, like the news distortion rule, have outlived whatever utility they once had and it is long past time for Congress to pass reforms.

Cruz avoided criticizing Carr directly today and praised the agency chairman for a “productive and refreshing” approach on most FCC matters. Nonetheless, Cruz’s statement suggests that he’d like to strip Carr and future FCC chairs of the power to wield the public interest standard and news distortion policy against broadcasters.

At today’s hearing and in recent months, Carr defended his actions on Kimmel by citing the public interest standard that the FCC applies to broadcasters that have licenses to use the public airwaves. Carr also defended his frequent threats to enforce the FCC’s rarely invoked news distortion policy, even though the FCC apparently hasn’t made a finding of news distortion since 1993.

Cruz said today he agrees with Carr “that Jimmy Kimmel is angry, overtly partisan, and profoundly unfunny,” and that “ABC and its affiliates would have been fully within their rights to fire him or simply to no longer air his program.” But Cruz added that government cannot “force private entities to take actions that the government cannot take directly. Government officials threatening adverse consequences for disfavored content is an unconstitutional coercion that chills protected speech.”

This is why it was so insidious how the Biden administration jawboned social media into shutting down conservatives online over accurate information on COVID or voter fraud. My Democrat colleagues were persistently silent over that scandal, but I welcome them now having discovered the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights. Democrat or Republican, we cannot have the government arbitrating truth or opinion. Mr. Chairman, my question is this, so long as there is a public interest standard, shouldn’t it be understood to encompass robust First Amendment protections to ensure that the FCC cannot use it to chill speech?

Carr answered, “I agree with you there and I think the examples you laid out of weaponization in the Biden years are perfect examples.” Carr criticized liberals for asking the Biden-era FCC to not renew a Fox station license and criticized Congressional Democrats for “writing letters to cable companies pressuring them to drop Fox News, OAN, and Newsmax because they disagreed with the political perspectives of those cable channels.”

Cruz seemed satisfied with the answer and changed the topic to the FCC’s management of spectrum. After that, much of the hearing consisted of Democrats pointing to Carr’s past statements supporting free speech and accusing him of using the FCC to suppress broadcasters’ speech.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) asked Carr if it “is appropriate to use your position to threaten companies that broadcast political satire.” Carr responded, “I think any licensee that operates on the public airwaves has a responsibility to comply with the public interest standard, and that’s been the case for decades.”

Klobuchar replied, “I asked if you think it’s appropriate for you to use your position to threaten companies, and this incident with Kimmel wasn’t an isolated event. You launched investigations into every major broadcast network except Fox. Is that correct?”

Carr noted that “we have a number of investigations ongoing.” Later, he said, “If you want to step back and talk about weaponization, we saw that for four years in the Biden administration.”

“Joe Biden is no longer president,” Klobuchar said. “You are head of the FCC, and Donald Trump is president, and I am trying to deal with this right now.”

As he has in the past, Carr claimed today that he never threatened ABC station licenses. “Democrats at the time were saying that we explicitly threatened to pull a license if Jimmy Kimmel wasn’t fired,” Carr said. “That never happened; that was nothing more than projection and distortion by Democrats. What I am saying is any broadcaster that uses the airwaves, whether radio or TV, has to comply with the public interest standard.”

In fact, Carr said on a podcast in September that broadcast stations should tell ABC and its owner Disney that “we are not going to run Kimmel anymore until you straighten this out because we, the licensed broadcaster, are running the possibility of fines or license revocations from the FCC if we continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion.”

Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) pointed to another Carr statement from the podcast in which he said, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”

Schatz criticized Carr’s claim that he never threatened licenses. “You’re kind of tiptoeing through the tulips here,” Schatz said.

FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, a Democrat, testified at today’s hearing and said that “the First Amendment applies to broadcasters regardless of whether they use spectrum or not, and the Communications Act prohibits the FCC from censoring broadcasters.”

Gomez said the Trump administration “has been on a campaign to censor content and to control the media and others, any critics of this administration, and it is weaponizing any levers it has in order to control that media. That includes using the FCC to threaten licensees, and broadcasters are being chilled. We are hearing from broadcasters that they are afraid to air programming that is critical of this administration because they’re afraid of being dragged before the FCC in an investigation.”

Gomez suggested the “public interest” phrase is being used by the FCC too vaguely in reference to investigations of broadcast stations. She said the FCC should “define what we mean by operating in the public interest,” saying the commission has been using the standard “as a means to go after any content we don’t like.” She said that “it’s still unconstitutional to revoke licenses based solely on content that the FCC doesn’t like.”

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) criticized Carr for investigating San Francisco-based KCBS over a report on Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities, in which the station described vehicles driven by ICE agents. Carr defended the probe today, saying, “The concern there in the report was there may have been interference with lawful ICE operations and so we were asking questions about what happened.”

Markey said, “The news journalists were just covering an important news story, and some conservatives were upset by the coverage, so you used your power as FCC chairman to hang a sword of Damocles over a local radio station’s head… Guess what happened? The station demoted the anchor who first read that news report over the air and pulled back on its political coverage. You got what you wanted.”

Carr said, “Broadcasters understand, perhaps for the first time in years, that they’re going to be held accountable to the public interest, to broadcast hoax rules, to the news distortion policy. I think that’s a good thing.”

Carr then criticized Markey for signing a letter to the FCC in 2018 that asked the agency to investigate conservative broadcaster Sinclair. The Markey/Carr exchange ended with the two men shouting over each other, making much of it unintelligible, although Markey said that Carr should resign because he’s creating a chilling effect on news broadcasters.

Cruz similarly criticized Democrats for targeting Sinclair, prompting Sen. Andy Kim (D-N.J.) to defend the 2018 letter. “Chairman Carr’s threats to companies he directly regulates are not the same thing as a letter from Congress requesting an agency examine a matter of public concern. Members on both sides of the aisle frequently write similar letters; that’s the proper oversight role of Congress,” he said.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/12/donut-labs-hub-motor-meets-watts-battery-to-create-new-ev-skateboard/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the big stories of last year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas was the debut of Donut Lab’s diminutive but powerful electric motors. When I spoke with Donut earlier this year, the company told me that it was looking at applications ranging from drones to large automotive motors, but also things like wind turbines and even washing machines. Now, almost a year later, we have our first look at an electric vehicle that uses the technology, thanks to a new collaboration between Donut Lab and WATT Electric Vehicle Company.

WATT had previously developed the Passenger and Commercial EV Skateboard (PACES), a lightweight aluminum platform for low-volume EVs. Now, it’s integrating Donut’s motors, first with one for each rear wheel, although there will eventually be an all-wheel-drive variant, too.

The small EV chassis is rather intriguing—with the motors in the rear wheel hubs, the layout is even more space-efficient than a more conventional EV, which still needs to find a few cubic feet to package its drive unit(s). The two companies see plenty of potential for the platform, which they say could give rise to “multiple vehicle configurations from beach buggies to high-performance sports cars to commercial delivery vehicles.”

“The integration of Donut Lab’s revolutionary in-wheel motor technology represents a significant leap for what PACES can offer the automotive world,” said Neil Yates, CEO of WATT Electric Vehicles. “Its motors, inverter, and software systems, perfectly complement our lightweight platform philosophy. The direct, fine control of the individual wheel speeds brings an agility and that is perfectly complemented by the low mass and inertia of our chassis technology. This skateboard can produce vehicles that will set new benchmarks for EV handling.”

“WATT EV’s PACES platform provides the perfect canvas to showcase the full potential of our advanced motor technology,” said Marko Lehtimäki, CEO of Donut Lab. “The exceptional low mass of PACES allows our high-torque, high-power-density in-wheel motors to truly shine, delivering a driving experience that would be impossible with heavier platforms. When you combine our direct-drive precision control with WATT’s lightweight engineering expertise, you create something genuinely transformative, a vehicle architecture that’s lighter, more efficient, more powerful, and infinitely more engaging to drive.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Back in October, word started making the rounds of an AI startup called Doublespeed. Backed by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Doublespeed offers customers a unique service: access to a massive phone farm that could be used to operate hundreds of AI-generated social media accounts.

Now, 404 Media reports in an explosive scoop that Doublespeed has been hacked. This wasn’t just one account associated with the startup, but the entire backend used to manage its phone farm — so it provides an extraordinary glimpse at how the service is actually being used to manipulate social media at scale.

Speaking to 404 on condition of anonymity, the hacker said they can “see the phones in use, which manager [computers controlling the phones] they had, which TikTok accounts they were assigned, proxies in use (and their passwords), and pending tasks. As well as the link to control devices for each manager.”

The hacker also shared a list of over 400 TikTok accounts operated by Doublespeed’s phone farm, about half of which were actively promoting products. Most of them, the publication reports, did so without disclosing that the posts were ads — a direct violation of TikTok’s terms of use, not to mention the Federal Trade Commission’s digital advertising regulations.

While undisclosed ads might seem like small potatoes in the grand scheme of things, the speak to a bleak trend. Not only is Doublespeed a possible breeding ground for disinformation campaigns or financial scams, but they seem to be getting away with their phone farm operation without any pushback from TikTok.

Doublespeed’s TikTok accounts ran a gamut of different cons, promoting language learning apps, supplements, massage products, dating apps and more. One account, operating under the unambiguously human-sounding name of Chloe Davis, had uploaded some 200 posts featuring an AI-generated woman hawking a massage roller for a company called Vibit, 404 reported.

Though the hacker says he reported the vulnerability to Doublespeed on October 31, he notes that he still had access to the company’s back end as recently as today.

So far, Doublespeed is only active on TikTok, though it has plans to expand to Instagram, Reddit, and X-formerly-Twitter. When it does, it seems all bets are off — with social media engagement, and all the influence it entails, being relegated to the highest bidder.

            <h2>AI Sends School Into Lockdown After It Mistook a Student’s Clarinet for a Gun</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/ai-surveillance-school-clarinet">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Students at Lawton Chiles Middle School in Florida were sent scrambling into lockdown last week, after an alert from an AI surveillance system detected a student carrying a gun.

There’s just one issue: the “gun” was actually a band student’s clarinet.

The whole thing unraveled quickly, according to local reporting. When the alert went out, it triggered an automatic “code red,” giving administrators no choice but to react to the AI system’s decision.

Luckily nobody was hurt, and local police soon declared the lockdown over. “The code red was a precaution and the children were never in any danger,” local police wrote in a Facebook post.

In a message to parents, school Principal Dr. Melissa Laudani said the district has “multiple layers of school safety, including an automated system that detects potential threats. A student was walking in the hallway, holding a musical instrument as if it were a weapon, which triggered the code red to activate.” (It’s not known what exactly constitutes a “code red,” as it isn’t mentioned in the school’s latest Parent Student handbook.)

Rather than blame the faulty AI system for the commotion — without which the fiasco never would have happened in the first place — the school blamed the young clarinetist.

“While there was no threat to campus, I’d like to ask you to speak with your student about the dangers of pretending to have a weapon on a school campus,” Laudani wrote.

It’s not known what particular system Lawton Chiles has on overwatch, but the fact that it can’t differentiate between a clarinet with 17 keys and a rifle with none is concerning.

The Lawton Chiles incident comes soon after another similar case, in which AI led to the violent detention of a 16-year old teen in Baltimore by at least eight officers with guns drawn. In that case, the school’s AI had somehow misidentified a small bag of Doritos for a handgun, prompting a heavily armed response from city police.

Like the story from Lawton Chiles, the Baltimore false positive could’ve easily been prevented had a human being been in the loop. Instead, it seems both systems allowed the AI to make the call without any challenge from a human being.

Omniilert, the company behind the Dorito incident, insisted that its AI system “functioned as intended: to prioritize safety and awareness through rapid human verification.”

It all underscores just how important it is that these AI school surveillance systems actually work before they’re forced into schools — because when it comes to identifying students with guns, false positives can be just as deadly as a false negatives.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Not using AI to pretend you have the hot bod of your dreams? Then clearly you’re not the CEO of a half-trillion-dollar AI company.

On Tuesday, OpenAI head honcho Sam Altman posted a holiday themed simulacrum of himself as a hunky firefighter with chiseled abs. Christmas lights are dangled around his neck like a bandolier, while he stands in front of an oversaturated smear that’s supposed to represent a decorated living room in the background. Shoved at the bottom is a calendar for the month of December.

The image was generated with the just-released new version of ChatGPT Images, GPT Image 1.5. OpenAI claims the new model “adheres to your intent more reliably,” allowing users to better fine-tune their images across multiple prompts “while keeping elements like lighting, composition, and people’s appearance consistent.”

The new model comes as Google dominates the conversation with its own image model released last month, Nano Banana Pro, which can generate astonishingly life-like images akin to what you’d see taken by a smartphone. That’s in addition to Google’s other recent showstopping AI release, Gemini 3 Pro, which together have largely dispelled the aura of invincibility OpenAI once possessed in the AI arms race. OpenAI has apparently been so rattled by Google’s massive leapfrog that Altman declared a “code red” behind the scenes.

He’s presenting a much different face to the world, though. The firefighter image of himself that looks ripped from the cover of a $8.99 smut paperback is another example of how Altman is willing to sacrifice whatever vestiges of self-respect he yet possess on the altar of hype through memes and cultural trends.

When OpenAI released Sora 2 this September, Altman allowed fans to use his likeness to generate deepfakes of himself. And the gamble paid off. AI corners of social media, not to mention the Sora 2 app itself, were drowning in a flood of videos showing Altman in all kinds of bizarre and absurd scenarios, like Altman wearing a dress and riding a horse through New York while firing a gun that dispenses money, and begging for GPUs through a doorbell camera, and even grilling a dead Pikachu.

That trend didn’t spawn out of nowhere. To kick off Sora 2’s launch, OpenAI posted a deepfaked video of Altman announcing the new AI app, and shared another promotional video generated with Sora that showed him on a slapstick quest to get to Sora’s launch on time.

Now Altman’s seemingly trying to recapture some of that viral potential with this latest debasement of himself created with his own tech, which is a little sad. It’s clearly a coordinated effort at the company, since another meme-ready AI image of Altman, wearing what appears to be at least five shirts, was posted by the official OpenAI account, too.

Unfortunately for Altman, his AI parody doesn’t look like it’s doing great numbers at the box office. In fact, many instead pointed out something in his firefighter image even more embarrassing than the fact that he was peddling AI thirst traps of himself: the December calendar at the bottom is straight-up inaccurate, showing dates that don’t align with the days of the week. Or at least, not this year; if he’d posted it in 2022 or 2033 instead, it would’ve been on the money.

            <div id="article-text">Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman has been confirmed by the U.S. Senate as the next administrator of NASA. The private astronaut and founder of the Shift4 payments processing platform will now be in charge of an agency that faces great uncertainty under President Trump.

Isaacman’s confirmation comes a little over a year after Trump nominated him. It was a volatile year for Isaacman, though, as Trump pulled his nomination in June after becoming concerned about the billionaire’s “prior associations.” (Isaacman had previously donated to Democrats, something Trump was reportedly aware of when he first nominated the entrepreneur.)

That led to months of sniping between Trump’s camp and people more closely aligned with Isaacman, like SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who publicly attacked the credibility of acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy. Trump ultimately flipped in November and re-nominated Isaacman.

The billionaire will now oversee a trimmed-down space agency that Trump has tasked with returning to the Moon. SpaceX has a contract to land astronauts on the lunar surface, though Duffy had threatened to revoke that contract, and encouraged Jeff Bezos’ rival company Blue Origin to try to beat Musk’s effort.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/youtube-to-pull-music-data-from-billboards-charts-because-it-doesnt-like-its-ranking-formula/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">YouTube is pulling its data from Billboard for use in the publisher’s industry-leading U.S. music charts. The decision is in response to a recent change Billboard made to its ranking formula, which continues to add more weight to paid, on-demand streaming compared with ad-supported, free streaming.

Billboard justified its decision to adjust its age-old formula by saying that the change will “better reflect an increase in streaming revenue and changing consumer behaviors.”

In other words, streaming now matters more than buying albums or songs, so it wants its charts to reflect that.

However, YouTube doesn’t like the new formula because it doesn’t want there to be much — if any — differentiation between free and paid streams, especially if the changes are meant to reflect how consumers today are enjoying music.

“Billboard uses an outdated formula that weights subscription-supported streams higher than ad-supported. This doesn’t reflect how fans engage with music today and ignores the massive engagement from fans who don’t have a subscription,” a YouTube blog post published on Wednesday explains. “Streaming is the primary way people experience music, making up 84% of U.S. recorded music revenue.”

“We’re simply asking that every stream is counted fairly and equally, whether it is subscription-based or ad-supported—because every fan matters and every play should count,” the post notes.

The ranking changes will be reflected starting with the charts published on January 17, which will include data from January 2-8, 2026. This will impact the Billboard 200 lists and genre-based album charts. In addition, the ratio between paid/subscription and ad-supported on-demand streaming tiers will be adjusted to 2.5:1 for the Billboard Hot 100, Billboard said.

To protest the new formula, YouTube said it will no longer provide data to Billboard after January 16, 2026.

Here’s what that change means in practice: Under the revised calculation, Billboard said it will take 33.3% fewer ad-supported on-demand streams of songs from an album, and 20% fewer paid/subscription on-demand streams of songs from an album, to equal an album unit. In short, it will take fewer streams than before for an album to climb the charts. This is a win for streaming in general but not necessarily for YouTube.

Here’s why. At present, the formula Billboard uses defines an album unit (the standard measurement for chart rankings) as one album sale. It counts 10 individual songs from an album as one album consumption unit, as well.

On the streaming side, it currently says an album unit equals 3,750 ad-supported streams — like YouTube’s  — or 1,250 paid/subscription official audio and video streams.

After the changes, those figures will be adjusted, so it will take 2,500 ad-supported streams or 1,000 paid/subscription streams to count as one album unit. This means paid streams count 2.5x as much as ad-supported streams. While that’s less of a gap than the current 3:1 ratio, it’s still not what YouTube would prefer seeing here. The company is essentially doing what companies do in failed negotiations like this: it’s taking its ball and going home.

Of course, by not cooperating with Billboard, YouTube’s music data won’t be considered in chart rankings, which could lead labels and artists to deprioritize publishing their music on YouTube. That’s not a good long-term strategy for YouTube as an important player in the streaming music era. That’s why this move should be viewed as the negotiation tactic it is.

“We are committed to achieving equitable representation across the charts and hopefully can work with Billboard to return to theirs,” YouTube’s announcement concludes.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">YouTube has won exclusive rights to stream the Oscars starting in 2029, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Wednesday. The Google-owned platform outbid other contenders, including the Oscars’ longtime home ABC, ending the network’s streak of hosting the awards show since 1961 (with the exception of a brief period in the early 1970s).

YouTube’s first show will be the 101st Oscars in 2029, and its deal will run through 2033. ABC will continue to broadcast the ceremony until 2028.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The news, which marks a landmark shift for one of television’s marquee events, highlights YouTube’s growing dominance in the television space and a major shift as streaming takes on more live events. The ceremony will be available live and for free to more than 2 billion viewers globally on YouTube, as well as to YouTube TV subscribers in the United States. The move comes as Oscar ratings have steadily fallen from a peak of 55 million viewers in 1998 to closer to 20 million in recent years, prompting the Academy to explore new ways to reach audiences.

“We are thrilled to enter into a multifaceted global partnership with YouTube to be the future home of the Oscars and our year-round Academy programming,” said Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Lynette Howell Taylor in a joint statement. “The Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible — which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community.”

As part of the deal, YouTube will not only broadcast the ceremony, but also red carpet coverage, behind-the-scenes content, the Oscar nominations announcement, Academy member and filmmaker interviews, Governors Ball access, film education programs, podcasts, and more.

“The Oscars are one of our essential cultural institutions, honoring excellence in storytelling and artistry,” YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said in a statement. “Partnering with the Academy to bring this celebration of art and entertainment to viewers all over the world will inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars’ storied legacy.”

Although this isn’t the first time a streamer has acquired the rights to an awards show — Netflix has secured rights to the SAG Awards — it’s the first time one of the big four awards shows (Emmys, Grammys, Oscars, and Tonys) will leave broadcast TV entirely in favor of streaming.

When I visited the Snapple website this week, I was served one of the drink brand’s famous fun facts: that a jiffy is an “actual time measurement equaling 1/100th of a second.” Fun indeed! And arguably even a little bit true!

In 2013 in The Atlantic, Adrienne LaFrance courageously exposed that many of Snapple’s bottle-cap facts were false. I wished to determine whether the company had since cleaned up its act; the intervening rebrand from “Real Facts” (scare quotes theirs) to Real Facts (no quotes!) felt like a vow.

Alas, a jiffy was first proposed as the name for the time light takes to travel one centimeter in a vacuum—about 33 trillionths of a second. In electronics, a jiffy might be 1/50 or 1/60 of a second. Only in Linux computing specifically can it be 1/100 of a second, and even then only sometimes.

Oh well. I did not have the heart to check the next statement: “Mangoes can get sunburned.” Whatever, sure. For the foreseeable future, stick with Atlantic Trivia for your fun facts.

And by the way, did you know that we owe the word quarantine to the Venetians? In the 15th century, the city required any ship arriving from a disease-stricken area to wait in the water for 40 days—quaranta in Italian—before entering Venice. At that point, it could safely be assumed that no one aboard was harboring plague.

Perhaps a solution for Venice’s overtourism today? You really want to see St. Mark’s Square? No problem—now just wait six weeks for it.

And by the way, did you know that the country of Liberia was founded when formerly enslaved Black Americans migrated there en masse in the mid-19th century? It’s the oldest republic in Africa (it declared independence in 1847), and it’s the only state there never colonized or occupied by a European power.

Its first 10 presidents were all born in the United States, and its capital, Monrovia, is the only in the world (other than America’s) to honor an American—namely, President James Monroe.</div>

On this week’s episode of The David Frum Show, The Atlantic’s David Frum opens with his thoughts on the shooting at Bondi Beach and the rise of anti-Semitic violence globally. He discusses what willing governments can do to crack down on radicals and prevent future acts of violence.

Then David is joined by Will Thomas, a professor at the Michigan Ross School of Business, to discuss Thomas’s paper “Crypto Kleptocracy.” David and Thomas discuss how the second Trump term has embraced the crypto industry, how cryptocurrencies have enriched the Trump family, and the new channels for corruption that crypto opens.

Finally, David discusses Joseph Conrad’s Lord Jim and what the novel can teach us about courage, a discussion relevant after an eyewitness reported that he thought police were slow to act during the terrorist attack on Bondi Beach.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

David Frum: Hello and welcome to The David Frum Show. I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. My guest this week will be Will Thomas, professor at the Michigan [Ross] School of Business, and we’ll be discussing the intersection of cryptocurrency and American kleptocracy, and how we can have a more honest approach to the management of both. My book of this week will be Lord Jim, by Joseph Conrad: a study of courage—what it means to have it, what it means to lack it.

But before the dialogue and before the book discussion, some opening thoughts on the terrible news this week from Australia, a massacre on Bondi Beach. Apparently, two gunmen, armed with hunting rifles, who killed, as I speak, a tally of 15 people, injured many more, who had gathered on the beach to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, the first night of Hanukkah. Much has been written about this terrible crime; I’ve written something myself on The Atlantic, and you can see my immediate thoughts there. I want, in this opening, to discuss something a little more practical, which is: What can be done about outrages like this? Are governments truly helpless in the face of this kind of anti-Semitic—and it didn’t have to be anti-Semitic; it could be some other kind of extremist hate—or is there more that could have been done that wasn’t done?

I draw attention to this fact: The two alleged, apparent gunmen are reportedly a father-and-son team, and the son, in particular, was known to the police. In fact, Australian police—the Australian security organization, which goes by the acronym ASIO—ASIO had put him under close scrutiny in 2019 because of his suspected ties to ISIS. They kept him under watch for about six months and then decided that he wasn’t an active threat to anybody and ceased to pay attention to him. And I’m not second-guessing that decision, because maybe they had good reasons. People deactivate and activate. The resources of a democratic country are large, but they’re not infinite; you cannot watch everybody anywhere. So I’m not second-guessing that decision. Maybe it was right; maybe it was wrong.

But the point is he was a known quantity. And when you get these kinds of radical actions, it very often happens that the people involved are known quantities. We are no longer in the al-Qaeda days, where a foreign terrorist group infiltrates sleeper agents into a country, tells them to avoid all contact with the police—Drive the speed limit; keep out of the public eye; don’t get in trouble; don’t get arrested—until the day to strike. The extremist actions that are happening in the 2020s are much more local. They import the technology, the know-how, the ideology, but the persons themselves are from the place where the crime is committed, usually, or they’ve been there for a while, at least. And they’ve had a chance to break other kinds of laws, as they often have done. So they’re known to the authorities.

Now, again, the authorities do not have infinite resources; they can’t watch everybody. And in a free society, anyway, there are limits on what “watching” means. You can’t just send an agent to follow somebody around because you think he might, at some point in the future, do some heinous act. But what they can do is put pressure, put various kinds of legal pressure, on the world from which these outrages come.

In Australia, in my native Canada, in the United States too, the movement that has expressed itself in anti-Semitic murders—like this one in Sydney; like the murder of two and the wounding of three in Manchester, England, on Yom Kippur this year; like the assassination of two people here in Washington earlier in the year 2025—those people usually have associations with some kind of radicalized group, and that group is something the government can monitor. And what it can do is be aware that, in these kinds of groups, that there are kind of circles: There’s a hardest core of people who might be on their way to committing an act of violence. There’s a slightly outer core of people who, without committing the act of violence themselves, will support and enable the act of violence and have a pretty good idea that the act of violence is coming. And then beyond them, a group of activists who maybe don’t know that an act of violence is coming but press the law and create permissions that enable the people who are more active, more militant to go forward. And then outside them is a larger group of well-wishers and fellow travelers who may share ideas and principles but probably aren’t in the movement for the long haul.

One of the things that’s very important to do is to separate the soft groups from the hard groups and to make sure that the hard groups understand they’re not gonna have as much permission and protection as they think they do. And this begins by enforcing laws pretty strictly and pretty impartially, a let me give you an example of what I mean. In September of 2025, a supporter of the anti-Israel cause rode along Bondi Beach—didn’t just ride, galloped on horseback on Bondi Beach—holding a Palestinian flag. Now he didn’t commit—no one was hurt. But this was a reckless action. People could have been hurt. The beach is crowded. We have no idea how good a rider he is, and anyways, it’s illegal to ride a horse on the beach. He was let go with a warning. Now, if you walk your cocker spaniel on Bondi Beach, you will face a fine of up to 330 Australian dollars. If a restaurant, a sidewalk café, doesn’t place its chairs properly, there’s a fine for them. But someone, because he came from a favored political group, was able to break the law and do it with impunity, or with a warning, and that sends a message about the attitude of the public authorities. Now, that doesn’t affect the hard-core person who’s determined to commit violence, but it does affect those who are making a decision: How far along the way do I go with this hard-core person who’s willing to commit violence?

A lot of anti-Israel violence since October 7 takes the form of a kind of playacting: dressing up in terrorist outfits; occupying public spaces in illegal ways, like putting up tents that are normally prohibited but putting them up on university campuses and defying the authorities to do anything about it; the riding the horse on Bondi Beach—that kind of thing. There’s a kind of playacting. But the playacting is not just a form of expression; it’s also a form of testing the attitude of the authorities. And if the authorities are more resilient and robust, the people who don’t wanna get in trouble, which is most of us, will back away from the playacting and will retreat to more lawful forms of protest.

No one is saying you don’t have a right to express your views on any contentious issue, and you wanna picket, picket. But for every picketer, there are rules that govern what is legal time, place, and manner—methods of picketing. And the anti-Israel movement systematically breaks those rules, at first in quite modest ways, but then in more and more threatening ways. Maybe it’s not the biggest deal in the world that somebody puts up a tent and breaks the campus rules on camping on the quad overnight. It’s a bigger deal when they are forming mobs in front of day-care centers or synagogues or old-age homes or hospitals, all of which have happened in many cities, and blowing whistles in the middle of the night. And, again, testing: Is anyone watching? Will anyone do anything about us?

And, again, if you enforce the rules, you are not going to necessarily deter the most violent person, but you can successfully separate the most violent people from the support structures that they need. And it becomes especially dangerous when the reason that that separation does not happen is, if there is a government, as was the case with the Australian federal government at present, as has been the case with some Canadian governments, both federal and provincial, where the government, in some ways, looks to the soft part of the movement for some kind of political support. So it’s worried, The reason we’re not going to enforce the law on riding horses on Bondi Beach, the reason we’re not gonna enforce the rules about blowing whistles under the windows of hospitals’ emergency units, the reason we’re not gonna stop you from mobbing in front of synagogues or day-care centers in ways that are clearly meant to be intimidating is because some of the people in this mob may vote for us—or, anyway, are connected in ways to people who vote for us, because that tells the mob that the government is afraid of them. And that is a very different dangerous feeling for a government to communicate.

Managing the problem of how do we protect lawful protests, lawful dissent—whatever one thinks of the particular dissent—and separating it from taking the steps along the pathway to violence begins by understanding that people who are really good liberals in their heart think that free speech becomes most important and precious when it’s at the very outermost edge, that when the speech is at its most extreme and when it is tempting us most to do something to suppress it, that’s when it most needs to be protected. And so, when somebody is chanting some hideous slogan or protesting under the windows of an old-age home, that’s exactly where the free-speech instincts need to be most robust; that’s the way many strongly principled liberals think. But not everyone in that crowd is a strongly principled liberal. They’re thinking in a different way. They’re thinking, I am testing and probing as to what is possible, and if this is possible, then the next thing will be possible. And I’m not walking up to a bright boundary; I’m changing the nature of the boundary, and I’m pushing and pushing and pushing to test and expose the weakness of the authorities and building a network, a community, that includes people who will take up a gun and mow people down on a beach in Australia.

Frum: Will Thomas is assistant professor of business law at the Michigan Ross School of Business. He is the co-author, with Jeffery Zhang, of an article called “Crypto Kleptocracy,” which was published in the November 2025 online edition of the Michigan Law Review. And it’s that article that sparked the conversation. I’ve written a little bit about crypto for The Atlantic; I focused especially on the problem with stablecoins. But Will Thomas and his co-author Jeffery Zhang point us to another direction, which is the power of cryptocurrency to enable government corruption.

Their article begins by pointing us to two converging lines of threat to American political integrity. The first is the change in the law of public integrity that has been advanced by the Supreme Court over the past dozen years and especially in a 2016 case, which involved the corruption trial of a former governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell. In the case McDonnell v. the United States, the Supreme Court dealt with these facts: The governor of Virginia and his wife had taken $175,000 in cash and gifts from someone with an interest before state government. The governor had enabled meetings for this donor, set ’em up with people on their state bodies that oversaw the interests that the donor had an interest in. And the governor facilitated those meetings and gave a kind of indication of the answer that he would like to see, but there wasn’t an explicit, Here’s the bag of swag. Here’s the favor in return. And the Supreme Court said, You can’t convict a governor of a state of bribery on those charges. Merely setting up meetings does not count as an “official act” under public-corruption statutes.

Now, this makes it extremely difficult to convict anybody of anything because corruption, as the Supreme Court wants it, you have to enter into the mind of the person. You have to say, The official receives this benefit from the donor, and in return, they do that favor. That can be hard to prove. The things that are easy to prove is that the meeting happened and the favorable result ensued, but we don’t know exactly what was inside everybody’s brain. The Supreme Court has made it very difficult to prove. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency industry has created this extraordinary method of flowing cash, or the equivalent of cash, to all kinds of people, including public officials, in ways that are very hard to trace, and it is the convergence of these two things that inspired the article “Crypto Kleptocracy.”

This is especially relevant because of what is happening at the federal level with President [Donald] Trump. President Trump has made, since being elected to the presidency last November and since becoming president in January, an enormous fortune—hundreds of millions, maybe even in excess of $1 billion—from cryptocurrency. One of the cryptocurrency schemes that the president floated was the launching of a meme coin called $TRUMP. That came on the market at the beginning of 2025. It was sold for $75 per coin—more than $75. I looked it up this morning—I’m speaking to you on the 15th of December—and the coin is trading for about five and a half dollars. So it’s lost 90 percent of its value. And one of the questions we’re invited to ask is: Did the people who lost all that money buying crypto coins, are they dupes? Or did they not care? Did they think, This is a great way of advancing money to the president?

So I thought, in that context, very important to reach out to Will Thomas to talk about “Crypto Kleptocracy.” Will, thank you so much for joining me today.

Will Thomas: Hey, David. Thank you for having me on today.

Frum: So let’s start with this question. You’re a law professor; you think about upholding the law. I wanna invite you to think like a lawbreaker. So, you and I, we are no-goodniks. We are out there in no-goodnik-land, and we are planning to get a favor from a public official—let’s say a state governor to make it less inflammatory. And you’re the expert, and I turn to you and say, I wanna deliver this governor a big pile of cash in ways that make it difficult for me to be punished, and I have some favors to ask. What’s my way? How should I do that? How should I structure this deal to get my favor from my governor with minimal legal risk?

Thomas: So, unfortunately, what I would tell you is it’s gotten a lot easier, and it’s gotten a lot easier both for decisions like McDonnell that you mentioned but also just a variety of Supreme Court decisions that have really narrowed what we think of as sort of legally enforceable corruption.

What the courts are really looking for these days is a pretty explicit sort of quid-pro-quo relationship. And the things that have been ruled out are the more casual gift with no explicit request for something of value, even though that’s well understood in sort of social practice. They have ruled out, recently, gratuities, so my giving something of value to an elected official after they took the actions that I wanted them to take. And they’ve ruled out giving money in exchange for maybe even explicit promises to somebody who is temporarily out of office. So we saw, most recently, Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, was caught in an FBI sting receiving a bag of $50,000 in cash with explicit promises to steer government contracts once he came into office. The current administration dropped that case, and there’s many reasons for that. But one of them is, I think they could point to Supreme Court cases saying that is not illegal behavior. So the advice I’d be giving a client is, Look, there’s about two or three things that you can’t do to influence a politician, but short of that, be as transactional as you wanna be, and chances are, the law is gonna protect you, and even if the law doesn’t protect you, the enforcement rates are so low that you don’t have to worry about it.

Frum: So I hear three opportunities, three fantastic opportunities to advance my case with my governor. The first is, if I get him the money or the benefit before he wins the election. The second is, if I get him the benefit or the money after he does the favor. And the third is, if I can just blur the connection between the money and the favor, and say, Nowhere is it going to be written down that ‘here’s the bag of swag in return for the favor.’ It’s just: I’m giving you gifts, and you’re doing me favors, and it’s kind of blurry, especially if the favors are not exactly, like, an order written in your handwriting, but you’ve set up a meeting, you’ve told the zoning board, you’ve told the state educational foundation that this is the result that would be good for the state, it happens to align with my interests, and you get the present. On all of these cases, I’m probably safe?

Thomas: I think that’s right. I think you got three pretty solid pathways these days to avoid getting in trouble.

Frum: Okay. Well, that’s great news for me as the corrupt donor. But I’m worried about my reputation. It’s not just enough for me to escape the law. Even though I can probably get away with it if indicted, I’d rather not be indicted, and I’d rather just not have people know about it. Is there a way to make this more anonymous?

Thomas: Right. Absolutely. And this is, I think, where crypto really enters the scene. Obviously, if there are ways to do these things without being detected, that’s gonna do two things—

Frum: Yeah. That’s great. That’s what I’m looking for.

Thomas: Right. So crypto is this cheap, sort of anonymous piece of financial technology. It’s embedded in this industry that is increasingly falling between regulatory cracks, so there’s not a lot of oversight. And it’s hitting the scene right as we’re having this sort of steady retreat away from fraud and anti-corruption law. So you sort of put these things together: Crypto creates space—whether it is through something like meme coins, whether it’s through something like stablecoins—to funnel, frankly, huge amounts of cash or cash equivalents to a willing politician without a lot of ability to even track what’s going on. So as long as your corrupt governor is putting themself up for business by, say, creating their own stablecoin or issuing their own meme coins, you’re gonna be able to funnel them quite a bit of money, and it will be virtually impossible for anybody else to track.

Frum: Okay, now we’re putting on something—so my corrupt governor has issued a meme coin. It’s going start worth $75; it’s going to rapidly fall to nothing, but I don’t care. What I want—I want him to know that the money came from me, but I don’t want anyone else to know. Can I structure things that way?

Thomas: Right. So the sort of deep irony of crypto is it’s built atop this system that’s supposed to be giving us radical transparency, right? We know all the money that moves across wallets; we conceal all of that information. And yet the sector’s notorious for being sort of secretive and providing anonymity. So you need to find some way to connect to the governor themselves by, say, informing them directly. But nobody—well, it’ll be extraordinarily difficult for anyone to be able to take payments made by one wallet into the meme coin and identify that with you and specifically identify you in relation to some kind of agreement or quid pro quo. You basically have these entirely disconnected events, with very little correspondence between the real world and the sort of crypto ledger.

Frum: Let’s go slower there because we spend a lot of time thinking about this—many honest people don’t, and they shouldn’t. So what is cryptocurrency? What’s a coin? What’s a meme coin? Explain these terms a little bit.

Thomas: So we’re gonna focus on just meme coins and stablecoins because cryptocurrency is a broad sector, so it’s a little bit of misnomer; it covers lots of things.

So what a meme coin is—a meme coin is essentially a loyalty token. Somebody is going to issue a variety of tokens around a theme, around an idea, a name, whatever. And they’re going to try to convince people to purchase them, in essence to purchase them to express their loyalty to the underlying idea, to express their interest. It’s almost like a trading card, right? It’s not necessarily purchased for its value; it’s purchased ’cause you’re interested in it.

I say that—if you actually look at the practice of meme coins, they look a lot like penny stocks, right? Lots of people who buy these meme coins aren’t necessarily buying them because they want to say, I own a meme coin with Donald Trump’s name on it. They’re buying them as a get-rich-quick scheme. The thought is, This thing will be valuable for a short period of time. If I can buy a lot now and sell it before it drops from $75 to $5, I can make a quick buck.

Frankly, if you talk to people in the meme-coin world, there’s the marketing description, which is they’re these kind of like trading-card-style loyalty tokens, and then there’s the actual day-to-day practice, in which it just looks like a boiler-room kind of pump-and-dump scheme.

Frum: Okay, but I think we still haven’t explained to people what—so cryptocurrency is a bunch of computer code that has a unique location and that you persuade people that this computer code has some value. And the most famous of them is bitcoin; there are others. And there’s a value that is attached to this piece of code. There’s a promise that there will only be so many units of this piece of code. And although it doesn’t have any actual commercial uses, nonetheless, it has value, and simply because it’s traded back and forth, the value tends to increase. But it’s essentially computer code that exists on computer systems and is traded back and forth.

Thomas: That’s correct.  Frum: Have I said that correctly?

Thomas: That’s exactly right. So it is sort of fiat currency in the truest sense, right? We just have a purely digital or sort of computer representation of this thing.

Frum: Don’t call it—but it’s not a currency. You can’t buy anything with it.

Thomas: In practice, it is not like the U.S. dollar or the euro, right. It’s still a highly specialized set of folks trading it amongst themselves.

Frum: It’s super inconvenient, and I looked this up: According to the Federal Reserve, of the people who own cryptocurrency, only 2 percent of those people ever use it to buy anything, and 3 percent—and they may overlap with the 2 percent—ever use it even to transfer money back and forth. It’s a speculative asset that’s for holding and for trading, not for buying and for selling.

Thomas: And I think, actually, that description is important because, while lots of people who talk about crypto, and particularly advocates of crypto, talk about it in the future—It will be a currency; it will replace the dollar; it will be a seamless method of transaction—the actual practice today, what you’re looking at is exactly right. The actual practice today is people seem to be treating this as a risky or speculative investment, right? I’ve got my normal stocks and bonds, and I’m gonna put a little money in this wild thing that might, sort of arbitrarily, make me a huge amount of money.

I actually have a colleague who studies crypto investors: What do they like? What do they know? One of the things that surprises me is even people who choose to buy any kind of crypto asset, whether it’s bitcoin, whether it’s a meme coin, know almost nothing about what crypto is. In fact, if you ask them, What is the blockchain?, they say, I’ve never heard of that, even though blockchain is the sort of underlying technology, it is the heart of all crypto assets. It is that sort of digital ledger that you were describing a moment ago. So people, clearly, are doing this as some kind of investment scheme, even if the crypto industry would like to characterize it as something bigger and grander.

Frum: Look, if you wanna buy milk, you want U.S. dollars, euros, yen—whatever they’re taking in the country in which you live. If you wanna hold wealth safe from the ravages of inflation, you wanna buy gold or real estate or, if you have good taste, art. There are all kinds of hard assets that retain value in times of monetary inflation.

But what it’s really great for is if you’re an international terrorist group and you wanna move money back and forth, or if you are a drug dealer and you wanna convert your piles of cash into something that you can put in a bank, it’s really useful. And that’s how the people at Binance got into trouble, because their platform was used that way, and the allegation against Binance was they knew it and organized their platform to help terrorists and drug dealers. And for that, the head of Binance was convicted and sent to prison because a jury accepted that he knowingly helped terrorists and drug smugglers.

Thomas: That’s exactly right. In addition to being this sort of purely digital representation of a thing of value, the crypto industry is very good at bouncing transactions through what people usually describe as shell companies, right? It’s very good at masking transactions. And, yeah, you don’t even have to say allegations—the Binance founder and Binance were convicted of federal crimes, including money laundering, and that money laundering was related to helping terrorist organizations cover up their activities so that they would avoid U.S. regulatory scrutiny. This is deeply harmful to national-security interests. This is a profoundly worrisome use of the technology.

Frum: So if I’m involved in the business of terrorist money laundering and I think, I could use a little political muscle behind me of the regular state—so here’s where this all [comes] tremendously back to our scheme about bribing the corrupt governor. So we can take some of this crypto money and funnel it to him. Now, my governor has got a problem, which is he’s actually quite a shrewd person, and he understands that cryptocurrency moves around a lot in value and what is $1 million today might be half a million tomorrow—it might be $2 million tomorrow, but it might be half a million tomorrow. He likes U.S. dollars, so he wants to know that he can count on this for his old age. He wants $200,000—not ether or dogcoin or catcoin—$200,000. How can I get him $200,000?

Thomas: So I think this is actually where stablecoins become the much bigger sort of public-corruption concern and threat.

The basic idea of a stablecoin is, if I described a meme coin as sort of a pump-and-dump scheme—something whose value fluctuates a lot—stablecoins are invented, their design proposed, to try to solve that volatility problem. And the way we’re gonna solve it is I’m gonna issue coins, and I’m gonna say, For each coin I issue you give me $1. I’m gonna take that $1, I’m gonna put it in the safest investment I know—I’m gonna put ’em in short-term U.S. Treasuries—and I’m gonna keep it there. And that way, if you ever want to cash your coin back in, you will get it for exactly $1, and you know that asset is protected.

That’s great. If I hold to my word, that solves that stability problem, which means you’ve got a straightforward way to cash out these investments. That’s the sort of first move we might make to make your governor feel a little bit more comfortable.

Frum: So if the governor wants to be a more active person in the corruption scheme, he issues a meme coin. It’s CorruptGovernor.com, or whatever the coin—$CORRUPTGOVERNOR—and he says, Look, buy my meme coin. Pay me $75 per coin. The Supreme Court has said, That’s fine. No problem. And no one understands it, so there’s no reputational risk. And it’ll fall to $5, but you don’t care about the money; what you care about is knowing that I got $75 from you, or $75 times however many units you wish to buy. But if the governor is more passive, the stablecoins are the way to go, and that, he says, I don’t have to be a participant here; I just receive the stablecoins, and I know I’ve got $200,000 in swag, and I will look favorably upon whatever it is you want me to do.

Thomas: Correct. Receiving the stablecoins are going to—they’ll hold their value over time, so that’s sort of an easy passive receipt. And, frankly, if the governor wants to go in the sort of more active direction, I think stablecoins are also, actually, both less risky, less sort of—

Frum: The governor could issue his own stablecoin. But then, you’re just making the money on the float because the meme coin you can make out of nothing, whereas, at least theoretically, with the stablecoins, you have to buy some U.S. Treasury bills.

Thomas: That’s correct. You’re making money just on the float. On the other hand, you are making money on third-party transactions that don’t necessarily involve you. This adds another level of removal, anonymity for your governor, right? So if you have a stablecoin that is out there that you’ve helped generate, two parties can engage in a transaction that never explicitly involves you at all, right—it’s just two private parties in the market. As long as they make that transaction using your stablecoin, you will then be getting a float off that. And, of course, those parties can engage in open-market transactions; they never have to say your name or involve you in any capacity. But you know what they’re doing, and that is that informal sort of not-quite-quid-pro-quo relationship.

Frum: In fact, we have not just a governor, but a president of the United States and his family engaging in these operations. Do you have any doubt that what President Trump has been doing this year is legal?

Thomas: I would say—I can imagine facts coming out that would change my mind, but at least based on what we know so far, I think that virtually all of the activity President Trump has engaged in around the crypto industry is legal. And I would go further and say some of those things are legal because of changes in the second Trump administration.

Frum: Oh, okay. So he’s made a billion dollars. Part of that money has been selling for $75 things that are, today, worth $5, and that’s legal. And part of that money has been made from issuing these stablecoins, which purport to be worth a constant value, although, as readers of my Atlantic article on the subject will know, they are guaranteed to fail sooner or later—almost certainly guaranteed to fail—but they fail more slowly than the meme coins, which go from $75 to $5 in a few months. And he’s been doing both of these things, and he’s made, apparently, a billion dollars—as president, because of the presidency—and it’s legal.

Thomas: Yes. I believe that all of this is legal, unless we were able to find out the exact, narrow, exacting kind of quid-pro-quo facts—

Frum: Unless he got some bad lawyering and made some really unnecessary—because he could make the billion dollars in ways that most people would regard as pretty unconscionable, so you’d have to have some pretty bad advice or be very, very greedy and stupid—

Frum: —to break a law when you don’t need to. You can make the same dubious billion dollars without breaking any laws.

Frum: Why don’t all the presidents do this? Crypto was invented all the way back in 2012, ’13. Why didn’t President [Barack] Obama make a billion dollars this way?

Thomas: So I think that there’s a couple things going on here. One is gonna be personality-driven, right? We’ve seen Donald Trump the president, in his first term, has a very different sort of attitude about these sorts of presidential self-enrichment practices. He had a hotel that was right next to the White House. He sold the hotel. He’s now bought a publicly traded company in Truth Social that, again, presented all these conflict-of-interest concerns. So, psychologically, he’s disposed to these kinds of behaviors.

I would say that the crypto industry has evolved in some ways, has become a more stable, reliable platform. The development of stablecoins, in particular, opens up a, frankly, a much safer way for politicians to exploit these things for value.

And the last really important thing is that, in addition to changes in corruption law, the federal government has struggled to figure out how it wants to regulate crypto coins. It has not yet had a sort of consistent answer; it bounces from scandal to scandal. The second Trump administration has pulled back from virtually all crypto enforcement and regulation. So there are some things going on right now that—

Frum: Let me stop you. I wouldn’t describe that as the government can’t figure it out. The Biden administration figured out: These things are poison. They have no legitimate use. Let’s try to discourage people from buying them. And the second Trump administration figured out: I personally can make a billion dollars if I say, Let ’em rip, so let ’em rip. That’s not, like, a “they’re baffled by the problem.” Both Biden and Trump were incredibly unbaffled. Biden said they, They’re poison. They have no legitimate use. Try to stop them. Trump said, They can make me rich. Let’s go for it. Neither president had any kind of intellectual uncertainty about crypto and what it is; they’ve had a big disagreement.

Thomas: That’s fair, yeah. So there are some crypto assets, like bitcoin and ethereum, where there seems to be some bipartisan consensus of, like, We see a use for it. Maybe we’ll allow it to go. But you’re absolutely right. With respect to the meme coins themselves, in particular, the Biden administration took a pretty aggressive view against these. They also took an aggressive stance towards a lot of the sort of exchanges that were letting things float in, were maybe sort of the source of a lot of the problems. And those actions have been unwound by the Trump administration; those investigations have stopped. And Trump has been using his pardon power, again, pretty aggressively to pardon folks convicted of fraud, but especially crypto-related fraud.

Frum: I think if I said to a lot of people, Look, there’s this industry—maybe it’s crypto, maybe it’s cigarettes, maybe it’s baseball trading cards, maybe it’s asbestos—and it’s got a product that a lot of people think is harmful. Not everybody—some people think it’s good. But a lot of people think it’s harmful. And one president tried to control it, and another president has said, Let it go. And the president who said, Let it go, has made a billion dollars outta the industry in nine months, I think most people would say, I have a pretty clear picture of what happened here. And even if I am inclined to think that the cigarettes or the asbestos is not as harmful as other people do, I don’t think the president who said, Let it rip, should make a billion dollars in nine months out of what some people regard as asbestos or cigarettes.

Thomas: I think you’re putting your finger on why we wrote this piece, right? To us, at least—and I think most people would agree—there is a big disconnect between what the law allows right now and what it prohibits and what I think anybody on the street would think of as sort of clearly corrupt behavior.

Now, look, that’s always true. Criminal law does never perfectly map onto our moral intuitions, but here, there seems [to be] a really glaring gap. And if anything, the gap has been, sort of both steadily and then acutely, growing a lot bigger. And our worry is not just this administration—although this is a profound worry—our worry is, is Trump playing the role of entrepreneur, where he is showing future politicians exactly the playbook to run if they wanna sort of follow in his footsteps?

Frum: (Laughs.) Yes. The next president may not literally do it because of publicity, but why shouldn’t a governor, why shouldn’t a president of Brazil or a prime minister of Japan, some other world leader, why—now, maybe other countries have stricter public-corruption laws. Maybe in Japan, if you take the money after doing the favor, they still say, Sorry, we’re not such idiots that taking the money after the favor means that we don’t see what happened here. That’s only in America, is that going to be a defense.

Thomas: Right. Everybody’s gonna have their own ways of working out these details. Although Europe is a great example of a jurisdiction that is very concerned about the crypto industry, that has been doing more than the United States to try to figure out how to regulate it, bring it under control, and there, too, there’s very little attention to this specific problem of how crypto enables public corruption. So even an area that is really focused on dealing with crypto has just not started to pay attention to the ways that there’s this huge problem.

Frum: Well, look, there’s so many ways that crypto is dangerous, and I referred to an article I wrote in The Atlantic about stablecoins. If you saw It’s a Wonderful Life, and who hasn’t, you know the problem of: You think the money’s in the bank, but it’s not really in the bank; it’s in all the different houses sponsored by the savings and loan. If everybody shows up at the same time to get their money out, even Mr. Bailey, as wonderful as he is, as honest as he is, can’t pay the money back, and now, imagine if Mr. Bailey was kind of a crook.

So the solution that was found after the events depicted in that movie was to say, Okay, first, we’re gonna have quite strict regulation about how the money is paid. We’re gonna have quite strict attention to the books of the Bailey savings and loan. And oh, by the way, we’re gonna have a federal stopgap so that if everyone—even if it’s Bailey, and he’s honest, and the money really is in people’s houses, and of course, he can’t turn all the money into cash all in an hour, we’ve got a federal guarantee [backing] him, that the federal government will provide the cash and Mr. Bailey will pay us back out of the insurance premiums he’s been paying for years of honest behavior.

So stablecoins are like Bailey’s savings and loan without the federal deposit insurance and without the proper system of auditing. It’s a promise: The money’s there. You all show up at the same time, we have no way to make sure that you all get your money at once, and maybe it’s not as honest as Bailey savings and loan.

Thomas: Well, I love that you bring up this example, in part because my co-author, Jeff Zhang, and I, we started this project in part because we were polishing off another essay that we’d written all about the return of bank runs—Silicon Valley [Bank], all these sorts of companies—which themselves are being driven largely by sort of speculative crypto assets that cause these problems. And as we were talking, Jeff, who’s more of a crypto expert than I am, was describing—we were talking about the Trump meme coin, and then he mentioned USD1 to me—this is the Trump family’s stablecoin—and in reading about it, I had exactly the same reaction you had a few moments ago, which is, This seems plainly corrupt. How is this allowed to happen? And that sort of kicked off this project.

Absolutely, there’s a deep tie between a traditional finance system that has seen the problems over time, has learned to address them and mostly ameliorate them, and then this new thing called crypto that takes itself to be a technological innovation and so sort of not subject to history, even though we know what happens when you create these kinds of investments, whether you call them cash or crypto: It leads to predictable problems. And right now, the predictable solutions to the predictable problems are not in place.

Frum: Okay. So let’s say we want the next president of the United States not to make a billion dollars in nine months from an industry that is maybe dangerous and that he’s regulating. How would we stop this?

Thomas: So there’s a variety of different things you might think about doing in this space. Some are gonna apply more specifically to a president versus, say, other politicians. So the first easy thing is just we need to reverse what the SEC has done under the second Trump administration. Go back to the Biden approach, and you can tweak it however you’d like, but start with the general instinct that these are securities; they’re being traded and treated like securities. We have a whole enforcement tool kit. We need to take advantage of that.

Frum: —just to explain something. So all over D.C., there are people who have BMWs and Lexuses that they’ve acquired by lobbying for the question, “Is cryptocurrency—is it a security or not?” Because the rules on securities—since the Great Depression, the United States government has put in place some very strict rules—you can really go to prison for lying about a security. But if it’s not a security, then the penalties for lying are a lot more lax.

And so one of the reasons cryptocurrency is called “cryptocurrency,” even though it’s useless as currency, is because, mostly: crypto, not a security so I don’t go to prison if I lie about it—whatever; fill in word here—so I need to call it something other than a security, even though it really is a security. It’s a derivative. It is a security, but if, again, if you lie about a security, the Securities and Exchange Commission will put you in jail, whereas if you lie about a currency, the rules are much slacker.

Thomas: That’s exactly right. So securities are—we have lots of law, lots of clear understanding of how to enforce them. The Securities and Exchange Commission is sort of the first among equals of financial regulators. They’re very professional. They know how to bring a lot of resources to these kinds of challenges.

And, frankly, we’ve had a definition of what counts as a security going back to the ’50s, and when I teach business students, when I teach undergraduates, I give them the test, and then I ask them to apply them to what they know about crypto assets, and they almost to a person agree, Oh, well, if that’s the test, these are securities.

So I think we have a straightforward story about why we need to undo what the second Trump administration has done there.

Frum: One step we can take is pass a law that says, Cryptocurrency shall henceworth be known as “crypto securities.” They are securities, they’re regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and if you lie about them, you do go to prison.

Thomas: Great. Easy first step. I think that’s where we should start. The second step would be with Congress.

It is true, right, that this technology looks a little different than other kinds of frauds we’ve seen in the past. But, look, the federal government has lots of fraud statutes: We have a securities-fraud statute. We have mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud. There is no reason why we shouldn’t have a crypto-fraud statute that directly grapples with how this technology is different, how it moves, how it enables fraud.

The Supreme Court has been pulling back on corruption laws, but in the Supreme Court’s defense, the reason that they have been pulling back is because the statutes that exist are often written in fairly broad language; they are subject to wide interpretation. And so Congress should take the lesson, right? If the Supreme Court is concerned about these generic, vague criminal statutes, we need a crypto-fraud statute that is pointed and sharp and actually addresses the problem.

Frum: What are the things that we most would want to fix in public corruption? I’m actually a little bit more sympathetic to the Tom Homan case, where you say, Look, you gave somebody money, thinking maybe someday they’ll be important. And that looks pretty bad in the case of Tom Homan, where he became important some months later. But what if you give somebody money, and they become important 20 years later? These things do get a little hard. But the idea that giving them the money after the official act, or broadening the definition of “political acts” so all the wink-and-nod ways that political corruption is typically done, those get a bye, those seem like things we need to fix faster.

Thomas: I think that’s right. And, look, I agree with you that we have strong intuitions of what counts as corruption, and it is easy to point to obvious cases of bad behavior. And it’s also easy to point to cases where you say, like, My congressman did a favor for my child to let them get a pass to go to visit the White House, and next month, I sent them a card, or when I sent in my contribution to the candidate, I wrote, Thanks for all the help. Is that really corruption? I think, no, that’s probably not. And so finding laws that parse those lines carefully is genuinely hard; I don’t wanna be dismissive of that. But I do think that there’s low-hanging—

Frum: If you included a gold watch with the thank-you note, however …

Thomas: Right. I think that’s exactly right. I think there’s a difference between—

Thomas: (Laughs.) No, no, you’re totally right. Like, just ’cause there’s dusk and dawn doesn’t mean there’s not night and day, right? We can knock out some low-hanging fruit here by looking at things like dollar amounts, by looking at connections, behavior. Instead of trying to make it this deeply formal, logical connection, we can just be context-sensitive human beings. You can look at some situations and say, That seems problematic to me, right? The new playing field’s problematic—

Frum: [What] you can just generally do [as] a kind of rule of thumb is: Do we have a big problem in the United States of people who look like they’re mildly careless politicians ending up in prison for mildly careless actions? Do we have a lot of those? I can’t think of many examples of that. And do we have a lot of examples of things that look really shocking that turn out to be, not only do they get away with it, but it turns out there’s nothing to get away with because, actually, it was legal the whole time, and Obama was just a fool not to do it?

Thomas: Right. The problem is always “What is legal?,” not “What is illegal?” here. The outlier cases are interesting, but they seem like slam dunks. It’s the first [Bob] Menendez prosecution that gets dismissed. It’s the [McDonnell] case. These are the situations where I think any layperson would have looked at it and said, Oh, yeah, that’s obviously a corrupt politician who’s probably going to prison, and it turns out, Oh, you’re so mistaken. That is absolutely legal behavior.

Frum: Yeah. There aren’t a lot of good explanations for a politician having an apartment full of gold bars.

Thomas: That’s correct. Or a freezer full of money, I think, was William Jefferson’s strategy back in my day.

Frum: So those are some of the things we wanna do on the public-integrity side. Let’s talk a little bit more about the crypto regulation—so, say, regulated as a security, put the Securities and Exchange Commission in charge. And what should we do about meme coins? If they’re a security, would they be considered just so obviously fraudulent that the SEC would crush them?

Thomas: When we first saw these definitions of securities coming around in the ’50s, what we were concerned about were penny stocks, right? And the problem with penny stocks—these were these thinly traded, highly volatile, very cheap quote-unquote stocks—and the question was: Are some of them legitimate investments, and are some of them just scams? And I think that broadly describes where we are with meme coins.

I’m open to the possibility that some of these are, in fact, legitimate investments. I also think that, just overwhelmingly, most of them are your sort of pump-and-dump scheme, where you’re engaged in behavior that, if securities law applied, you and I would say, Oh, that’s insider trading. That’s illegal. But because securities law doesn’t apply, that sort of deceptive-promotion, flag-the-thing-and-run practice is legal. So I think if securities law applied, if the SEC stepped in, what we would see is the category of meme coin would largely disappear, or at least the quantity of meme coins would be dropped as just not worth the risk.

Frum: And for the stablecoins, my solution for them—and tell me if you disagree with any of this—is I think we need to see: A stablecoin is a deposit-taking institution. If I give you $100 and you say, I’m putting the $100 in a vault somewhere. I’m gonna make a little bit of money on the interest arbitrage between the zero amount I’m paying you and the few basis points I can earn, and if I have enough money, if I have enough depositors, then 50 basis points here, 50 basis points there, it adds up to real money. But it’s a deposit-taking institution, and that means it needs to be audited all the time. They need to have federal deposit insurance, and they have to pay for it the way other deposit insurance companies do. Oh, and one more thing: It needs to be domiciled in the United States, the way every deposit-taking institution that’s called a bank has to be in the United States and almost none of the deposit-taking institutions that are called meme coin—they’re all somewhere in some jurisdiction like El Salvador, where they’re already very far beyond the reach of U.S. law. (Laughs.)

Thomas: Right. Well, and I will say, in very, very limited defense of Congress, because Congress passed a stablecoin-specific statute this year. It does not—

Frum: The GENIUS Act—so-called GENIUS Act.

Thomas: The GENIUS Act, yes. You made me say it.

Frum: What genius thought of this?, we’ll say after the big crash. (Laughs.)

Thomas: Right. There is way more that that statute should be doing; it does not do nearly enough. It does at least start to conceive of stablecoins as something that somebody like the Federal Reserve should be regulating. It’s a mild step towards the general idea you have, which is, look, this is just a version of banking by another name, right? This should be regulated the same way we regulate other deposit institutions.

Now, the other thing that I would say in this space is stablecoins are often presented as a solution to existing financial problems. The biggest one people point to is the difficulty of engaging in sort of cross-border money transfers. I think we lose track of the fact that that is almost entirely an American problem. Many other countries don’t have that problem. They don’t need stablecoins, because they’ve just solved them internally to their own banking system. So in some respects, what I think is we should address the technology, but we should also address the arguments for its demand by improving some of our financial-transaction systems in the United States. That will take away the reason to want to invest in stablecoins.

Frum: Yeah, and I completely agree with you on that. I think it’s a bit of a, again, ruse when you say, Why are we making it easier for Hezbollah to move money across continents?, and you say, Well, look at the problem that, if you’re a day laborer in the United States trying to send $200 back to Guatemala, Western Union charges you $19. And I think, I never heard you care about the day laborer before. And there are a lot of things we can do for that [laborer]—I agree with you; it shouldn’t cost $19 to send $200 to Guatemala. That’s one important problem. But that’s not why you’re making it easier for Hezbollah to move money around the planet.

Thomas: I fully agree with you. I think that thinking of crypto in that way is—it’s a trillion-dollar solution to a million-dollar problem.

Frum: Well, thank you so much for making time and walking us through all these difficult issues. I’m sorry I interrupted you so much, but you operate on such a high mental level, and I have such a cynical mind, and so I’m conscious that I lowered the tone of a lot of the discussion, but maybe I’m even right.

Thomas: No, I appreciate the interventions, in part because you’re right—it’s a technology, it’s a space that, I think, gets a lot of freedom from the fact that it’s complicated, that people are willing to move past and overlook it. And I think, at the end of the day, if the technology is complicated, what it is being used for is very simple, and what it is being used for is very troubling, and so reining it in—

Frum: I would say this was a technology invented by science-fiction fans and used by fans of The Godfather, and so we just need to bring a little bit more of the “read The Godfather” mindset into “read the Isaac Asimov Foundation-trilogy” mindset that created the coins in the first place.

Frum: It was a pleasure to talk to you. Bye-bye.

Frum: Thanks so much to Will Thomas for joining me today to talk about cryptocurrency and public corruption and the challenges to public integrity in the United States.

As I mentioned at the top of the program, my book this week is Lord Jim, by Joseph Conrad. Now, what’s brought Lord Jim back to the top of my reading list was a report—and this is not yet a verified report, so I don’t wanna overtax this—but a report from the horrific anti-Semitic massacre on Bondi Beach that Australian police officers were in the vicinity, were armed, and yet, for 20 minutes, seemed to have done nothing as the gunmen killed and killed, paused and reloaded—they were using hunting rifles, not automatic or semiautomatic weapons, so there was a lot of opportunities to stop them, and indeed, one heroic onlooker did rush one of the gunmen and bring them to earth.And this led me to think about courage—what it means, what it is, why people do and don’t take risks to protect others. And Lord Jim, which is a novel of the sea published in the year 1900, is a great meditation on this question.

Lord Jim is the story of a young Englishman named Jim who grows up in a country parsonage and dreams of adventure. And he especially dreams of being a hero, of rescuing people—he has images of himself prevailing in a storm, saving people, washing people to shore—and he chooses a career at sea as a way to achieve his dreams. And when I say “at sea,” he’s not in the navy—he’s in the merchant marine, but ferrying goods around the planet. And he is successful. He makes a good name for himself. He rises in the service. And then he has this terrible moment of testing.

He is on board a ship, the Patna, and with a very miscellaneous international crew, and they are carrying 800 passengers, pilgrims, from some port in India on pilgrimage to Mecca. The exact details of this are quite blurry in the book; Conrad doesn’t tell you where they’re going or where they’re coming from or even what is the nature of the so-called exacting faith, as he describes it in the novel. But that’s obviously what is going on. In the middle of the night, the Patna bumps into something at sea—maybe a sandbar or maybe some piece of underwater junk; it’s not clear—but the boat lurches and begins to take on water. It only has a single bulkhead to restrain the water, and if that bulkhead cracks, and it looks like it’s about to crack, the whole ship is going to sink in minutes, and they will all be doomed.

The officers, seeing the ship doomed, panic, and without regard for their passengers, they race to the lifeboats to save themselves. Jim urges them to hesitate, to try to do something to save the passengers, but the rest of the crew decides it’s doomed, including the captain. They race for the lifeboats, and they call on Jim to follow them, to jump into the lifeboat after them and save himself. He hesitates just for a moment, and then, motivated by some impulse he doesn’t even really understand in the course of the novel, he jumps and jumps into the lifeboat and abandons 800 people to be drowned—except they don’t drown. Turns out, the bulkhead holds. The ship is, the next day, rescued by a French vessel and pulled into a port, and a board of inquiries convened to examine the dereliction of duty of the crew of the Patna, who abandoned 800 passengers to apparent death.

Most of the crew then vanish. (Laughs.) They get out while the getting is good. But Jim stays to face justice, and that’s the beginning of the drama of the story. Because the narrators—and there are a series of different narrators of the story—have to make sense of who Jim was, this apparently decent, honorable person who wants to be a hero, and the neglect of duty that he committed.

One of the people who narrate the book, a captain called Charles Marlow, describes his first encounter with Jim: “I liked his appearance,” says Charles Marlow. “I liked his appearance; I knew his appearance; he came from the right place; he was one of us. He stood there for all the parentage of his kind, for men and women by no means clever or amusing, but whose very existence is based upon honest faith, and upon the instinct of courage. I don’t mean military courage, or civil courage, or any special kind of courage. I mean just that inborn ability to look temptations straight in the face—a readiness unintellectual enough, goodness knows, but without pose—a power of resistance, don’t you see, ungracious if you like, but priceless—an unthinking and blessed stiffness before the outward and inward terrors, before the might of nature, and the seductive corruption of man.” And he goes on to say, “This has nothing to do with Jim, directly; only he was outwardly so typical of that good, stupid kind we like to feel marching right and left of us … of the kind that is not disturbed by the vagaries of intelligence and the perversions of—of nerves, let us say. He was the kind of fellow you would, on the strength of his looks, leave in charge of the deck, figuratively and professionally speaking.”

Only, none of that turned out to be true. In the crisis, Jim broke. He didn’t do his duty. He abandoned people to their death, and he was then made to look a fool because his cowardice turned out to be utterly unnecessary. And Jim is tormented not just by his cowardice, but by the lost chance to shine as a hero when he was, in fact, had he only known it, safe the whole time, and if he had stayed aboard, the one man who did his duty, he would’ve been an enormous hero. And he misses that appearance of heroism as much as feels genuine guilt for the wrong he did.

And as another narrator comments of Jim, “He looked as genuine as a new sovereign,” sovereign being the solid gold coin that was the most prestigious unit of currency in the British empire. “He looked as genuine as a new sovereign, but there was some infernal alloy in his metal. How much? The least thing—the least drop of something rare and accursed; the least drop!—but he made you—standing there with his don’t-care-hang air—he made you wonder whether perchance he were nothing more rare than brass.”

Jim will spend the rest of his life trying to get back that moment of failed courage. And one of the interests of the novel is that, in the end, he does: He has a chance to do something where he has to really think in advance—he doesn’t have to rely on his instincts, but he has to make a very deliberate, premeditated decision to risk death, accept death, and he does, to save others. And so he redeems himself. But along the way, he raises the question of whether courage is one thing, two things, many different things; whether there’s a difference between courage in the moment and courage that has to be premeditated; and whether it detracts from our courage if the courage is done because you’re conscious of other people watching. Because when Jim goes to his heroic death, he goes viewed by all the people of a village he’s come to care about in an unnamed part of the East Indies. He goes under the view of all the people he cares about. Whereas when he failed to show courage, he was failing to show [it] alone and almost undetected, seen only by a handful of crewmates who were behaving as he did.

It makes you think about those police officers—if, indeed, the eyewitness is correct and they flinched from their duty, what do they think of themselves in the aftermath?

I’m thinking today of another sad thing. Rob Reiner, the great director, and his wife, Michele Reiner, were friends of my wife and myself. We were not close to them; they had 500 close friends, and we were 498 out of 500, maybe. But we received so many acts of kindness and goodness from them, and they seem to have met a very grim, untimely end at the hands of, apparently, reportedly, possibly, a loved one. If true, it’s hard to think of anything more fearsome and terrible. They are much in my mind today, and to all who admire his movies, to all who knew and loved Rob and Michele, we need to express our solidarity to each other. We have been deprived of two gracious, generous, and gentle human beings.

I’ll tell you one story about Rob Reiner before I go. One of the last times I saw him was, I think, in 2021. We were dropping our youngest daughter off at college. And then, after we dropped her off at college—she was in Los Angeles—I had arranged a dinner party with Rob Reiner and some other people in the political world whom he was interested to meet. And I made the reservation in my name. But we had been driving across the country, we dropped our daughter, so we were a little late. So the Reiners, embarrassingly for me, got there first, and I arrived just as they were being seated. And the look on the maître d’s face at me: You didn’t indicate that it was Rob Reiner who was—because we gave you the David Frum table, and if only we had known that Mr. and Mrs. Reiner were going to be here, they would be seated at the table where we have hastily moved them. And you should have warned us because you are nobody, and he is everything. And indeed, everything, he was.

How is a new soccer video game news? Isn&#39;t there a new soccer game released every year?

I see a games option on some streaming devices and I guess this informs me that NetFlix has streaming games too.

But, does anyone here play games on streaming devices? What&#39;s it like to play a game on Roku or Apple TV?

Gitlab and Forgejo are both open-source and self-hostable.

For self-hosting, try Fogejo instead. It should be a lot easier to host and administer, and has a nice &quot;smoothness&quot; to it. (I used to use it back when it was still Gitea...)

Utterly hilarious that X is so powerful that it can make Microsofties making long term price plans (which must have passed multiple committees)... just surrender and cancel their plans within a day.

Granted they&#39;re &quot;re-evaluating our approach&quot; so they&#39;ll try again later. But it&#39;s still funny.

Essentially it is a means for GitHub to spin up processes or scripts on machines(VM/physical) to do &quot;stuff&quot; when certain things happen in a GitHub repo.

Most common uses would be stuff like building and deploying software after a push to main.

You push(update) main(branch of your application code) and it triggers a runner, a GitHub agent software running on a VM or physical machine. The runner(agent) executes commands like compiling the code, testing, deploying to your preferred location. It does these execut

It would help if there&#39;s a graphics presenting this.

If you run on your own hardware then you can as well ignore github and also self-host your git repo.

Read the article. It has already been edited to announce that GitHub has reversed their decision, for now.

There will NOT be any charge for runners on your own hardware.

No charges for self-hosted Action runners. Until...

I always love this ploy. &quot;You are part of a small percentage of users whining about this, but our price changes are actually good for everyone else&quot;, as if you&#39;re supposed to take one for the good of humanity. Or Microsoft.

I don&#39;t believe it. I&#39;ve been repeatedly told that Rust code is memory safe and this sort of stupid programming error can&#39;t happen in Rust, only other languages.

it was in an &#39;unsafe&#39; section for what it is worth.

But then systems programing means you&#39;re going to have a lot of that.  So maybe rust really isn&#39;t such a good systems language... as it does not really get you much when you can&#39;t use its safety features.

Unsafe is very hard to avoid in Rust. It&#39;s pretty much impossible for something low level like kernel development. 20% of Rust packages use unsafe. And most Rust apps depend on multiple packages.

So, in other words, it really isn&#39;t any better at bare metal development than C/C++. If you have to direct memory and hardware manipulation in unsafe blocks, then really, it&#39;s just the same thing as doing it in C.

The applicable bit here is that the rust compiler enforces memory ownership rules that ought to prevent multiple threads from modifying the same memory address. By using an &quot;unsafe&quot; block of code, you&#39;ve told the compiler to turn those rules off.

I can&#39;t comment on how necessary an &quot;unsafe&quot; block would be in this instance, but I would guess that systems programming definitely requires unsafe blocks at times.

The applicable bit here is that the rust compiler enforces memory ownership rules that ought to prevent multiple threads from modifying the same memory address. By using an &quot;unsafe&quot; block of code, you&#39;ve told the compiler to turn those rules off.
At which point, you&#39;re (basically) using C - again.  Not saying that there&#39;s no benefit to Rust and its safe(er) sections, but being a good Rust programmer doesn&#39;t make you a good C programmer, which (I&#39;m guessing) is what you need more of for the unsafe sections.  Rewriting things in Rust for the sake of it probably hinges on the ratio or safe to unsafe code, where those are and how they&#39;re maintained.

In rust, ownership rules are ALWAYS enforced no matter what you do. In fact, there are exactly 5 things that unsafe allows:https://doc.rust-lang.org/book... [rust-lang.org]You can, in principle, circumvent the borrow checker by converting a normal pointer into a raw pointer and later dereferencing it, which is just adding indirection. But in practice, there&#39;s no good reason to do this, and there&#39;s likely already an easier way to do what you might be wanting to do with it that doesn&#39;t require unsafe. Raw pointers are generally only really useful for FFI, which is already inherently unsafe in any language.

C code is also quite safe and easy to write in a memory safe way if you don&#39;t use pointers. Every language has the ability to shoot yourself in the foot with its more complex functionality. For rust, you need to specifically declare functions or types &quot;unsafe&quot; in order to do so. It opens the possibility to do things that the compiler can&#39;t verify to be memory safe. But you need to do it explicitly.

This CVE is discussed in detail by this YTer. He&#39;s a Rust proponent but very open about its limitations.

The reason people will roll their eyes at you over that is that its an incredibly boring debate that ended 30 years ago. Its pure surface level semantics and it just isn&#39;t interesting and tends to suggest people haven&#39;t actually spent much time understanding what they are complaining about.

First, I&#39;m not a Rust programmer, but I am a programmer.

Rust&#39;s claims about memory safety read to me like &quot;we promise we are memory-safe except where you tell me they aren&#39;t. If you use a library that is marked as unsafe, you are responsible for knowing what you are doing and what the library is doing.  But in all other cases, we guarantee memory safety.&quot;

If I wanted 100% memory safety, there would be a lot of things that I either couldn&#39;t do or couldn&#39;t do efficiently enough to be worth doing.  A large part

CVE ... pertains to the Android Binder rewrite in Rust.
Rewrites always carry the risk of new problems as well as old problems in new ways.

Just curious; was there a reason this coded needed to be rewritten or was it a failure to apply &quot;if it&#39;s not broke, don&#39;t fix it?&quot;

A vulnerability in an unsafe section of Rust is not surprising, and it was essentially inevitable that it would happen. That&#39;s the whole point of having safe vs unsafe modes.

There are still two really good reasons to use Rust widely:

ISIS attacks over the past week in Australia and Syria have led some to wonder whether the Islamist terrorist organization, once also known as the Islamic State, is making a comeback.

“Actually,” says Bruce Hoffman, “it never went away.”

Hoffman is a professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations. “We defeated the caliphate,” he told me on Tuesday, referring to the stretch of land—one-third of Syria and two-fifths of Iraq—that ISIS ruled from 2014–19, until a coalition of 90 nations crushed it militarily. But ISIS itself “reverted to its roots and has emerged as a highly capable international terrorist organization” that “still poses a threat to the security of Western countries.”

About 1,000 U.S. troops are still based in Syria, mainly to fight the group’s surviving remnants. So it shouldn’t be too surprising that ISIS militiamen killed two of them, as well as an American translator, in an ambush over the weekend.

Australia is a different case; ISIS has never mounted a political or military challenge to the existing order. But antisemitic incidents have soared in the two years since Hamas’ assault on Israel; the pace of incidents since then is five times as high as in the decade before the war in Gaza got underway. Some of these incidents have been theatrical (anti-Israel graffiti), but some have been deadly—for instance last year’s burning of a synagogue in Melbourne, an event that, like this week’s mass shooting on Bondi Beach, took place around the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah.

This latest attack killed at least 15 people.

News outlets have reported that the two gunmen, a father and a son, were “inspired” by ISIS. But Hoffman suspects that the connection is more direct. The pair had recently spent time—and might have been trained—in the southern Philippines, a region he describes as a “hotbed” of ISIS activity.

The Australian people stepped up in response to the latest attack. A Syrian immigrant, the owner of a nearby fruit stand, tackled and disarmed one of the gunmen at great personal risk. More than 20,000 citizens lined up to donate blood for the dozens who were injured in the attack—most of them Jews gathered to celebrate the beginning of Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights. The Australian government also moved swiftly to tighten laws on firearms; the two shooters had bought their weapons legally.

It is hard to say how many ISIS adherents are still around and active. A “counterterrorism guide” published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence estimates between 8,800 and 13,100 (though the document doesn’t explain how it came to such precise figures). Hoffman thinks this number is too low, placing the figure somewhere between 13,000 and 20,000.

At the height of the caliphate, Hoffman says, ISIS had recruited 53,000 foreign fighters from more than 80 countries. Some were subsequently killed; many more likely deserted. But others simply moved. The ODNI fact sheet describes the organization as “a global enterprise, overseeing at least 15 branches and networks in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, as well as supporters worldwide.”

The burning of the Melbourne synagogue wasn’t even the most damaging assault by ISIS last year. In January 2024, two ISIS suicide bombers killed 84 Shiite Muslims who were attending a memorial service for Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran’s terrorist operations throughout the Middle East, on the fourth anniversary of his assassination. (ISIS is a radical Sunni Muslim group.) Two months later, agents of ISIS-K (the K denotes the Khorasan region, which overlaps parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran) planned and carried out a mass shooting at a concert hall in Moscow, killing 137 and injuring at least 100. (U.S. intelligence officials had warned the Kremlin of the impending attack, but Moscow ignored them.)

“Iran and Moscow are police states,” Hoffman said. “If ISIS can operate in police states, they can operate in Western countries”—as the attack on the open beach in Australia tragically demonstrated.

According to the ODNI document, “ISIS elements use ambushes, IED [improvised-explosive-device] attacks, kidnappings, military-style assaults, suicide operations, and targeted killings,” and the organization “encourages supporters worldwide to conduct operations in their own countries using readily available weapons.” The intelligence agency, however, adds that the group’s ability to train and deploy agents against civilian targets in Europe has been “significantly degraded during the past decade.” Certainly, its ability to mount centralized or coordinated attacks has sharply diminished.

Still, the global war on terrorism, like global terrorism itself, is far from over.

Discussions of race are everywhere and nowhere in 2025. On one hand, President Donald Trump is openly insulting Somali immigrants, describing entire nations as “shithole” countries, and insisting that the most persecuted class of humans are white South Africans. On the other, none of this is actually registering as anything other than Trump being Trump, and so when the Supreme Court agrees to revisit a foundational doctrine like birthright citizenship, too many of us shrug it off. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick spoke to civil rights attorney Sherrilyn Ifill about her recent Substack, “Is It Too Late,” in which she argued that it is not too late to save American ideals of democracy and equality, but it is assuredly too late to remain indifferent. Part of that conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity below.

Dahlia Lithwick: There is a very human propensity, especially in times of crisis, to normalize and rationalize and temporize. We comfort the comfortable, and we look for hope in norms and in institutions and in rationality. So many people have this perpetual hope that something’s going to come along and life is going to go back to 2010 or 2012. This hope says that with enough time, and even if it’s uncomfortable right now, someone else is going to come along, or some institution is going to come along, and put us in the DeLorean and we’re all going to go back. Can you talk about the ways in which American exceptionalism and the American normalization bias and the profound—just to talk about the Supreme Court as an example—American trust in institutions can get us to the point where it’s not that we don’t see the fire, we can’t even smell the smoke. You write, “everyone should be on full alert,” but you and I both know that not only are people not on full alert, I’m not even sure what could put them on full alert.

Sherrilyn Ifill: I think things are unraveling pretty fast and people will get on full alert. The only question is, when they get on full alert, will it be too late? That’s why I’m saying: “You might want to do that now.” I’ve been guilty of this as well: not ringing the alarm bell with sufficient urgency. This is something lawyers do all the time, because we’re used to finding the little interstices and figuring out how to move within these small spaces so that we can get where we want to go and so that we can make change. I was trained in that tradition—you find a way, you find a pathway, and all of that presumes the legitimacy of the framework.

I’m not a nihilist. I actually always do have hope. And I think one of the reasons I feel so clear, in this moment, is that I have no desire to return to 2010. I have no desire to return to the ’80s. I’ve been a civil rights lawyer for 35 years. The ’80s were a nightmare.

What are we returning to? I don’t have a dream time calling out to me. People will say, “When Obama was president.” I mean, really? Because most of the videos you’ve seen of police killing unarmed black men, most of that was in the second Obama administration. That was Eric Garner. That was Ferguson. That was Walter Scott running in that park. So if you’ve been doing the work that I’ve been doing, you’re always invested in the future.

I have excitement and hope in this time because as this whole thing begins to unravel, we have the opportunity to create something new. This is where the 14th Amendment is so helpful for me, because it’s one of the biggest moments of creating something absolutely new in this country, so I use it as inspiration, not only its very words and provisions and guarantees, but also to remind me that we have the right and the obligation to refound our country when it goes astray. That’s what those young kids in college during the Civil Rights Movement did. They did a version of refounding. So I don’t want to suggest that I don’t feel hope for the future. I do feel quite hopeful. But I also feel that pretending that all we need to do is just make some incremental changes to get us back to 2010 interferes with our ability to do that reset. What has been laid bare is that 2010 ain’t it.

We have some serious structural problems. As a litigator, I don’t know how anyone can purport to pretend that they know what the rules are at the Supreme Court anymore. We have a Supreme Court that not only has the power to say what the law is, pursuant to Chief Justice John Marshall and Marbury v. Madison, but they’ve now decided that they have the power to say what the facts are. That has never been part of our system of adjudication and litigation. Assigning factual findings to the Supreme Court? No, that is for the trial courts, for district courts. But we are now seeing a majority on the Supreme Court that regularly swats away the findings of the district court. That is the power of the district court. They are closest to the conflict. They can evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. They’re seeing the exhibits, the documents, all of it. It’s playing out in real time. It’s not theoretical for them. And now we have a Supreme Court that months later will swat away a two-week trial and the findings of fact over 160 pages by a district court. That’s real. That is real and structural. And it should not be dependent on the personnel of the court.

Last week was a startling and arresting moment for me in terms of the Trump v. Slaughter arguments about Humphrey’s Executor. Put aside originalism, that’s gone, there’s not even a pretense of text and history. But the idea that, “Well, you know, since agencies don’t look like they did 100 years ago, I guess we don’t have to think about them the same way.” It is so strange to see serious people pretending to be doing serious work in this serious place, when all pretense of intellectual seriousness has fallen away. Instead you have feelingsball and “How does executive power make me feel today?” There is no commitment to the principles that were laid out and in which people like you and I as institutionalists took a lot of solace. Part of what is so challenging about this moment is that by the time most Americans get around to the point that they can say the sentence “Amy Coney Barrett’s not going to save us,” or “Brett Kavanaugh is not going to save us,” it’s all going to be too late. It seems we are so committed to the principle that they are originalists, that they are textualists, that they care about a precedent, and so committed to the proposition that the U.S. Supreme Court is going to save us in the end.

The irony of it is that the U.S. Supreme Court got this reputation and the confidence of the American public after Brown. And that’s why, as much as this court is hollowing out Brown, they’ll never overturn it because that is how they became—how they got the reputation, certainly among Black people, for many decades, of being the people who come to your rescue. The shift started to happen with the Burger court in the 1980s.

So many of those who have the greatest platforms are still speaking and behaving in a way that suggests that this is something easily solved, or this is just how it goes, or we can just do this for a couple of years. But if you are watching the videos of people being chased by masked figures who claim to be federal agents, but we don’t know, and who are kidnapping people and throwing them in vans and doing this to American citizens and holding them? The danger is just there. It  is apparent. The more we treat it as though this is just Trumpism, this is Trump 2.0—all the little things that we say to tamp down the alarm are really profoundly problematic.

Many of those who have the greatest microphones frankly don’t know very much about race or racism or the history of it in this country. They want to be experts, so they play to their expertise. These are also the people who have said, “We talk about race too much. We talk about identity too much. We’re scaring people off with that. Everything’s not race.” We’ve made it seem illegitimate to talk about racism. It’s almost like you’re being soft, you’re being anti-intellectual, you’re not doing the rigorous work of politics if you’re talking about race.

In fact, race is threaded through every institutional structure of this country. And we have someone who is exploiting it every day. It’s not that I’m talking about race, it’s that he just stood up the other day and said, We want the Danes, the Swedes, and the Norwegians. We don’t want people from shithole countries. We’re being told that it’s illegitimate to keep talking about race when we’re confronting a tsunami of a movement that uses racism as its stalking horse. It is the lure that brought so many people into this movement. It’s important to help people understand that that’s the bait they’re using. The bait that says, “Yeah, I’m not sure that those people are qualified,” right? Yeah, all of that stuff that just lives in this country, that’s being used as the bait for this smash-and-grab, for this power grab. And I don’t think we’re doing this country any favors by steering people away from that realization.

            <div id="article-text">Suspected Chinese-government-linked threat actors have been battering a maximum-severity Cisco AsyncOS zero-day vulnerability in some Secure Email Gateway (SEG) and Secure Email and Web Manager (SEWM) appliances for nearly a month, and there&#39;s no timeline for a fix.

Cisco disclosed the bug, tracked as CVE-2025-20393, on Wednesday and said it affects both physical and virtual SEG and SEWM appliances in certain non-standard configurations where the Spam Quarantine feature is enabled and exposed to the internet.

&quot;On December 10, Cisco became aware of a new cyberattack campaign targeting a limited subset of appliances with certain ports open to the internet … This attack allows the threat actors to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system of an affected appliance,&quot; according to the security advisory.

The vendor also published recommendations for customers to assess exposure and mitigate risks.

According to Cisco&#39;s threat intel arm Talos, the attacks have been ongoing &quot;since at least late November 2025.&quot;

A Cisco spokesperson declined to answer The Register&#39;s questions, including how many appliances have been infected and when it will release a fix.

&quot;We strongly urge customers to follow guidance in the advisory to assess any exposure and mitigate risk,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;Cisco is actively investigating the issue and developing a permanent remediation.&quot;

Also on Wednesday, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency added CVE-2025-20393 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.

In a subsequent report, Cisco Talos on Wednesday pinned the attacks &quot;with moderate confidence&quot; on a Chinese-nexus advanced persistent threat (APT) group it tracks as UAT-9686.

After breaking into internet-facing appliances, the attackers deploy a persistent Python-based backdoor called AquaShell, along with AquaTunnel (reverse SSH tunnel), chisel (another tunneling tool), and AquaPurge (log-clearing utility). ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">interview No good idea - like rewarding open source software developers and maintainers for their contributions - goes unabused by cybercriminals, and this was the case with the Tea Protocol and two token farming campaigns.

Both incidents gave the project&#39;s founders a real-time view into how far - and fast - attackers will go to chase financial gain, and they helped shape &quot;radical changes&quot; that will roll out in the Tea network&#39;s mainnet launch early next year, co-founder and CEO Tim Lewis told The Register.

The Tea Protocol was founded by Max Howell, who created open source package manager Homebrew, and Lewis, who established DEVxDAO, a non-profit that distributes grants to support decentralized computing projects, to reward open source developers and help secure software supply chains via financial incentives.

&quot;When you think about the different package management ecosystems, they all have different gates in front of them, and none of them have been a financial gate,&quot; Lewis said in an interview.

&quot;There&#39;s a human that sits in the front who has to be this gate, but it takes a toll on the human to go through all the data, and that&#39;s only getting worse,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#39;s the proliferation of the AI-induced pull requests, which are great, but that&#39;s become like a DDoS attack.&quot;

Last year, the duo rolled out the Tea Protocol testnet - essentially a test run for the incentives program that allows open source developers to earn cryptocurrency - specifically Tea tokens - for valuable code and fixes, while users can stake Tea to support specific projects and also earn rewards. A portion of the protocol rewards is shared with project maintainers and users who stake their tokens.

&quot;Again, this was on a test network for fake internet points that could eventually potentially have some value,&quot; Lewis said. &quot;Our incentive for that period only lasted about three weeks.&quot;

We got to watch this happen in real time, and we recognized how fast, how far people had gone to create scripts that have a worm-like behavior

In April 2024, the Tea team shut down the incentive program&#39;s rewards after about 15,000 spammy packages flooded the npm registry to farm Tea points. These contained little or zero useful functionality, and were instrumented with &quot;tea.yaml&quot; metadata that linked back to Tea accounts in an attempt to inflate developers&#39; reputation and earn payouts.

&quot;We got to watch this happen in real time, and we recognized how fast, how far people had gone to create scripts that have a worm-like behavior,&quot; Lewis said.

Then it got worse. In 2025, the earlier Tea farming campaign grew into the IndonesianFoods and Indonesian Tea campaigns that polluted more than 1 percent of npm with spam packages. And in November, Amazon uncovered more than 150,000 malicious npm packages, all linked to another Tea token farming campaign, that the cloud giant described as &quot;one of the largest package flooding incidents in open source registry history.&quot;

&quot;I view this as a canary in the coal mine,&quot; Lewis said.

In these token farming campaigns, the fraudsters flooded registries with spam, as opposed to cryptocurrency- and other secret-stealing laced code -  and neither of the latter two is hypothetical. North Korea&#39;s Lazarus Group and other sophisticated attackers have previously targeted npm for these illicit purposes.

&quot;When you are a destructive organization like Lazarus Group, there&#39;s incentive to use this same techniques to attack [supply chains],&quot; Lewis said. &quot;So we need to fix the core.&quot;

To this end, Tea&#39;s founders are working to fix the protocol&#39;s design to ensure that the incentives program can&#39;t be abused when the mainnet launches in early 2026.

This involves requiring packages and projects to pass ownership and provenance checks, and ensuring contributions aren&#39;t just automated spam. The Tea team is also designing monitoring features that will check for Sybil attacks and flag surges in low-quality package creation and suspicious identities.

If malicious-looking patterns are detected, the developer won&#39;t receive rewards and their registrations will be quarantined, pending further review.

Additional key quality and security improvements will happen via integration with PKGW, which Howell wrote. It&#39;s a package runner that creates a containerized environment for projects and manages developer tools across environments. PKGW verifies maintainers using cryptographic signatures and identity checks, and also evaluates their contributions to various projects for quality, along with security posture and dependencies.

This registry will integrate directly with Tea upon the protocol&#39;s mainnet launch, and will auto-detect and penalize, if needed, spammy packages at the point of registration - not after - while rewarding maintainers for their legit contributions.

In the future, Lewis says that this design will also allow enterprises to automate bug bounties, and SBOMs (software bills of materials) that provide an inventory of all the components found in a piece of software. This will make it easier for large companies to map out their dependencies, and then reward developers for fixing any critical security issues they find.

&quot;Me, as an enterprise, I can set up a fund for $50,000 to the top 100 things that were problems in my ecosystem,&quot; Lewis said. &quot;As a maintainer, if I solve the problem, then via bounty mechanism, if I&#39;ve registered my repository, I&#39;m entitled to 20 percent of this bounty, and it&#39;s my job to make sure that the code base is clean.&quot;

In fact, several banking firms have already signed on to a pilot bounty program, and while Lewis won&#39;t name names, each of these has pledged a $250,000 reward to better secure their open source code.

&quot;Some CISO, somewhere, every day is looking at his tens of thousands of packages that he approved for use, and now he&#39;s responsible for whether or not these things are secure,&quot; Lewis said. &quot;He can&#39;t have all the people that work within his department spend all of their time trying to get some guy in Nebraska to review a pull request and get the critical bug for his architecture solved en masse. We&#39;re hoping this creates a tool that allows that value distribution without impermanent loss en masse.&quot;

Lewis&#39; goal, he says, is to see upwards of &quot;millions of dollars a day, retrieved for issue completion.&quot;

Project developers and maintainers write the fixes, and chief security officers can confirm to their boards of directors that their dependencies and critical code is secure. &quot;Plus, the meantime for resolution for these issues comes down - and they are not funding groups like North Korea&#39;s Lazarus,&quot; he added.

In other words: Tea&#39;s goal reaches fruition. Open source project maintainers get paid for their valuable work, code becomes more secure, financially motivated crews can&#39;t game the system, and the world becomes a better place. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In today&#39;s episode of &quot;Amazon Kremlinology,&quot; AWS has put out a press release that shows a significant shuffle of one of AWS&#39;s most storied leaders.

Two weeks after their announcement of Nova 2 models at AWS re:Invent (&quot;where hope goes to the desert to die&quot;), SVP of Utility Computing Peter DeSantis is taking two of his teams from AWS, putting them into SVP of Doesn&#39;t-Work-At-Amazon-As-Of-Next-Month Rohit Prasad&#39;s old org, and managing the whole thing as a cohesive unit called &quot;AGI.&quot; This unit will report directly to Andy Jassy, Amazon&#39;s Lead Product Marketer for GenAI (and also CEO).

The two things Peter&#39;s taking along with him are the reworked Annapurna Labs business that makes AWS&#39;s silicon chips (Nitro, Graviton, Trainium, and Inferentia), and their quantum computing business, about which companies are very excited but utterly unable to communicate effectively to anyone who&#39;s not spent at least four years in a Ph.D. program at Berkeley.

You have to unpack a bit of history and ad some context to make sense of the rest of it, since this is a very Amazonian announcement. Amazon is much, much, much more than just Amazon.com and AWS: Alexa, Amazon Prime Video, Twitch, Zoox, Amazon Ads, and the AGI team, to name a few.

The message here is that AI and AI-related compute should not be an AWS only thing, but rather is an all-Amazon thing. In other words, Andy Jassy believes that this unit is building things that either are or will become so important that they&#39;re taking one of our most senior AWS leaders and putting him in charge of all of it.

Does moving Peter de Santis out of AWS reflect a lack of confidence in Matt Garman?

No, because the org that Peter is taking over already existed; now he&#39;s getting a larger scope by taking it over and bringing other things with him in a way that&#39;s far more strategically important and visible than Utility Computing alone.

Where have I heard the vertical integration story before?

Jassy specifically calls out &quot;the advantages of optimizing across models, chips, and cloud software and infrastructure.&quot; This is the Apple playbook for AI – if you control the silicon and the models together, you can optimize end-to-end in ways that their two closest peer companies cannot: Microsoft because they buy from Nvidia, and Google because their TPU and model teams exist in parallel universes that occasionally exchange passive-aggressive emails like my extended family. That&#39;s the strategic bet that Amazon is making here.

Why is quantum computing being bundled with AI?

Fascinating, isn&#39;t it? Quantum computing is a decade-out bet at minimum, which is a statement that remains as true today as it was in the 1990s. Grouping it with &quot;things that need Peter DeSantis&#39;s technical depth to shepherd for the long haul&quot; suggests this org is explicitly about strategic patience, not quarterly results. That may be one of the most encouraging signs I&#39;ve seen from Amazon in a while; long-term thinking is where they&#39;re at their best.

Jassy&#39;s memo specifically names Pieter Abbeel as the new head of the frontier model research team (the base model builders) within AGI. Abbeel&#39;s a legitimate AI researcher who came over when Amazon acqui-hired Covariant last year. He&#39;s continuing to work with the robotics team as well as leading frontier models.

It&#39;s easy to dismiss Amazon&#39;s expression of this as &quot;a pile of unwanted children,&quot; but do bear in mind that Amazon has one of the largest deployed robotics fleets on Earth (warehouses). If embodied AI becomes a thing, they have a testing ground that OpenAI and Anthropic can only dream of. That convergence is potentially a tectonic shift that a whole bunch of folks likely won&#39;t see coming – if Amazon can pull it off. ®

A defiant Brendan Carr testified before the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday in his first public appearance before lawmakers since threatening broadcasters who aired comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s show.

Over the course of nearly three hours, the Federal Communications Commission chairman ping-ponged between heated exchanges with Democrats and largely muted questions from Republicans. But at least some members of both parties expressed concern about regulators bending the First Amendment — though there’s little sign it will have much impact on Carr.

Taking center stage were comments Carr made in September in the wake of the public killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. After Kimmel made a joke on his late night show about the political ideology of the killer, Carr told interviewer Benny Johnson it was “some of the sickest conduct possible,” and could be a problem for broadcasters who aired the show. “We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” he said.

The remarks went too far even for a handful of Republican lawmakers, including Senate Commerce Committee Chair Ted Cruz (R-TX), who likened it to mafia talk. But during the hearing, Carr denied the comment was ever a threat in the first place, calling the idea “projection and distortion by Democrats.” He repeatedly doubled down on his insistence that the FCC should ensure broadcast licenses are being used in the public interest, including by enforcing against alleged news distortion. He refused to express regret for the comments. “My job is to enforce the law as passed by Congress that includes a public interest standard, and broadcast TV is fundamentally different than any other media,” Carr told the panel.

“My job is to enforce the law as passed by Congress that includes a public interest standard”

For the most part, it was Democrats who hammered Carr on his Kimmel comments, but Cruz reiterated his critique at the start of the hearing. He also, however, accused his Democratic colleagues of hypocrisy over their silence over alleged jawboning during the Biden administration. Cruz called on his Democratic peers to join him in passing reforms.

Several groups have warned the public interest obligation and news distortion standard for broadcast licensees are overly ambiguous and flawed, and Democrats may be open to refining them. Carr appeared at the hearing alongside the two other FCC commissioners, Democrat Anna Gomez and Republican Olivia Trusty. Speaking with reporters afterwards, Gomez said she would “welcome Congress legislating on the public interest standard because what we have seen under this administration is the weaponization of the FCC and the abuse of our regulatory authority in order to silence speech.” Gomez accused the Republican majority of “bandying about the phrase, ‘operating in the public interest,’ as an excuse to go after content this administration doesn’t like. And that is not valid. It’s contrary to the First Amendment.”

Most Republicans besides Cruz either didn’t address Carr’s broadcaster threats, or attacked Democrats for alleged hypocrisy without taking a stance themselves. Several Republicans asked about far less controversial topics, like broadband maps and robocall scam enforcement.

By contrast, Carr and panel Democrats often ended up talking over each other in testy exchanges. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) asked whether Carr would have threatened broadcasters to take Kimmel off the air had he made the kinds of remarks that Trump did on Truth Social recently, baselessly saying that progressive filmmaker Rob Reiner was killed because he angered people with “TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.” “Democrats on this dais are accusing me of engaging in censorship,” Carr responded, “and now you’re trying to encourage me to police speech on the internet. I’m simply not going to do it.” Schatz asked if there are any conservative commentators or comedians that say anything offensive that he’d consider investigating. “I’m not looking at things that are offensive or awful, to use your words,” Carr said. “I’m looking at things that are consistent with our public interest rules and regulations.”

When Carr attempted to turn Klobuchar’s questioning of alleged censorship by the Trump administration back onto the Biden administration, Klobuchar shot back. “Joe Biden is no longer president. You are the head of the FCC, and Donald Trump is president and I’m trying to deal with this right now,” she said.

Other Democratic senators homed in on an obvious pattern at the FCC: the agency no longer considers itself to be independent. Carr refused to give a yes or no answer to Sen. Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM) on whether the FCC is an independent agency. Lujan held up a print out of the FCC website that said it was. “This isn’t a trick question,” Lujan said. When Carr admitted the FCC is not independent, Lujan asked, “Is your website wrong? Is your website lying?”

The FCC website appeared to have been updated recently to remove the word independent. Public Knowledge’s broadband policy director Alisa Valentin said on Bluesky that the FCC website appeared to still call the agency independent as of 11:54 AM Wednesday. The Internet Archive last captured the page on October 1st, when the word “independent” was still there.

Carr would not answer a question from Sen. Andy Kim (D-NJ) about whether he had any conversations with the president or his senior officials “about using the FCC to go after critics,” saying he would not discuss specific conversations with the president. When Kim reframed the question to whether it would be appropriate for the administration to give such direction to pressure media companies, Carr declined to “get into hypotheticals.”

“Trump is not your boss. The American people are your boss”

“The easy answer is no,” Kim said. “It’s not a hypothetical, it’s literally just trying to determine whether or not you are understanding your job being belonging to the American people. Trump is not your boss. The American people are your boss.” Kim also pointed out that Trump had posted in August that he would be in favor of the FCC revoking the broadcast licenses of ABC and NBC because he believed they engaged in biased coverage of him.

Cruz and Kim debated past examples of lawmakers pressuring the FCC to scrutinize media mergers based on what each perceived to be partisan interests. But Kim argued such letters are the “proper oversight role of Congress” and far different from “Chairman Carr’s threats to companies he directly regulates.”

Toward the end of the back-and-forth, the two lawmakers expressed some common ground. “The First Amendment is not simply a one-way license for one team to abuse the power and the other not,” Cruz said. “Instead we should respect the free speech of all Americans, regardless of party.” Kim said he agreed, and said he hoped to work together “to show that we do this regardless of who was violating, that we try to show that integrity to the process.”

Carr has already rejected one Democratic senator’s call for him to resign, and it looks unlikely that Congress will otherwise make any serious attempts to remove him. Cruz seems eager to use this moment to pass legal changes he thinks conservatives will come to appreciate once the shoe is on the other foot. The question now is whether he can build a strong enough coalition to do so.

If you’ve been holding off on getting a new iPhone, now’s the perfect time to size up your options. Apple’s 2025 iPhone lineup is now available, which includes the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and a brand-new model, the ultra-thin iPhone Air. These new phones offer a number of new features over their predecessors, such as upgraded cameras, faster chips, better battery life, and even better screens — Apple Intelligence, however, is still a work in progress.

Alongside the new hardware, Apple also launched iOS 26 (yes, the numbering system has changed and we’re jumping from iOS 18), which includes a new Liquid Glass user interface, live translation, wallpapers in messages, and more. The software marks Apple’s biggest visual redesign since iOS 7, and despite some very polarizing reactions, we think it looks fine.

If your current iPhone is humming along, there’s no need to rush out and get a new one. But if you’re questioning whether it’s the year to replace your iPhone that’s a few generations old, then I think the answer is an easy yes. There are real gains to be had this time around, especially in the basic iPhone 17, which features a higher-refresh-rate display than last year’s model for smoother-looking animations, plus double the base storage to 256GB — all without raising the price, despite the current tariff situation in the US.

There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.

The most expensive, souped-up iPhone isn’t automatically the best one for everyone. What I look for is a happy medium — features that will satisfy most people at the best price. Sometimes, that’s last year’s model.

Battery performance can vary significantly between current iPhone models, primarily due to the size of the phone. Everyone wants a phone that can last a full day, and these recommendations reflect that.

One size does not fit all. Some people like a small phone, others want the biggest screen money can buy. This list includes iPhones for people in both camps.

Screen: 6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe / Qi2 / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

The iPhone 17 marks a turning point for the standard model. After years with a lower-quality screen, the cheapest model finally got two major upgrades for 2025: an always-on display and a high-refresh-rate panel. These features make it feel meaningfully better than the iPhone 16 and prior models in everyday use, bringing it closer than ever to the Pro models. And at the same $799 starting price as the previous generation, this year’s update is a no-brainer.

While the iPhone 17’s 48-megapixel main camera is carried over from last year, the ultrawide camera has been changed from a 12-megapixel sensor to a 48-megapixel sensor, and it delivers sharper and more vibrant photos. The device features an 18-megapixel Center Stage selfie camera, which is also in the Air and 17 Pro. Your selfies may not look materially better, but the front camera’s square sensor elevates the user experience, making it possible to take horizontal selfies while holding the device vertically (no need to rotate the phone).

Apple also gives you double the storage — 256GB versus 128GB in the base iPhone 16 — and improved battery life. The standard 17 still lacks a proper telephoto camera, and the A19 chip is slower than the A19 Pro found in the Pro models. Still, it’s a big step up in almost every way, even if it looks basically the same as every iPhone from the past six years.

Screen: 6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 Pro / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.78 with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel 8x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W MagSafe / Qi2 / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

The iPhone 17 Pro introduces a bold redesign and a number of notable upgrades, including the lineup’s most advanced camera setup yet. It also features rounded edges, and similar to last year, it’s on equal footing with the 17 Pro Max in terms of performance. The biggest differences are that the Pro Max offers a larger display, a larger battery, and up to 2TB of storage.

Whereas the iPhone 17 is for most people, the 17 Pro is geared more toward creators. The device has three 48-megapixel cameras, including a 48-megapixel telephoto, and it offers several pro features aimed at those who want to take the best possible photos and videos. Some of those features include Genlock support, which lets videographers sync up timecodes across multiple cameras, and support for ProRes RAW recording. It also sports the upgraded Center Stage selfie camera found in other 2025 iPhone models.

Despite the additions and improvements, there’s little here that makes the 17 Pro an absolute must-upgrade. However, it comes in an irresistible orange, which is apparently the new “it” color.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max’s redesign isn’t just about looks. Apple hollowed out the device’s aluminum frame to fit in the biggest battery yet in an iPhone. Apple says the device offers up 39 hours of video playback, which is 12 more hours than last year’s iPhone 16 Plus, our previous battery champ. The device can easily push through a full day and then some, though your mileage will vary depending on how often you play mobile games, watch videos, and doomscroll on social media.

There are other benefits to going with the 17 Pro Max. It has the largest display among the latest iPhone lineup — 6.9 inches — and offers up to 2TB of storage, giving creators more room than ever for storing their media. If you want the most iPhone you can possibly get, including the longest battery life, then the 17 Pro Max is the way to go.

The iPhone Air is Apple’s biggest redesign since the iPhone X was released in 2017. It’s shockingly thin and light, at 5.6mm and 165 grams, respectively. Thanks to its titanium frame and Ceramic Shield 2 display, it’s more durable than you might expect, too. The device feels deceptively small, despite having a 6.5-inch display. You really have to see and feel the phone yourself to get the appeal.

But the thinner design comes with a few substantial compromises compared to the other models available this year. One of the biggest is that the Air features a single 48-megapixel camera on the back. That’s not to say the device’s camera is bad. But it’s a far less versatile system than even the far more affordable iPhone 17, which has a dual-camera setup. The second compromise is on battery life, which is just okay. It’s not terrible, but it’s not great, either.

At $999, you’re paying a lot for middling battery life and camera performance. Those who primarily care about design, though, may be more forgiving about those shortcomings.

This recommendation comes with a heavy sigh. Yes, the 16E is the cheapest new iPhone Apple sells. Yes, it’s a good phone. It has a capable camera, reliable performance, full water resistance, wireless charging, and will be supported with software updates for years to come. But its $599 price tag starts to feel like too much when you consider what it’s missing.

There’s no MagSafe, which you can kind of add by way of a MagSafe case, but it’s a bummer not to have it built in when it has basically become a standard iPhone feature. There’s no ultrawide camera, no Dynamic Island housing timely information, no camera control button (not a huge loss, honestly), and no Ultra Wideband for precise object tracking. It does support Apple Intelligence, but that doesn’t feel like much of a consolation, given that it’s very much still a work-in-progress.

The 16E will most likely receive more years of software support than a previous-gen model like the iPhone 14 or 15. And sure, Apple Intelligence might turn into something useful someday. The 16E is a good choice if you want the path of least resistance to blue bubbles and FaceTime at your fingertips. But if you’d like MagSafe, a more advanced camera, and some of the other bells and whistles that got lost on the way to the 16E, then it’s not a bad idea to look at one of the older iPhones.

Apple’s latest iPhone lineup is available now, but there are already reports about what’s next. One report suggests Apple is readying a book-style foldable iPhone for 2026, which allegedly looks like two iPhone Air models put side by side. Apple is reportedly still working to flatten the crease that appears when the phone is unfolded, but has otherwise settled on a design. Looking ahead to 2027, a report claims Apple is planning a redesigned “all-screen” iPhone to celebrate the device’s 20th anniversary. These upcoming releases are allegedly part of Apple’s three-year plan — starting with the new iPhone Air — that’s aimed at refreshing its smartphone lineup.

Instead, the company plans to focus on ‘world-class first-party hardware and software.’

Meta has “paused” its program to license its VR operating system to other hardware companies so they could build their own headsets using the platform, as reported by Road to VR .

With the program, announced in April 2024, Meta announced that it would be licensing the Quest OS headset — which, at the same time, it also renamed to Horizon OS — to hardware makers like Lenovo and Asus. In a blog post at the time, Meta said that the program would give “more choice to consumers and a larger ecosystem for developers to build for.” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video that “our goal is to make it so that the open model defines the next generation of computing, again with the metaverse, glasses, and headsets.”

But now, Meta is pausing the program to focus on its first-party offerings instead. “We have paused the program to focus on building the world-class first-party hardware and software needed to advance the VR market,” Meta spokesperson Johanna Peace says in a statement to The Verge. “We’re committed to this for the long term and will revisit opportunities for 3rd-party device partnerships as the category evolves.”

Meta recently delayed the launch of mixed reality glasses codenamed “Phoenix” from the second half of 2026 to the first half of 2027 and is beginning work on a new Quest device, according to internal memos reported on by Business Insider. The company is reportedly looking at axing up to one-third of its metaverse budget next year, and a spokesperson says that Meta is “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward A.I. glasses and wearables.”

            <h2>This Nobel Prize–winning chemist dreams of making water from thin air</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/17/1129259/omar-yaghi-chemist-nobel-prize-crystals-water-air/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Omar Yaghi was a quiet child, diligent, unlikely to roughhouse with his nine siblings. So when he was old enough, his parents tasked him with one of the family’s most vital chores: fetching water. Like most homes in his Palestinian neighborhood in Amman, Jordan, the Yaghis’ had no electricity or running water. At least once every two weeks, the city switched on local taps for a few hours so residents could fill their tanks. Young Omar helped top up the family supply. Decades later, he says he can’t remember once showing up late. The fear of leaving his parents, seven brothers, and two sisters parched kept him punctual.

Yaghi proved so dependable that his father put him in charge of monitoring how much the cattle destined for the family butcher shop ate and drank. The best-­quality cuts came from well-fed, hydrated animals—a challenge given that they were raised in arid desert.

Specially designed materials called metal-organic frameworks can pull water from the air like a sponge—and then give it back.

But at 10 years old, Yaghi learned of a different occupation. Hoping to avoid a rambunctious crowd at recess, he found the library doors in his school unbolted and sneaked in. Thumbing through a chemistry textbook, he saw an image he didn’t understand: little balls connected by sticks in fascinating shapes. Molecules. The building blocks of everything.

“I didn’t know what they were, but it captivated my attention,” Yaghi says. “I kept trying to figure out what they might be.”

That’s how he discovered chemistry—or maybe how chemistry discovered him. After coming to the United States and, eventually, a postdoctoral program at Harvard University, Yaghi devoted his career to finding ways to make entirely new and fascinating shapes for those little sticks and balls. In October 2025, he was one of three scientists who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for identifying metal-­organic frameworks, or MOFs—metal ions tethered to organic molecules that form repeating structural landscapes. Today that work is the basis for a new project that sounds like science fiction, or a miracle: conjuring water out of thin air.

When he first started working with MOFs, Yaghi thought they might be able to absorb climate-damaging carbon dioxide—or maybe hold hydrogen molecules, solving the thorny problem of storing that climate-friendly but hard-to-contain fuel. But then, in 2014, Yaghi’s team of researchers at UC Berkeley had an epiphany. The tiny pores in MOFs could be designed so the material would pull water molecules from the air around them, like a sponge—and then, with just a little heat, give back that water as if squeezed dry. Just one gram of a water-absorbing MOF has an internal surface area of roughly 7,000 square meters.

Yaghi wasn’t the first to try to pull potable water from the atmosphere. But his method could do it at lower levels of humidity than rivals—potentially shaking up a tiny, nascent industry that could be critical to humanity in the thirsty decades to come. Now the company he founded, called Atoco, is racing to demonstrate a pair of machines that Yaghi believes could produce clean, fresh, drinkable water virtually anywhere on Earth, without even hooking up to an energy supply.

That’s the goal Yaghi has been working toward for more than a decade now, with the rigid determination that he learned while doing chores in his father’s butcher shop.

“It was in that shop where I learned how to perfect things, how to have a work ethic,” he says. “I learned that a job is not done until it is well done. Don’t start a job unless you can finish it.”

Most of Earth is covered in water, but just 3% of it is fresh, with no salt—the kind of water all terrestrial living things need. Today, desalination plants that take the salt out of seawater provide the bulk of potable water in technologically advanced desert nations like Israel and the United Arab Emirates, but at a high cost. Desalination facilities either heat water to distill out the drinkable stuff or filter it with membranes the salt doesn’t pass through; both methods require a lot of energy and leave behind concentrated brine. Typically desal pumps send that brine back into the ocean, with devastating ecological effects.

I was talking to Atoco executives about carbon dioxide capture earlier this year when they mentioned the possibility of harvesting water from the atmosphere. Of course my mind immediately jumped to Star Wars, and Luke Skywalker working on his family’s moisture farm, using “vaporators” to pull water from the atmosphere of the arid planet Tatooine. (Other sci-fi fans’ minds might go to Dune, and the water-gathering technology of the Fremen.) Could this possibly be real?

It turns out people have been doing it for millennia. Archaeological evidence of water harvesting from fog dates back as far as 5000 BCE. The ancient Greeks harvested dew, and 500 years ago so did the Inca, using mesh nets and buckets under trees.

Today, harvesting water from the air is a business already worth billions of dollars, say industry analysts—and it’s on track to be worth billions more in the next five years. In part that’s because typical sources of fresh water are in crisis. Less snowfall in mountains during hotter winters means less meltwater in the spring, which means less water downstream. Droughts regularly break records. Rising seas seep into underground aquifers, already drained by farming and sprawling cities. Aging septic tanks leach bacteria into water, and cancer-causing “forever chemicals” are creating what the US Government Accountability Office last year said “may be the biggest water problem since lead.” That doesn’t even get to the emerging catastrophe from microplastics.

So lots of places are turning to atmospheric water harvesting. Watergen, an Israel-based company working on the tech, initially planned on deploying in the arid, poorer parts of the world. Instead, buyers in Europe and the United States have approached the company as a way to ensure a clean supply of water. And one of Watergen’s biggest markets is the wealthy United Arab Emirates. “When you say ‘water crisis,’ it’s not just the lack of water—it’s access to good-quality water,” says Anna Chernyavsky, Watergen’s vice president of marketing.

In other words, the technology “has evolved from lab prototypes to robust, field-deployable systems,” says Guihua Yu, a mechanical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin. “There is still room to improve productivity and energy efficiency in the whole-system level, but so much progress has been steady and encouraging.”

MOFs are just the latest approach to the idea. The first generation of commercial tech depended on compressors and refrigerant chemicals—large-scale versions of the machine that keeps food cold and fresh in your kitchen. Both use electricity and a clot of pipes and exchangers to make cold by phase-shifting a chemical from gas to liquid and back; refrigerators try to limit condensation, and water generators basically try to enhance it.

That’s how Watergen’s tech works: using a compressor and a heat exchanger to wring water from air at humidity levels as low as 20%—Death Valley in the spring. “We’re talking about deserts,” Chernyavsky says. “Below 20%, you get nosebleeds.”

That still might not be good enough. “Refrigeration works pretty well when you are above a certain relative humidity,” says Sameer Rao, a mechanical engineer at the University of Utah who researches atmospheric water harvesting. “As the environment dries out, you go to lower relative humidities, and it becomes harder and harder. In some cases, it’s impossible for refrigeration-based systems to really work.”

So a second wave of technology has found a market. Companies like Source Global use desiccants—substances that absorb moisture from the air, like the silica packets found in vitamin bottles—to pull in moisture and then release it when heated. In theory, the benefit of desiccant-­based tech is that it could absorb water at lower humidity levels, and it uses less energy on the front end since it isn’t running a condenser system. Source Global claims its off-grid, solar-powered system is deployed in dozens of countries.

But both technologies still require a lot of energy, either to run the heat exchangers or to generate sufficient heat to release water from the desiccants. MOFs, Yaghi hopes, do not. Now Atoco is trying to prove it. Instead of using heat exchangers to bring the air temperature to dew point or desiccants to attract water from the atmosphere, a system can rely on specially designed MOFs to attract water molecules. Atoco’s prototype version uses an MOF that looks like baby powder, stuck to a surface like glass. The pores in the MOF naturally draw in water molecules but remain open, making it theoretically easy to discharge the water with no more heat than what comes from direct sunlight. Atoco’s industrial-scale design uses electricity to speed up the process, but the company is working on a second design that can operate completely off grid, without any energy input.

Yaghi’s Atoco isn’t the only contender seeking to use MOFs for water harvesting. A competitor, AirJoule, has introduced MOF-based atmospheric water generators in Texas and the UAE and is working with researchers at Arizona State University, planning to deploy more units in the coming months. The company started out trying to build more efficient air-­conditioning for electric buses operating on hot, humid city streets. But then founder Matt Jore heard about US government efforts to harvest water from air—and pivoted. The startup’s stock price has been a bit of a roller-­coaster, but Jore says the sheer size of the market should keep him in business. Take Maricopa County, encompassing Phoenix and its environs—it uses 1.2 billion gallons of water from its shrinking aquifer every day, and another 874 million gallons from surface sources like rivers.

“So, a couple of billion gallons a day, right?” Jore tells me. “You know how much influx is in the atmosphere every day? Twenty-five billion gallons.”

“Just the greater Phoenix area gets influx of about 25 billion gallons of water in the air,” he says. “If you can tap into it, that’s your source. And it’s not going away. It’s all around the world. We view the atmosphere as the world’s free pipeline.”

Besides AirJoule’s head start on Atoco, the companies also differ on where they get their MOFs. AirJoule’s system relies on an off-the-shelf version the company buys from the chemical giant BASF; Atoco aims to use Yaghi’s skill with designing the novel material to create bespoke MOFs for different applications and locations.

“Given the fact that we have the inventor of the whole class of materials, and we leverage the stuff that comes out of his lab at Berkeley—everything else equal, we have a good starting point to engineer maybe the best materials in the world,” says Magnus Bach, Atoco’s VP of business development.

Yaghi envisions a two-pronged product line. Industrial-scale water generators that run on electricity would be capable of producing thousands of liters per day on one end, while units that run on passive systems could operate in remote locations without power, just harnessing energy from the sun and ambient temperatures. In theory, these units could someday replace desalination and even entire municipal water supplies. The next round of field tests is scheduled for early 2026, in the Mojave Desert—one of the hottest, driest places on Earth.

“That’s my dream,” Yaghi says. “To give people water independence, so they’re not reliant on another party for their lives.”

Both Yaghi and Watergen’s Chernyavsky say they’re looking at more decentralized versions that could operate outside municipal utility systems. Home appliances, similar to rooftop solar panels and batteries, could allow households to generate their own water off grid.

That could be tricky, though, without economies of scale to bring down prices. “You have to produce, you have to cool, you have to filter—all in one place,” Chernyavsky says. “So to make it small is very, very challenging.”

Difficult as that may be, Yaghi’s childhood gave him a particular appreciation for the freedom to go off grid, to liberate the basic necessity of water from the whims of systems that dictate when and how people can access it.

“That’s really my dream,” he says. “To give people independence, water independence, so that they’re not reliant on another party for their livelihood or lives.”

Toward the end of one of our conversations, I asked Yaghi what he would tell the younger version of himself if he could. “Jordan is one of the worst countries in terms of the impact of water stress,” he said. “I would say, ‘Continue to be diligent and observant. It doesn’t really matter what you’re pursuing, as long as you’re passionate.’”

I pressed him for something more specific: “What do you think he’d say when you described this technology to him?”

Yaghi smiled: “I think young Omar would think you’re putting him on, that this is all fictitious and you’re trying to take something from him.” This reality, in other words, would be beyond young Omar’s wildest dreams.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rolling out enterprise-grade AI means climbing two steep cliffs at once. First, understanding and implementing the tech itself. And second, creating the cultural conditions where employees can maximize its value. While the technical hurdles are signiﬁcant, the human element can be even more consequential; fear and ambiguity can stall momentum of even the most promising initiatives.

Psychological safety—feeling free to express opinions and take calculated risks without worrying about career repercussions1—is essential for successful AI adoption. In psychologically safe workspaces, employees are empowered to challenge assumptions and raise concerns about new tools without fear of reprisal. This is nothing short of a necessity when introducing a nascent and profoundly powerful technology that still lacks established best practices.

“Psychological safety is mandatory in this new era of AI,” says Rafee Tarafdar, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Infosys. “The tech itself is evolving so fast—companies have to experiment, and some things will fail. There needs to be a safety net.”

To gauge how psychological safety influences success with enterprise-level AI, MIT Technology Review Insights conducted a survey of 500 business leaders. The ﬁndings reveal high self-reported levels of psychological safety, but also suggest that fear still has a foothold. Anecdotally, industry experts highlight a reason for the disconnect between rhetoric and reality: while organizations may promote a safe to experiment message publicly, deeper cultural undercurrents can counteract that intent.

Building psychological safety requires a coordinated, systems-level approach, and human resources (HR) alone cannot deliver such transformation. Instead, enterprises must deeply embed psychological safety into their collaboration processes.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Some disillusionment was inevitable. When OpenAI released a free web app called ChatGPT in late 2022, it changed the course of an entire industry—and several world economies. Millions of people started talking to their computers, and their computers started talking back. We were enchanted, and we expected more.Well, 2025 has been a year of reckoning. For a start, the heads of the top AI companies made promises they couldn’t keep. At the same time, updates to the core technology are no longer the step changes they once were.To be clear, the last few years have been filled with genuine “Wow” moments. But this remarkable technology is only a few years old, and in many ways it is still experimental. Its successes come with big caveats. Read the full story to learn more about why we may need to readjust our expectations.

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t. Check out the rest of the package here, and you can read more about why it’s time to reset our expectations for AI in the latest edition of the Algorithm, our weekly AI newsletter.

Quantum navigation could solve the military’s GPS jamming problem

Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thousands of flights have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of using radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.One approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
