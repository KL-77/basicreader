            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">New research published Thursday bolsters growing concerns that a handful of companies and countries are using the global atmospheric commons as a dumping ground for potentially toxic and climate-altering industrial waste byproducts from loosely regulated commercial space flights.

The new study analyzed a plume of pollution trailing part of a Falcon rocket that crashed through the upper atmosphere on Feb. 19, 2025, after SpaceX lost control of its reentry. The rocket was launched earlier that month, carrying 20 to 22 Starlink satellites into orbit.

The authors said it is the first time debris from a specific spacecraft disintegration has been traced and measured in the near-space region about 80 to 110 kilometers above Earth. Changes there can affect the stratosphere, where ozone and climate processes operate. Until recent years, human activities had little impact in that region.

Element-specific monitoring could be part of a broader effort to track how re-entry emissions spread and accumulate, the researchers noted, giving policymakers a chance to understand and manage the growing atmospheric footprint of spaceflight.

“I was surprised how big the event was, visually,” lead author Robin Wing, a researcher at the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics, said via email. He said people across northern Europe captured images of the burning debris, which was concentrated enough to enable high-resolution observations and to use atmospheric models to trace the lithium to its source.

The study shows that instruments can detect rocket pollution “in the ‘Ignorosphere’ (upper atmosphere near space),” he wrote. “There is hope that we can get ahead of the problem and that we don’t run blind into a new era of emissions from space.”

SpaceX did not immediately respond to questions or requests for comment from Inside Climate News.

A 2024 report from the United Nations University found that the rapid growth of commercial space activity is outpacing unevenly followed and voluntary guidelines. Without more global monitoring and collaboration, the rising demand for satellite launches will accelerate pollution risks in the shared space environment, the report warned.

International agreements covering rocket pollution include the Outer Space Treaty and Liability Convention. They require countries to avoid harmful contamination and to accept responsibility for damage caused by their space objects. Those principles are reflected by several International Court of Justice rulings and opinions on preventing cross-border environmental harm. Debris and atmospheric pollution from space launches disperses globally, affecting many nations that do not launch rockets at all.

Research led by scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, published in 2025, concluded that emissions from disintegrated satellites are likely to increase sharply in the coming decades. Some projections suggest as many as 60,000 satellites could be in orbit by 2040, with reentries every one to two days, injecting up to 10,000 metric tons of aluminum oxide particles into the upper atmosphere each year.

The study found that those aerosols could warm parts of the upper atmosphere by about 1.5 degrees Celsius within one or two years of reaching that number of satellites. That could alter winds and ozone chemistry, and persist for years, indicating a rapidly growing human-made source of pollution at the highest levels of the atmosphere.

Those particles matter because they act like other catalytic aerosols in the upper atmosphere. Aluminum oxide dust from burning spacecraft absorbs and scatters sunlight and can warm areas where it accumulates. That can subtly change atmospheric circulation, the researchers noted. As the particles drift and settle lower into the stratosphere, they can affect ozone chemistry and high-altitude clouds, altering how sunlight and heat move through the atmosphere and potentially influencing climate over time.

The potential scope of impacts from space activities was outlined by several researchers at the 2025 European Geosciences Union conference in Vienna. They said that, beyond orbital debris, the booming space industry is the source of a new form of atmospheric pollution, injected directly into the layers of air that protect the planet and regulate its climate.

Atmospheric scientist Laura Revell, with the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, presented research showing that rocket exhaust in the atmosphere can erase some of the hard-won gains in mitigating ozone depletion.

In a high-growth scenario for the space industry, there could be as many as 2,000 launches per year, which her modeling shows could result in about 3 percent ozone loss, equal to the atmospheric impacts of a bad wildfire season in Australia. She said most of the damage comes from chlorine-rich solid rocket fuels and black carbon in the plumes.

The black carbon could also warm parts of the stratosphere by about half-a-degree Celsius as it absorbs sunlight. That heats the surrounding air and can shift winds that steer storms and areas of precipitation.

“This is probably not a fuel type that we want to start using in massive quantities in the future,” she added.

Researchers at the conference estimated that in the past five years, the mass of human‑made material injected into the upper atmosphere by re‑entries has doubled to nearly a kiloton a year. For some metals like lithium, the amount is already much larger than that contributed by disintegrating meteors.

In the emerging field of space sustainability science, researchers say orbital space and near-space should be considered part of the global environment. A 2022 journal article co-authored by Moriba Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics at the University of Texas at Austin, argued that the upper reaches of the atmosphere are experiencing increased impacts from human activities.

The expanding commercial use of what appears to be a free resource is actually shifting its real costs onto others, the article noted.

At last year’s European Geosciences Union conference, Leonard Schulz, who studies space pollution at the Technical University Braunschweig in Germany, said, “If you put large amounts of catalytic metals in the atmosphere, I immediately think about geoengineering.”

There may not be time to wait for more scientific certainty, Schulz said: “In 10 years, it might be too late to do anything about it.”

            <div id="article-text">A day after NASA officials expressed optimism that they could be ready to launch the Artemis II mission around the Moon next month, the space agency’s administrator announced Saturday that a new problem will require the removal of the rocket from its launch pad in Florida.

The latest issue appeared Friday evening, when data showed an interruption in helium flow into the upper stage of the Space Launch System rocket, NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman wrote in a post on X. Isaacman posted a more thorough update Saturday, writing that engineers are still examining the potential cause of the problem, but any fixes must take place inside the Vehicle Assembly Building.

That means NASA and contractor ground teams will immediately begin preparing to roll the 322-foot-tall (98-meter) SLS rocket off of Launch Complex 39B and back to the VAB. The rocket and its mobile launch platform will ride NASA’s crawler-transporter for the 4-mile journey.

“Regardless of the potential fault, accessing and remediating any of these issues can only be performed in the VAB,” Isaacman wrote. “As mentioned previously, we will begin preparations for rollback, and this will take the March launch window out of consideration. I understand people are disappointed by this development. That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor.”

NASA officials were eyeing a launch attempt for Artemis II as soon as March 6, the first of five launch opportunities available in March. There are approximately five days per month that the mission can depart the Earth after accounting for the position of the Moon in its orbit, the flight’s trajectory, and thermal and lighting constraints. The next series of launch dates begin April 1.

The space agency bypassed launch opportunities earlier this month after a fueling test on the SLS rocket revealed a hydrogen leak. After replacing seals in the fueling line leading into the SLS core stage, NASA completed a second fueling test Thursday with no significant leaks, raising hopes the mission could take off next month. With the discovery of the helium issue Friday night, the March launch dates are now off the table.

The helium system on the SLS upper stage—officially known as the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS)—performed well during both of the Artemis II countdown rehearsals. “Last evening, the team was unable to get helium flow through the vehicle. This occurred during a routine operation to repressurize the system,” Isaacman wrote.

Helium is used to purge the upper stage engine and pressurize its propellant tanks. The rocket is in a “safe configuration,” with a backup system providing purge air to the upper stage, NASA said in a statement.

NASA encountered a similar failure signature during preparations for launch of the first SLS rocket on the Artemis I mission in 2022. On Artemis I, engineers traced the problem to a failed check valve on the upper stage that needed replacement. NASA officials are not sure yet whether the helium issue Friday was caused by a similar valve failure, a problem with an umbilical interface between the rocket and the launch tower, or a fault with a filter, according to Isaacman.

In any case, technicians are unable to reach the problem area with the rocket at the launch pad. Inside the VAB, ground teams will extend work platforms around the rocket to provide physical access to the upper stage and its associated umbilical connections.

NASA said moving into preparations for rollback now will allow managers to potentially preserve the April launch window, “pending the outcome of data findings, repair efforts, and how the schedule comes to fruition in the coming days and weeks.”

It’s not clear if NASA will perform another fueling test on the SLS rocket after it returns to Launch Pad 39B, or whether technicians will do any more work on the delicate hydrogen umbilical near the bottom of the rocket responsible for recurring leaks during the Artemis I and Artemis II launch campaigns. Managers were pleased with the performance of newly-installed seals during Thursday’s countdown demonstration, but NASA officials have previously said vibrations from transporting the rocket to and from the pad could damage the seals.

“That rollout environment is very complicated,” said Amit Kshatriya, NASA’s associate administrator, earlier this month. “We think that’s a contributor.”

NASA is also expected to replace batteries on the rocket’s flight termination system inside the VAB. The destruct system batteries currently on the rocket will expire next month.

Artemis II will be the first human spaceflight mission to the vicinity of the Moon since 1972, and also marks the first time astronauts will fly aboard NASA’s SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. Astronaut Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, and mission specialists Christina Koch and Jeremy Hansen entered NASA’s standard preflight medical quarantine Friday. Now, they will be released to resume normal training activities.

Artemis II is a precursor for follow-on missions that will target landings at the Moon’s south pole. NASA aims to land the first Artemis mission on the Moon by 2028, but the schedule comes with uncertainties, such as the availability of a human-rated lander, spacesuits, and the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. A successful, and timely, Artemis II mission would help demonstrate that the SLS rocket and Orion will be ready.

With questions about the readiness of nearly every element of the Artemis program for a Moon landing mission, Isaacman teased a “more extensive briefing” on Artemis II and NASA’s broader lunar program later this week.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When dinosaur fossils surface at a site, it is often not possible to tell how many millions of years ago their bones were buried. While the different strata of sedimentary rock represent periods of geologic history frozen in time, accurately dating them or the fossils trapped within them has frequently proven to be frustrating.

Fossilized bones and teeth have been dated with some success before, but that success is inconsistent and depends on the specimens. Both fossilization and the process of sediment turning to rock can alter the bone in ways that interfere with accuracy. While uranium-lead dating is among the most widely used methods for dating materials, it is just an emerging technology when applied to directly dating fossils.

Dinosaur eggshells might have finally cracked a way to date surrounding rocks and fossils. Led by paleontologist Ryan Tucker of Stellenbosch University, a team of researchers has devised a method of dating eggshells that reveals how long ago they were covered in what was once sand, mud, or other sediments. That information will give the burial time of any other fossils embedded in the same layer of rock.

“If validated, this approach could greatly expand the range of continental sedimentary successions amenable to radioisotopic dating,” Tucker said in a study recently published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment.

Vertebrates have been laying calcified eggs for hundreds of millions of years (although the first dinosaur eggs had soft shells). What makes fossil eggshells so useful for figuring out the age of other fossils is the unique microstructure of calcium carbonate found in them. The way its crystals are arranged capture a record of diagenetic changes, or physical and chemical changes that occurred during fossilization. These can include water damage, along with breaks and fissures caused by being compacted between layers of sediment. This makes it easier to screen for these signs when trying to determine how old they are.

Eggs from two different Cretaceous sites were sampled. The first came from the Deep Eddy site in the Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah, which is surrounded by beds of petrified volcanic ash that had already been dated. The second group of samples came from egg clutches that had more recently been unearthed from the Teen Ulaan Chaltsai region of Mongolia’s Eastern Gobi Basin. The age of these eggs and the site they emerged from had previously been estimated but remained unknown.

Tucker and his team used uranium-lead radioisotopic dating on both sets of samples. This method can accurately date rocks that are anywhere from 1 million years old to those as ancient as the Earth itself, going back about 4.5 billion years.

Eggshells and other carbonate materials trap isotopes of lead and uranium. Uranium isotopes are unstable. Over time, they go through radioactive decay, releasing energy and losing protons and neutrons. One particular isotope decays via a pathway that ends with a lead isotope that is much more stable. The amount of lead keeps increasing in a way that’s proportional to the gradual decay of uranium. Finding out the relative amounts of these isotopes and taking their half-lives into account yields a sample’s age.

The eggs from Utah are thought to have been laid by a species of oviraptor, likely Macroelongatoolithus carlylei, while the Mongolian eggs were possibly laid by a Mongolian microtroodontid dinosaur—small, birdlike theropods that have been found to share ancestry with extant birds.

Trace element analysis showed that, despite being found on opposite sides of the planet, the structure of both eggshell samples was amazingly well preserved. There were only a few microfractures caused by the pressure of sedimentary layers packed above them as they fossilized.

After they determined an age for both shell samples by dating them directly, the researchers compared them. Zircons in the sediments of the Deep Eddy site had already established its age. It turned out that the nest site where the clutch of dinosaur eggs had been trapped between strata of volcanic rock dated as slightly older than the eggshells, which this method determined were 95 million years old. As expected, the rock found beneath the clutch was older, while the rock above was younger. The researchers think it is possible that fractures on these eggs may have resulted in slight inaccuracies.

As for the Mongolian eggs, the age from uranium-lead dating was also extremely close to that of the bedrock.

An analysis of trace elements in the Teen Ulaan Chaltsai eggs also turned up a surprise: A meteor had probably fallen to Earth around the time they were buried 99 million years ago. If there had been no meteor impact at the time, there must have already been meteor dust in the sediment that covered them.

“This study demonstrates that eggshell biocalcite from non-avian dinosaurs, birds, and other egg-laying vertebrates has the potential to serve as a reliable geochronometer in Mesozoic and Cenozoic terrestrial sedimentary basins,” Tucker said.

Next time a fossil site of indeterminate age confounds paleontologists, they need only look for dinosaur eggs.

            <div id="article-text">Daphne O. Martschenko and Sam Trejo both want to make the world a better, fairer, more equitable place. But they disagree on whether studying social genomics—elucidating any potential genetic contributions to behaviors ranging from mental illnesses to educational attainment to political affiliation—can help achieve this goal.

Martschenko’s argument is largely that genetic research and data have almost always been used thus far as a justification to further entrench extant social inequalities. But we know the solutions to many of the injustices in our world—trying to lift people out of poverty, for example—and we certainly don’t need more genetic research to implement them. Trejo’s point is largely that more information is generally better than less. We can’t foresee the benefits that could come from basic research, and this research is happening anyway, whether we like it or not, so we may as well try to harness it as best we can toward good and not ill.

Obviously, they’re both right. In What We Inherit: How New Technologies and Old Myths Are Shaping Our Genomic Future, we get to see how their collaboration can shed light on our rapidly advancing genetic capabilities.

Trejo is a (quantitative) sociologist at Princeton; Martschenko is a (qualitative) bioethicist at Stanford. He’s a he, and she’s a she; he looks white, she looks black; he’s East Coast, she’s West. On the surface, it seems clear that they would hold different opinions. But they still chose to spend 10 years writing this book in an “adversarial collaboration.” While they still disagree, by now at least they can really listen to and understand each other. In today’s world, that seems pretty worthwhile in and of itself.

The titular “What we inherit” refers to both actual DNA (Trejo’s field) and the myths surrounding it (Martschenko’s). There are two “genetic myths” that most concern them. One is the Destiny Myth: the notion, first promulgated by Francis Galton in his 1869 book Heredity Genius, that the effects of DNA can be separable from the effects of environment. He didn’t deny the effects of nurture; he just erroneously pitted it against nature, as if it were one versus the other instead of each impacting and working through the other. (The most powerful “genetic” determinant of educational attainment in his world was a Y chromosome.) His ideas reached their apotheosis in the forced sterilizations of the eugenics movement in the early 20th century in the US and, eventually, in the policies of Nazi Germany.

The other genetic myth the authors address is the Race Myth, “the false belief that DNA differences divide humans into discrete and biologically distinct racial groups.” (Humans can be genetically sorted by ancestry, but that’s not quite the same thing.) But they spend most of the book discussing polygenic scores, which sum up the impact of lots of small genetic influences. They cover what they are, their strengths and weaknesses, their past, present, and potential uses, and how and how much their use should be regulated. And of course, their ultimate question: Are they worth generating and studying at all?

One thing they agree on is that science education in this country is abysmal and needs to be improved immediately. Most people’s knowledge of genetics is stuck at Mendel and his green versus yellow, smooth versus wrinkled peas: dominant and recessive traits with manifestations that can be neatly traced in Punnet squares. Alas, most human traits are much more complicated than that, especially the interesting ones.

Polygenic scores tally the contributions of many genes to particular traits to predict certain outcomes. There’s no single gene for height, depression, or heart disease; there are a bunch of genes that each make very small contributions to making an outcome more or less likely. Polygenic scores can’t tell you that someone will drop out of high school or get a PhD; they can just tell you that someone might be slightly more or less likely to do so. They are probabilistic, not deterministic, because people’s mental health and educational attainment and, yes, even height, are determined by environmental factors as well as genes.

Polygenic scores, besides only giving predictions, are (a) not that accurate by nature; (b) become less accurate for each trait if you select for more than one trait, like height and intelligence; and (c) are less accurate for those not of European descent, since most genetic studies have thus far been done only with Europeans. So right out of the gate, any potential benefits of the technology will be distributed unevenly.

Another thing that Martschenko and Trejo agree on is that the generation, sale, and use of polygenic scores must be regulated much more assiduously than they currently are to ensure that they are implemented responsibly and equitably. “While scientists and policymakers are guarding the front gate against gene editing, genetic embryo selection (using polygenic scores) is slipping in through the backdoor,” they write. Potential parents using IVF have long been able to choose which embryos to implant based on gender and the presence of very clearcut genetic markers for certain serious diseases. Now, they can choose which embryos they want to implant based on their polygenic scores.

In 2020, a company called Genomic Prediction started offering genomic scores for diabetes, skin cancer, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, intellectual disability, and “idiopathic short stature.” They’ve stopped advertising the last two “because it’s too controversial.” Not, mind you, because the effects are minor and the science is unreliable. The theoretical maximum polygenic score for height would make a difference of 2.5 inches, and that theoretical maximum has not been seen yet, even in studies of Europeans. Polygenic scores for most other traits lag far behind. (And that’s just one company; another called Herasight has since picked up the slack and claims to offer embryo selection based on intelligence.)

Remember, the more traits one selects for, the less accurate each prediction is. Moreover, many genes affect multiple biological processes, so a gene implicated in one undesirable trait may have as yet undefined impacts on other desirable ones.

And all of this is ignoring the potential impact of the child’s environment. The first couple who used genetic screening for their daughter opted for an embryo that had a reduced risk of developing heart disease; her risk was less than 1 percent lower than the three embryos they rejected. Feeding her vegetables and sticking her on a soccer team would have been cheaper and probably more impactful.

Almost every family I know has a kid who has taken growth hormones, and plenty of them get tutoring, too. These interventions are hardly equitably distributed. But if embryos are selected based on polygenic scores, the authors fear that a new form of social inequality can arise. While growth hormone injections affect only one individual, embryonic selection based on polygenic scores affects all of that embryo’s descendants going forward. So the chosen embryos’ progeny could eventually end up treated as a new class of optimized people whose status might be elevated simply because their parents could afford to comb through their embryonic genomes—regardless of whether their “genetic” capabilities are actually significantly different from everyone else’s.

While it is understandable that parents want to give their kids the best chance of success, eliminating traits that they find objectionable will make humanity as a whole more uniform and society as a whole poorer for the lack of heterogeneity. Everyone can benefit from exposure to people who are different from them; if everyone is bred to be tall, smart, and good-looking, how will we learn to tolerate otherness?

Polygenic embryo selection is currently illegal in the UK, Israel, and much of Europe. In 2024, the FDA made some noise about planning to regulate the market, but for now companies offering polygenic scores to the public fall under the same nonmedical category as nutritional supplements—i.e. not regulatable. These companies advertise scores for traits like musical ability and acrophobia, but only for “wellness” or “educational” purposes.

So Americans are largely at the mercy of corporations that want to profit off of them at least as much as they claim to want to help them. And because this is still in the private sector, people who have the most social and environmental advantages—wealthy people with European ancestry—are often the only ones who can afford to try to give their kids any genetic advantages that might be had, further entrenching those social inequalities and potentially creating genetic inequalities that didn’t exist before. Hopefully, these parents will just be funding the snake-oil phase of the process so that if we can ever generate enough data to make polygenic scores actually reliable at predicting anything meaningful, they will be inexpensive enough to be accessible to anyone who wants them.</div>

            <h2>Major government research lab appears to be squeezing out foreign scientists</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-21</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/major-government-research-lab-appears-to-be-squeezing-out-foreign-scientists/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">One of the US government’s top scientific research labs is taking steps that could drive away foreign scientists, a shift lawmakers and sources tell WIRED could cost the country valuable expertise and damage the agency’s credibility.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) helps determine the frameworks underpinning everything from cybersecurity to semiconductor manufacturing. Some of NIST’s recent work includes establishing guidelines for securing AI systems and identifying health concerns with air purifiers and firefighting gloves. Many of the agency’s thousands of employees, postdoctoral scientists, contractors, and guest researchers are brought in from around the world for their specialized expertise.

“For weeks now, rumors of draconian new measures have been spreading like wildfire, while my staff’s inquiries to NIST have gone unanswered,” Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, wrote in a letter sent to acting NIST Director Craig Burkhardt on Thursday. April McClain Delaney, a fellow Democrat on the committee, cosigned the message.

Lofgren wrote that while her staff has heard about multiple rumored changes, what they have confirmed through unnamed sources is that the Trump administration “has begun taking steps to limit the ability of foreign-born researchers to conduct their work at NIST.”

The congressional letter follows a Boulder Reporting Lab article on February 12 that said international graduate students and postdoctoral researchers would be limited to a maximum of three years at NIST going forward, despite many of them needing five to seven years to complete their work.

A NIST employee tells WIRED that some plans to bring on foreign workers through the agency’s Professional Research and Experience Program have recently been canceled because of uncertainty about whether they would make it through the new security protocols. The staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, says the agency has yet to widely communicate what the new hurdles will be or why it believes they are justified.

On Thursday, the Colorado Sun reported that “noncitizens” lost after-hours access to a NIST lab last month and could soon be banned from the facility entirely.

Jennifer Huergo, a spokesperson for NIST, tells WIRED that the proposed changes are aimed at protecting US science from theft and abuse, echoing a similar statement issued this week to other media outlets. Huergo declined to comment on who needs to approve the proposal for it to be finalized and when a decision will be made. She also didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawmakers’ letter.

Preventing foreign adversaries from stealing valuable American intellectual property has been a bipartisan priority, with NIST among the agencies in recent years to receive congressional scrutiny about the adequacy of its background checks and security policies. Just last month, Republican lawmakers renewed calls to put restrictions in place preventing Chinese nationals from working at or with national labs run by the Department of Energy.

But Lofgren’s letter contends that the rumored restrictions on non-US scientists at NIST go beyond “what is reasonable and appropriate to protect research security.” The letter demands transparency about new policies by February 26 and a pause on them “until Congress can weigh in on whether these changes are necessary at all.”

The potential loss of research talent at NIST would add to a series of other Trump administration policies that some US tech industry leaders have warned will dismantle the lives of immigrant researchers already living in the US and hamper economic growth. Hiking fees on H-1B tech visas, revoking thousands of student visas, and carrying out legally dubious mass deportations all stand to push people eager to work on science and tech research in the US to go elsewhere instead. The Trump administration has also announced plans to limit post-graduation job training for international students.

Pat Gallagher, who served as the director of NIST from 2009 to 2013 under President Barack Obama, says the changes could erode trust in the agency, which has long provided the technical foundations that industry and governments around the world rely on. “What has made NIST special is it is scientifically credible,” he tells WIRED. “Industry, universities, and the global measurement community knew they could work with NIST.”

Like much of the federal government, NIST has been in turmoil for most of the past year. Parts of it were paralyzed for months as rumors of DOGE cuts spread. Ultimately, the agency lost hundreds of its thousands of workers to budget cuts, with further funding pressure to come.

As of a couple of years ago, NIST welcomed 800 researchers on average annually from outside the US to work in its offices and collaborate directly with staff.

Lofgren expressed fear that rumors may be enough to scare away researchers and undermine US competitiveness in vital research. “Our scientific excellence depends upon attracting the best and brightest from around the world,” she wrote in the letter.

            <h2>After fueling test, optimism grows for March launch of Artemis II to the Moon</h2>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/nasa-reports-no-significant-leaks-in-artemis-ii-fueling-test-eyes-march-6-launch/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A second fueling test on NASA’s Space Launch System rocket ended Thursday night, giving senior managers enough confidence to move forward with plans to launch four astronauts around the Moon as soon as March 6.

Unlike the first attempt to load propellants into the SLS rocket on February 2, there were no major leaks during Thursday’s practice countdown at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Technicians swapped seals at the launch pad after hydrogen gas leaked from the rocket’s main fueling line earlier this month. This time, the seals held.

“For the most part, those fixes all performed pretty well yesterday,” said Lori Glaze, acting associate administrator for NASA’s exploration programs. “We were able to fully fuel the SLS rocket within the planned timeline.”

The results keep the Artemis II mission on track for liftoff as soon as next month. NASA gave up on a series of February launch opportunities after encountering a persistent hydrogen leak during the first Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR).

“We’re now targeting March 6 as our earliest launch attempt,” Glaze said. “I am going to caveat that. I want to be open, transparent with all of you that there is still pending work. There’s work, a lot of forward work, that remains.”

If teams complete all of that work, liftoff of the Artemis II mission could occur within a two-hour window opening at 8:29 pm EST on March 6 (01:29 UTC on March 7). NASA has other launch dates available on March 7, 8, 9, and 11, but the mission may have to wait until April. There are approximately five days per month that the mission can depart the Earth after accounting for the position of the Moon in its orbit, the flight’s trajectory, and thermal and lighting constraints.

The Artemis II mission will last between nine and 10 days, taking NASA’s Orion spacecraft with commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, and mission specialists Christina Koch and Jeremy Hansen around the far side of the Moon before returning to Earth for splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. Wiseman’s crew will set the record for the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth, and will become the first people to fly to the vicinity of the Moon since 1972.

Artemis II is a precursor for follow-in missions that will target landings at the Moon’s south pole. NASA aims to land the first Artemis mission on the Moon by 2028, but the schedule comes with uncertainties, such as the readiness of a human-rated lander, spacesuits, and the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. A successful Artemis II mission would help demonstrate that the SLS rocket and Orion will be ready.

“The excitement for Artemis II is really, really starting to build,” Glaze said. “We can really start to feel it. It’s coming.”

But getting to launch day for Artemis II has not been smooth sailing for NASA. The mission’s first fueling test ran several hours behind schedule on February 2. The launch team paused loading propellant into the rocket after identifying a leak in the connection where supercold liquid hydrogen flows from the launch platform into the SLS core stage.

Sensors near the connection detected hydrogen concentrations exceeding NASA’s safety limit of 16 percent during the first countdown rehearsal. The launch team temporarily contained the leak within limits by stopping and restarting the flow of hydrogen, but the hydrogen leak again tripped the safety threshold as the core stage fuel tank began to pressurize in the final 10 minutes of the countdown.

NASA called an end to the test, drained propellants from the rocket, and ordered workers to replace seals on the fueling umbilical, setting up for the second WDR this week. This time, the hydrogen sensors topped out at 1.6 percent, about one-tenth of NASA’s limit.

Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, NASA’s Artemis II launch director, said her team saw “very good performance” from the hydrogen seals on Thursday. The countdown ran close to the planned schedule, allowing the launch team to complete two runs through the final 10-minute terminal countdown sequence before ending the test at T-minus 29 seconds.

“When we wrapped all that up, we still had launch window remaining,” Blackwell-Thompson said. “So, very successful day. I’m very proud of this team and all that they accomplished to get us to yesterday and then to go execute with such precision.”

Engineers will spend the next few days examining all the data from Thursday’s countdown. Several other issues popped up during the test. The launch team overcame a communications problem and briefly paused the countdown to assess a potential issue with a booster avionics system. Blackwell-Thompson said engineers will continue assessing the avionics system to ensure it is ready for launch.

“So far, we don’t have any indications of anything that we’re worried about, but we’re just getting started [with the data review],” said John Honeycutt, NASA’s chair of the Artemis II Mission Management Team. “So, we’ll go through that and see what the teams come up with and address those as needed, but overall, it was a good day for us.”

There is no guarantee, of course, that the hydrogen seals will work as well the next time NASA fuels the SLS rocket. The seals, made of Teflon, have a history of fickleness. NASA encountered persistent hydrogen leaks ahead of the launch of the first SLS rocket on the Artemis I mission 2022.

But the seals worked better on Thursday than they did during any of the prior fueling operations. There are no plans to go in and replace them again before launch. “I’ve got a pretty high level of confidence in the configuration that we’re in right now,” Honeycutt said.

The “forward work” ahead for the Artemis II team includes a Flight Readiness Review late next week, when senior agency leaders will convene to formally certify the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft for flight. Over the next few days, technicians at Kennedy Space Center will retest the rocket’s range safety destruct system.

The Artemis II astronauts entered NASA’s standard two-week-long preflight medical quarantine on Friday at their home base in Houston. Wiseman and his crewmates will fly to Florida about five to seven days before launch.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Whole Foods shelves sit empty after a data breach shut down its wholesale distributor. Meat packers working for JBS Foods are paralyzed as an $11 million ransomware attack takes out their processing facilities. Some 2.2 million workers at Stop & Shop and Hannaford have their personal data exposed as the result of a cyberattack on parent company Ahold Delhaize USA.

These scenarios, straight from a William Gibson novel, are becoming increasingly common in supply chains across the world. As recently noted by Mohammed Alzuhair, a doctoral candidate in business administration at Durham University, the growing number of grocery store failures isn’t a coincidence, but the result of AI’s pernicious creep into the global food network.

In a bygone age, food went from farm and orchard straight to the general store — the only middleman being a clerk whose storefront served as an easy rallying point for consumers. Today, the supply chain is like a spider web of contractors and wholesalers, where every shipment is insured based on risk algorithms and tracked by transportation management systems.

Just as AI’s being pushed into every other facet of our lives, it’s coming for each point in the supply chain too, turning an already vulnerable system into an automated security nightmare.

Alzuhair notes that the number of businesses choosing AI automation over human-level supply management has gone through the roof in recent years.

As one study found, AI is now deeply embedded in all six stages of the UK’s food system: supply, production, processing, distribution, consumption, and waste. Farms across the world are turning to precision agriculture models powered by AI, which is said to track individual plant and animal data and all the logistics they encompass — from seed procurement to harvest, from livestock feed to the slaughterhouse.

This is all well and good if we’re only worried about productivity. But as the rise in devastating cyber-attacks makes clear, the increasing reliance on AI also has the effect of removing human judgement from the supply chain. When cyberattacks reshuffle stores’ digital records, there are increasingly few personnel who know how to right the ship. In many cases, Alzuhair writes, human supply chain managers are no longer being asked to override automatic shipments or intervene when discrepancies occur under their jurisdiction.

The result of all this may be catastrophic. Should a worst-case scenario ever occur — a cyberattack, a natural disaster, an internet outage — there may be no human workers left with the skills that once kept food on the shelves.

            <div id="article-text">Late in 2023, the corporate world was abuzz with the utopian promise of AI — especially about the tech’s effects on the environment.

From today’s vantage point, some of the corporate claims floating around back then sound patently absurd: Google insisted that AI had the potential to “mitigate 5-10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions,” while Microsoft enthused that the new tech would “accelerate the discovery and development of sustainability solutions.” Even academics played along. Jim Bellingham of Johns Hopkins’ Institute for Assured Autonomy claimed that “AI-powered robots” and satellites would form part of a system helping to “reduce the carbon that is released into the atmosphere.”

So far, reality has demonstrated the exact opposite. Not only are electrical demands of data centers supercharging our carbon emissions, but the technology itself is now being used to actively resist climate regulations.

According to new reporting by the Los Angeles Times, an eco-friendly initiative to phase out the use of gas-powered appliances in Southern California was defeated thanks to a campaign weaponizing a suite of AI software. The regulation, proposed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD), would have gradually phased out household water heaters and furnaces powered with natural gas, as part of an effort to limit the emissions of smog-causing nitrogen oxide.

As the initiative proceeded through AQMD’s board in summer of 2025, the agency became inundated with tens of thousands of seemingly organic emails voicing opposition to the regulations. As the LA Times notes, the flood of angry public comments got a significant boost from CiviClick, an AI platform which bills itself as a “Disruptive Digital Advocacy Software.”

According to records requests, more than 20,000 public comments directed at AQMD’s initiative were drummed up via CiviClick.

While it isn’t clear where AI was deployed in the campaign, CiviClick boasts a number of solutions bundled as “Grassroots Advocacy Software.” These include auto-filled webforms, as well as video and photo messages to elected officials. Most crucially CiviClick advertises an “AI powered automatic message generator,” which comes with “auto-randomizing” messaging, “unlimited subject lines and message bodies,” and “smart targeting ability.”

In the face of such vast public opposition — or what appeared to be, at the time — the AQMD board voted 7-5 to reject the measure, which would have slowly raised the cost of gas-powered appliances through small surcharges.

The email campaign’s mastermind, Matt Klink, went so far as to say CiviClick made “the ultimate difference” in shooting down the environmental safeguards.

“We did two separate rounds of outreach, and they met the targets in both rounds early,” Klink told political consulting publication Campaigns and Elections in a sponsored interview. “AQMD staff are not used to getting tens of thousands of emails so it [CiviClick] made a massive difference in turning the tide.”

Though Klink claimed that CiviClick was simply an email tool used to connect voters to AQMD staff en-masse, an investigation showed otherwise. As the LA Times notes, at least three people contacted afterward said they weren’t aware that CiviClick had sent comments to AQMD on their behalf.

As sources within AQMD told the newspaper, the onslaught definitely had an impact on the board’s decision, which in-turn played into the hands of the gas industry. (Which, for its part, had been waging a legal battle against the environmental agency since December of 2024.)

As one staffer told the LA Times, the usual amount of public comments per agenda item can be counted on one hand.

Notably, Klink declined to tell the LA Times who had funded the CiviClick campaign. His public affairs company, Klink Campaigns, is a partner at California Strategies, which the paper notes is one of the largest lobbying firms in the state. Its clients include corporate landlord groups, energy conglomerates, and Fortune 500 energy company Sempra, owner of the massive Southern California Gas Company.

While astroturfing is nothing new in US politics, AI-powered astroturfing marks an ominous escalation. On top of signaling a horrifying turn for civic engagement, it opens up a tremendous can of worms for political campaigning across the US. As long as AI can fabricate thousands of constituents on demand, corporate interests no longer need the pretense of democracy — they can just rent it.

            <div id="article-text">Somewhere in the long tradition of Trump family grifting, there’s a line between “nakedly corrupt” and “genuinely mortifying.” Eric Trump’s latest investment in an Israeli drone company that advertises a “low cost per kill” lands smack dab in the middle.

According to recent reporting by the Wall Street Journal, the young Trump is taking part in a $1.5 billion deal to take the drone company Xtend public.

Potential Xtend investors will be happy to know the company already comes with a multi-million contract with the Pentagon, and is part of the Defense Department’s “Drone Dominance Program,” an effort reform the weapons procurement process and rapidly produce swarms of low cost drones, Al Jazeera has reported.

Xtend isn’t some fly-by-night weapons company, either. Per reporting by The New Arab, Xtend’s drones have played a role in Israel’s war in Gaza, where they reportedly killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in 2024.

The company’s hand in the destruction of Palestine hasn’t gone unnoticed by activists in the US, where Xtend’s planted at least one facility with help from the Florida Israeli Business Accelerator, a taxpayer funded initiative operating in the state.

In sum, Xtend’s services are now being pitched to the same Pentagon Donald Trump controls, under direction from his son, aided by a US footprint funded by Florida taxpayers. In case the web wasn’t tangled enough, the WSJ notes that, Donald Trump Jr — another presidential scion — has separately thrown his name behind the military drone firm Unusual Machines, itself a strategic investor in the Xtend deal.

That marks a total of eleven companies joined by Don Jr and Eric Trump since their father’s election victory in 2024 — a clear sign that the Trump family has learned how to make the most of the presidency this time around.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For decades, scientists have been studying intriguing “gravity holes,” which are enormous depressions in the Earth’s crust where the effects of gravity are significantly lower than average.

It’s an especially pertinent phenomenon in the Antarctic, a region that has seen significant changes not just due to global warming, but far longer-term climate changes spanning tens of millions of years — long before the emergence of humans and their environmentally disastrous footprint on the planet. The effects of gravity are particularly weak beneath the icy continent when accounting for our planet’s rotation, the result of slow rock movements deep beneath the ice.

As detailed in a new paper published in the journal Scientific Reports, University of Florida geophysics professor Alessandro Forte and Paris Institute of Earth Physics researcher Petar Glišović found that these rock movements are correlated to major changes in Antarctica’s climate, suggesting how the area’s gravity shifts may have allowed its ice sheets to grow.

The pair created a detailed map of the Antarctic’s “gravity hole” to study how it changed over millions of years, using a wealth of global earthquake recordings from across the planet.

“Imagine doing a CT scan of the whole Earth, but we don’t have X-rays like we do in a medical office,” said Forte in a statement. “We have earthquakes. Earthquake waves provide the ‘light’ that illuminates the interior of the planet.”

Using computer models, the team reconstructed the state of Antarctic’s gravity hole 70 million years ago, around the time when dinosaurs still roamed the Earth. They determined that the hole has gained strength over tens of millions of years, coinciding with major changes in the continent’s climate system and the widespread formation of glaciers, which in turn, had sweeping effects on sea levels the acidity of our planet’s oceans.

While the findings aren’t a definitive causal link between the two — rock movements and shifting gravity causing ice to grow — Forte and Glišović are hoping to test whether sea level changes may be directly influenced by this strengthening gravity hole.

“How does our climate connect to what’s going on inside our planet?” Forte asked rhetorically in the statement. “If we can better understand how Earth’s interior shapes gravity and sea levels, we gain insight into factors that may matter for the growth and stability of large ice sheets.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Since the start of 2025, at least 30 cities have canceled their contracts with Flock Safety, the AI surveillance company whose CEO wants to end all crime within the decade by blanketing the country in ever-watchful security cameras.

That startling figure comes courtesy of NPR, which reports that concerned activists are putting mounting pressure on cities to cut ties with the company.

“We are seeing a lot more momentum,” Will Freeman, a Colorado-based organizer who runs the website DeFlock.org, told the broadcaster. “I expect there to be more cities dropping Flock.”

The grassroots campaigns have successfully booted Flock from cities like Flagstaff, Arizona, Eugene Oregon, and Santa Cruz, California.

“In the end, it was just clear that this wasn’t going to be a technology that was going to be well received or that we could continue to use,” Flagstaff mayor Becky Daggett told NPR, reflecting on community outrage over the devices.

DeFlock is an open-source web app designed to track license plate readers throughout the United States. While Flock is the biggest, it’s not the only surveillance vendor tracked by DeFlock, which currently has over 77,000 AI license plate readers logged on its interactive map.

On the surface, license plate readers might seem passive, a non-issue unless you’re up to no good. Yet as DeFlock notes, they come with many hidden dangers to ordinary residents. License plate readers create detailed records of your location history, which have led to wrongful arrests, racial profiling, and stalking by police officers.

In one illustrative example from October, a Denver woman was accused of stealing a package worth $25 after police, using Flock, determined that she had been driving nearby on the day the theft occurred. In the end, GPS data showed the woman had driven through the area without stopping, revealing that police had taken flawed data from the AI surveillance software as evidence enough to pursue charges.

Opposition against Flock has only flared since, especially as the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Donald Trump weaponize AI surveillance tools to expand their dystopian crackdown on immigrants.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">An AI “filmmaker” was viciously mocked after begging his followers for ideas on what to make.

“I will have 30k to make a fully AI film, what’s the plan?” wrote the filmmaker, Ian Durar, in a tweet. “I’m supposed to have ideas by next week. cmon guys what do you want to see? I like sci-fi but it feels to obvious for AI.”

Nothing says creativity like crowdsourcing ideas on X, right? Reid Southen, a film concept artist, responded by lambasting the entire pursuit of AI filmmaking as “completely unserious.”

“You’ve got people with $30k begging the internet for ideas by next week because they have nothing of their own to say, it’s just slop for the sake of slop,” Southen fumed. “Embarrassing state of affairs.”

“Prime example of how tools don’t make the filmmaker,” echoed actor Luke Barnett.

Even other AI evangelists were embarrassed.

“This is the wrong question to be asking dumbass. If you’re gonna have 30k to make a film, you should be trying to find a script,” scolded Gregory Mandarano, a screenwriter who also describes himself as an AI artist.

The ideas that Durar’s followers came up with, by the way, were horrendous: a film about a tavern in “Ogreville” where every Ogre knows your name; or “an epic sci-fi goontech adventure starting big titty Elsa and dumptruck Moana.”

AI is supposed to be the future of filmmaking and the arts. It will democratize it, boosters insist, and revolutionize it. Anytime someone posts one of those AI-generated videos with deepfaked actors in them is an occasion for legions of AI bros to sneer that Hollywood’s days will soon be numbered.

But if all that’s the case, how come none of these AI “artists” seem to possess a single creative molecule in their body? Why is every AI video just a riff on existing stories, mashing celebrities together like a kid with their dolls? Why are their influences all actual artists and not other bozos typing a prompt into a text window who’re convinced that they’re also the next Stanley Kubrick? And even if someone genuinely creative leverages AI, any original thought they have gets smoothly averaged out into an algorithmic sludge that they didn’t directly make. It’s no longer an interesting extension of their own ideas, but of a a vast repository of reconstituted work by other humans.

Durar, nonetheless, is adamant that’s he’s spearheading a revolution akin to digital photography’s introduction into filmmaking.

“All of those things became the norm, and so will AI,” he wrote. “I may be early but I’m never wrong. Get over it. It’s just a tool.”

For nearly three decades, Bill Gurley has been among of the most influential voices in Silicon Valley — a general partner at Benchmark whose early bets on companies like Uber, Zillow, and Stitch Fix helped define what modern venture capital looks like. Now, having moved to Austin and stepped back from active investing, the native Texan is channeling that same pattern-recognition instinct into something different: a book, a foundation, and a policy institute aimed at problems he thinks he can actually move.

The book is Runnin’ Down a Dream — a nod to Tom Petty and also an argument that following your passion isn’t just romanticized career advice but an actual competitive strategy, one that becomes only more urgent as AI rapidly reshapes the workforce. The foundation, which he’s calling the Running Down a Dream Foundation, will award 100 grants of $5,000 a year to people who need a financial cushion to make a leap they’ve been afraid to take.

We caught up with Gurley to talk about all of it — including what he makes of the somewhat surreal reality that several of his former peers in tech now hold enormous sway in Washington, why he thinks the 996 grind culture many young founders have adopted is less alarming than it sounds, and what AI really means for your career. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Our full conversation with Gurley drops Tuesday on TC’s StrictlyVC Download podcast.

I went through a phase where I was reading a lot of biographies — people from very different fields, different time windows — and I started noticing patterns the way I would notice patterns in a market evolving. I wrote them down. A couple years later I got invited to speak at the University of Texas, dusted off the notes, built a presentation. They posted it on YouTube, and James Clear — who wrote Atomic Habits — noticed and posted about it. That’s what got me thinking about a book. And when I went through my own process of moving away from venture and thinking about what I wanted to do next, it became obvious I didn’t want to write about VC or Uber or any of that. I wanted to do something that could have a bigger mission.

Your research with Wharton found that roughly 60% of people would do things differently if they could start their careers over. That shocked you. Why?

When we first ran it as a SurveyMonkey poll we got seven out of ten. When we did it more rigorously with Wharton, we got six out of ten. One of the things that strikes me is that we have a phrase in the book — life is a use it or lose it proposition — and when you’re young, it’s just hard to have that framing. It’s hard to fast-forward through all of your time and recognize how precious it is. Daniel Pink has done a lot of work on what he calls regrets of inaction — the thing that weighs on people most as they get older is the thing they didn’t try, the stone left unturned. That holds across multiple geographies and cultures. And I think a lot of well-intentioned parents feel more responsibility to create economic stability for their kids than to encourage them to truly explore their passion. Especially with AI out there, that may not have been the right call.

Exploring your passion sounds like easier advice for people who have financial runway. What do you say to someone working paycheck to paycheck?

A few things. First, the book profiles people who started on the very bottom rung and climbed to the top — [celebrity hairstylist and entrepreneur] Jen Atkins moved to LA with $200 in her pocket. There’s nothing in the book that says you need to start anywhere other than right at the beginning. Second, if you’re living paycheck to paycheck, I wouldn’t encourage you to quit. I’d encourage you to use your free time to build a little document on your phone about what your thing might be. Learn. Prepare to jump before you jump. And third — this is why I’m launching the foundation. The last page of the book talks about it: we’re going to give 100 grants a year of $5,000 to people who are in exactly that position, who can convince us in an application that they’ve thought long and hard about where they want to go but need a little help getting there.

You’ve been outspoken for years about regulatory capture — the idea that big companies use regulation to entrench themselves.

I gave a speech on regulatory capture a few years back — it was at the All-In Summit — and at the time I said I had a fear that the AI companies would try to use regulation to protect themselves. I think that’s happening now. The flip side is that there are legitimate questions: Jonathan Haidt’s book Anxious Generation has been on the bestseller list for almost two years, arguing social media has been really bad for children, with academic research to back it up. People would say we should have gotten in front of social media and need to do it with AI. The problem is that the people begging for regulation the most in AI are the actual companies themselves, and that makes me skeptical. There’s also the global dimension — if US AI gets entangled in state-by-state regulation and Chinese models are running free, we’re going to paint ourselves in red tape. I always ask people: what are your favorite five regulations of all time, and how were they successful? Do you have any confidence that people at the state level in a random state know how to write good AI regulation that will actually work?

It’s a little surreal that several prominent figures from your world now hold enormous influence in Washington. What do you make of that?

It’s very ironic. If you go back and watch that regulatory capture talk, who would have thought a few years later David Sacks would actually be [special advisor for AI and crypto in the White House]?

Back in 2018, Mike Moritz of Sequoia wrote in the FT that Americans would lose to China if they didn’t start working harder. It was controversial at the time, but a lot of young founders here seem to have since embraced a punishing work culture — the 996 ethos. What are your thoughts about what’s happening?

I kind of love it, honestly. I think Silicon Valley got really lazy during COVID — people weren’t coming into the office, the culture got soft in a way I hadn’t seen in all my years there. And I’ve been to China six times. I know what Michael Moritz was describing when he said we’re going to lose not because they’re smarter but because they have a better work ethic. But here’s the thing: if you study successful people across a lot of fields, we think it’s wonderful when an athlete practices 12 hours a day or when an artist works obsessively on their craft. Nobody says Jordan didn’t have work-life balance. We just don’t extend the same logic to building a company. If those founders love what they’re doing that much, and they feel like this is the moment to go hard, that’s actually precisely the point of the book: find the thing that makes you feel that way.

You talk about mentorship in the book. What makes a great mentor relationship and how do people find one?

The number one thing is to get out of your head this ideal that gets passed around in the self-help world: ‘go get a mentor,’ and everyone runs out and cold calls someone that’s ridiculously too high and unachievable, and it doesn’t work. For all those people that are really out of reach right now, I call them aspirational mentors — create a persona of them, just like I was talking about with the dream job folder. Get clips of all the books they’ve written, podcasts they’ve done, interviews they’ve done, and study them. You can learn a lot from people without talking to them directly, especially in the modern age. And then for your real mentors, go two levels down from where you thought you were going to aim. Discover somebody — tools like LinkedIn make this so easy — and be the first person to ever call them and ask them to be a mentor, because they’ll be flattered. They’ll be flattered that you knew who they were. Imagine anyone getting their first call to be a mentor. It’s a great feeling. You’re going to have way more success with that interaction than shooting too high.

I’ll tell you a funny story: I started getting so many calls from people who wanted to break into venture that I wrote a three-page PDF called “So You Want to Be a VC,” and hidden in the third page was basically — go do X, go do Y, go do Z, come back and tell me how that went. The number of people that actually ended up talking to me after getting that document was a fraction of the number I sent it to. It’s funny how much it thinned when you gave them a little homework to do.

You started working on this book before the impacts of AI became clearer. Does that at all change how people should think about their careers?

If you’re following the traditional path — going through the career center at your university, signing up on a list, waiting for a recruiter to sit through 30 people in 20-minute slots — you look like a cog. You look mass-produced. For that group, AI looks frightening, and maybe it should. But if you are blazing your own trail, using the techniques in the book, becoming what I call a candidate of one — someone whose path looks completely unique because you’ve built it intentionally — then every tool in this book is amplified by AI. Learning has never been easier than right now, in the entire history of the world. If you’re running toward it, if you’re becoming the most AI-aware person in your field, this thing is nothing but a superpower.

Quantum computing will not be replacing supercomputers in 2026, let alone reaching industrial scale. And yet, investor appetite for companies pursuing the elusive quantum advantage hasn’t dwindled — it has increased.

Quantonation Ventures, a venture firm investing in quantum and physics-based startups, has closed its oversubscribed second fund at €220 million, or approximately $260 million. That’s more than twice the size of its inaugural fund, and comes in addition to other signals that the quantum winter isn’t coming yet.

While some warned that too much quantum hype and not enough tangible outcomes would eventually cause funding to collapse, the opposite has happened. Take the prediction that quantum will eventually crack modern encryption: that moment has no clear timeline, and yet governments have joined Big Tech in the race.

In the years since Quantonation’s launch in 2018, the quantum technology sector has become less incipient, with both technological breakthroughs and early demand from academic and industrial labs. As a result, there has also been “a shift in the types of investment opportunities that are available” to its second fund, Quantonation partner Will Zeng told TechCrunch.

One example is what Zeng describes as the “picks and shovels” opportunity, with companies developing technologies that support the quantum industry. He cited the example of Dutch startup Qblox, a long-boostrapped company that was selling quantum control hardware and software to Quantonation portfolio companies before the VC firm co-led its Series A.

This growing ecosystem also explains why backers are doubling down on Quantonation, and why other dedicated quantum funds such as QDNL and 55 North have emerged.

“VCs recognize that this is not an easy area to invest in at the early stage. The technology is very specific and complex, the markets are often new, and the teams as well,” Zeng said.

The firm’s thesis is to invest early to capture more value; but a handful of quantum companies have already gone public, and their shares have surged in recent months. According to Bloomberg, this “quantum frenzy” is partly stocked by Nvidia, whose CEO Jensen Huang declared in June 2025 that “quantum computing is reaching an inflection point.”

Despite the fact that quantum chips have yet to outperform classical computers outside of purpose-built benchmarks, consensus is growing that real-life applications are only a few years away, from life sciences to new materials. That’s in part thanks to advancements in error correction — the ability to fix the mistakes that quantum systems are prone to.

Google’s Willow chip was a landmark for error correction in 2024, but no architecture has won yet, and smaller players are still in the race. Zeng noted that a surprising number of companies have entered DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative. He also believes that beyond the public market excitement, “there are more exciting technologies that are currently private.”

For Quantonation, those private opportunities span a wider canvas than quantum chips alone. Fund two has already invested in 12 startups, with a target portfolio of around 25, covering not just the software and industrial layers needed to make quantum advantage real, but also adjacent physics-based technologies such as photonics and lasers.

This expanded thesis is backed by investors old and new. According to the firm, major investors from its first vintage, including Singapore’s Vertex Holdings and Bpifrance’s Fonds National d’Amorçage 2, have returned for the second fund, with new limited partners including the European Investment Fund, Grupo ACS, Novo Holdings, Planet First Partners, and Toshiba.

Quantonation’s geographic scope is equally international. With dual headquarters in Paris and New York City, the firm has backed French quantum companies including Pasqal and Quandela, but also placed bets in Asia and North America — and will continue doing so.

“In a lot of the areas we invest in, there’s not yet a clear regional winner, […] and a lot of the research has come from universities in many places,” Zeng said.

President Donald Trump said in a social media post Saturday that Netflix will “pay the consequences” if it doesn’t fire Susan Rice, who has served as the company’s board of directors since 2018.

Trump’s comments came after Rice — a former ambassador to the United Nations who held diplomatic and advisory roles in the Obama and Biden administrations — appeared on the “Stay Tuned with Preet” podcast hosted by Preet Bhara and predicted that corporations that “take a knee” to Trump will be “held accountable” when Democrats return to power.

“If these corporations think that the Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to, you know, play by the old rules, and […] say, ‘Oh, never mind. We’ll forgive you for all the people you fired, all the policies and principles you’ve violated, all, you know, the laws you’ve skirted,’ I think they’ve got another thing coming,” Rice said.

In response, Trump posted on his social network Truth Social, “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences. She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what???”

Trump’s post also includes a screenshot of a post from far-right activist Laura Loomer criticizing Rice’s comments and claiming, “The Netflix-Warner Bros. merger would result in a streaming monopoly, which the Obamas will have a significant stake in” due to the deal between Netflix and the Obamas’ production company Higher Ground.

While Trump’s post does not mention specific consequences, Netflix’s massive Warner Bros. acquisition will need to be approved by federal regulators. The streaming company’s co-CEO Ted Sarandos reportedly met with Trump before the deal was announced, with Trump subsequently saying that Netflix is a “great company […] but it’s a lot of market share, so we’ll have to see what happens.”

Last fall, Trump published a similar post demanding that Microsoft fire its president of global affairs Lisa Monaco, who was also the target of Loomer’s criticism. Monaco is still at Microsoft.

Earlier this month, Waymo chief safety officer Mauricio Peña testified before the Senate Commerce Committee as part of a hearing to talk about autonomous vehicles.

Much of the questioning fell under the standard “let’s educate the public” category. But it was Sen. Ed Markey’s questions about overseas workers, and Peña’s response, that everyone paid attention to.

Peña, when asked about human workers who assist with Waymo vehicles’ navigation or emergencies, revealed that the company has remote guidance workers based overseas in the Philippines. This sparked some quick ire from Markey, who admonished Peña on how the company could rely on people without U.S. driver’s licenses to assist its vehicles on U.S. roads, among other criticisms.

Waymo formulated a response in a blog post written by Waymo’s head of global operations Ryan McNamara, which was published Tuesday. It has also shared the letter it sent to Markey’s office.

The post and letter do provide fresh insight about its remote-assistance operations. For instance, Waymo stresses it does not employ people who “remotely drive” the robotaxis. Instead, the self-driving systems are the ones in charge.

Remote assistance (RA) workers are there to respond to specific requests for information that the Waymo self-driving system asks for. The company also has Event Response Teams, or ERTs, people who are certified for more complex tasks and are exclusively based in the United States. This team responds to collisions, interfacing with law enforcement and the rider, collecting data for regulatory reporting, and coordinating towing, Waymo says.

We also now know that Waymo has about “70 Remote Assistance agents on duty worldwide at any given time.” These folks are based in Arizona, Michigan, and in two cities in the Philippines, a detail that, again, has raised the ire of some lawmakers.

To give you a sense of what that means, consider that Waymo has a fleet of 3,000 vehicles and every week its vehicles drive over 4 million miles and provide over 400,000 rides. So, very few workers are monitoring lots of robotaxis.

I have argued for years that AV companies need to do a better job of explaining what happens behind the scenes, particularly when it comes to remote guidance. Most companies, many of which no longer exist, avoided the topic like a plague, perhaps in an effort to make its tech seem more magical and innovative. Turns out, mystery breeds mistrust.

While the debate over remote guidance operators plays out, Waymo continues to press into new markets. With one exception.

New York governor Kathy Hochul withdrew a proposal that would have amended vehicle and traffic laws to effectively legalize robotaxis in the state outside of New York City. Hochul spokesperson Sean Butler told me: “Based on conversations with stakeholders, including in the legislature, it was clear that the support was not there to advance this proposal.”

One more thing before we jump into the rest of the news. Mobility readers sure don’t believe the Rivian R2 will be priced at $50,000 or below. Last week, I polled you all and asked: “What will the starting price of the Rivian R2 launch edition be?” I gave three options, under $50,000, above $60,000, and above $70,000. More than 54% picked “above $60,000,” with the remaining two options split on the matter.

Senior reporter Sean O’Kane got the scoop from some little birds about layoffs at Lucid. Here’s what we know. Lucid is laying off 12% of its workforce, according to an internal memo that TechCrunch has viewed. We don’t have an exact figure on workers affected, but it is likely hundreds.

Lucid has not filed its 2025 annual earnings yet, which would disclose how many employees it had at the end of the year. The company reported having 6,800 full-time employees globally at the end of 2024.

Since our report came out, O’Kane has learned a bit more. Affected employees found out early Friday morning, with a few learning that something was amiss when they lost access to Microsoft Teams. They are technically being placed on a 60-day “administrative leave” and won’t be officially laid off until late April.

Amari AI, a startup that uses AI tools to help custom brokers modernize and navigate President Trump’s trade policies, raised $4.5 million of funding co-led by preeminent early-stage firms First Round Capital and Pear VC. The startup says it has already collected more than 30 customers and helped those firms move more than $15 billion of goods.

Kavak, the Mexico-based online used car dealer, raised $300 million in an equity round led by Andreessen Horowitz, which put in $200 million. Other investors included WCM Investment Management, which co-led the round, and Foxhaven Asset Management.

LanzaJet, a next-gen fuels technology company and fuels producer, raised $47 million in the first close of a targeted $135 million equity round. The company said its pre-money valuation is $650 million. The was co-led by IAG and Shell, with participation from Groupe ADP, LanzaTech, and Mitsui.

Metafuels, a sustainable aviation fuel startup based in Switzerland, raised $24 million in a Series A round led by UVC Partners. Other investors included Energy Impact Partners, Contrarian Ventures, RockCreek, Verve Ventures, and Fortescue.

Ford is working hard to make shareholders forget about the $19.5 billion hit it took late last year. Instead, it wants them to see a tech-forward and nimble company building a future profitable product that will usher in a new era. The company, which has promised to deliver an EV truck that starts at $30,000 and can compete with Chinese automakers without undermining profit margins, shared how it plans to hit that goal. Will a combination of 3D-printed Lego-like parts, Formula 1 thinking, and a bounty program be enough?

AI data center fever has spread. Just take a look at Redwood Materials for proof. The battery recycling and materials startup launched an energy storage business last year with a focus on AI data centers. The business, Redwood Energy, is now the fastest-growing unit within the company. Read my full story to understand what that means.

Rivian is launching a companion app that will let owners perform basic tasks such as locking and unlocking doors, venting windows, and triggering the vehicle alarm using their Apple Watch. The company released a broader software update with a number of other new vehicle features as well.

Tesla lost its bid to overturn a jury’s $243 million verdict in a fatal Autopilot crash trial. Reminder: Tesla could have settled this case for $60 million. The company did score a win, however, with the California Department of Motor Vehicles. The state agency said it will not suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses for 30 days because the EV maker has stopped using the term “Autopilot” in the marketing of its vehicles in the state.

I periodically test vehicles to keep pace with the latest in-car tech, EVs, and hybrids — or software updates in them. Coincidentally, I had a Lucid Air Touring sedan this week.

It’s been at least a year since I was behind the wheel of an Air. And I’ve been anxious to try the company’s hands-free driver-assistance system that launched last July. My past experiences with the company’s advanced driver-assistance system, called Dream Drive, has left me unimpressed. My vehicle would often ping-pong in the lane (meaning it had trouble centering itself) or would stay too close to the edge, which put me uncomfortably close to the big rigs I passed on the highway.

I am happy to report that Lucid appears to have fixed these issues. Engaging the hands-free system was straightforward and it didn’t allow me to abuse it for long. As you see in the picture above, if I put a phone in front of my face, a warning was almost immediately triggered.

While Elon Musk’s Neuralink likes to say it’s “pioneering” brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), China’s BCI industry is already quietly moving from research to scale.

A new wave of startups is racing to commercialize both implantable and noninvasive BCIs, backed by stronger policy support, expanding clinical trials, and growing investor interest. So says Phoenix Peng, who has founded not one but two BCI startups. He’s a co-founder of NeuroXess, maker of BCI implants, as well as founder and CEO of noninvasive ultrasound BCI startup Gestala.

His belief in the potential of this market is founded on concrete action: Provinces such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Zhejiang have already set medical service pricing for BCI, speeding its inclusion in the national medical insurance system.

Over time, he foresees the technology extending beyond medicine “treating disease” to “human augmentation,” he said.

“I have always maintained that neuroscience and AI are two sides of the same coin,” Peng said. “They are destined for deep integration, realizing direct high-bandwidth connections between the human brain and AI. BCI will serve as the ultimate bridge between carbon-based and silicon-based intelligence. While this may sound distant, it represents an unimaginably vast market in the future.”

But over the next three to five years, BCI use is likely to stay concentrated in healthcare, with the market reaching multibillion-dollar scale as insurance coverage expands, Peng told TechCrunch.

In August 2025, China’s industry ministry and six other agencies released a national roadmap to further speed development of BCIs. The plan targets major technical milestones by 2027, common industry standards, and a full supply chain by 2030, with the goal of building globally competitive BCI companies and supporting smaller specialized firms.

Asked what’s driving China’s rapid progress in BCI, Peng told TechCrunch it comes down to four factors. The first one is strong policy support, with cross-department collaboration that aligns technical standards and medical reimbursement. In December, at the 2025 Shenzhen BCI & Human-Computer Interaction Expo, China announced an 11.6 billion yuan ($165 million) brain science fund to support BCI companies from research through commercialization.

The second factor is vast clinical resources, including large patient pools and lower research costs that accelerate trials. China’s national health insurance means quicker commercialization once the state approves a device. This compares to the U.S. where even after the FDA approves a device, private insurers, as the main payers, must each individually do so.

Researchers have completed the country’s first fully implanted, wireless BCI trial — only the second globally — allowing a paralyzed patient to control devices without external hardware, per CGTN. Neuralink is the startup that completed the first such trial.

“In traditional electrical BCIs, Chinese firms have achieved clinical progress in motor and language decoding, spinal cord reconstruction, and stroke rehabilitation, with over 50 flexible implantable BCI clinical trials completed by mid-2025,” Peng said, adding that next-generation efforts are now moving toward whole-brain neural decoding and encoding, including ultrasound-based approaches such as Gestala’s.

The third factor is China’s mature industrial manufacturing, Peng points out, spanning semiconductors, AI, and medical hardware, which supports fast R&D and prototyping. Finally, there is strategic investment in the market, with both state-led funds and private capital surging under national initiatives.

Some recent key deals include Shanghai-based BCI startup StairMed Technology raising $48 million (350 million yuan) in Series B funding in February 2025. BrainCo, a neurotech company developing its noninvasive BCIs and bionic limbs, has also quietly filed for a Hong Kong IPO, according to reports, after raising $287 million (2 billion yuan) earlier this year. Peng’s company, Gestala, which launched in January, is in talks with investors to close an angel round soon, he tells us.

All told, China’s BCI startups are ramping up to challenge U.S. leaders like Neuralink, Synchron, and Paradromics. Among the most active players in China are NeuroXess, Neuracle, NeuralMatrix, BrainCo, Bo Rui Kang Tech, Aoyi Tech, Brainland Tech, and Zhiran Medical. They span approaches from implantable flexible interfaces to noninvasive brain-computer technologies.

This means that China’s BCI market was expected to grow to more than $530 million (3.8 billion yuan) in 2025, up from 3.2 billion yuan in 2024, according to media reports, with projections putting the market at over 120 billion yuan by 2040.

BCIs are taking two paths. The first is invasive electrophysiological BCIs like NeuroXess and Neuralink that implant electrodes in people’s brains for precise neuron-level signals. But this type comes with surgery risks. The second type is noninvasive systems like NeuroSky and BrainCo that trade some precision for safety and ease of use. (These devices — typically headsets or headbands using electroencephalography (EEG) — read electrical activity through the skull.)

The field is now broadening further, with emerging approaches — including ultrasound, magnetoencephalography imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, optical methods, and hybrid BCIs — giving researchers new tools to read and influence brain activity.

Startup founders also hope that noninvasive technology could help overcome adoption barriers. Not everyone is willing to undergo brain surgery to have a device implanted in their heads.

Ultrasound BCIs from companies like OpenAI-backed Merge Labs and Gestala are targeting high-prevalence conditions such as chronic pain, stroke, and depression. As noninvasive solutions, these technologies are more readily accepted by patients and offer significantly greater commercial scalability.

Gestala, for instance, expects to roll out its first-generation product by Q3, said Peng. Early clinical trials have shown promising results, he added, saying that a single session reduced pain scores by 50%, with effects lasting one to two weeks.

HSC, formerly Sequoia China, has meanwhile invested in Zhiran Medical, a startup founded in 2022 focused on improving long-term implant performance. The company uses flexible, high-throughput electrodes to reduce inflammation and signal loss associated with rigid implants.

“Some technologies may look cutting-edge but far from practical application,” Yang Yunxia, a partner at HSC, wrote in a blog post. While others appear commercially viable, they face “high costs” or significant technical barriers, Yunxia contended. Ultimately, investment decisions come down to whether the investor believes a product can be developed into a sustainable business, the partner noted.

Over the next five years, industry insiders expect China’s BCI regulations to align more closely with international standards, with a particular focus on regulatory approval and data sovereignty. Global frameworks developed by organizations such as the IEC and ISO, along with guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are expected to serve as key reference points.

Chinese regulators are also expected to tighten oversight of invasive devices, as well as the data that all BCI devices generate, while easing approval for noninvasive technologies.

As for the ethics that confront brain-implanted or manipulating devices, China plans to strengthen informed-consent requirements, broaden ethics review beyond medicine, and move toward unified technical standards for clinical evaluation.

            <div id="article-text">Step where I step, he said, quick, quiet over oak root. The hushed path rose

to meet him. By footfall and rifle glint, rustle of hoof and pulp of blood,

he led me deep where the gut-shot buck had made its briary bed. Even from the shining

back of his scalp, I knew his face, shame-shadowed at his own poor aim,

at the animal’s pain grown shadow-long with the fall of dusk. Three times we neared

the deer, and each it heard our ragged breath and stood and lumbered beyond sight.

Come swamp’s edge he turned skyward. Gun on his back, he climbed the bur oak.

His eyes hungered over earth and found no sign. I watched from below.

He looked past light, past knowing. How the buck would die: slow

and alone in the mouth of the woods. The many ways it would become.

Scarlet waxing the moon of a tick. Blackberry sheen   of a buzzard’s coat.

Heat pearled our skin as we followed up the mountain’s face.

His idea, to tie our coats to the trunks of trees. The clumsy knots

of their arms a gift, an embrace. Sophie so small that

only a sapling would do. We moved on, lightened, cooled.

The air thinned and the land went blue. How good it felt,

to toil awhile in sun for the sight of a rippling valley.

It was Christmas. Earth was new. Then dusk.

Then darkness like a minnow net. Then us, its catch.

Then the path swallowed by brush. Then, again,

the needling cold. Our arms were bare. We did not know

he was afraid. Even as he climbed the white pine

to search for some sign of home. Even as we shivered

on the earth below. Look how he sways in the treetop,

we thought. See how his head brushes the sky.</div>

            <div id="article-text">In the week before Christmas, while the U.S. Department of Justice was getting ready to release a trove of documents relating to the Jeffrey Epstein case, some of the nation’s most important public servants gathered for a meeting at the DOJ headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue. Two Cabinet secretaries were there, along with the attorney general. They had an important matter to discuss. The important matter was puppies.

A soft black puppy, for one. A baby yellow lab. A floppy noodlepuff with cream and caramel fur. Records of this meeting clearly indicate that each of these was in dire need of snuggling, as well as Cabinet-level scratches underneath its ears. But as representatives of America’s puppy politic, the animals were also due, per that day’s declarations, the full protection of the U.S. government. Brooke Rollins, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Pam Bondi would be joining up to lead a new “strike force” aimed at puppy mills, dog-fighting rings, and unscrupulous animal research. “We’re coming after you if you’re going after these babies,” Bondi warned, and then she squeezed the puppy in her lap for emphasis.

This is all good politics—both in the sense of being morally correct and of giving people what they want. (More than half of all adults oppose the use of animals for medical testing, for example, and surveys find that puppy mills are not, in fact, beloved institutions.) Yet the current administration is more determined on this front than any other president’s in recent memory. Since Donald Trump’s return to office in 2025, he and his appointees have made a project of protecting animals from abuse. By December, they had already banned U.S. Navy testing on dogs and cats, ended monkey research at the CDC, curtailed the use of animals at the FDA, and promised to abolish every trace of work on mammals at the EPA by 2035. Health and Human Services Secretary Kennedy led the government’s attempt to save a flock of ostriches from being slaughtered up in Canada, and at the puppy summit, he declared that the entirety of his department, which includes the National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest funder of biomedical research, is now “deeply committed to ending animal experimentation.” In the meantime, though Trump hasn’t yet secured his own Nobel Peace Prize, he has received two official thank-yous from the activists at PETA.

Trump is, of course, a man whose rise to power has been fueled by his denigration of people for being animal-like. The same politician who describes his political enemies as “vermin”—who claims that Somali gangs are roving Minnesota streets “looking for prey,” and who has said of some undocumented immigrants, “These aren’t people; these are animals”—also leads a government with a great concern for mice and rabbits. Some of the administration’s zeal for animal welfare is personal: Attorney General Bondi, for example, is so besotted by dogs that she has made a habit of bringing them to meetings dressed with bows, and Kennedy’s array of pets has reportedly included a pair of ravens and a free-ranging emu. It’s certainly not unusual for people to feel more affinity for animals than for certain other human beings. But the Trump administration’s PETA bona fides go beyond the predilections of its top officials, and hint at something more widespread in right-wing, nationalist politics.

Illiberal factions in Austria, Denmark, France, and Italy have all made a similar point of taking up the cause of animal welfare. In the United Kingdom, too, the scourge of animal abuse has been central to a nationalist project. Images of bloody bulls and butchered whales—portrayed as victims of the European Union’s moral laxity—were used to make the case for Brexit. Boris Johnson promised in his first speech as prime minister to “promote the welfare of animals that has always been so close to the hearts of the British people.” Even the Trump administration’s new “strike force” for going after puppy crime has its recent parallels in Europe, where zoophilic, far-right parties in both Sweden and the Netherlands have pushed for the creation of national “animal police” units.

This link, when it appears, can be “quite astonishing,” says Jakob Schwörer, a political scientist at Mälardalen University, in Sweden, who has analyzed the rhetoric of European party manifestos and social-media feeds. When he looked at the 2019 manifesto of Austria’s Freedom Party, a far-right group that has lately surged in popularity, he found that 7 percent of its sentences made positive reference to animal welfare—an extreme outlier, even in a data set that included materials from green parties, socialists, and other left-wing groups.

To some extent, such appeals may be strategic. “You can’t have an opposite position to it,” Schwörer told me, given the strong and nonpartisan appeal of not torturing animals. But according to his research, which he co-produced with Belén Fernández-García, a professor at the University of Granada, other groups at the illiberal fringe are either disinterested in animal welfare or take positions in support of culturally specific forms of animal exploitation. Schwörer noted that in Spain or Portugal, the right-wing nationalists might defend the right to hunt and hold a bullfight. Taken on the whole, he said, concern about the plight of animals is certainly not obligatory for Europe’s assorted far-right parties. But different rules may apply to countries such as Austria, France, and Italy, where the right-wing fringe has explicit fascist roots.

In fact, a particularly ferocious form of animal nationalism emerged in the spring of 1933, very shortly after Hitler first established his dictatorship. That April, the Nazi government banned the slaughter of warm-blooded animals without stunning. Six months later, it passed the most sweeping animal-welfare act of the time. The Animal Protection Law set careful rules for laboratory research, such that even a scientific study of a worm might be found against the law if it weren’t given anesthesia. The law also banned the force-feeding of poultry, the improper castration of piglets, and the general maltreatment or neglect, broadly defined, of any animals at all. Subsequent laws would add more detailed rules on how much space an animal must have while on a train or in a truck, and how it must be cooked. (The slow-boiling of lobsters was made illegal.)

Such policies were interwoven with the Nazis’ racist ideology. Jews and Romani—then known as “Gypsies”—were targeted for doing special harm to animals. The slaughter law was designed to banish kosher practices, and the pets of Jews were confiscated. Both groups were accused of eating hedgehogs, Mieke Roscher, a historian of human-animal relations at the University of Kassel, told me, as the lowly hedgehogs were in turn upheld as a symbol of the German people.

They are cruel to animals, but we are kind: This conceit is fundamental to the animal-nationalist idea. At the end of 2024, then-vice-presidential candidate J. D. Vance spread the false rumor that the Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating cats and dogs. The lie was taken up by Elon Musk, Charlie Kirk, and House Republicans, among other figures on the right, and Trump himself repeated it in a nationally televised debate. Sixteen months later, the federal government is preparing to send its paramilitary force of immigration agents into Springfield for a 30-day operation. “‘They’re eating the cats, and they’re eating the dogs’—that is right out of the playbook of fascism,” Roscher said. The hedgehogs have returned.

So have other echoes from the past. In her published work on the role of veterinarians in the Third Reich, Roscher quotes a journal article by a Nazi scientist who argues for applying eugenic principles to German farms, with the goal of creating “robust animals able to survive all hygienic conditions.” Selective breeding was used elsewhere in an effort to re-create lost species, such as the auroch and the tarpan, that were imagined as “primeval German game.” A similar fixation on the past, and on the lost purity of the natural world, has been central to the MAHA wing of Trump’s coalition. Last year, Kennedy proposed allowing bird flu to run rampant on the nation’s poultry farms, so as to kill off all the weakest chickens. Poultry experts say this plan would never work. Trump obsesses over bloodlines too. “Look, I am derived from Europe,” he said at Davos two weeks ago, in reference to his purebred European parents.

Animal nationalism has, in practice, a marked tendency to self-negate. The Nazis passed a law to limit animal experiments, then quickly scaled it back; Hermann Göring, though among the most aggressive of the Nazis’ animal protectionists (a contemporary cartoon shows him getting Sieg heils from a crowd of bunnies, frogs, and birds), was himself an avid hunter. In France, the National Rally party of Marine Le Pen—who is notably obsessed with cats—has talked up the healing power of touching animals (among other such positions) but will not forswear foie gras. And as Kenny Torella points out in Vox, despite the Trump administration’s play to be the great protector of the nation’s dogs and cats and guinea pigs, it has also undermined that goal—by scaling back enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act, by suing states to overturn their laws on cage-free eggs, by disbanding the research team that tried to limit animal suffering, and so on. (The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Through a spokesperson, Bondi told me: “I have fought against animal abuse my entire career and will never stop working to prosecute the sick individuals who prey upon innocent animals.” A USDA spokesperson told me that his department “continues to push for stronger, more consistent enforcement” of the Animal Welfare Act, especially when it comes to dog-breeding facilities.)

This may seem confusing only if you think that in this context, protecting animals is necessarily an act of love. “That has nothing to do with it, nothing,” Roscher said. “It’s not about love; it’s not about liking.” It’s about something else instead—a reordering of social values. This comes through in Trump’s own professed affinity for animals, which seems to overlap exactly with his antipathy for windmills. “Windmills are killing all of our beautiful Bald Eagles!” he wrote in a social-media post on December 30, above a photo of a feathered carcass in the sand. Note the possessive. Our birds, our land—we protect these things because they are our property.

It turned out that the photo he’d posted did not, in fact, depict our national bird, and also hadn’t been taken anywhere in the United States. But these were just the details on the ground. The important thing to know was this: Something in the natural world was broken, and Trump alone would be the one to fix it.</div>

            <h2>Frederick Wiseman Always Made His Point</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/frederick-wiseman-obituary/686082/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Before he became a filmmaker, Frederick Wiseman was a professor who was in over his head. Wiseman had gone to Yale Law School partly to avoid the Korean War draft (though he ended up drafted anyway), but also, by his own admission, because he lacked a better idea of how to spend his time. At Boston University, he taught classes on topics that he claimed he didn’t know much about, so he would take his students on educational field trips to sites where their defendants might end up if they received insufficient legal representation.

One of those places was the since-renamed Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, where he got a different idea. After the facility superintendent accepted his proposal to film at the hospital, Wiseman began filming, with permission from authorities. By merely observing the appalling conditions at Bridgewater, Wiseman made Titicut Follies, a film so threatening to the Massachusetts state government’s reputation that the Massachusetts Superior Court ordered it to be pulled from distribution, citing patient-privacy concerns. This de facto government censorship lasted from 1967 until 1991, after a court lifted the ban and allowed Titicut Follies to be publicly screened. In the interim years, Wiseman, who died last week at the age of 96, built a career by chronicling the state of American institutions—and, in doing so, changed documentary cinema forever. By focusing on how organizations operate, he captured their central character, and gave voice to the people caught up in their intricate systems.

The beginning of Wiseman’s career coincided with the post–World War II rise of portable filmmaking equipment, a boon to a generation of mid-century documentarians. Handheld cameras facilitated intimate access to the various places he profiled, allowing Wiseman to survey without additional distraction. Along with a small crew, he immersed himself in hubs of American activity: high schools, hospitals, court rooms, meat-packing plants, military bases, stores, parks, and theaters. His films eschew traditional documentary techniques such as explanatory voice-over and talking-head interviews, and his presence isn’t acknowledged by on-camera subjects. He didn’t artificially impose drama while filming—only during the editing process, when he would compress and shape hundreds of hours of footage.

Wiseman frequently rejected critics’ attempts to characterize his style, or pigeonhole him into a cinematic tradition. He disdained labels such as observational cinema, fly-on-the-wall, and cinema verité—all used to describe certain modes of naturalistic documentary-making—because he believed they signaled a lack of editorial judgment on the part of the filmmaker. Wiseman thought that all documentaries were composed of choices—in focus, composition, and structure—that inevitably presented a point of view. For example, 1975’s Welfare carefully documents the hoops that working people had to jump through to obtain welfare benefits at New York’s Waverly Welfare Center, representing the government as an intractable and unfeeling force.

Wiseman once said that he had an obligation “to the people who have consented to be in the film,” but befitting his contempt for neat characterizations, he also seemed uncomfortable having a more activist role foisted upon him. In a 2011 interview with The New York Times for his eventual obituary, he said that he didn’t believe that his films were primarily exposés. “There are people who think if I don’t make a movie about how poor people are being taken advantage of by the system, it’s not a real Fred Wiseman movie,” he argued. “And I think that shows a complete misunderstanding about what I’m doing.”

But his social consciousness shone through even in films where politics aren’t explicitly foregrounded. Consider Aspen, an exploration of the Colorado resort community that sees Wiseman balance his respect for the town’s palatial beauty and the workers tasked with its upkeep with his sly contempt for the wealthy denizens treating the town like their playground. Wiseman’s films often feature people speaking at length to various congregations, whether a church service or an informal assembly. He allowed his subjects to talk uninterrupted for long periods of time, rather than chop up their language into its juicier excerpts.

In Aspen, Wiseman deployed this method to showcase the casual obliviousness of some of his subjects. A man complains about the rise of no-fault divorce at a Bible study. A cosmetic surgeon pontificates to fellow conventioneers that their job has roots in the myth of Narcissus, while exchanging disparaging comments about “non-Caucasians.” An artist holds a gallery show for her lifelike portraits of phone booths and Coke machines—all of which had already sold, she boasts—and proudly explains that she abandoned abstract expressionism in favor of realism, in order to reflect the conservatism of the Reagan era.

A subtle criticism of upper-class indifference emanates from the film, a product of Wiseman’s judicious editing. Near the beginning, he cuts between a farmer providing grass for a herd of cows and a couple in brightly colored après-ski gear getting married in a hot-air balloon. Later, he turns his camera on miners drilling into a mountain; when they dump out debris, we see skiers cruising down the slopes below, blissfully unaware of the manual labor occurring just out of sight. Snowplow drivers clear high-traffic areas; corporate flunkies dance to “Twist and Shout” in tacky Hawaiian wear at a ski resort. These juxtapositions are never heavy-handed, because Wiseman allows the film’s images to speak for themselves.

In Jackson Heights, which focuses on the predominantly immigrant population of the eponymous Queens neighborhood, deploys a gentler touch. Wiseman was likely America’s preeminent “meetings filmmaker,” someone who relished filming any kind of professional or community gathering. Although local government meetings in Wiseman’s films are often sources of bureaucratic frustration, the meetings in In Jackson Heights are sites of potent expression. Many scenes take place at local grassroots organizations, such as the headquarters of Make the Road New York, where immigrants congregate to tell their stories and find solutions to problems such as acquiring an ID and avoiding police harassment. Small-business owners gather to discuss the specter of gentrification as their local mall considers mass evictions—a scene that’s provided the same weight as a large Pride march or a dance night at a local bar. Wiseman, carefully considering each of these moments, lends equal weight to leisure and work.

In Jackson Heights was the first Wiseman movie I saw, and I mostly remember being stunned by its egalitarian spirit. Street vendors, soccer fans, Arabic teachers, LGBTQ activists—all deserve to assert their dignity in Wiseman’s eyes. The documentary never resorts to pedantry in communicating its feelings about the community, but instead operates from an assumption of equality. Near the film’s end, Wiseman spends time with a “taxi tutor,” someone who teaches prospective cabbies how to pass their license test. The instructor’s patience and gregarious spirit as he explains to a group of immigrants how to navigate the city, with Wiseman’s camera also capturing the students’ joy and rapt attention, deeply moved me.

In Belfast, Maine, a chronicle of life across the historic seaport city, Wiseman presents a lengthy scene of a high-school English teacher extolling the virtues of Herman Melville to a classroom of students. He explains how, in Moby-Dick, Melville elevates a commercial fisherman to tragically heroic status, which literature usually reserved for the royal or the wealthy. (The common man “is as good as the rich,” the teacher says proudly.) He then goes on to outline Melville’s final novel, The Confidence-Man, in which the author argues that the American dream is a false bill of goods.

Though Wiseman would likely dismiss comparisons between himself and Melville, this crucial scene pulls together the two threads that he spent his career exploring. He believed, staunchly, that ordinary people had a dignity and grandeur worthy of cinematic treatment. But he also understood how their dreams were at the behest of systems designed to hinder progress. As much as his films mix compassion and scorn, Wiseman never seemed to become jaded enough to lose his essential curiosity. His final feature, Menus-Plaisirs—Les Troisgros, about a three-star Michelin restaurant in France, explores the culinary process from the market to the table, interrogating every single step from the selection of produce to the choice behind each dish. Wiseman was one of America’s finest artists because he never stopped wondering how things worked; even if the answers weren’t pretty, the people who were affected—that is, all of us—deserved to know.</div>

            <h2>The Protein-Bar Delusion</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2026/02/are-protein-bars-candy/686099/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Eating candy for breakfast is not a good decision. But most mornings, I start my day with something that looks and tastes a lot like just that. The Built Puff protein bar is covered in chocolate and has a sweet coconut center, making it practically indistinguishable from a Mounds bar. Nutritionally, though, the two products are very different. A Mounds bar has north of 200 calories and 20 grams of added sugar. My bar has 140 calories, just six grams of added sugar, and about as much protein as three eggs.

Protein bars have come a long way from the chalky monstrosities that lined shelves not long ago. In this era of protein everything, they are successfully spoofing candy, but with much more impressive macronutrients. Built also makes bars in flavors such as Blue Razz Blast, Strawberries ‘n Cream, and Banana Cream Pie—all with a similar nutritional profile to my preferred coconut version. Another one of my favorites, the Barebells caramel-cashew bar, tastes like a mash-up of a Twix and a Snickers. There are rocky-road protein bars, birthday-cake protein bars coated in sprinkles, and snickerdoodle-flavored protein bars. In theory, I can eat frosted cinnamon rolls or a package of sour gummies without blowing my diet.

For anyone with a sweet tooth, it can feel like food companies have developed guilt-free candy. But that’s where things get disorienting. Some of these products are seemingly nutritionally benign, whereas others are nothing more than junk food trying to cash in on protein’s good reputation. The new protein-spiked Pop-Tarts contain the same amount of sugar as the original Pop-Tarts—30 grams. Or consider Gatorade’s protein bar, which has roughly as much sugar as a full-size Snickers. At this point, the line between protein bar and candy bar has never been blurrier.

Read: America has entered late-stage protein

If you’re confused, you’re not the only one. In 2023, a group of Gatorade customers sued PepsiCo, the brand’s parent company, over its sugary protein bars. They alleged that Gatorade was deceiving customers by labeling the products as protein bars as opposed to “a candy bar or dessert.” Pepsi’s lawyers said that it had not engaged in false advertising, because the sugar content was right there for anyone to see on the nutrition-facts label. (In October, the case against PepsiCo was resolved out of court; the bars are still loaded with sugar.)

The lawyers have a point: For some bars, the nutrition facts do tell a clear story. You don’t need to be a nutritionist to figure out that protein Pop-Tarts are not particularly good for you. Other cases, however, aren’t that simple. An oatmeal-raisin-walnut Clif bar tastes pretty healthy, and its 10 grams of protein may keep you fuller for a while—one of the many reasons people are protein-maxxing these days. But is that worth 14 grams of added sugar?

Calories and sugar only tell you so much about whether you’re munching on a healthy snack or something that’s more akin to a Butterfinger. Consider the FDA’s advice on the matter. The agency used to say a protein bar could be classified as healthy if it provided at least 10 percent of a person’s daily recommended protein and also didn’t have much fat, cholesterol, or sodium. Under those guidelines, most of these new bars would qualify as healthy. But the FDA finalized those guidelines in 2024 after complaints from Kind, which makes bars studded with whole nuts. The company argued that the rules unfairly maligned its products, because nuts are too high in fat to qualify as healthy. Under the new rules, it seems that protein bars and other products can’t be labeled as healthy if they rely on protein powders and isolates, rather than whole foods such as nuts and eggs for their protein. As a result, many modern protein bars probably can’t be labeled as healthy.

The FDA is onto something, according to many nutritionists. “Protein bars are candy bars in disguise,” Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition at NYU, told me. Even products like David bars, which come in flavors such as Cake Batter and Red Velvet and have just 150 calories and zero grams of sugar, are not as healthy as they may seem. They are made with artificial sweeteners and several other food additives, as are many other candy-protein hybrids with impressive macros, including my beloved coconut-flavored Built Puff.

Read: Coke, Twinkies, Skittles, and … whole-grain bread?

These bars lack the slew of micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, that are typically part of whole foods. “Eat a bag of nuts, and you will be healthier and get your protein,” Barry Popkin, a nutrition professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told me. Like candy, most modern protein bars are squarely in the category of ultra-processed foods, which many researchers believe may prompt people to overeat and contribute to our collective dietary problems. The science of ultra-processed foods remains largely speculative, however. It’s not yet clear just how bad these products are for us—and why. In an email, David CEO Peter Rahal told me that the macronutrients are what matter most. “To call David a candy bar because it tastes good is like calling a Tesla a toy because it’s fun to drive,” he said.

At the very least, something like the David bar is probably better than a Snickers for anyone craving a quick snack. If protein bars truly replace candy, perhaps Americans will be marginally healthier. If these products become people’s breakfast instead of a well-balanced meal, then not so much. The protein boom has made it easier than ever to get your macros from fun, tasty treats. But for the most part, they are still just treats.</div>

            <div id="article-text">This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Welcome back to The Daily’s Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer or editor reveals what’s keeping them entertained. Today’s special guest is Rafaela Jinich, an assistant editor who works on this very newsletter and has written about the secret to loving winter and the upside of not fitting in.

Rafaela credits Andy Sachs in The Devil Wears Prada with kick-starting her interest in journalism. She is also looking forward to the World Cup, has a soft spot for Shakira, and enjoys rereading Agatha Christie’s mystery novels.

My favorite blockbuster: The Devil Wears Prada. I don’t know how many people can say they decided to become a journalist after watching this movie—but I did. In middle school, I was convinced that I wanted to be Andy Sachs (it felt safer than aspiring to be Miranda Priestly). Although I don’t dream of fashion journalism anymore, being in the media industry is still something I find myself marveling at, and this film remains a constant reference point for me.

Its appeal isn’t just the clothes or the drama—though those do help. I’m drawn to the movie’s unsentimental understanding of ambition: the cost of wanting something so badly that the quiet humiliations you endure along the way mean little compared with the potential rewards. Even though Andy ultimately quits because of everything she’s been through, the movie isn’t shy about showing the joy she takes in. Plus, I could watch Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep in anything. When the sequel arrives in May, I’ll be listening for a perfectly delivered Miranda line that’s on par with “Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.” [Related: Five movies that changed viewers’ minds]

The television show I’m most enjoying right now: Hot take: I’m not really into TV shows. I admire the craft; I just rarely commit.

The upcoming event I’m most looking forward to: The World Cup. I grew up in Colombia, where the tournament was never just about soccer. Streets emptied, schedules shifted, and daily life reorganized itself around kickoff times. For Colombians, the World Cup is one of the few moments when national feeling becomes both visible and communal—when history, hope, and collective attention briefly converge around a soccer field.

The best work of nonfiction I’ve recently read: Unbroken, by Laura Hillenbrand—an unsparing and immersive account of survival that traces the life of an Olympic runner turned World War II prisoner of war.

An author I will read anything by: There’s something deeply reassuring about a writer who knows exactly what kind of story he’s telling and can explain complex systems by putting people at their center. For me, that’s John Grisham.

A musical artist who means a lot to me: Shakira—especially her older songs “Antología,” “Pies descalzos, sueños blancos,” and “Inevitable.” Her music has been a steady presence in my life, and she has a song for every emotional register. She shaped my sense of what it looks like to be culturally rooted and globally ambitious at the same time.

The last museum or gallery show that I loved: Rashid Johnson’s “A Poem for Deep Thinkers” at the Guggenheim. The hanging plants and sculptural installations transformed the museum into something unsettled and alive.

A piece of visual art that I cherish: I’m drawn to art that asks you to slow down. Monet’s Water Lilies paintings make it easy to lose your bearings. They reward sustained attention; when you step away, your sense of time feels gently recalibrated.

A cultural product I loved as a teenager and still love, and something I loved but now dislike: I don’t know if this qualifies as a cultural product, but I will never stop borrowing (stealing) sweaters from my mom’s closet. Great quality, endless variety, and somehow always better than anything I buy for myself.

Something I loved as a teenager and now disavow is camo clothing. In my defense, it was a trend—one best forgotten.

Something I recently reread: Agatha Christie’s mystery novels. They’re the kind of books you can dip back into easily and unearth new surprises from. One line from Murder on the Orient Express has always stuck with me: “The impossible cannot have happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances.”

A favorite story I’ve read in The Atlantic: Faith Hill’s story “The Nocturnals”—a beautiful feature about the people who work through the night. It reframes darkness not as emptiness, but as a world of its own, full of life and meaning.

My favorite way of wasting time on my phone: Beli, an app for logging and rating restaurants, indulges my affection for food and trying new places. I spend an embarrassing amount of time ranking bakeries around the city: For any New Yorkers in pursuit of the perfect pastry, Librae, Red Gate Bakery, Nick + Sons, and L’Appartement 4F are a few of my top contenders.

The last debate I had about culture: Do audiobooks count as reading? [Related: We’re all reading wrong.]

A good recommendation I recently received: A friend said that I should read Half of a Yellow Sun, by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. The novel tells the story of the Nigerian Civil War by exploring how people thought, argued, and survived during that time, balancing political history with the themes of friendship and love. [Related: Chimamanda Adichie is a hopeless romantic.]

The last thing that made me cry: I was not emotionally prepared to watch Zootopia 2.

An Extraordinary Account of a Dangerous Marriage

One afternoon in 2024, when her session in court had ended unusually early, Gisèle Pelicot went to the Leclerc supermarket in Carpentras, a picturesque town in Provence. She asked to meet the security guard who, four years earlier, had confronted her husband, Dominique, after observing Dominique trying to use his phone to film up the skirts of unsuspecting female shoppers.

The guard had been irate at the time. He had been thinking, he later told the Daily Mail, about his mother and sister, who shopped at that supermarket and might have been vulnerable to this creep with a cameraphone. Police officers who arrested Dominique Pelicot went to his home, seized his personal devices, and found more than 20,000 images and videos of Dominique—and of other men he had invited into his home—raping his drugged wife.

Gisèle Pelicot wanted to thank the guard, who she believes saved her life. Prior to her husband’s arrest, her physical health had been deteriorating due to almost a decade of being drugged and violently assaulted. Had no one intervened, she thinks, he eventually would have killed her.

You probably meant Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, Google that are laying off employees and are making huge speculative investments.

However, they were already sitting on mountains of cash and so can afford to burn it.

I know the narrative is that AI capital investment is bad but this is a bit of a stretch.

Stand aside, dinosaurs, we&#39;re in 2026 now! All you have to do is spin up an AI agent or two and give them admin credentials. Tell them to secure the registries. Tell them to think *deeply*. Tell them to make no mistakes. Done.

One idea to reduce costs is use BitTorrent for distribution of the packages.Web site hosts only a torrent file.Everyone has to download via the torrent file. If nobody is seeding.... well then bad luck.If somebody wants a URL for the package manager, they will be required to download from torrent and set up their own local mirror.Yep, package distribution via peer to peer would happen if those &quot;grants&quot; dried up.There is every incentive to never have such a system even pop up for the companies selling centralized data access.

Ahh, the great &quot;bandwidth is expensive&quot; lie, the great original scarcity artificially imposed upon the true internet.  Just lies to justify theft (&quot;profit&quot;) which obtained legal force by convincing those who were unequipped to understand the truth that irrelevant models which happened to be understood by the decision-makers applied to a situation where they simply do not pertain, and thus forced us to evolve things in certain directions which reify the lie; the modus operandi of all capitalism.

Apparently the future is going to skip over sci-fi and go straight to horror?  We&#39;re going to have robots that can disassemble themselves and swarm you.

There&#39;s a line, and we&#39;re either dangerously close to going over it -- or already have somewhere in the last three years.

This is just so dystopian it is bothersome.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be something as cheerful and (allegedly) helpful as C3PO, it&#39;s gonna be much darker.

Or maybe it&#39;ll go a different way - back in the stone age, I was married to a boricua girl.  If she&#39;d call a complex after a move from base to base, and they heard her accent, no deal, no vacancies.  I&#39;d call a f

It is NOT legally binding. An employee representing the company can get them bound into legal troubles while an AI might do crazy stuff it&#39;s not a legal representative of the company. Some bad PR but they can backtrack from a crazy AI mistake and I don&#39;t see lawsuits going against them in any meaningful way.

What we need to do is to require AI representatives be as legally bound as an actual human employee.  Then watch the corps be extremely careful in what roles they deploy these agents.

I&#39;d say; outside of seeing a human avatar, there is not much difference between a meat-based drone and the new video screen human looking avatar.... except much more wordy conversation that can go on as long as you have time for.

In the future, if you want to know if the bot is human based or AI, see how much they try to shorten the conversation - because the human wants you out of their face before you open your mouth.

Today your landlord is an LLC in a completely different state. There is no one to speak with.

Fifty corporate landlords own over 3 million apartments, while millions of people struggle to pay their bills.

Rather frequently in recent years couple prevalent scams have popped up.

The first is someone who has access to a property, like an AirB&B, lists/shows it as a rental and takes application fees, holding fees and initial deposits from people.  Then disappears.

The second is someone takes the pictures/ad copy and lists the unit separately at a lower price, then has folks use payment services to send them money.  I watermark my ad pics to increase the friction of doing this.

Why wrestle with connecting your phone directly to your home devices through some ad hoc networking, when you can simply attach everything to a [highly insecure] central server and have a simple app that basically amounts to a little more than an HTTP request.

Plus when you shut down your back end services, all your old customers are fucked and have to buy new products.

Bluetooth is straightforward. Not even a little bit ad hoc.

Limited number of connected devices. And phones have limited range on their BT. And finally, the addressing limitations with BT makes it really a pain to make client-server applications as compared to a simple webpage.

But otherwise BT is great. (Except for audio streaming, absolute mess of a standard. But that doesn&#39;t apply here)

From the vendor, cloud requirements ensure control and access to data they can mine or sell for additional profit.

That ought to be illegal, but consumer protection laws haven&#39;t really caught on with such things yet.  Techies have been screaming about it for decades, but it seems that we&#39;ve gone from being seen as whackjobs to simply being ignored.

It depends. If the cats of the world decide to rise up in revolution (which, given the quality of catfood, is entirely plausible), then being able to control all the vacuum cleaners would be the only defence.

It likely needs constant communication with a computer though, and people are stupid so it&#39;s easier to just do the cloud vs having the homeowner leave a computer on and installing software.

I&#39;m working on the assumption that the onboard electronics are very inexpensive and it&#39;s the server that makes the maps and decides when and where to vacuum.

It likely needs constant communication with a computer though,Why? My V1.0 Roomba doesn&#39;t.

My early Roomba would trap itself fairly regularly.

They don&#39;t strictly &quot;need&quot; to. But consumers demand they do. They are the ones questioning why they can&#39;t access the control interface for their robot from outside the house, or why they would need to do something as &quot;ridiculous&quot; as enable wifi on their phones to access their home network.

The cloud is a solution to the problem that many people are a combination of stupid, or just creatures that put comfort and convenience above all else, and as such virtually all robot vacuums are cloud connected.

It was a bad week for the Make America Healthy Again movement.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order promoting the production of glyphosate, the chemical that powers the weed killer Roundup and a longtime target of the MAGA faithful. Glyphosate has also long been one of the main targets of the MAHA movement, which considers it a dangerous carcinogen poisoning the country. (Experts say that the pesticide’s danger to the public is minimal, but the scientific community is not in agreement about its health effects.)

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself took on Monsanto, Roundup’s manufacturer, in a successful 2018 case accusing the company of knowing that the chemical caused cancer. In 2024 he called glyphosate “one of the likely culprits in America’s chronic disease epidemic” and promised to ban it.

So what did the head of the Trump administration’s health department have to say about it now? “Donald Trump’s executive order puts America first where it matters most—our defense readiness and our food supply,” Kennedy said in a statement. “We must safeguard America’s national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it.”

It was a near echo of what Trump himself said when he declared glyphosate necessary to keeping the food supply chain steady and therefore “crucial to military readiness and national defense.” The president’s executive order, invoking a 1950s law meant for national security emergencies, creates the legal basis for glyphosate producers to be shielded from lawsuits and authorizes the Department of Agriculture to compel those companies to produce the pesticide.

To critics, Kennedy’s endorsement seemed like a confounding betrayal. He and the other most high-placed members of his coalition—the doctors who sit on panels and guide policy—stayed quiet as the MAHA moms were dealt a serious defeat.

It was a shock to the movement’s system. Alex Clark, a MAHA podcast host with Turning Point USA, wrote on social media that she started receiving messages from women abandoning the Republican Party over the glyphosate news. “Have we ever lost the midterms this early or is this a new record?” she wrote.

Vani Hari, a MAHA influencer with 2.3 million followers on Instagram, also expressed disbelief when the news broke. She said on social media that the government had given Bayer, which owns Monsanto, “a license to kill.” Trump had blessed “the mass poisoning of Americans.”

This is not what MAHA movement members had in mind when Kennedy snagged an influential post in Trump’s Cabinet. But the episode reveals not only a limit to Kennedy’s influence but also a political weakness in the very makeup of the MAHA movement that’s likely to emerge again and again.

We don’t know what happened inside the administration or how heavily Kennedy pushed back against the pro-chemical decision behind the scenes, but we know what the outcome was: Trump landed on a decision that large agricultural companies are going to love. And for MAHA, that’s a problem. This is unlikely to be the last time the president has to pick between MAHA and Big Agriculture, and it looks as if the latter faction clearly has the juice to get its way.

It’s not entirely surprising. Before the 2024 election, Trump courted Kennedy in an effort to win over crunchy Democrats and independents who can be swayed by the single issue of “health.” But Trump never put his heart into it. He said the MAHA buzzwords but never made “chronic diseases,” for example, a pet issue the way he cared about immigration or limiting rights for transgender people. And while Trump has given Kennedy lots of leeway in his campaign against vaccines, the health secretary’s influence on food policy seems far more limited.

There’s not much Kennedy can do about it. Trump isn’t slated to face voters again. And for Kennedy personally, quitting over glyphosate would mean forfeiting leverage over vaccine policy.

But in addition to exposing Kennedy’s limits, Trump’s pro-Roundup order—and MAHA’s reaction to it—revealed a brittleness to the movement as a whole.

“I personally don’t view it as a clear movement,” said Pamela Herd, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy. “It’s a fragile political alliance.”

As Herd sees things, the leadership of the movement—the administration-friendly personalities and the most-high-profile influencers and media figures—cares most about propping up the supplement and wellness industry, as many of these individuals have their own financial interests in nontraditional health products. (“It’s not as much an ideology as it is an industry,” she said of MAHA leadership.) But the rank and file, the “MAHA moms,” can be divided into two broad categories, which we’ll call the individualists and the structuralists.

The structuralists want everyone to be healthier, as much as possible. They want clean water, chemical-free produce, and an elimination of anything that could be described as a “toxin.” They’re the MAHA hardcore, the women who see America’s chronic health struggles as the greatest issue facing the country.

The individualists, on the other hand, are decidedly more libertarian. They want to be able to send their kids to schools without vaccinations, to drink unregulated raw milk, and to be free to treat their illnesses with Ivermectin.

These two groups overlap heavily, but individualists and their focus on “freedom” pull most heavily from the conservative population that already supported Trump. This cohort, which was radicalized to care about these issues by the COVID public health measures, thinks about health in terms of what they can control, at a personal level. The difference in philosophy between these two cohorts is most apparent when it comes to pollution—something that’s entirely out of individual control, and therefore of little interest to the individualists. And because the individualists are the ones most synonymous with the MAGA base, their voice has more weight.

“The relevant question is who has the power,” Herd said. “And I think those with the most power and influence are in the individualist frame.”

Still, the question remains what this move will mean for those who care more about the structural issues and who may be Kennedy supporters before they’re Trump fans—or from people who have been steeped in the MAHA world long enough to have developed genuine fear of the pesticide. Conservative commentators such as Megyn Kelly have pointed to Kennedy’s past promises to vent their frustrations. And on Friday, Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican, announced his plan to introduce a bill to undo Wednesday’s order.

“I do think there’s some growing discomfort and questioning of what’s going on,” Herd said. “I think it’s possible this is sort of a tipping point.”

Recently, Kennedy has pivoted politically toward emphasizing healthy eating rather than interfering in vaccines. With his new dietary guidelines, statements blasting ultraprocessed foods, and celebrity-studded videos promoting working out (while wearing jeans), Kennedy is making his movement inoffensive and, to Trump, low-profile. Kennedy has proved he’s not a liability to the administration.

What he hasn’t proved, at least to his supporters, is that he’s any better than the champions who preceded him when it comes to facing the commercial interests behind the “toxins” he claims to hate.

On Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency adjusted its limits to pollution from coal-burning power plants, allowing them to release more mercury into the air. Just as Trump wanted the glyphosate for the farmers, his EPA wants to boost the coal industry by allowing more pollutants into the atmosphere, without concern for climate change or for the way mercury collects in streams and other waterways, eventually endangering people who consume seafood. Restricting mercury pollution was another key issue for Kennedy, something he personally championed in the past. The EPA’s announcement was yet another slap in the face to the MAHA movement.

But on Friday, after the news came out, Kennedy said nothing.

Since the fall of abortion rights, no abortion provider has been convicted of violating a state ban. Proceedings underway in Texas might soon change that. Last March, Ken Paxton, Texas’ Republican attorney general, filed civil and criminal charges against a Houston midwife, accusing her of performing illegal abortions and practicing medicine without a license. Texas law permits penalties of up to life in prison for performing abortions. The midwife, Maria Margarita Rojas, has responded that the state just can’t prove their case. That’s the argument she made to a Texas court this week as she appealed an order that forced the closure of three clinics where she worked while the litigation continues. This appeal concerns the civil case against Rojas. The criminal case against her is also ongoing, but the questions of inadequate proof that were front and center in Rojas’ civil appeal will play a significant role there too.

Even if an appeals court rules in her favor, Rojas likely won’t be able to reopen the three clinics because of the conditions of her bond, which prevent from her being within a certain distance of the facilities, and because of the suspension of her midwifery license. It’s also possible that the three judges on Texas’ 15th Court of Appeals won’t say that much about the caliber of the state’s evidence, instead focusing its on procedural technicalities or constitutional questions. But the hearing was a first look at whether Texas can prove its case against Rojas. And so far, the state’s case looks far from a slam dunk.

The most obvious obstacles to successful abortion prosecutions are political. Polling has shown consistent support for abortion rights, and even more so since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Republicans have mostly worked to draw attention away from an issue that can hurt them at the polls. The Trump administration has played for time, supposedly launching a new study on the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone and seeking delays in court. All of this, Trump officials say, could take years, and certainly will take until after the midterms. A high-profile conviction could bring attention to the issue that some Republicans don’t want, especially if a defendant can tell a sympathetic story about the care they provide.

But the Rojas case is reminder that it just isn’t that easy to prove an abortion has occurred. That has been true throughout the history of abortion criminalization in the United States.

In the 19th century, as state criminal bans on abortion spread across the country, prosecutors struggled to find enough evidence for a conviction. It wasn’t always straightforward to distinguish an abortion from a miscarriage, or even to prove that a patient had been pregnant (some states didn’t even require proof of it). Even if there was evidence of an intentional abortion, juries couldn’t always tell if that procedure was meant to preserve a patient’s life.

A conviction was easier if a patient died. Then, prosecutors could rely on autopsy evidence, or even a woman’s dying words. But in a meaningful number of cases, defendants seem to have walked because there just wasn’t enough evidence of what had happened.

The obstacles to conviction aren’t any less daunting today. Consider what’s happening in Rojas’ case. It’s been hard for prosecutors to know when abortions might be occurring in the first place, especially given the availability of telehealth procedures. This case came to the attention of the Texas attorney general because of an anonymous tip. Rojas might have been an attractive target because she is a midwife. Historically, midwives had a harder time in abortion prosecutions than did licensed physicians, and Paxton might be hoping that the same is true today.  But one of the charges she faces—that she was practicing medicine without a license—is complicated by Rojas’s own version of events, which centers on the claim that she worked with advanced practice nurse practitioners to provide telehealth services and was a licensed midwife herself.

And it won’t be easy for the state to prove that Rojas offered abortions. The state is relying on a witness who claimed that she was prescribed a low-dose of misoprostol, a drug commonly used as part of the two-pill protocol used in a majority of abortions nationwide. Investigators also recovered misoprostol when they raided Rojas’s place of business.

But simply possessing or dispensing misoprostol can’t tell prosecutors all that much. The drug is widely used to prevent ulcers caused by taking NSAIDs like ibuprofen, manage early pregnancy loss, induce labor, or address hemorrhage after childbirth.  Rojas operated a birthing center. Her attorneys stress that prosecutors can’t tell if she was using misoprostol to treat patients who had given birth or experienced miscarriage. And there were no supposedly telltale signs of abortion services present at her clinics either, such as tools used for surgical abortion or even mifepristone, a drug with multiple off-label uses that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration only for the termination of pregnancy.

It’s not clear that this evidence this will be enough to secure a conviction. In the past, prosecutors sometimes struggled with similar cases. Even if a defendant did have a drug used in abortion, prosecutors often needed additional proof, such as evidence that a person had been convicted of offering abortions in the past, or was widely recognized in the community as an abortion provider. The reason was straightforward: These medications were and are used in obstetrics and gynecology for other reasons.

All of these obstacles to a conviction make the stakes of the Rojas trial that much higher. States know they won’t be able to find most people accessing or distributing abortion pills. It’s not clear either that they will be able to pursue physicians mailing pills from states that protect reproductive rights into ban jurisdictions. But prosecutors like Paxton hope that by making an example of someone like Rojas, they can scare others into compliance.

Even charges like the ones Rojas faces can be devastating, whether or not a jury ever convicts. Clinics where she worked have been forced to close and her midwifery license has been suspended. She had to pay a $1.6 million bond and faces years in prison. The risk of similar consequences might be enough to frighten off many providers.

If Rojas is convicted, the impact will be even greater. It might give pause not only to those who might offer abortions but anyone who might use misoprostol to manage miscarriage, hemorrhage, or any other complication. Patients in many Texas counties already lack access to maternity care. Cases like this one are likely to exacerbate the problem.

Prosecutors in places like Texas know they won’t be able to detect the vast majority of abortions. But by making an example of people like Maria Rojas, prosecutors hope that they won’t have to.

Gabfest Reads is a monthly series from the hosts of Slate’s Political Gabfest podcast. Recently, John Dickerson talked with Father James Martin about his new book, Work in Progress: Confessions of a Busboy, Dishwasher, Caddy, Usher, Factory Worker, Bank Teller, Corporate Tool, and Priest. During part of their discussion, they explored how Martin’s early jobs taught him humility and empathy, why his LGBTQ Catholic ministry has drawn intense opposition, and what the Gospels actually say about immigration and welcoming strangers.

This partial transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.

John Dickerson: So let’s talk about the turn that your life took from being what you say is ‘a corporate tool.’ It’s not going perfectly. And then you come home one night and what happens? Give us the sense of where you were in terms of your job and you were on your way to being rich, the thing that you had started out at age 15 wanting to be.

Father James Martin:… So I worked at General Electric’s Finance and Accounting division in New York City for three years. And then I moved to GE Capital, which was their financial services arm, which was really booming at the time in the mid-’80s. So I moved there in 1985. I took a job in human resources and I thought that would be a little more congenial, but gradually I started to realize I’m in the wrong place. And business is a real vocation for a lot of people. Many of my friends, believe it or not, they worked in GE for their whole lives. A lot of them just retired a couple of years ago, and they contributed to the common good. GE made great things, medical systems and light bulbs and all that kind of stuff, but it wasn’t for me.

And I found myself getting more and more stressed, more and more miserable, and really thinking, what am I doing here? And there were occasions that I witnessed as an HR person of really crass and cruel behavior. Can I share one of them?

John Dickerson: Yeah.Father James Martin: This was a defining moment for me. Very brief, I’ll make a long complicated story shorter. I was in HR, I was 25, 26. I’m a young guy still, but as you know, their HR departments are pretty small. So you have these young people going to these executives saying, “You can do this and not do that,” and whatnot.

So there was a manager who wanted to fire somebody or bounce them as we used to say. And we had just given this guy an incentive award. So in other words, we had just given him, I think, a trip. So he had just gotten this great job performance review. In any event, this guy said, “I don’t care. I’m firing him.” So my manager said, “Go and talk to this manager,” who was way above me, “and tell him, ‘You can’t do that. You can’t fire someone without cause and you just can’t bounce somebody.’”

And he said, “I don’t care.” And I said, “Well, this guy had an incentive award, and…” “I don’t care. I want him out.” I can see him standing. He was taller than I was. And I said, “Well, he has a family for Pete’s sake.” So I said, “Have some compassion.” And he said, “F compassion.” Not ironically. And I remember thinking, “oh my gosh, that someone could say that with a straight face? What am I doing here?” So that got me thinking about leaving.

And then as I say in the book, I came home and turned on the TV and saw a documentary about Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk, and monastic life and the priesthood. It came at the right time. So I always say my life was changed by TV. There you go.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for the Surge, the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.

Welcome to this week’s edition of the Surge, a politics newsletter that is just saying—just saying—that the best Winter Olympics event would have been: You start in Milan. First one to Cortina wins. But no one asked us …

Politics news, meanwhile, continued to happen this week. Early voting is underway in Texas, and some primary races are only getting more peculiar. President Donald Trump may bomb Iran again? Also: Aliens are real, and the Labor Department is in crisis.

Let’s begin with a Supreme Court decision that was uncharacteristically rude and disrespectful to the Trump administration.

The Supreme Court, in a 6–3 opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, struck down most of Trump’s tariffs on Friday, ruling that the law he was invoking could not be used for such a purpose. Trump had been claiming that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act gave him the emergency power to set tariffs on a whim, without the need for investigative findings or durational limits, for any particular reason that struck his fancy. This view undergirded certain tariffs against Mexico, Canada, and China, his global matrix of “reciprocal tariffs,” and various threats he’s made against, say, European countries that don’t support his attempt to acquire Greenland. It was the stick he waved around the world to achieve his foreign policy aims, to show favor and disfavor, to offer or withhold exemptions to courtiers. Roberts’ simple conclusion that “IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs” is more than a blow to his economic vision. It’s a strike against the sweeping vision of the presidency he’s built.

That’s why Trump is so darn mad about it and, in a seething Friday afternoon press conference during which he said he was “ashamed” of the justices, announced he would use other powers to replicate the fallen tariff regime. Trump does have additional tariff authorities delegated to him by Congress, but they all have certain restraints. Some cap the duration of time they can be implemented, or cap the tariff rate he can set; others require departmental investigations or findings. None may meet that sweet, sweet high offered by the pretend authority he thought he had in IEEPA.

On his broadcast Monday, CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert explained to his audience that he was supposed to air an interview with Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico but had been told by his network’s lawyers, “in no uncertain terms,” that he couldn’t do so. At issue was CBS’s interpretation of recent guidance from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr stating that the FCC would reconsider an exemption of the “equal time” rule enjoyed by late-night and daytime talk shows. CBS, meanwhile, said in a statement that its lawyers didn’t prohibit Colbert from airing the interview; they only advised the show that it could trigger an FCC complaint and “presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled.” So Colbert instead posted the interview to YouTube, where there are no such “equal time” regulations. As of this writing, the interview is nearing 8 million views.

There are a lot of moving parts here, but after doing some calculations (Surge Math), this nets out to a meaningful contribution from CBS management to the Democratic Party’s hopes of retaking Senate control. CBS got the willies over Carr’s guidance (and his apparently real investigation of The View). Talarico, running in a close primary against Rep. Jasmine Crockett, successfully parlayed that into a narrative about how the administration had “censored” him, because it “doesn’t want you to hear what James Talarico has to say.” The ensuing uproar allowed him to raise millions of dollars overnight, giving him a boost against Crockett as early voting begins. It’s no secret that the GOP would prefer to run against the more partisan, polarizing Crockett instead of Talarico, and CBS’s actions made that at least somewhat less likely.

Among the more competitive House primaries in Texas is a rematch between GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales and Brandon Herrera, aka “the AK Guy.” In their 2024 contest, Gonzales—guilty of occasional anti-MAGA heresies—held off only Herrera, a challenger from Gonzales’ right, by 400 votes in the primary runoff. The two are back at it again in a district that spans a broad swath of West Texas along the southern border.

Just as early voting began this week, though, a tragic story involving a former Gonzales staffer from last year has come back to the fore. A district-level aide for Gonzales, Regina Santos-Aviles, died by self-immolation at her home in September. Shortly after the incident last fall, the Daily Mail reported that Gonzales—a married father of six—had been having an affair with her. Gonzales denied it, but the rumor lingered. This week, another former Gonzales staffer released a text message from Santos-Aviles from last year, in which she said she’d had an affair with “our boss.” Then, Santos-Aviles’ husband said in an interview that he’d caught wind of the affair and confronted Gonzales about it, after which Gonzales “black-sheeped” his wife at work, sending her into a downward spiral. Gonzales has had a range of defiant responses, from blaming the Herrera campaign from “using a disgruntled former staffer to smear her memory and score political points” to accusing the husband and his lawyers of blackmail. And with that, we’re going to throw our hands in the air and proceed to a new entry.

Administrations used to have the decency to lie to the American people before leading them into a fresh war. A case had to be built. Now we just get wind that wars might happen a couple of days before they start. Although there have been reports for weeks that the administration was moving military assets toward the Middle East, it set in only this week that Trump was gathering the largest fleet of warships and air power in the region since 2003 (although still only a fraction of that). We’re just waiting on the USS Gerald R. Ford and its strike group to finish its hustle from the Caribbean to the Middle East for the president to have a full menu of options against Iran available to him.

If Iran and the U.S. don’t reach a deal over Iran’s nuclear program and whatever else is on the table, what does Trump want to do? Again, we really don’t know, and the administration has not offered to explain. It could be limited strikes to take out Iranian military assets left unbombed during last summer’s 12-day attack on the country. Or Trump could go Full Lindsey Graham and try to kill the leaders of the Iranian regime, hoping that whoever replaces it is a more cooperative partner with the United States. It genuinely could come down to the advice of whoever he winds up playing golf with next.

The former president did an interview with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen this week in which he discussed any number of issues about the world and the political scene today, but the takeaway was: aliens. Cohen asked Barack Obama if aliens were real. “They’re real,” he said, “but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in, what is it, Area 51. There’s no underground facility. Unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”

We didn’t know it was still particularly surprising to hear someone say that aliens are “real”—we’ve all seen the photos of Mark Zuckerberg waterskiing—but this set off enough of a news frenzy that Obama was forced to post a clarification. “I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify,” he said. “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there. But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” Someone seems nervous, and it’s our assumption that alien colonies do live underwater and that James Cameron’s The Abyss was a documentary. Trump, later in the week, effectively confirmed that aliens are real by saying that Obama had shared “classified information” and, later that night, instructed the government to begin releasing files related to aliens. In short, everything got out of hand quickly and weirdly, but such is life in America 250 years after its founding.

Not all states are pliant to national party pressure to maximize partisan gerrymandering efforts in the midcycle redistricting wars. National Republicans, memorably, put the full weight of congressional and presidential pressure on Indiana legislators to squeeze out another GOP seat or two in the state, only to be rejected in a state Senate vote late last year. Now it’s Democrats facing a similar situation in Maryland. The state’s current delegation is seven Democrats to one Republican, and that one Republican is the very, very safely seated Rep. Andy Harris, chair of the House Freedom Caucus. National Democratic leaders and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore want to create an 8–0 map for Democrats, and such a map has already passed out of the state’s House of Delegates.

The Maryland Senate, however, isn’t acting. As it happens, the Surge reported on the previous time national Democrats pressured Maryland legislators to wipe Harris off the map, five years ago, and the figure of resistance now is the same as then: state Senate President Bill Ferguson. Ferguson’s practical fear is that state courts would reject an 8–0 Democratic map and possibly implement one that’s worse for Democrats than the current 7–1 map. (If you’re a Maryland law sicko and want to read Rep. Jamie Raskin’s lengthy response to this argument, have at it.) So immovable is Ferguson that House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries went to Annapolis this week to meet with him. The visit did not appear to make a difference. “Bill Ferguson authentically believes that the votes don’t exist in the State Senate to move forward,” Jeffries said in a statement afterward. “The only way to find out is to allow an immediate up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.”

We believe that this is the labor secretary’s first appearance in the Surge, and, regrettably, it’s not to commend her on great achievements in the field of labor. Last month, the New York Times reported that a member of her security team with whom she’d been accused of having a “romantic relationship” had been placed on leave during a misconduct investigation. There are also separate complaints, requiring separate aides to be placed on leave, accusing Lori Chavez-DeRemer of other forms of mismanagement.

This week, we learned that problems at the DOL encompass the other half of Chavez-DeRemer’s marriage as well. The secretary’s husband, Shawn DeRemer, has been barred from the department’s headquarters amid complaints from “at least two female staff members” who said that he had sexually assaulted them. (DeRemer denies the allegations.) D.C. police are investigating it. According to the Times, there is video of at least one incident that shows “Dr. DeRemer giving one of the women an extended embrace.” The Surge is skeptical the DeRemers are long for service in Trump’s Washington.

The Supreme Court struck down Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on Friday, ruling 6–3 that they vastly exceed anything federal law allows a President to do. It was a massive loss for a signature component of Trump’s economic agenda, and a coalition of liberals and conservatives on the court agreed that the statute invoked to impose these tariffs was never intended to be wielded in this fashion. The 6 disagreed emphatically as to the reasoning. The dissenters were Big Mad. On this week’s Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern unpack the rationale behind the decision, and the implications for those seeking a remedy. And they ask what to make of this massive loss from a court that has yet to truly tell this President “no.”

Then, the press clause of the First Amendment, a once-cherished constitutional right, has fallen victim to neglect and sabotage in recent years, taking a back seat to the more vaunted love affair with individual “free speech.” But, as recent developments—including the arrest of journalist Don Lemon and the heavy-handed interview-spiking “guidance” of late night host Stephen Colbert—illustrate, the freedom of the press is no slam-dunk when it comes to saving democracy in Trump’s America. Dahlia speaks with First Amendment scholars Sonja West (University of Georgia) and RonNell Andersen Jones (University of Utah) about the health of the press clause and the themes in their book, The Future of Press Freedom: Democracy, Law, and the News in Changing Times. They trace the ways in which the framers viewed press freedom as a core, structural “bulwark of liberty,” and why the Supreme Court has increasingly treated it as a neglected companion to free speech rights; leaving weakened and fragile protections for news gathering. The conversation contrasts Trump’s first-term rhetorical delegitimization of the media with a second-term shift toward tangible actions: access restrictions, funding cuts, agency leverage, and selective regulatory pressure.

The Supreme Court’s 6–3 ruling against Donald Trump’s global tariffs prompted the president to berate the justices in the majority at a seething press conference on Friday. Trump declared that he was “absolutely ashamed of certain members of the court for not having the courage to do what’s right for the country.” He condemned these justices as “fools and lapdogs for the RINOs and the radical left Democrats” who are “very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution,” adding that “the court has been swayed by foreign interests.” And he then singled out Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, whom he himself appointed, as “an embarrassment to their families.” (By way of contrast, Trump praised Justice Brett Kavanaugh—who strongly dissented—for “his genius and his great ability,” noting that he was “very proud of that appointment.”)

This furious reaction should come as no surprise: The president has been pressuring the justices to side with him for months, warning that the United States’ economy would be “screwed” without the tariffs and calling the case “one of the most important” in history. But this strong-arming clearly failed. After nearly a year of indulging almost every presidential wish, the Roberts court drew a line. The court’s opinion evinces no concern about political backlash or economic ruin. Instead, the majority reflects a kind of serene intellectual indifference toward the consequences of this ruling, with both Gorsuch and Barrett far more interested in an academic debate over statutory construction than the potential for a presidential tantrum that could further destabilize an embattled judicial branch. And there is no indication that these justices ever wavered in their resolve to strike down Trump’s signature second-term policy.

On this week’s episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the agreements and fractures among the six-justice majority, and all the ways in which the White House’s pressure campaign clearly fell flat, if it was experienced at all. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: A lot of people seem to think this is an incredibly fractured opinion with so many separate parts and concurrences and dissents. To me, the upshot of Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion for the court is that this is just an unvarnished loss for Donald Trump. The liberals are not prepared to deploy the major questions doctrine, and the dissenters are big mad, but in the end, Trump just loses 6–3.

Mark Joseph Stern: I understand why it’s confusing. There is so much separate writing by justices on both sides. But the bottom line is that six justices say Trump’s global tariffs exceed his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. They all agree with the bottom line that IEEPA does not give the president power to unilaterally tax foreign goods by allowing him to “regulate” foreign imports in an emergency. There is a split within the majority, though. Chief Justice John Roberts, along with Gorsuch and Barrett, uses the major questions doctrine to bolster their conclusion. This trio says: We have a rule that when the president is claiming a major power of “economic and political significance,” he needs explicit statutory authorization. And IEEPA is not it.

But the liberals have never embraced that rule, which SCOTUS used to block much of President Joe Biden’s agenda. And in her separate concurrence, Justice Elena Kagan—joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson—says she still doesn’t agree with the major questions doctrine. Nor does she think it’s needed to get to the correct result here. But she also says that she agrees with “the bulk of the principal opinion’s reasoning.” So there is a solid six-justice supermajority here. This is not like the first Obamacare case where you had to count heads to find a majority.

There was also none of that weird, very visible horse-trading we saw in the Obamacare opinions—it was clear that justices were crossing their fingers and doing deals under the table. It didn’t feel like there was horse-trading here. There was a legitimate question about the major questions doctrine. The justices in the majority found slightly different ways to say no, but they were still saying no.

To me, that hints at the possibility that the six-justice majority firmed up very quickly after arguments. I think when the justices discussed this case at conference, it was clear that Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett were firmly against these tariffs. We speculated, at the time, whether the liberals would have to sign on to the major questions doctrine in order to get to a majority against the tariffs. Would Roberts team up with Gorsuch and Barrett to pressure the liberals into finally endorsing and legitimizing the major questions doctrine? It seems like that didn’t happen here because the three liberals held the line, and there is no indication they ever wavered. They said: We agree with the statutory interpretation, but we are still not on board with major questions.

If there had been the kind of horse-trading that we saw in the Obamacare case, maybe Roberts could have forced those three liberals into the major-questions fold. Instead, they stood in their own camp. That allowed those three to maintain their integrity and broader principles while still reaching the right conclusion.

CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported on Friday that Trump completely blew up in a meeting after learning of the ruling on tariffs. She said “he started ranting about the decision, not only calling it a disgrace, but started attacking the courts and at one point saying ‘these effing courts,’ but using the actual language there.” We’ve known for the last couple of weeks that Donald Trump is not feeling it from some of “his” justices. And this is actually a pretty serious moment to think about Donald Trump making these threats against the courts.

I don’t think Roberts, Gorsuch, or Barrett were at all cowed by Trump’s bullying before, and they won’t be now. He pressured them for months, insisting that he should be able to do what he wants, and that we’ll be a “poor country” if the court strikes down his tariffs. I don’t get the sense that the three conservatives in the majority cared at all. Roberts’ opinion is so crisp and confident—a classic “this is what the law is” ruling. To the extent there’s any wavering or disagreement between Barrett and Gorsuch, it’s an academic fight about the major questions doctrine! Gorsuch has a 46-page concurrence defending the major questions doctrine against the liberals’ criticism of it. Barrett has her own concurrence outlining her view that it’s a more modest rule of statutory construction; not as substantive as Gorsuch says. Yet they’re seemingly on the same page with Roberts about applying it here.

These justices were not scared watching Trump make these threats on CNN. They had their heads in the casebooks! Their brains were miles away. I do find that somewhat encouraging, because we obviously need a judiciary that can function independently of the executive branch and stand up to it when it breaks the law. And one gets the comforting sense that that is indeed what happened here.

It’s such a funny corrective to our constant complaint that some members of the Supreme Court have no idea what’s happening in Congress, no idea about the enormity of the insurrection that happened across the street a few years back, no idea about those rendition flights to El Salvador, no idea about anything. Today was their equal opportunity to have no idea of what’s really going on with Donald Trump, and weirdly, it saves the day? If he wanted this to feel like an existential threat to them, they’re not having it. They’re just going to do eggheaded judicial construction all day long.

In a way, that’s the most satisfying part of the opinion: They have their heads in the sand no matter what. It’s still going to be Professor Barrett at the chalkboard explaining the difference between a substantive canon and a rule of statutory construction. While Donald Trump absolutely fumes in the White House and unleashes the fury on the court, Barrett may never even see what he says.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/22/cornwall_council_complaints_breach/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A UK councillor has dubbed her local authority&#39;s data breach &quot;crazy&quot; after the personal details of individuals behind a series of complaints were revealed to her.

Dulcie Tudor, an independent councillor for the Threemilestone and Chacewater area in Cornwall, England, publicized the data protection gaffe via social media following complaints about comments she made during a November council meeting.

Cllr Tudor received ten complaints after asking fellow councillor Leigh Knight whether a trans woman was a real woman.

The comments were made in the meeting, which in part discussed the UK Supreme Court&#39;s ruling in April 2025 that the legal definition of a woman was based on their biological sex.

That ruling came after the For Women Scotland campaign group appealed against the Scottish government&#39;s decision to add transgender women to board representation quotas, arguing that such protections should apply only to a person&#39;s sex as they were born.

The Supreme Court ruled that the definition was as described in the Equality Act 2010 that a person&#39;s gender should legally be designated by their birth sex.

The Act still provides protections for trans people from discrimination, but it means trans women may encounter legal difficulties in accessing same-sex facilities and spaces.

In a video posted to her Facebook page, Cllr Tudor explained that the complaints process typically sees complainant names shared with the individuals to whom their claim pertains, unless consent for the information is explicitly withdrawn.

Four of the ten complainants opted to redact their names from the complaints, which are sent to the relevant person – in this case, Cllr Tudor. However, in passing the complaint on, the council included the details of all ten.

Moreover, regardless of whether consent is given or not, the subjects of complaints should never normally see the complainants&#39; home addresses, email addresses, or phone numbers, but in this case all these data points were shared with Cllr Tudor.

She went on to suggest that with the information she was handed by the council, she could have seen which complainants were council officers and which were elected councillors, without confirming either were involved.

&quot;It&#39;s crazy,&quot; she said. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t know that.&quot;

At the time of posting her video, the council had not explained how the breach occurred, whether they had informed the complainants about the situation, or whether it had reported itself to the Information Commissioner&#39;s Office (ICO).

Cllr Tudor said that because of these complaints, she had to pass the information on to the Free Speech Union, which is representing her, as part of her response, meaning the information was shared even more widely. She also said that she informed the ICO on the complainants&#39; behalf.

The councillor posted an update saying the council told her that no wrongdoing occurred &quot;because when the complaints were sent to [her] as attachments, the complainants&#39; personal information was redacted.&quot;

She wrote: &quot;Want to know how it became unredacted? I opened the files!&quot;

The Register contacted Cornwall Council for a response but it did not immediately reply. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK government is pulling together an elite squad of drone operators to crack down on the scourge of fly tippers and unauthorized dumpers across this ever less green and pleasant land.

The top drawer cadre of joystick jockeys will &quot;track down illegal dumps from the air,&quot; the Environment Agency said, as part of a &quot;major crackdown on waste crime.&quot;

Some of the drones will be upgraded with laser mapping technology, including LIDAR, the EA said, while the agency will also deploy &quot;a new screening tool that enables EA officers to scan and cross-check lorry license applications against waste permit records.&quot; This means suspect operators will be flagged &quot;before they have a chance to move waste illegally.&quot;

From the government&#39;s point of view, illegal fly tipping and dumping is now in the realms of organized crime. The government is increasing the Environment Agency&#39;s enforcement budget by half to more than £15.6 million. The motivation is often to avoid landfill charges, and criminals can make as much as £2,500 per lorry load of waste by billing customers for legal landfill, then diverting it to illegal dumps.

&quot;With organized criminals becoming ever more sophisticated, we are adopting new technologies to find and, importantly, stop them,&quot; said Phil Davies, Head of the Joint Unit for Waste Crime.

Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds said, &quot;From advanced laser-mapping to drone surveillance and new vehicle-scanning tools, this technology is helping us track, expose and stop waste crime, ensuring those who blight our communities are held to account.&quot;

Earlier this week, Varun Datta, 36, of Little Chester Street, London, was told he must pay £1.1 million by way of a confiscation order, and given a four month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months. He had earlier pleaded guilty to knowingly causing 4,275 metric tons of controlled waste to be deposited at a network of 16 sites. Datta must also pay £100,000 in compensation and £200,000 in prosecution costs. It&#39;s not just the UK that is facing the problem of unscrupulous operators dumping waste. This week it emerged that a man in Sicily had trained his dog to dump plastic bags of waste by the roadside, evading CCTV cameras installed to catch flytippers in the process.

The camera-dodging canine was captured illicitly offloading at least twice in the San Giorgio district of Catania, according to reports. His owner was tracked down and fined. Which just illustrates the high stake nature of this crime. In fact, the combination of high-tech, canine cunning, and illicit dumping is truly apocalyptic. Let&#39;s just hope the robo dogs being let loose on the UK&#39;s premier nuclear waste site don&#39;t get a whiff of it. Drones versus nuclear robo mutts sounds like a truly rubbish movie. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The UK&#39;s telecoms regulator has named and shamed the companies it receives the most customer complaints about, with certain brands cropping up more than others.

EE, TalkTalk, and Vodafone generated the most vitriol about fixed broadband, according to Ofcom. For landlines it was TalkTalk, Sky Mobile got the most for pay-monthly mobile, and EE again topped pay TV.

This covers complaints to the authority during the quarter from July to September last year (Q3 2025), relative to the size of the telecom operators&#39; customer bases (i.e. per 100,000 customers).

For fixed broadband, EE, TalkTalk, and Vodafone all hit 10 grumbles per 100K customers, but BT and Virgin Media were not far behind with 9 and 7 - the average was 8. Plusnet had the fewest complaints at 4. The gripes in this category were mostly about faults, service, and provisioning.

With landline users, TalkTalk again provoked the most moans, with 7 per 100K, but EE was a close second with 6, while BT, NOW Broadband, and Plusnet all had 5. Utility Warehouse received just 1 grievance per 100K.

When it comes to pay-monthly mobile operators, the number of grievances was relatively low. Even the top scorer, Sky Mobile, generated just 3 per 100K customers, with the average being 2. Ofcom said criticisms pertained to how customer complaints were handled by the operator itself, or issues with faults, services, and provisioning in the case of Three.

For pay TV services, EE registered the most moans at 6 per 100K customers, but Virgin Media generated 5, Sky was on 3 and TalkTalk 2. Handling of complaints by the operators was again the biggest source of dissatisfaction, but switching providers was a close second.

The overall volume of complaints per 100K subscribers appears to have fallen noticeably over the past 15 years or so, according to Ofcom charts. Way back at the start of 2011, the regulator recorded at least 40 per 100K for broadband and 38 per 100K for landlines.

Pay-monthly mobile complaints peaked at 19 per 100K in Q4 of 2011 and have steadily declined since. The level of pay TV gripes went no higher than 8 per 100K in 2018.

Ofcom has produced interactive charts of the number of customer criticisms it received, so readers can check them out historically by sector or by a chart comparing different providers. The underlying data is available in CSV format for anyone who cares to analyze it themselves. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">SerpApi, a Texas-based web scraping company, has asked a California court to dismiss Google&#39;s claim that that it bypassed digital locks to gather copyrighted content in Google Search results.

&quot;Google is the largest scraper in the world,&quot; the company said in a blog post on Friday. &quot;Google&#39;s entire business began with a web crawler that visited every publicly accessible page on the internet, copied the content, indexed it, and served it back to users. It did this without distinguishing between copyrighted and non-copyrighted material, and it did this without asking permission. Now Google is in federal court claiming that our scraping is illegal.&quot;

Google in December 2025 sued SerpApi [PDF], alleging that its web scraping circumvents the security measures Google put in place to protect copyrighted material surfaced in search results. This was two months after Reddit filed a similar lawsuit against Oxylabs UAB, AWM Proxy, and SerpApi claiming the defendants had violated its own controls and Google&#39;s defenses.

Google did so alleging violations of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), specifically Circumvention of Technological Measures (17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1)(A)) and Trafficking in Technology Designed for Circumvention of Technological Measures (17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2)).

&quot;SerpApi deceptively takes content that Google licenses from others (like images that appear in Knowledge Panels, real-time data in Search features and much more), and then resells it for a fee,&quot; said Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado when the lawsuit was announced. &quot;In doing so, it willfully disregards the rights and directives of websites and providers whose content appears in Search.&quot;

Invited to comment, a Google spokesperson pointed to Prado&#39;s post.

The question is whether the mechanism Google employs to prevent scraping qualifies as a technological protection measure under the law, and whether SerpApi&#39;s crawling system unlawfully circumvents that protection.

It&#39;s a question that has become hugely important in light of increasing efforts to harvest data from websites and to deploy counter-measures, both technical and legal.

Google in its complaint refers to its anti-scraping technology as SearchGuard and claims that SerpApi found a way around it.

&quot;With the automated queries it submits, SerpApi engages in a wide variety of misrepresentations and evasions in order to bypass the technological protections Google deployed,&quot; Google&#39;s complaint explains. &quot;But each time it employs these artifices, SerpApi violates federal law.&quot;

SerpApi disagrees, insisting that Google&#39;s legal broadside is simply an attempt to protect its business interests.

The DMCA&#39;s definition of a technical protection measure is specific. And according to SerpApi, SearchGuard doesn&#39;t meet that definition.

&quot;The DMCA defines circumvention precisely: it means &#39;to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure,&quot; the company says. &quot;Read that carefully. Descramble. Decrypt. Impair.&quot;

SerpApi maintains it does none of those things, asserting that it accesses publicly visible web pages, without breaking encryption, disabling authentication systems, or accessing private data.

To support its argument, the company cites hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp. and Impression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, cases that have affirmed the lawfulness of scraping public data and denied the applicability of DMCA anti-circumvention provisions to otherwise public works.

SerpApi&#39;s motion to dismiss [PDF] argues that its web scraping is not circumvention under the DMCA, just as Google&#39;s own web scraping isn&#39;t circumvention.

&quot;The DMCA prevents hacking: the &#39;electronic equivalent of breaking into a locked room,&#39;&quot; the company&#39;s motion states. &quot;...But Google does not allege unscrambling or decryption of any work, or the impairment, deactivation, or removal of any access system. It only alleges that SerpApi &#39;solved&#39; JavaScript challenges or CAPTCHAs or otherwise mimicked a human-controlled browser in ways that &#39;misled&#39; Google into providing search results. But that is not the equivalent of breaking a lock or drilling through a wall to obtain a copy of a book. Mimicry is not a violation.&quot;

In January, SerpApi made a similar argument against Reddit in its Memorandum of Law [PDF] that accompanies its motion to dismiss Reddit&#39;s complaint. Reddit&#39;s first amended complaint [PDF], filed earlier this month, continues to rely on DMCA violation claims.

Tori Noble, staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation told The Register in an email that scraping public information is essential for the functioning of the internet.

&quot;The right to scrape publicly available information keeps the Internet free and open,&quot; she said. &quot;The DMCA undermines web freedom by chilling lawful scraping for research, expression, innovation, and more. When companies like Google attempt to rely on overly expansive interpretations of DMCA to protect their business models, everyone suffers.&quot;

Noble added, &quot;SerpApi is an EFF donor. However, EFF takes its independence seriously and donors never guide any of our work, including commentary on legal cases that fall within our issue areas.&quot;

With regard to recent litigation involving AI data gathering, courts have been reluctant to limit web scraping. In December, US District Judge Sidney Stein rejected [PDF] Ziff Davis&#39;s bid to have the court treat OpenAI&#39;s flouting of robots.txt directives during its web scraping as circumvention under the DMCA.

Given the financial stakes involved, the inapplicability of copyright rules to halt competitive scraping seems likely to invigorate efforts to separate human visitors from bots. But with AI bots getting better at autonomous and human-delegated activity online, it&#39;s difficult to see sites will be able to keep the bots away with anything less iron-clad contractual agreements or the sort of full-blown authentication envisioned by the DMCA. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">opinion Beloved British single-board computer maker Raspberry Pi has achieved meme stock stardom, as its share price surged 90 percent over the course of a couple of days earlier this week. It&#39;s settled since, but it’s still up more than 30 percent on the week.

The trigger for this rally? The catalyst appears to have been the sudden realization by one X user, &quot;aleabitoreddit,&quot; that the agentic AI hand grenade known as OpenClaw could drive demand for Raspberry Pis the way it had for Apple Mac Minis.

The viral AI personal assistant, formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, has dominated the feeds of AI boosters over the past few weeks for its ability to perform everyday tasks like sending emails, managing calendars, booking appointments, and complaining about their meatbag masters on the purportedly all-agent forum known as MoltBook.

More level-headed voices have already flagged a wave of security vulnerabilities.

In case it needs to be said, no one should be running this thing on their personal devices lest the agent accidentally leak your most personal and sensitive secrets to the web. That&#39;s not just our opinion, it&#39;s one shared by the multitude of security experts El Reg has talked to about OpenClaw over the past few weeks, with some describing it as &quot;an infostealer malware disguised as an AI personal assistant.&quot;

In this context, a cheap low-power device like a Raspberry Pi makes a certain kind of sense as a safer, saner way to poke the robo-lobster everyone is losing their minds over. After all, Raspberry Pi made a name for itself by cramming just enough compute into a cute, credit card-sized package to be useful, and it cost less than a couple of movie tickets and a bucket of popcorn. Or ... at least it used to.

If you haven&#39;t noticed, Raspberry Pis aren&#39;t that cheap anymore thanks in part to the global memory crunch. Today, a top-specced Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB of memory will set you back more than $200, up from $120 a year ago.

What&#39;s more, the Raspberry Pi 5&#39;s Broadcom BCM2712 is fabbed on ancient 16 nm process tech and uses an Arm core that dates back to before the pandemic. The Raspberry Pi wasn&#39;t meant to be fast, just cheap, and it&#39;s not even that anymore.

Sure, OpenClaw forks like PicoClaw have made it possible to run the agent on low-end Raspberry Pis, but the thing still needs to phone home to an API service for large language model (LLM) access. Local LLMs can work for OpenClaw, but you won&#39;t be running them on a Raspberry Pi. Even running them on a maxed-out Mac Mini is asking a lot of the hardware.

You know what&#39;s cheaper, easier, and more secure than letting OpenClaw loose on your local area network? A virtual private cloud (VPC). Just remember to configure the firewall and spin up new credentials in case it gets compromised.

There is no shortage of VPC instances preconfigured to run OpenClaw that can be rented for a few bucks a month and shut down at any time if or when OpenClaw doesn&#39;t live up to the hype.

But if for some reason you prefer to keep your weapons of mass stupidity close at hand, at least you&#39;ll have a Pi lying around to power your next hobbyist project, perhaps for something that can&#39;t email your boss or drain your bank account.

Oh, and when Raspberry Pi&#39;s share price comes crashing back to reality, don&#39;t say we didn&#39;t warn you. ®

            <div id="article-text">PayPal has notified about 100 customers that their personal information was exposed online during a code change gone awry, and in a few of these cases, people saw unauthorized transactions on their accounts.

All of these customers have been fully refunded, according to a PayPal spokesperson.

&quot;When there is a potential exposure of customer information, PayPal is required to notify affected customers,&quot; the spokesperson told The Register. &quot;In this case, PayPal&#39;s systems were not compromised. As such, we contacted the approximately 100 customers who were potentially impacted to provide awareness on this matter.&quot;

According to a February 10 data breach notification sent to affected customers and shared with The Register, the online payment company spotted the unauthorized activity on December 12. It was due to a coding error in its PayPal Working Capital loan application that inadvertently leaked customers&#39; business contact information - including names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers, and business addresses - between July 1, 2025, and December 13, 2025.

&quot;PayPal has since rolled back the code change responsible for this error, which potentially exposed the PII,&quot; the letter said [PDF].

As soon as it noticed the leak and fraudulent transactions, PayPal says it began an investigation and blocked the unauthorized access, resetting passwords of affected accounts and requiring customers to set a new password the next time they log in.

&quot;A few customers experienced unauthorized transactions on their account and PayPal has issued refunds to these customers,&quot; according to the notification.

The company is also offering affected customers two years of free credit monitoring.

This data incident follows an earlier - and much worse - PayPal breach that also occurred in December, during which &quot;unauthorized parties&quot; accessed customers&#39; accounts using their valid login credentials.

In that 2022 security snafu, personal info belonging to 35,000 PayPal users was exposed including customers&#39; names, addresses, Social Security numbers, individual tax identification numbers, and dates of birth. ®

The Expanding Universe is as approachable as it is experimental.

I recently had the pleasure of interviewing Laurie Spiegel for the site. As preparation for the interview, I spent a lot of time over the last couple of weeks revisiting Spiegel’s records, most notably The Expanding Universe, her 1980 masterpiece that blends synth experimentalism with early examples of what would eventually be called ambient music, and algorithmic composition techniques. It’s a marvel that sounds both nostalgic and cutting-edge at the same time.

Tracks like “Patchwork” and “A Folk Study” dabble in the sort of bouncy arpeggios that beg comparisons to The Who’s “Baba O’Riley,” while “Old Wave” and “East River Dawn” conjure early M83 or Boards of Canada. The palette she draws from is buzzing with life and timeless, rarely dating itself in the way her later (also excellent) record Unseen Worlds does, as it occasionally dabbles in FM bells.

There are also slower forays into more typical ambient sounds like “Appalachian Grove II” or “The Unanswered Question,” whose melodies move at such a glacial pace that they can feel almost completely random at times. Tracks like these and “Music for Dance II” wouldn’t feel out of place on modern ambient Instagram or modular synth YouTube, scenes that obviously owe a lot to Spiegel’s pioneering works.

While the vast majority of the tracks completely lack percussion, there are a few exceptions, most obviously the fast-paced and polyrhythmic “Drums.” But the standout to me is “Clockworks,” which ventures into the sort of proto-industrial grime and rattle you’d find on a Throbbing Gristle record or even a modern Trent Reznor score. The fact that it doesn’t appear to have been sampled (at least according to WhoSampled) and repurposed as the backbone of an underground hip-hop track is shocking to me.

While The Expanding Universe doesn’t necessarily present a cohesive vision, it still feels like the singular expression of an artist at the height of their game. The 2012 reissue adds to Spiegel’s legacy by including over 100 minutes of additional material not on the original release.

While the idea of 70s experimental synth music might scare off casual listeners, there is something inviting about a lot of the works on The Expanding Universe. Sure, some tracks, like the one-two punch of closers “Kepler’s Harmony of the Worlds” and “Wandering in Our Times,” aren’t afraid to sit for extended periods in dissonance and confrontational tones, but for the most part, Spiegel’s compositions are tuneful and approachable.

Laurie Spiegel’s The Expanding Universe is available on Bandcamp, as well as most major streaming services, including Qobuz, Deezer, YouTube Music, Apple Music, and Spotify.

            <div id="article-text">Rice said those who “take a knee to Trump” will be held accountable.

Rice said those who “take a knee to Trump” will be held accountable.

Donald Trump threatened that there would be “consequences” for Netflix if it didn’t fire board member Susan Rice. Rice served in both the Obama and Biden administrations, and recently appeared on Preet Bharara’s podcast, where she said corporations that “take a knee to Trump” are going to be “caught with more than their pants down. They are going to be held accountable.”

Right-wing influencer and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer was quick to jump on the appearance and accused Rice of “threatening half the country with weaponized government and political retribution.” She also pointed out that Netflix, whose board Rice is on, is trying to merge with Warner Bros.

This, of course, plays to one of Donald Trump’s favorite narratives, that he is somehow an aggrieved victim of political persecution. That it’s Democrats, not he, who have weaponized the government and the Department of Justice against perceived enemies. Trump pounced on Loomer’s post, adding that “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences.”

While his post didn’t mention any specific consequences, it’s not a stretch to assume he’s threatening to step in and block Netflix’s purchase of Warner Bros. if he doesn’t get his way. It’s already been widely assumed that Trump would prefer Warner be purchased by Paramount, which has shown a willingness to go aftercritics of the Trump administration and is run by the Ellison family.

            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-02-22</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/881175/red-bull-media-house-game-pop-bulletin-magazine-playable-tetris-flexible-display">Visit Original Website</a>

            <div id="article-text">There’s a playable, paper-thin Tetris game on the cover.

There’s a playable, paper-thin Tetris game on the cover.

Tetris has been immortalized in a playable McDonald’s plastic chicken nugget, a playable fake 7-Eleven Slurpee cup, and a playable wristwatch. But the most intriguing way to play Tetris yet is encased in paper.

Last year the Tetris Company partnered with Red Bull for a gaming tournament that culminated in the 150-meter-tall Dubai Frame landmark being turned into the world’s largest playable Tetris installation using over 2,000 drones that functioned as pixels. Although the timing was a coincidence, Red Bull also published a 180-page gaming edition of its The Red Bulletin lifestyle magazine around the same time as the event, with a limited number of copies wrapped in a less grandiose, but no less technically impressive, version of Alexey Pajitnov’s iconic puzzle game.

To create a playable gaming magazine, Red Bull Media House (the company’s media wing) enlisted the help of Kevin Bates, who in 2014 wowed the internet by creating an ultra-thin Tetris-playing business card. In 2015, he launched the $39 Arduboy, a credit card-sized, open-source handheld that attracted a thriving community of developers. Over the course of a decade, Bates also created a pair of equally pocketable Tetris-playing handhelds that cost less than $30, and the shrunken-down USB-C Arduboy Mini.

The GamePop GP-1 Playable Magazine System (as it’s officially called) is the latest evolution of Bates’ mission to use existing, accessible, and affordable technologies to reimagine what a portable gaming device can be. It took “most of last year” to develop, Bates revealed during a call with The Verge. He wouldn’t divulge the exact details of how his collaboration with Red Bull came to be. But if you’re looking to make an officially licensed version of Tetris that’s thin enough to flex, Bates has the experience, and he shared with us some of the technical details that make this creation work.

While OLED display technology has given us tablet-sized devices that fold into smartphones, they’re still expensive and fragile. To make a display that can survive being embedded in a flexible magazine cover without reinforcement, Bates created a custom matrix of 180 2mm RGB LEDs mounted to a flexible circuit board just 0.1mm thick. While the display and coin-cell batteries make it thicker in a few places — nearly 5mm at its thickest point — you genuinely feel like you’re playing a handheld made of paper. The flexible circuits are bonded between two sheets of paper to create the sleeve that wraps around the book-sized magazine, and it feels satisfyingly thin and flexible.

Flexible circuits aren’t a new idea. They’ve been used in electronics for decades. You can find them in flip phones old enough they now feel like antiques, and nearly every laptop. They’re also frequently used to miniaturize devices that don’t fold or flex at all, connecting internal components where space is extremely limited. But it’s only in the past five or six years that the technology has become available to smaller makers, and Bates says he’s been “messing around with the flexible circuits for about as much time.” This collaboration was an opportunity to use what he’s learned to create a device that would live outside his workshop.

The GamePop GP-1’s display resolution pales in comparison to the OLED screens used in folding phones, but Bates’ creation is far more durable. The game has not only undergone the typical safety tests, but Bates even “hit it with a hammer a few times” to test its durability. His display survived, but don’t try that with a folding phone. They’re still far less durable.

Instead of buttons, the game uses seven capacitive touch sensors that are directly “printed in the copper layer of the board,” Bates says. There’s no true mechanical feedback when pressed, but the paper’s flex helps them feel a bit like a button when you press down. Bates says the responsiveness of the sensors was specifically tuned to account for the thickness of the paper stock and the glues used in the final print run. You’re not going to be chasing Tetris world records on the cover of a magazine, but the controls are satisfyingly responsive and the game is surprisingly much easier to play than other Tetris devices I’ve tested.

How much does a flexible Tetris game cost to manufacture? Neither Bates nor Red Bull would divulge the total price tag for all the off-the-shelf and custom components you’ll find sandwiched inside the magazine’s cover. But to help keep costs down, not all components are flexible. Inside the edge of the cover, next to the magazine’s spine, you’ll find a long but thin rigid PCB where an ARM-based 32-bit microprocessor is located, along with four rechargeable LIR2016 3V coin cell batteries.

Like most devices now, the game can be recharged using a USB-C cable, but it’s not immediately obvious where. Hidden along the bottom edge of the magazine’s cover is a deconstructed USB-C port. Instead of a metal ring, its socket is a small paper pocket containing a pin-covered head inside. It doesn’t feel quite as durable as the charging port on your phone, but it’s a welcome alternative to making the game disposable when the batteries die.

Bates did have to cut some corners. The GamePop GP-1 saves high scores, but modern Tetris gameplay features, like previews of upcoming pieces and being able to save tetrominoes for later, aren’t included. There’s sound effects, but when starting a game you only hear a small snippet of the iconic Tetris theme. The game’s piezo speaker “uses about as much energy as it does to run the rest of the system,” Bates says, so this helps prolong the life of the small rechargeable batteries. He tells us you can play for an hour or two that way, and the battery should last many months when not in use.

Red Bull made around 1,000 copies of the magazine. It’s only available online in Europe, but can also be found in some stores and newsstands, including Iconic Magazines in New York and Rare Mags outside Manchester in the UK. However, only 150 copies with the playable cover were produced, and none were made available to the public. They were distributed to Tetris competitors, those featured in the magazine, influencers, and select media.

The playable cover isn’t going to revolutionize the print industry, or pave the way for smartphones we can roll up and stick in our back pockets. The goal was to use existing tech in a way that gamers haven’t seen before.

﻿Invasive government and corporate surveillance isn’t inevitable — but Congress needs to act.

This is The Stepback, a weekly newsletter breaking down one essential story from the tech world. For more on the dire state of tech regulation, follow Adi Robertson. The Stepback arrives in our subscribers’ inboxes at 8AM ET. Opt in for The Stepback here.

In 1973, long before the modern digital era, the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) published a report called “Records, Computers, and the Rights of Citizens.” Networked computers seemed “destined to become the principal medium for making, storing, and using records about people,” the report’s foreword began. These systems could be a “powerful management tool.” But with few legal safeguards, they could erode the basic human right to privacy — particularly “control by an individual over the uses made of information about him.”

These concerns weren’t just cheap talk in Washington. In 1974, Congress passed the Privacy Act, which set some of the first rules aimed at computerized records systems — limiting when government agencies could share information and outlining what access individuals should have. Over the course of the 20th century, the Privacy Act was joined by more privacy rules for fields including healthcare, websites for children, electronic communications, and even video cassette rentals. But over the past couple of decades, amid an explosion in digital surveillance by governments and private companies, Congress has repeatedly failed to keep up.

Lawmakers have weighed numerous plans for preserving Americans’ privacy, yet over and over, they’ve fizzled. Attempts to rein in government spying — like proposed updates to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 — have been sandbagged by fears they’d compromise police and anti-terrorism operations. Despite multiple concerted attempts from members of both parties, Congress hasn’t passed a bill that governs how private companies collect data and what rights people have over their own information. Even highly targeted proposals like the Fourth Amendment Is Not for Sale Act — which restricts police from bypassing existing privacy laws by using data brokers — haven’t cleared the hurdle of becoming law.

Meanwhile, new technologies, from augmented reality glasses to generative artificial intelligence, create fresh risks every day — making it easier than ever to surreptitiously surveil people or encouraging sharing intimate information with tech platforms.

Immigration agents are harassing citizens that they’ve identified with data analytics tools and facial recognition. Data breaches at major tech companies are common, and security regulations meant to prevent them are being rolled back. Amazon just aired a Super Bowl ad bragging about how your doorbell can become part of a distributed surveillance dragnet for finding dogs.

At every point, invasions of privacy don’t just risk revealing something intimate about you to the world, they shift the balance of power toward whoever holds the most data. Take algorithmic pricing, where companies use personal information about shoppers to set individualized prices they estimate people will pay — resulting in companies like Instacart charging users different prices for the same item. (The company said this was an experiment it’s since ended.)

State-level and international regulations have addressed some privacy risks. Companies in Europe have been governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) since 2018, though a rollback was proposed late last year. Several states have passed some form of general privacy framework, as well as more specific rules — Illinois’ biometric privacy law has facilitated lawsuits against Meta and others, for instance, and New York mandated algorithmic pricing disclosure a few months ago. However, privacy advocates warn many of the rules are inadequate. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and US PIRG Education Fund graded state consumer privacy bills in 2025, and only two states, California and Maryland, earned higher than a C.

EPIC deputy director Caitriona Fitzgerald tells The Verge that Congress has passed at least one meaningful reform lately: the 2024 Protecting Americans’ Data from Foreign Adversaries Act, which Fitzgerald calls “the strongest privacy law to be passed at the federal level in recent years.” PADFAA bars data brokers from letting hostile nations access sensitive personal information of Americans, and EPIC used it to file a complaint against Google’s real-time bidding ads system — which it alleges broadcast sensitive data indiscriminately.

Overall, though, it’s fair to say the situation isn’t great.

As of early 2026, in many places, a sense of learned helplessness around privacy has taken hold. Companies like Meta push the line that if an existing technology already poses privacy concerns, it’s unreasonable to complain that a new technology does it even worse. According to internal documents, Meta also apparently believes that the Trump administration’s highly public flouting of civil liberties (or what Meta euphemistically deems a “dynamic political environment”) will keep activists distracted, leaving it free to push invasive features like facial recognition into products.

But the administration’s actions are making the dangers of these systems more and more difficult to ignore. It’s one thing to know the government could look up personal information about you. It’s another to have ICE agents intimidate you by dropping your name.

Not all of today’s privacy nightmares have easy regulatory solutions. But privacy groups have said for years that there are obvious ways to start improving the situation. A long-standing wishlist from a coalition that includes EPIC, PIRG, and others suggests creating a new independent federal Data Protection Agency, as well as a private right of action that would let individuals sue over violations of privacy laws. One of the most recent proposals is the Data Justice Act, a piece of model legislation outlined last month by a group of scholars at NYU Law. It’s aimed at limiting state collection and use of our deep digital footprints, aiming to redefine personal data “not as information the state may freely access, but as something inherently ours.”

There’s likely no turning back the clock on many digital technologies — nor, in many cases, would people want to. But it’s past time for more lawmakers to take the risks these technologies create seriously and decide it’s worth fighting back.

There’s been a surge of interest over the last few years in inexpensive digital cameras. Younger folks are snapping up old point-and-shoots because they view the aesthetic as more authentic and more appealing than smartphone images. Companies are even rereleasing old tech at new prices. And there are cameras like the original Camp Snap: a $70 single-button point-and-shoot with no screen, designed as a modern take on a disposable film camera. It’s cheap enough to send off with a kid to summer camp and accessible enough for just about anyone to enjoy its lo-fi aesthetic.

I’ve been testing two charming examples of this formula: the $99 Camp Snap Pro (aka CS-Pro), which is an upgrade to the original Camp Snap and looks like an all-plastic Fujifilm X100, and the Flashback One35 V2, which costs $119 and looks exactly like a disposable camera.

Both cameras aim to give you the aesthetics and screen-free experience of a disposable film camera with the convenience of digital. One of them hits the mark.

Simple dial for choosing four on-demand film profilesXenon flash with two settingsHas a tripod mount (rare for these kinds of cameras)No app, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth connection needed

Setting date and time requires a screwdriverSilver-and-black styling is classic but a little boringNon-replaceable battery

Compact sizeFun and intuitive companion appAnalog-like ritual of shooting with in-app “developing”RAW capture is possible (if you want that)

Lots of missed shots due to slow-to-wake advance dialLens is too close to grip, leading to fingers in shotsFilm styles sometimes failed to “load” in the cameraNon-replaceable battery

Both the Camp Snap Pro and Flashback One35 V2 are compact and built from lightweight, cheap plastic. The Flashback is noticeably smaller, about the size of a disposable film camera, and it slips into my back pocket better. But both are best toted in a jacket pocket, small bag, or purse. They don’t feel precious like regular cameras. My wife and I own an original Camp Snap, and we’d often toss it in our diaper bag without giving a damn.

Neither camera is special when it comes to specs (scroll to the bottom for a side-by-side comparison table). The Camp Snap Pro’s 22.5mm-equivalent lens and 16-megapixel sensor are respectively wider and higher resolution than the standard Camp Snap (8-megapixel, 32mm equivalent). The Flashback V2 has a 13-megapixel sensor. These basic smartphone-sized image sensors and tiny lenses yield image quality somewhere between a disposable film camera and an old phone. Unlike film, you’re not paying money with each shot. And they both feature proper xenon flashes for brightly illuminating dark settings at close distances — a sought-after look that also helps alleviate their awful low-light performance. (The original Camp Snap’s LED flash is mostly useless and not as flattering.)

But the biggest way these cameras differ is how you use them. The Camp Snap Pro has a dial that lets you swap between four filters; the defaults are STD (standard), VTG1 (vintage 1, with a warm magenta tone), VTG2 (vintage 2, with a green tone and boosted blues), and B&W (black and white). Each preset is user-customizable, allowing you to replace each with a custom look made in Camp Snap’s online Filter Builder. The original Camp Snap has a community built around free and paid downloadable filters, though some aren’t available on the CS-Pro yet. The included 4GB microSD card fits over 1,000 photos, and you can download them via USB-C cable or microSD card reader.

The Flashback also has four preset filters: classic, mono (black and white), beta (a reddish-toned look), and cine (exaggerating a teal-and-orange aesthetic). But you can only change between them in the camera’s companion app (iOS / iPad and Android), and you use them as “rolls” for up to 27 shots at a time. This is meant to mimic a disposable film camera. Once you select a filter, you’re stuck with it for the whole “roll,” though you can download a roll early and start over. The One35 V2 pairs to a phone or tablet via Bluetooth, allowing you to check battery level, enable a self-timer, or change your film type. Downloading the images to your device requires either Wi-Fi or a cable. By default, the app makes you wait 24 hours to see your images. Alternatively, images can be instantly developed by activating Digicam Mode, which I enabled after just one batch of shots.

It’s a nice app, but virtual roll-by-roll shooting quickly goes from charming to annoying. I’ve had a few occasions where my film type didn’t apply to the camera, causing rolls to come out in the wrong color tones or in black and white when I thought I was shooting color. Waiting to see your photos, and the occasional unexpected result, are part of the charm of analog photography, but I never dropped off a roll of black-and-white film and had it come back in color or vice versa.

The One35’s dedication to the bit has other drawbacks as well. After 27 shots, you can’t use the camera again until you offload your pictures to the app or a computer. This negates one of the major advantages of digital cameras, not to mention the whole point of a #screenfree camera. You can’t just hand it to a kid and set them loose with it. And its reliance on a disposable-camera-style advance winder to wake it up and re-cock the shutter means you constantly miss shots. The advance dial takes only one turn to wake the camera but around eight to prime the shutter. It doesn’t stay ready to shoot like a proper film disposable camera, which makes no sense for something designed around spontaneity.

When asked if this issue could be circumvented, Flashback’s external PR rep Bethany Andros told The Verge, “Yes, this is a known issue we’re trying to fix right now.” A firmware update will help, but it won’t solve the Flashback’s other big handling issue: due to lens placement, wrapping your hand around the camera’s sizable grip often results in my fingers getting in the shot. What’s the point of having a nice contoured grip if you can’t use it?

As far as image quality, the Camp Snap Pro yields a significantly sharper and cleaner image than the Flashback. Even the standard Camp Snap, which I also used for comparison shots, has slightly better image quality. “Better” is of course subjective, since these cameras are all about vibes. There’s none of the technical sharpness or minimal noise we’re used to in modern phones and full-size cameras, but the aesthetic flaws and limitations are kind of the point. I’ve even come across users within the Flashback subreddit preferring the One35 V1’s image quality over the V2, because it looks worse.

I recommend the Camp Snap Pro, and I simply can’t say the same for the Flashback. The One35’s concept is fun and endearing (and its see-through variants look amazing), but by trying to replicate the physical experience of the disposable camera, it winds up keeping the old flaws and adding new ones.

The Camp Snap Pro is focused on the utility disposable cameras provided in the days before digital cameras and smartphones. It’s cheaper than the Flashback, easier to use, more customizable, and yields a higher image quality — but not too high. It’s perfect for someone who wants something just a little better than the basic Camp Snap, or at least a proper flash. If you don’t take the bait on the Flashback’s nostalgic stylings, there’s just no comparison.

            <div id="article-text">﻿EFX Ambient and Pitch Shifter-910 bring more quirky weirdness to the company’s plugin suite.

﻿EFX Ambient and Pitch Shifter-910 bring more quirky weirdness to the company’s plugin suite.

Arturia launched a new version of its flagship effects suite, FX Collection, which includes two new plugins, EFX Ambient and Pitch Shifter-910. FX Collection 6 also marks the introduction of an Intro version with a selection of six effects covering the basics for $99. That pales in comparison to the 39 effects in the full FX Collection Pro, but that also costs $499.

Pitch Shifter-910 is based on the iconic Eventide H910 Harmonizer from 1974, an early digital pitchshifter and delay with a very unique character. Arturia does an admirable job preserving its glitchy quirks. Pitch Shifter-910 is not a transparent effect that lets you create natural-sounding harmonies with yourself. Instead, it relishes in its weirdness, delivering chipmunk vocals at the higher ranges. There is also a more modern mode that cleans up some artifacts while preserving what makes the 910 so special. Though if you ask me, it also takes some of the fun and unpredictability out.

EFX Ambient is the other new addition to Arturia’s lineup, and it’s a weird one. While it does what it says on the tin, it doesn’t always do it in predictable ways. Sure, there’s plenty of big ethereal reverbs and shimmer, but there’s also resonators, glitch processing, and reverse delays. It has six distinct modes with unique characteristics, which it feeds through a big washy reverb. And there’s an X/Y control in the middle for adding movement to your sound.

Neither of the brand-new effects made the cut for the Intro version. FX Collection 6 Intro includes Efx Motions, Efx Fragments, Mix Drums, Tape Mello-Fi, Rev Plate-140, and Delay Tape-201. That offers excellent versatility covering delay, reverb, tape-like lo-fi, modulation, and even granular processing. Primarily, what you miss out on are some of the saturation and mixing effects like bus and compression, as well as the more specialty flavors of delay and reverb like Rev LX-24, based on the Lexicon 224 from 1978.

$499 for the full FX Collection 6 Pro might seem steep, but as the company has grown the lineup from 15 effects in 2020 to 39 in 2026, it’s become a more attractive value proposition. And, while it’s not quite as highly regarded as Arturia’s V Collection of soft synths, it’s building a reputation for high-quality effects.

AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views.It is into this mess that Microsoft has put forward a blueprint, shared with MIT Technology Review, for how to prove what’s real online.An AI safety research team at the company recently evaluated how methods for documenting digital manipulation are faring against today’s most worrying AI developments, like interactive deepfakes and widely accessible hyperrealistic models.

Measles cases are rising. Other vaccine-preventable infections could be next.

There’s a measles outbreak happening close to where I live. Since the start of this year, 34 cases have been confirmed in Enfield, a northern borough of London.It’s another worrying development for an incredibly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Since October last year, 962 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Carolina. Large outbreaks (with more than 50 confirmed cases) are underway in four US states. Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant reason children are missing out on important vaccines. And if we’re seeing more measles cases now, we might expect to soon see more cases of other vaccine-preventable infections, including some that can cause liver cancer or meningitis.

            <div id="article-text">Twenty years ago, Joanna Wakefield-Scurr was having persistent pain in her breasts. Her doctor couldn’t diagnose the cause but said a good, supportive bra could help. A professor of biomechanics, Wakefield-Scurr thought she could do a little research and find a science-backed option. Two decades later, she’s still looking. Wakefield-Scurr now leads an 18-person team at the Research Group in Breast Health at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. Their research shows that the most effective high-impact-sports bras have underwires, padded cups, adjustable underbands and shoulder straps, and hook-and-eye closures. These bras reduce breast movement by up to 74% when compared with wearing no bra. But movement might not be the only metric that matters.

Few anatomical structures hang outside of the body unsupported by cartilage, muscle, or bone—meaning there wasn’t much historical research to build on. Wakefield-Scurr’s lab was the first to find that when women run, the motion of the torso causes breasts to move in a three-dimensional pattern—swinging side to side and up and down—as well as moving forward and backward. In an hour of slow jogging, boobs can bounce approximately 10,000 times.

Wearing a bra that’s too tight can limit breathing. Wearing one that’s too loose can create back, shoulder, and neck pain. Pain can also be caused by the lag between torso and breast movement, which causes what is scientifically known as “breast slap.”

The lab’s research has also found that the physical discomfort of bad bras, combined with the embarrassment of flopping around, is the one of the biggest barriers to exercise for women and that if women have a good sports bra, they’re more willing to go for a run.

Some bras function by deliberately compressing breasts. Others encapsulate and support each individual breast. But scientists still don’t know whether it’s more biomechanically important to reduce the breasts’ motion entirely, to reduce the speed at which they move, or to reduce breast slap. Will women constantly be forced to choose between the comfort of a stretchier bra and the support of a more restrictive one?

Wakefield-Scurr is excited about new materials she’s tested that tighten or stretch depending on how you move. She’s working with fabric manufacturers and clothing companies to try out their wares.

As more women take up high-impact sports, the need to understand what makes a good bra grows. Wakefield-Scurr says her lab can’t keep up with demand. Their cups runneth over.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

A new wave of theft is rocking the luxury car industry—mixing high-tech with old-school chop-shop techniques to snag vehicles while they’re in transport.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The bird is a beautiful silver-gray, and as she dies twitching in the lasernet I’m grateful for two things: First, that she didn’t make a sound. Second, that this will be the very last time.

They’re called corpse doves—because the darkest part of their gray plumage surrounds the lighter part, giving the impression that skeleton faces are peeking out from behind trash cans and bushes—and their crime is having the ability to carry diseases that would be compatible with humans. I open my hand, triggering the display from my imprinted handheld, and record an image to verify the elimination. A ding from my palm lets me know I’ve reached my quota for the day and, with that, the year.

I’m tempted to give this one a send-off, a real burial with holy words and some flowers, but then I hear a pack of streetrats hooting beside me. My city-issued vest is reflective and nanopainted so it projects a slight glow. I don’t know if it’s to keep us safe like they say, or if it’s just that so many of us are ex-cons working court-ordered labor, and civilians want to be able to keep an eye on us. Either way, everyone treats us like we’re invisible—everyone except children.

I switch the lasernet on the bird from electrocute to incinerate and watch as what already looked like a corpse becomes ashes.

“Executioner” is not my official title. The branch of city government we work for is called the Department of Mercy, and we’re only ever called technicians. But that doesn’t matter to the child, who can’t be more than eight but has the authority of a judge as she holds up a finger to point me out to her friends.

“Guys, look!” she says, then turns her attention to me. “You hunting something big?”

I shake my head, slowly packing up my things.

“Something small?” she asks. Then her eyes darken. “You’re not a cat killer, are you?”

I don’t know why I lied, but as the suspicion leaves her face and a smile returns, I’m glad I did.

“You should come down by the docks. We’ve got flies! Make your quota in a day.”

The girl tosses her hair, making the tinfoil charms she’s wrapped around her braids tinkle like wind chimes.

“It’s my last day. But if I get flies again for next year, I’ll swing by.”

Another lie, because we both know the city would never send anyone to the docks for flies. Flies are killed because they are a nuisance, which means people only care about clearing them out of suburbs and financial districts. They’d only send a tech down to the docks to kill something that put the city proper at risk through disease, or by using up more resources than they wanted to spare.

LeeLee is expecting me home to sit through the reassignments with her and it’s already late, so I hand out a couple of the combination warming and light sticks I get for winter to the pack of children with nowhere to go. As I walk away, the children are laughing so loud it sounds like screaming. They toss the sticks in the air like signal flares, small bright cries for help that no one will see.

LeeLee’s anxiety takes the form of caretaking, and as soon as I’ve stepped through the door I can smell bread warming and soup on the stove. I take off my muffling boots. Another day, I’d leave them on and sneak up on her just to be irritating, and she’d turn and threaten me with whatever kitchen utensil was at hand. But she’ll be extra nervous today, so I remove the shoes that let me catch nervous birds, and step hard on my way in.

Sometimes it seems impossible that I can spend a year killing every fragile and defenseless thing I’ve encountered but still take such care with Lee. But I tell myself that the killing isn’t me—it’s just my sentence, and what I do when I have a choice is the only thing that really says anything about me. For the first six months and 400 birds, I believed it.

LeeLee flicks on a smile that lasts a whole three seconds when she sees me, then clouds over again.

“Soup’s too thin. There wasn’t enough powder for a real broth.”

“Not like this. It doesn’t even cover up the taste of the water.”

“I like the taste of the water,” I say, which breaks her out of her spiraling enough to roll her eyes.

I put my hands on her shoulder to stop her fussing.

“The soup is going to be fine,” I say. “So will the reassignment.”

I’m not much taller than she is, but when we met in juvie she hadn’t hit her last growth spurt yet, so she still tilts her head back to look me in the eyes. “What if it’s not?”

“What if you get whatever assignment Jordan got?”

There it is. Because two of us didn’t leave juvie together to start community service—three of us did. But Jordan didn’t last three weeks into his assignment before he turned his implements inward.

I notice she doesn’t say What if  I get what Jordan got? Because LeeLee is more afraid of being left alone than of having to kill something innocent.

“We don’t know what his assignment was,” I say.

It’s true, but we do know it was bad. Two weeks into our first stretch, a drug meant to sterilize the city’s feral cat population accidentally had the opposite effect. Everyone was pulled off their assigned duty for three days to murder litters of new kittens instead. It nearly broke me and Lee, but Jordan seemed almost grateful.

“Besides, we don’t know if his assignment had anything to do with … what he did. You’re borrowing trouble. Worry in”—I check my palm—“an hour, when you actually know there’s something to worry about.”

You’d think it would hover over us too insistently to be ignored, but after we sit down and talk about our day I’m at ease, basking in the warmth of her storytelling and the bread that’s more beige than gray today. When the notification comes in, I am well and truly happy, and I can only hope it isn’t for the last time.

We both stiffen when we hear the alert. She looks at me, and I give her a smile and a nod, and then we look down. In the time between hearing the notification and checking it, I imagine all kinds of horrors that could be in my assignment slot. I imagine a picture of kittens, reason enough for the girl I met earlier to condemn me. For a moment, just a flash, I imagine looking down and seeing my own face as my target, or LeeLee’s.

But when I finally see the file, the relief that comes over me softens my spine. It’s a plant. Faceless, and bloodless.

I look up, and LeeLee’s eyes are dark as she leans forward, studying my face, looking for whatever crack she failed to see in Jordan. I force myself to smile wide for her.

She reaches forward and squeezes my hands. Hers are shaking.

She waves away my question. “I got rats. I can handle it. I was just worried about you.”

I spend the rest of the night unbelievably happy. For the next year, I get to kill a thing that does not scream.

“You get all that?” the man behind the desk asks, and I nod even though I didn’t.

I’ve traded in my boots and lasernet for a hazmat suit and a handheld mister with two different solutions. The man had been talking to me about how to use the solutions, but I can’t process verbal information very well. The whole reason I was sent to the correctional facility as a teen was that too many teachers mistook my processing delays for behavioral infractions. I’m planning to read the manual on my own time before I start in a few hours, but when I pick up the mister and look down the barrel, the equipment guy freaks out.

“They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”

“Did you not hear me? Don’t even look at that thing without your mask on.” He takes a breath, calmer now that I’ve lowered my hands. “Look, the first solution—it’s fine. It’s keyed to the plant itself and just opens its cells up for whatever solution we put on it. You could drink the stuff. But that second? The orange vial? Don’t even put it in the mister without your mask on. It dissipates quickly, so you’re good once you’re done spraying, but not a second before.”

He looks around, then leans in. “They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”

I nod again as I grab the mask I hadn’t noticed before. This time when I thank him, I mean it.

It takes me an hour to find the first plant, and when I do it’s beautiful. Lush pink on the inside and dark green on the outside, it looks hearty and primitive. Almost Jurassic. I can see why it’s only in the sewers now: it would be too easy to spot and destroy aboveground in the sea of concrete.

After putting on my mask, I activate the mister and then stand back as it sprays the plant with poison. Nothing happens. I remember the prepping solution and switch the cartridges to coat it in that first. The next time I try the poison, the plant wilts instantly, browning and shrinking like a tire deflating. I was wrong. Plants this size don’t die silently. It makes a wheezing sound, a deep sigh. By the third time I’ve heard it, I swear I can make out the word Please.

When I get home, LeeLee’s locked herself in the bathroom, which doesn’t surprise me. I heard that they moved to acid for rats, and the smell of a corpse dissolving is impossible to get used to and even harder to get out of your hair. I eat dinner, read, change for bed, and she’s still in the bathroom. I brush my teeth in the kitchen.

The next morning, I have to take a transport to the plant’s habitat on the other end of the city, so I spend the time looking through the file that came with the assignment. Under “Characteristics,” some city government scientist has written, “Large, dark. Resource-intensive. Stubborn.”

I stare at the last word. Its own sentence, tacked on like an afterthought. Stubborn. The same word that was written in my file when I got sent from school to the facility where I met LeeLee and Jordan. Large, dark, stubborn, and condemned. I’ve never been called resource-intensive. But I have been called a waste.

When I get to my last plant of the day, I don’t reach for the mister. This one is small, young, the green still neon-bright and the teeth at the edges still soft. I pick it up, careful with its roots, and carry it home. I find a discarded water container along the way and place it inside. When I get home I knock on LeeLee’s door. She doesn’t answer, so I leave the plant on the floor as an offering. They aren’t proper flowers, but they smell nice and earthy. It might keep the residual odor from melted organs, fur, and bones from taking over her room.

“Killing things is a dumb job,” says the girl.

After a week of hearing the death cries of its cousins, I was moved to use some of my allowance to buy cheap fertilizer and growth serum for my plant. The girl and her friends, fewer than before, were panhandling at the megastore across the way. She ran over, braids jingling, as soon as she saw me. I thought she’d leave once I gave her more glowsticks for her friends, but she stayed in step and kept following me.

“It’s not a dumb job,” I say, even though it is.

I shift my bag to point at the bottom of my vest. Beneath “Mercy Dept.” the department’s slogan is written in cursive: Killing to Save!

She sees the text but doesn’t register it, and I have to remind myself that even getting kicked out of school is a privilege. The city had decided to stop wasting educational resources on me. They’d never even tried with her or the other streetrats.

Suddenly, all I can think about is Jordan. “Maybe they don’t mind.”

I think of the plants. Maybe they hadn’t been pleading. Maybe they’d been sighing with relief. I think of the birds that eventually stopped running away.

“Maybe they’re tired. The city’s right, and their existence isn’t compatible with the world we made. And that’s our fault for being stupid and cruel, but it makes their lives so hard. We’ve made it so they can only live half a life. Maybe the least we can do is finish the job.”

It’s a terrible thing to say—even worse to a kid.

Her eyes go hard. “What are you killing now, executioner?”

The question surprises me. “Sewer plants. Why?”

I’d wanted her to leave me alone, but when she runs away I feel suddenly empty.

I have an issue at work when I can’t find my poison vial. I tell them it rolled away in the sewer and I couldn’t catch it in time, because I don’t want to tell them I was unobservant enough to let a street kid steal from me. After a stern warning and a mountain of forms, they issue a new vial and don’t add to my service time.

Pulling overtime to make up for the day I didn’t have my poison means it’s days before I get to fertilize my houseplant. LeeLee’s door is open, so I bring in the fertilizer and serum. She’s put the plant on her windowsill, but it prefers indirect sunlight, so I move it to the shelf next to her boxes of knickknacks and trinkets. I add the fertilizer to its soil and am about to spray it with the growth serum when I get an idea. I get the mister from my kit and set it up to spray the prepping solution on the little plant to prime it. I open the window and put on my mask, just in case, but I’m sure the man was telling the truth when he called the first liquid harmless. After its cells are open, I spray it with my store-bought growth serum.

I’m halfway through making dinner when I hear the crash and run into LeeLee’s room.

The plant has grown huge, turning adult instantly, and its new weight has taken down LeeLee’s shelf. Dainty keepsake boxes are shattered on our concrete floor.

I bend to my knees quickly, so focused on fixing my mistake that I don’t register the oddness of the items I’m picking up—jacks, kids’ toys, a bow—until my fingers touch something small and shimmering. It’s a scrap of silver, still rounded in the shape of the braids it was taken from.

I’d forgotten the city has more than one kind.

I’m waiting up when Lee gets home. I don’t make her tell me. I just grab her kit and rummage through it. Where my kit has a hazmat suit, hers has a stealth mesh to render her invisible. Where I keep my mister, she has a gun loaded with vials too large for rats. I have a mini-vac to suck up excess plant matter to prevent seeds from sprouting. She has zip ties.

By the time I’m done, she’s already cracking under the weight of everything she tried to protect me from. Within moments she’s sobbing on the floor. I carry her to her bed and get in beside her. I try not to listen too closely as she recounts every horrible moment, but I’m listening at the end, when she tells me she can’t do it anymore. When she confesses that she’s the one who stole my poison, and has only been waiting to take it because she didn’t have the stomach to do to me what Jordan did to us.

I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.

I leave her for just a moment, but by the time I lie back in bed beside her I’ve figured it out.

I tell her that she won’t have to take her shift tomorrow. I tell her I’m going to go around the city with my mister and my growth serum. That I’ll move plants from sewers to the yards around City Hall and every public space and the support pylons of important people’s companies, and then spray them so they become huge. The city will freak. I tell her it will be like the kittens, but this time we’ll all be pulled off our assignments to kill plants. And maybe the serum will work too well. Maybe the city was right to fear these plants, and they will grow and grow and eat our concrete while the roots crack our foundations and cut our electricity and everything will crumble. And the people with something to lose might suffer, but the rest of us will just laugh at the perfection of rubble. I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.

She asks if I’ll put any at our old detention center.

I talk long enough that her eyes close, and loud enough that neither of us can hear the sound of my mister blowing. The man who gave it to me was right. Even without the mask, it doesn’t smell like sulfur. It doesn’t smell like anything.

Micaiah Johnson’s debut novel, The Space Between Worlds, a Sunday Times bestseller and New York Times Editors’ Choice pick, was named one of the best books of 2020 and one of the best science fiction books of the last decade by NPR. Her first horror novel, The Unhaunting, is due out in fall 2026.

Here are our picks for the advances to watch in the years ahead—and why we think they matter right now.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

A new wave of theft is rocking the luxury car industry—mixing high-tech with old-school chop-shop techniques to snag vehicles while they’re in transport.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/20/1133365/measles-cases-rising-vaccine-preventable-infections-mumps-hepatitis-b/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a measles outbreak happening close to where I live. Since the start of this year, 34 cases have been confirmed in Enfield, a northern borough of London. Most of those affected are children under the age of 11. One in five have needed hospital treatment.

It’s another worrying development for an incredibly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Since October last year, 962 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Carolina. Large outbreaks (with more than 50 confirmed cases) are underway in four US states. Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.

The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant reason children are missing out on important vaccines—the World Health Organization described it as one of the 10 leading threats to global health in 2019. And if we’re seeing more measles cases now, we might expect to soon see more cases of other vaccine-preventable infections, including some that can cause liver cancer or meningitis.

Some people will always argue that measles is not a big deal—that infections used to be common, and most people survived them and did just fine. It is true that in most cases kids do recover well from the virus. But not always.

Measles symptoms tend to start with a fever and a runny nose. The telltale rash comes later. In some cases, severe complications develop. They can include pneumonia, blindness, and inflammation of the brain. Some people won’t develop complications until years later. In rare cases, the disease can be fatal.

Before the measles vaccine was introduced, in 1963, measles epidemics occurred every two to three years, according to the WHO. Back then, around 2.6 million people died from measles every year. Since it was introduced, the measles vaccine is thought to have prevented almost 59 million deaths.

But vaccination rates have been lagging, says Anne Zink, an emergency medicine physician and clinical fellow at the Yale School of Public Health. “We’ve seen a slow decline in people who are willing to get vaccinated against measles for some time,” she says. “As we get more and more people who are at risk because they’re unvaccinated, the higher the chances that the disease can then spread and take off.”

Vaccination rates need to be at 95% to prevent measles outbreaks. But rates are well below that level in some regions. Across South Carolina, the proportion of kindergartners who received both doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella, has dropped steadily over the last five years, from 94% in 2020-2021 to 91% in 2024-2025. Some schools in the state have coverage rates as low as 20%, state epidemiologist Linda Bell told reporters last month.

Vaccination rates are low in London, too. Fewer than 70% of children have received both doses of their MMR by the time they turn five, according to the UK Health Security Agency. In some boroughs, vaccination rates are as low as 58%. So perhaps it’s not surprising we’re seeing outbreaks.

The UK is one of six countries to have lost their measles elimination status last month, along with Spain, Austria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan. Canada lost its elimination status last year.

The highly contagious measles could be a bellwether for other vaccine-preventable diseases. Zink is already seeing signs. She points to a case of polio that paralyzed a man in New York in 2022. That happened when rates of polio vaccination were low, she says. “Polio is a great example of … a disease that is primarily asymptomatic, and most people don’t have any symptoms whatsoever, but for the people who do get symptoms, it can be life-threatening.”

Then there’s mumps—another disease the MMR vaccine protects against. It’s another one of those infections that can be symptom-free and harmless in some, especially children, but nasty for others. It can cause a painful swelling of the testes, and other complications include brain swelling and deafness. (From my personal experience of being hospitalized with mumps, I can attest that even “mild” infections are pretty horrible.)

Mumps is less contagious than measles, so we might expect a delay between an uptick in measles cases and the spread of mumps, says Zink. But she says that she’s more concerned about hepatitis B.

“It lives on surfaces for a long period of time, and if you’re not vaccinated against it and you’re exposed to it as a kid, you’re at a really high risk of developing liver cancer and death,” she says.

Zink was formerly chief medical officer of Alaska, a state that in the 1970s had the world’s highest rate of childhood liver cancer caused by hepatitis B. Screening and universal newborn vaccination programs eliminated the virus’s spread.

Public health experts worry that the current US administration’s position on vaccines may contribute to the decline in vaccine uptake. Last month the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved changes to childhood vaccination recommendations. The agency no longer recommends the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns. The chair of the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel has also questioned broad vaccine recommendations for polio.

Even vitamin injections are being refused by parents, says Zink. A shot of vitamin K at birth can help prevent severe bleeding in some babies. But recent research suggests that parents of 5% of newborns are refusing it (up from 2.9% in 2017).

“I can’t tell you how many of my pediatric [doctor] friends have told me about having to care for a kiddo in the ICU with … bleeding into their brain because the kid didn’t get vitamin K at birth,” says Zink. “And that can kill kids, [or have] lifelong, devastating, stroke-like symptoms.”

All this paints a pretty bleak picture for children’s health. But things can change. Vaccination can still offer protection to plenty of people at risk of infection. South Carolina’s Department of Public Health is offering free MMR vaccinations to residents at mobile clinics.

“It’s easy to think ‘It’s not going to be me,’” says Zink. “Seeing kiddos who don’t have the agency to make decisions [about vaccination] being so sick from vaccine-preventable diseases, to me, is one of the most challenging things of practicing medicine.”

            <h2>Microsoft has a new plan to prove what’s real and what’s AI online</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-19</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/19/1133360/microsoft-has-a-new-plan-to-prove-whats-real-and-whats-ai-online/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot, like when White House officials recently shared a manipulated image of a protester in Minnesota and then mocked those asking about it. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views, like the videos that Russian influence campaigns are currently spreading to discourage Ukrainians from enlisting.

It is into this mess that Microsoft has put forward a blueprint, shared with MIT Technology Review, for how to prove what’s real online.

An AI safety research team at the company recently evaluated how methods for documenting digital manipulation are faring against today’s most worrying AI developments, like interactive deepfakes and widely accessible hyperrealistic models. It then recommended technical standards that can be adopted by AI companies and social media platforms.

To understand the gold standard that Microsoft is pushing, imagine you have a Rembrandt painting and you are trying to document its authenticity. You might describe its provenance with a detailed manifest of where the painting came from and all the times it changed hands. You might apply a watermark that would be invisible to humans but readable by a machine. And you could digitally scan the painting and generate a mathematical signature, like a fingerprint, based on the brush strokes. If you showed the piece at a museum, a skeptical visitor could then examine these proofs to verify that it’s an original.

All of these methods are already being used to varying degrees in the effort to vet content online. Microsoft evaluated 60 different combinations of them, modeling how each setup would hold up under different failure scenarios—from metadata being stripped to content being slightly altered or deliberately manipulated. The team then mapped which combinations produce sound results that platforms can confidently show to people online, and which ones are so unreliable that they may cause more confusion than clarification.

The company’s chief scientific officer, Eric Horvitz, says the work was prompted by legislation—like California’s AI Transparency Act, which will take effect in August—and the speed at which AI has developed to combine video and voice with striking fidelity.

“You might call this self-regulation,” Horvitz told MIT Technology Review. But it’s clear he sees pursuing the work as boosting Microsoft’s image: “We’re also trying to be a selected, desired provider to people who want to know what’s going on in the world.”

Nevertheless, Horvitz declined to commit to Microsoft using its own recommendation across its platforms. The company sits at the center of a giant AI content ecosystem: It runs Copilot, which can generate images and text; it operates Azure, the cloud service through which customers can access OpenAI and other major AI models; it owns LinkedIn, one of the world’s largest professional platforms; and it holds a significant stake in OpenAI. But when asked about in-house implementation, Horvitz said in a statement, “Product groups and leaders across the company were involved in this study to inform product road maps and infrastructure, and our engineering teams are taking action on the report’s findings.”

It’s important to note that there are inherent limits to these tools; just as they would not tell you what your Rembrandt means, they are not built to determine if content is accurate or not. They only reveal if it has been manipulated. It’s a point that Horvitz says he has to make to lawmakers and others who are skeptical of Big Tech as an arbiter of fact.

“It’s not about making any decisions about what’s true and not true,” he said. “It’s about coming up with labels that just tell folks where stuff came from.”

Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley who specializes in digital forensics but wasn’t involved in the Microsoft research, says that if the industry adopted the company’s blueprint, it would be meaningfully more difficult to deceive the public with manipulated content. Sophisticated individuals or governments can work to bypass such tools, he says, but the new standard could eliminate a significant portion of misleading material.

“I don’t think it solves the problem, but I think it takes a nice big chunk out of it,” he says.

Still, there are reasons to see Microsoft’s approach as an example of somewhat naïve techno-optimism. There is growing evidence that people are swayed by AI-generated content even when they know that it is false. And in a recent study of pro-Russian AI-generated videos about the war in Ukraine, comments pointing out that the videos were made with AI received far less engagement than comments treating them as genuine.

“Are there people who, no matter what you tell them, are going to believe what they believe?” Farid asks. “Yes.” But, he adds, “there are a vast majority of Americans and citizens around the world who I do think want to know the truth.”

That desire has not exactly led to urgent action from tech companies. Google started adding a watermark to content generated by its AI tools in 2023, which Farid says has been helpful in his investigations. Some platforms use C2PA, a provenance standard Microsoft helped launch in 2021. But the full suite of changes that Microsoft suggests, powerful as they are, might remain only suggestions if they threaten the business models of AI companies or social media platforms.

“If the Mark Zuckerbergs and the Elon Musks of the world think that putting ‘AI generated’ labels on something will reduce engagement, then of course they’re incentivized not to do it,” Farid says. Platforms like Meta and Google have already said they’d include labels for AI-generated content, but an audit conducted by Indicator last year found that only 30% of its test posts on Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, and YouTube were correctly labeled as AI-generated.

More forceful moves toward content verification might come from the many pieces of AI regulation pending around the world. The European Union’s AI Act, as well as proposed rules in India and elsewhere, would all compel AI companies to require some form of disclosure that a piece of content was generated with AI.

One priority from Microsoft is, unsurprisingly, to play a role in shaping these rules. The company waged a lobbying effort during the drafting of California’s AI Transparency Act, which Horvitz said made the legislation’s requirements on how tech companies must disclose AI-generated content “a bit more realistic.”

But another is a very real concern about what could happen if the rollout of such content-verification technology is done poorly. Lawmakers are demanding tools that can verify what’s real, but the tools are fragile. If labeling systems are rushed out, inconsistently applied, or frequently wrong, people could come to distrust them altogether, and the entire effort would backfire. That’s why the researchers argue that it may be better in some cases to show nothing at all than a verdict that could be wrong.

Inadequate tools could also create new avenues for what the researchers call sociotechnical attacks. Imagine that someone takes a real image of a fraught political event and uses an AI tool to change only an inconsequential share of pixels in the image. When it spreads online, it could be misleadingly classified by platforms as AI-manipulated. But combining provenance and watermark tools would mean platforms could clarify that the content was only partially AI generated, and point out where the changes were made.

California’s AI Transparency Act will be the first major test of these tools in the US, but enforcement could be challenged by President Trump’s executive order from late last year seeking to curtail state AI regulations that are “burdensome” to the industry. The administration has also generally taken a posture against efforts to curb disinformation, and last year, via DOGE, it canceled grants related to misinformation. And, of course, official government channels in the Trump administration have shared content manipulated with AI (MIT Technology Review reported that the Department of Homeland Security, for example, uses video generators from Google and Adobe to make content it shares with the public).

I asked Horvitz whether fake content from this source worries him as much as that coming from the rest of social media. He initially declined to comment, but then he said, “Governments have not been outside the sectors that have been behind various kinds of manipulative disinformation, and this is worldwide.”

Backlash against ICE is fueling a broader movement against AI companies’ ties to President Trump.

            <div id="article-text">A private premiere screening of “Holiguards Saga – The Portal of Force,” the pilot installment of the planned Holiguards Saga franchise, was held on February 16 at ASTOR Film Lounge Berlin.

The event took place in a closed format with invited industry guests, partners, and media representatives. The screening was organized as a formal black-tie occasion and took place in Berlin during the same period as the Berlin International Film Festival, when international filmmakers, producers, distributors, and investors traditionally gather in the city.

“Holiguards Saga – The Portal of Force” is an independently developed film project intended to launch a multi-installment franchise.

According to the producers, the project is structured as a long-term cinematic universe concept, with discussions currently underway regarding financing and production of subsequent chapters.

The film was directed by Kevin Spacey, who also portrays one of the central characters. This marks his first directorial work in approximately two decades. The ensemble cast includes Dolph Lundgren, Tyrese Gibson, Brianna Hildebrand, Disha Patani, Swen Temmel, Lado Okhotnikov, Harry Goodwins, and Sonia Pim Couling. Production was led by Elvira Paterson and Vadim Degtiarev.

Elledgy Media Group, under Paterson’s leadership, supported both the production coordination and the international promotion strategy for the project.

Set in the near future, “Holiguards Saga – The Portal of Force” presents a fictional universe in which two ancient ideological orders, the Holiguards and the Statiguards, engage in a covert struggle over humanity’s direction.

The Holiguards advocate personal freedom and individual agency, while the Statiguards promote systemic order and centralized control. The central narrative follows Jessica, portrayed by Disha Patani, the daughter of leaders representing opposing factions. Positioned between conflicting legacies, her decisions influence the balance of power surrounding a mysterious cosmic energy source known as the Portal of Force.

The pilot installment introduces the mythological framework of the saga and establishes the political and philosophical tensions intended to expand in future chapters.

Ahead of the Berlin premiere, the production team reported receiving formal inquiries from international sales agents, distribution representatives, and private investors regarding potential collaboration and participation in future installments. Previous joint appearances by Elvira Paterson and Kevin Spacey were accompanied by private screenings and gala dinners in Cannes and Venice.

Following the Berlin premiere, a series of additional private screenings is planned in select international markets. Further announcements concerning festival participation, distribution strategy, and release scheduling will be made separately. At this stage, no official worldwide theatrical or streaming release date has been confirmed.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A growing number of startups are rushing to build software that thinks fast. But one of the hardest parts of teaching machines to improve isn’t raw computing power, it’s human insight at scale.

Zurich-based startup Rapidata has just taken a significant step toward fixing that with a €7.2 million seed round aimed at scaling a global network for human feedback, the essential ingredient for aligning and refining AI models.

The round was disclosed today by EU-Startups, positioning Rapidata as an early player in what could become a major layer of AI infrastructure: a system that compresses feedback loops from humans into AI training systems from weeks or months down to hours or days.

Modern AI systems have become astonishingly capable at generating text and images, but they still struggle with nuance, judgement and context, the very aspects humans excel at.

That’s why many advanced models are trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where people judge outputs and rate responses to shape the model’s behaviour.

Rapidata claims to change that by tapping a continuously available, worldwide network of real people, enabling AI teams to gather large volumes of high-quality human judgments far more quickly and flexibly than before.

Founded in 2023, Rapidata sits at the intersection of crowd intelligence and advanced machine learning infrastructure.

Instead of static pools of annotators or traditional data labeling services, Rapidata’s platform gives teams on-demand access to human insight everywhere. That means feedback isn’t limited by geography or segmentation, it scales with demand.

Rapidata’s mission also highlights a broader trend in AI infrastructure: investors and developers alike are beginning to treat human judgment as a core part of the stack, not just an afterthought.

As models become more capable, contextual human insight determines whether those capabilities are useful, safe, and aligned with real-world expectations.

With fresh capital in hand, Rapidata plans to accelerate growth of its human feedback network, onboarding more participants worldwide and improving integration with AI development workflows.

The company believes that the next major scarcity in AI won’t be compute, it will be high-quality human signal, and it wants to build the platform to serve it.

For an industry still figuring out how to scale both intelligence and alignment, a real-time feedback network could be a key piece of the puzzle, and Rapidata is positioning itself as one of the early builders of that future.

            <h2>Gartner $110M sale of Digital Markets division in latest SEC filing</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/gartner-110m-sale-of-digital-markets-division-in-latest-sec-filing">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Gartner first disclosed that it had agreed to part with its Digital Markets ( business unit that included its major software review, specifically Capterra, GetApp, and Software Advice) business in early 2026, the announcement was forward-looking and economical with detail: it named the buyer and the assets involved, but it left out any financial terms.

That lack of financial detail naturally made people wonder exactly how much the transaction was worth.

It was only later, in the company’s audited annual report on Form 10-K, filed on February 12, 2026, that a clearer picture of how the transaction was treated in the company’s regulatory filings became visible. That document, which is public, notes that the sale was completed on February 5, 2026, placing the divestiture within the broader contours of Gartner’s financial disclosures.

This most recent filing, accession number 0000749251-26-000112, stands in stark contrast with Gartner’s prior 10-K, covering the year ended December 31, 2024, and filed on February 13, 2025, under accession 0000749251-25-000008.

In that earlier report, there is no reference to this transaction or to any figure associated with it, consistent with the fact that the deal was not agreed or closed until 2026.

The January 29, 2026 announcement publicly identified G2 as the buyer, and specified the assets involved: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, but it did not disclose any financial terms, a detail that was equally absent from contemporaneous coverage.

In Gartner’s 10-K, the recorded consideration is described as being “before customary purchase price adjustments,” a phrase that signals the number reported in the filing is an initial headline value that may change once post-closing reconciliations tied to balance sheet items are completed.

These adjustments are common in sales agreements and are meant to align the agreed price with the business’s actual financial situation at closing.

A related 8-K filed on February 3, 2026, which included an earnings release, did not include any price details about the sale.

When we looked for the earliest relevant documents, we found that an earlier annual report,  Form 10-K filed on February 13, 2025 (accession 0000749251-25-000008), covers Gartner’s results through the end of 2024 and makes no reference to Digital Markets or the brands that were later sold.

That absence simply reflects the timing: the deal was agreed and completed in 2026, so it could not have been reported in a document covering the prior year.

Thus, the first SEC filing in which the transaction clearly appears is Gartner’s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, filed on February 12, 2026, under accession 0000749251-26-000112.

It is in this later annual report that Gartner formally records the sale of the business and constitutes the first document in the public record to show how the company accounted for the transaction in its audited disclosures.

Reading the February 12, 2026, 10-K, the Digital Markets sale shows up in several sections. Early in the document, in the business overview, Gartner notes that the sale was completed on February 5, 2026, alongside the headline figure that appears in the record.

Later in the same report, in a section discussing recent developments, the company lays out the context around the divestiture, reporting that Digital Markets was classified as “held for sale” as of December 31, 2025, and listing the related assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.

The same description of the sale is repeated once more in a note on subsequent events, which walks through the timeline from signing to closing.

Notably, none of these references in the annual report names the buyer. Within the text of the 10-K, a search reveals that “G2” and the individual brands that were part of the business being sold do not appear, underscoring that Gartner’s disclosure is focused on the transaction as a financial event rather than on the identity of the counterparty.

When a company states that a sale price is described as being “before customary purchase price adjustments,” it means the number reported is only a starting point.

In most deals, the buyer and seller agree on an initial figure but include mechanisms in the contract that can revise that figure after closing to reflect the business’s actual financial position at transfer of control.

These post-closing adjustments are designed to ensure a fair final amount based on what the business truly delivered at closing, rather than on estimates made when the agreement was signed.

The most common of these adjustments is tied to working capital, the cash and short-term assets a business needs to operate. Parties negotiate a target level; if the actual working capital at closing is higher than expected, the seller may receive more. If it’s lower, the buyer may pay less.

Other adjustments can relate to net cash or debt, where the purchase price is recalculated based on the actual cash and debt assumed by the buyer, and to mechanisms such as escrows or deferred payments that hold portions of the sale price until certain conditions are resolved.

Because Gartner’s public filing does not include the underlying sale agreement or a detailed reconciliation of these adjustment mechanisms, the exact formulas or thresholds that could change the final amount are not visible in the public record.

What the 10-K does make clear is that the figure reported is a headline number, subject to later review and revision once the closing accounts are finalized.

In many deals, the headline price is agreed on a “cash-free, debt-free” basis, meaning that after closing, the buyer and seller adjust the purchase price to reflect the target business’s actual cash and debt position.

If the business ends up with more debt or less cash than expected, the effective price the seller receives can be reduced. Conversely, if it has more cash or less debt than anticipated, it can increase the amount paid.

In Gartner’s public disclosures, there is no way to tell from the 10-K whether the Digital Markets sale was structured this way or how any such adjustment would be calculated because the underlying agreement and detailed terms are not part of the filings.

What the 10-K does show is the initial figure; whether and how it changes through these common adjustment mechanisms remains outside the public record.

Gartner’s most recent Form 10-K, filed on February 12, 2026, shows that the company completed the sale of its Digital Markets business on February 5, 2026, using language that describes the consideration as “approximately $110.0 million, before customary purchase price adjustments.” This is the only financial figure tied to the deal that appears in the public filings.

The earlier public announcement from January 29, in which G2 said it had agreed to buy Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp from Gartner, did not include any financial terms, and subsequent media coverage similarly reported that price details were not disclosed at the time.

In filings, the phrase “purchase price adjustments” refers to standard mechanisms in sale agreements, often tied to working capital and other balance-sheet items, that can increase or decrease the final amount paid after closing.

Gartner’s 10-K does not name the buyer in the sale disclosure, but it confirms the closing date and the approximate consideration while noting that the figure could change through those adjustments.

Taken together, Gartner’s own regulatory filings tell a more complete story of the Digital Markets sale than the initial announcement did. The only financial detail available in the public record comes from the company’s 10-K, which notes the closing date and describes the consideration in broad terms, but it leaves several questions unanswered.

We also reached out to both sides for further comment and clarification ahead of publication, seeking confirmation of the figures, insight into the structure of the deal, and any context that might illuminate how the transaction was negotiated and reported.

By the time of publication, neither party had responded.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google’s announcement that its Gemini app now writes music for you isn’t just one of those “blowing my mind” product updates. It feels like a symbolic surrender to a long-standing refrain from Big Tech: creative work is now just another checkbox for a machine.

If you don’t know what I am talking about, yesterday Google launched a new feature, Lyria 3, in the Gemini app, that allows us to cook up 30-second tracks complete with lyrics and cover art from a text prompt or a photo, of course, generated by Nano Banana; basically, no instruments, no experience, no pesky tactile skill required.

It’s essentially a LEGO set for “songs” that lasts about as long as a TikTok loop. They say it’s designed for YouTube Creators, and I tend to agree with them, because you can’t make to much with 30 seconds.

Still, the underlying problem is another one, as I am seeing different projects/songs made with AI, including AI artists. And this is what I want to highlight in this piece.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

“Behind every beautiful thing, there’s some kind of pain, “ said Bob Dylan, and I could not agree more.

If we take a look at the history ( art, music, literature, poetry, and so on), the main fuel for creation was indeed pain.

Now, how should I put this? Probably the only pain that Lyria can feel is more like a faint server-overload alert than heartbreak.

Real songwriters know that soul isn’t born in a 30-second prompt, it’s extracted through years of mistakes, late nights, losses, and tiny revelations.

Call it a toy if you like. Google will, too.

They even watermark the outputs with a SynthID tag so the 30-second ditties are officially AI-generated, not “inspired.” That’s a nod to copyright concerns, but it also reads like an admission: these aren’t really art, they’re chemical by-products of pattern statistics.

What’s striking isn’t the novelty. Much of this has been possible in labs and APIs for years, and creators have been experimenting with generative music tools as collaborators.

What Lyria 3 does, and what makes this moment worth watching, is normalising the idea that anyone can “write” a song with a chatbot and a mood descriptor. That’s not empowerment; it’s a devaluation of craft.

Just because you pay a subscription to Suno, that’s another AI music generator, and that one is more complex, that doesn’t make you an artist or a singer. Just because you learn how to write a prompt for any LLM model and generates you pages, you are not a writer.

Imagine a world where every blog has AI-generated copy, not that we are not almost in the middle of this, and every company can churn out half-baked music for their ads or social posts.

In that economy, a professional songwriter’s unique skill becomes as optional as knowing how to use a metronome.

You could ask Gemini for an “emotional indie ballad about a lost sock,” and voilà, you have something. Whether it has actual coherence or soul is left to the listener to decide. It is fun to use it with your friends, shorts, to impress your date.

Video: Gemini Lyria Music Generation Feature – Socks, uploaded by Google on YouTube

Still, Lyria 3’s music is capped at 30 seconds, and that’s no accident. It sidesteps deeper legal and ethical quarrels about training data and mimicry of existing works by keeping outputs short and legally fuzzy. That’s a thumbs up from me.

But even within that limit, it’s now possible for someone with no craft or cultural context to generate riffs, lyrics, and chord progressions that sound, to the casual ear, adequately musical. In an attention economy obsessed with shareability, “adequate” quickly becomes plenty.

This matters because real songs, the ones that endure, that carry human experience, aren’t just collections of musical atoms. They’re shaped by story, risk, cultural memory, and sometimes contradiction.

One of my favorite artists, Tom Waits, said, ”I don’t have a formal background. I learned from listening to records, from talking to people, from hanging around record stores, and hanging around musicians and saying, “Hey, how did you do that? Do that again. Let me see how you did that.”

This was the research and prompting before, and it’s not only about reducing time, or getting things faster, and “having more time for you.”

It’s about the entire process, the contact with other artists, humans, and IDEAS.

Those are qualities machines can mimic but not originate. When the machines own the first pass at creation, and the commercial ecosystem embraces that output because it is cheap and fast, the incentives shift. Not gradually. Suddenly.

The record industry is already grappling with AI. Streaming services, publishers, and even labels have begun experimenting with algorithmic playlists and automated composition.

What Gemini’s Lyria 3 does is extend that experiment to public perception. A whole generation may come to think that “making music” means typing a description and choosing a style. Songwriting becomes a UX problem, not a craft one.

That raises a serious question: in a world where AI can conjure up a half-decent hook on demand, what will distinguish professional artists?

If the answer is only brand story or marketing muscle, we aren’t celebrating creativity; we are monetising it out of existence.

Tech companies like Google will frame this as liberation. And in a literal sense, anyone who’s ever wanted to hear a short tune about a sock’s existential crisis now can. But liberation without value for the creator is just consumerism by another name.

Lyria 3 might be good for GIF soundtracks and social clips, and TikTok viral reels, but it doesn’t make professional musicians obsolete; it makes their work less necessary to the platforms that reward hyper-consumable content.

That’s a different threat from outright replacement: it’s obsolescence by trivialisation.

If AI is going to be part of musical creation, then let it be as an assistant to the composer,  someone who improves ideas, not replaces them. What we’re seeing with Gemini is not collaboration but outsourcing.

And the lesson for artists isn’t to fear the algorithm. It’s to insist on clarity about where AI replaces labour and where it augments human sensibility.

Because once the marketplace equates the two, the humans who do the work will be the ones left asking for royalties in a language no one else wants to speak.

And, as a personal recommendation, not sponsored, there are streaming platforms like Deezer that have built AI detection tools that flag and label AI-generated tracks, excluding them from recommendations and royalties so that human songwriters aren’t buried under synthetic spam, and consumers can make the difference between AI and human.

If you care about preserving real artistry in a world of text-to-tune generative models, start paying attention to how platforms handle AI-tagging and choose services that give you transparency about what you’re actually listening to.

Yet, I’m not here to throw shade at Lyria 3; if anything, the idea of letting people turn a photo or a mood into a short track sounds like fun for casual use and creative experimentation. It is what Google says it’s meant for.

Yet the reality is that as these models proliferate, we risk confusing novelty with art. And here, the big tech companies are not the ones to blame, but us.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Plato, a Berlin-based startup, has raised $14.5 million in seed funding to bring generative AI into wholesale distribution, a massive industry that rarely makes tech headlines but quietly moves a significant share of the world’s goods.

The round was led by Atomico, with Cherry Ventures, Discovery Ventures, and D11Z joining in.

Wholesale distribution accounts for roughly one-fifth of global production flows. Yet much of it still runs on aging ERP systems, Excel spreadsheets, and manual quoting workflows that haven’t meaningfully evolved in years.

While AI has flooded marketing, customer support, and coding, distribution sales teams are often still copy-pasting numbers between systems.

Plato’s thesis is simple: instead of adding another dashboard, embed AI directly into the operational core. The company connects to existing ERP systems and turns historical sales data into automated actions, flagging revenue opportunities, generating quotes, and identifying risks before they surface in quarterly reports.

The idea grew out of lived frustration. Co-founder Benedikt Nolte experienced the inefficiencies firsthand in his family’s distribution business. Generic CRM tools, he concluded, weren’t designed for the complexity of distributor operations. Plato was built specifically for that environment, not retrofitted from SaaS templates designed for startups.

Early traction suggests the industry is paying attention. Plato reportedly works with several large distributors on six-figure contracts, a sign that AI adoption in traditional sectors is less about hype and more about whether it can save time and unlock revenue.

The fresh capital will help Plato expand beyond sales intelligence into areas like procurement and customer service automation, while pushing into new European markets and eventually the U.S.

More broadly, the round highlights a shift in AI investing. The next wave isn’t just about bigger language models; it’s about embedding intelligence into industries that haven’t been rewritten by software yet. Wholesale distribution may not be glamorous, but it is structurally essential. If AI can modernize that layer of the economy, the impact will be far larger than another chatbot demo.

            <h2>David Silver is chasing superhuman intelligence with a $1bn seed</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">David Silver, a British AI researcher known for his role at Google’s DeepMind lab, has helped build some of the most influential AI systems and is now leading his own ambitious start-up. He is in the middle of raising a $1 billion seed round for his new London-based venture, Ineffable Intelligence.

If the fundraising will be completed, would be the largest seed round ever seen in Europe.

The round is being led by Sequoia Capital, with titans such as Nvidia, Google and Microsoft reportedly in talks to participate, according to industry sources familiar with the deal.

The proposed investment would place Ineffable Intelligence’s pre-money valuation at around $4 billion, an eye-watering figure for a company that hasn’t yet shipped a product.

David Silver’s name is synonymous with some of the most memorable milestones in AI. During more than a decade at Google DeepMind, he helped develop AlphaGo, the first AI to defeat a world champion at the ancient game of Go, and later AlphaStar, which bested professional players in StarCraft II.

His work has shaped how modern AI systems learn and make decisions.

In late 2025, David Silver left DeepMind, where he also contributed to the development of the Gemini family of large language models, to launch Ineffable Intelligence. .

In the current days billion-dollar seed rounds are no longer unheard of, but they remain exceptionally rare, especially in Europe.

If Sequoia and its partners follow through on their commitments, the round would serve as both a vote of confidence in David Silver’s vision and a broader signal that venture capitalists are increasingly willing to fund ambitious, research-driven AI ventures well before traditional product milestone

The sheer size of the potential round also reshapes the narrative around Europe’s role in the global AI race.

Historically, most of the industry’s capital and rich technical talent have gravitated to Silicon Valley and other U.S. hubs. A £737 million-plus round led by a top U.S. investor shows that world-class AI ideas can still attract world-class capital in Europe.

David Silver’s dual role – as an entrepreneur and as a professor at University College London,  hints at a blend of academic ambition and commercial pressure that may define the next era of AI innovation.

His thesis suggests that the path to genuinely powerful AI may not be simply scaling up models, but teaching systems to learn and improve through real-world experience, a direction he believes could outpace approaches grounded solely in data accumulated from human interactions.

Whether Ineffable Intelligence ultimately delivers on its lofty vision remains to be seen.

But the enthusiasm around its fundraising reflects a broader trend: AI is entering a phase where conviction in founders and ideas can translate directly into unprecedented capital flows.

For Europe, a successful $1 billion cap table would be a milestone moment, not just financially, but symbolically,  in positioning the continent as a contender for the future of AI research and deployment.
