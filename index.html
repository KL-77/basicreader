            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/fcc-asks-stations-for-pro-america-programming-like-daily-pledge-of-allegiance/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr today urged broadcasters to join a “Pledge America Campaign” that Carr established to support President Trump’s “Salute to America 250” project.

Carr said in a press release that “I am inviting broadcasters to pledge to air programming in their local markets in support of this historic national, non-partisan celebration.” The press release said Carr is asking broadcasters to “air patriotic, pro-America programming in support of America’s 250th birthday.”

Carr gave what he called examples of content that broadcasters can run if they take the pledge. His examples include “starting each broadcast day with the ‘Star Spangled Banner’ or Pledge of Allegiance”; airing “PSAs, short segments, or full specials specifically promoting civic education, inspiring local stories, and American history”; running “segments during regular news programming that highlight local sites that are significant to American and regional history, such as National Park Service sites”; airing “music by America’s greatest composers, such as John Philip Sousa, Aaron Copland, Duke Ellington, and George Gershwin”; and providing daily “Today in American History” announcements highlighting significant events from US history.

Carr apparently wants this to start now and last until at least July 4. Carr’s press release starts by touting Trump’s Salute to America 250 project and quotes a White House statement that said, “Under the President’s leadership, Task Force 250 has commenced the planning of a full year of festivities to officially launch on Memorial Day, 2025 and continue through July 4, 2026.”

That White House quote cited by the FCC today is nearly a year old, as you might have guessed by the reference to Memorial Day in 2025. More recently, Trump has said he wants the celebration to last throughout 2026. A Trump proclamation last month declared a “yearlong commemoration” of American independence that began on January 1, 2026.

Today’s FCC press release said, “Broadcasters can voluntarily choose to indicate their commitment to the Pledge America Campaign and highlight their ongoing and relevant programming to their viewing and listening audiences.” Although it’s described as voluntary, Carr said broadcasters can meet their public interest obligations by taking the pledge. This is notable because Carr has repeatedly threatened to punish broadcast stations for violating the public interest standard.

“I believe in the greatness of our country,” Carr said in the press release. “And I look forward to broadcasters showcasing its inspiring history by taking the Pledge and fulfilling their public interest mandate to serve the needs and interests of their local communities as America’s 250th birthday celebration marches on.”

Carr has enthusiastically backed Trump’s battles against the media by making numerous threats to revoke broadcast station licenses. Carr targeted ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel in September, and recently opened an investigation into ABC’s The View. In both cases, Carr said he was enforcing the FCC’s public interest standard.

Stephen Colbert said this week that CBS forbade him from interviewing Texas Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico because of Carr’s threat to ditch the FCC’s longstanding practice of exempting talk shows from the equal-time rule. CBS denied prohibiting the interview but acknowledged giving Colbert “legal guidance” about potential consequences under the equal-time rule. Carr responded Wednesday by claiming that Colbert lied and said the media “should feel a bit ashamed for having been lied to and then run with those lies.”

If Carr’s pledge is truly voluntary, there would be no reason to limit it to broadcasters, said Harold Feld, a longtime telecom attorney who is senior VP of consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. “If this were genuinely intended as voluntary, and genuinely about celebrating America, there is no reason to limit this to broadcasters,” Feld told Ars. “Cable operators are equally free to celebrate America, as are podcasters for that matter.”

The FCC’s lone Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, has been urging broadcasters to push back against the FCC and assert their First Amendment rights. She wrote in response to Carr’s Pledge America Campaign, “Nothing is more American than defending our constitutional rights against those who would erode our civil liberties. If broadcasters choose to participate in this FCC campaign, they can do so by defending their First Amendment rights and refusing government interference.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Meta announced today that it will divorce its Horizon Worlds social and gaming service—once promoted as the company’s first major step into the metaverse—from its Quest VR headset platform and digital store.

The company says it is now “shifting the focus of Worlds to be almost exclusively mobile.” The announcement is also filled with statements like “we’re doubling down on the VR developer ecosystem” that are attempting to head off any suggestion that Meta is retreating from the mixed reality space.

This is far from the first signal that big changes are happening with Meta’s mixed reality strategy. CNBC reported that Meta has lost $80 billion on investments in Reality Labs, the company’s mixed reality division. More than 1,000 Reality Labs employees were laid off in January, but don’t misread that as a total closure; more than 15,000 people were working in that part of the organization before the layoffs.

It’s also important to note that those layoffs reportedly did not affect many people working on augmented reality, the category Meta is exploring for future smart glasses. Many of the layoffs focused specifically on internal studios making VR content, games, and experiences.

Some of the changes—like the removal of individual worlds from the VR store—are presented by the company as efforts to make the store a better discovery platform for third-party developers.

In general, Meta frames many of its recent moves as a pivot away from first-party development of VR experiences to a focus on a third-party developer ecosystem, with stats like “86% of the effective time people spend in their VR headsets is with third-party apps.”

“We’ll continue to support the third-party community through strategic partnerships and targeted investments—as we have since the beginning,” writes Meta Reality Labs VP of Content Samantha Ryan.

Meta launched a Horizon Worlds mobile app last year and found it attracted an influx of new users interested in the service’s social gaming aspects, except for the VR element. It seems that the mobile launch was successful enough to merit focusing the entire service on that platform and audience, rather than shutting it down amid the other closures of internal content projects.

As far as we know, Meta plans to continue to design, make, and sell VR hardware and maintain the storefronts that third-party developers sell on for those platforms. It won’t make much content in-house, and you don’t see much talk about the promise of an all-encompassing, transformational metaverse anymore.

Instead, Meta’s speculative investment appears focused on smart glasses, as well as AI models, technologies, and applications.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/with-nih-in-chaos-its-controversial-director-is-taking-over-cdc-too/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health, is now also the acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an unusual arrangement that has drawn swift criticism from researchers and public health experts.

Bhattacharya’s new role comes amid a leadership shakeup in the Department of Health and Human Services under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It also marks the third leader for the beleaguered public health agency under Kennedy.

Susan Monarez, a microbiologist and long-time federal health official, held the position of acting director before becoming the first Senate-confirmed CDC director at the end of July. But she was in the role just shy of a month before Kennedy ousted her for—according to Monarez—refusing to rubber-stamp changes to vaccine recommendations made by Kennedy’s hand-picked advisors, who are overwhelmingly anti-vaccine themselves.

Jim O’Neill was then named acting director. At the time, O’Neill was the deputy secretary of HHS but had previously worked as a Silicon Valley investor and entrepreneur who became a close ally of Peter Thiel. As acting director of the CDC, he signed off on a dramatic overhaul of the CDC’s childhood vaccine recommendations.

Now, amid Kennedy’s shake-up, O’Neill is out of the CDC and, according to media reports, will be nominated to run the National Science Foundation, which is currently without a director or deputy director. As a health economist with a medical degree, Bhattacharya has more qualifications to temporarily run the CDC than O’Neill, but researchers and public health experts were quick to blast his apparent lack of leadership skills.

Under Bhattacharya’s watch, the NIH terminated or froze hundreds of millions of dollars for research grants, including $561 million in grants to research the four leading causes of death in America, according to a Senate report released earlier this month. At least 304 clinical trials were defunded. Of the NIH’s 27 institutes and centers, 16 are currently without directors, an unprecedented number of vacancies.

Insiders report that, as NIH director, Bhattacharya delegates most of his responsibilities for running the $47 billion agency to two top officials. Instead of a hands-on leader, Bhattacharya has become known for his many public interviews, earning him the nickname “Podcast Jay.”

Researchers expect that Bhattacharya will perform similarly at the helm of the CDC. Jenna Norton, an NIH program officer who spoke to the Guardian in her personal capacity, commented that Bhattacharya “won’t actually run the CDC. Just as he doesn’t actually run NIH.” His role for the administration, she added, “is largely as a propagandist.”

Jeremy Berg, former director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, echoed the sentiment to the Guardian. “Now, rather than largely ignoring the actual operations of one agency, he can largely ignore the actual operations of two,” he said.

Kayla Hancock, director of Public Health Watch, a nonprofit advocacy group, went further in a public statement, saying, “Jay Bhattacharya has overseen the most chaotic and rudderless era in NIH history, and for RFK Jr. to give him even more responsibility at the CDC is malpractice against the public health.”

Like other commenters, Hancock noted his apparent lack of involvement at the NIH and put it in the context of the current state of US public health. “This is the last person who should be overseeing the CDC at a time when preventable diseases like measles are roaring back under RFK Jr.’s deadly anti-vax agenda,” she said.

It is widely expected that Bhattacharya will, like O’Neill, act as a rubber-stamp for Kennedy’s relentless anti-vaccine agenda items. When Kennedy dramatically overhauled the CDC’s childhood vaccine schedule, slashing recommended vaccinations from 17 to 11 without scientific evidence, Bhattacharya was among the officials who signed off on the unprecedented change.

Ultimately, Bhattacharya will only be in the role for a short time, at least officially. The role of CDC director became a Senate-confirmed position in 2023, and, as such, an acting director can serve only 210 days from the date the role became vacant. That deadline comes up on March 25. President Trump has not nominated anyone to fill the director role.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/wikipedia-bans-archive-today-after-site-executed-ddos-and-altered-web-captures/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The English-language edition of Wikipedia is blacklisting Archive.today after the controversial archive site was used to direct a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a blog.

In the course of discussing whether Archive.today should be deprecated because of the DDoS, Wikipedia editors discovered that the archive site altered snapshots of webpages to insert the name of the blogger who was targeted by the DDoS. The alterations were apparently fueled by a grudge against the blogger over a post that described how the Archive.today maintainer hid their identity behind several aliases.

“There is consensus to immediately deprecate archive.today, and, as soon as practicable, add it to the spam blacklist (or create an edit filter that blocks adding new links), and remove all links to it,” stated an update today on Wikipedia’s Archive.today discussion. “There is a strong consensus that Wikipedia should not direct its readers towards a website that hijacks users’ computers to run a DDoS attack (see WP:ELNO#3). Additionally, evidence has been presented that archive.today’s operators have altered the content of archived pages, rendering it unreliable.”

More than 695,000 links to Archive.today are distributed across 400,000 or so Wikipedia pages. The archive site is commonly used to bypass news paywalls, and the FBI has sought information on the site operator’s identity with a subpoena to domain registrar Tucows.

“Those in favor of maintaining the status quo rested their arguments primarily on the utility of archive.today for verifiability,” said today’s Wikipedia update. “However, an analysis of existing links has shown that most of its uses can be replaced. Several editors started to work out implementation details during this RfC [request for comment] and the community should figure out how to efficiently remove links to archive.today.”

Guidance published as a result of the decision asked editors to help remove and replace links to the following domain names used by the archive site: archive.today, archive.is, archive.ph, archive.fo, archive.li, archive.md, and archive.vn. The guidance says editors can remove Archive.today links when the original source is still online and has identical content; replace the archive link so it points to a different archive site, like the Internet Archive, Ghostarchive, or Megalodon; or “change the original source to something that doesn’t need an archive (e.g., a source that was printed on paper), or for which a link to an archive is only a matter of convenience.”

The Wikipedia guidance points out that the Internet Archive and its website, Archive.org, are “uninvolved with and entirely separate from archive.today.” The Internet Archive is a nonprofit based in the US.

As we previously reported, malicious code in Archive.today’s CAPTCHA page was used to direct a DDoS against the Gyrovague blog written by a man named Jani Patokallio. The Archive.today maintainer demanded that Patokallio take down a 2023 blog post that discussed the archive site founder’s possible identity. Patokallio wasn’t able to determine who runs Archive.today but mentioned apparent aliases such as “Denis Petrov” and “Masha Rabinovich,” and described evidence that the site is operated by someone from Russia.

When we last wrote about this topic, the Archive.today maintainer told Ars Technica that it would not provide any comment on the Wikipedia discussion unless we removed references to Patokallio’s blog, which we did not do.

Patokallio told Ars today that he is pleased by the Wikipedia community’s decision. “I’m glad the Wikipedia community has come to a clear consensus, and I hope this inspires the Wikimedia Foundation to look into creating its own archival service,” he told us.

In emails sent to Patokallio after the DDoS began, “Nora” from Archive.today threatened to create a public association between Patokallio’s name and AI porn and to create a gay dating app with Patokallio’s name. These threats were discussed by Wikipedia editors in their deliberations over whether to blacklist Archive.today, and then editors noticed that Patokallio’s name had been inserted into some Archive.today captures of webpages.

“Honestly, I’m kind of in shock,” one editor wrote. “Just to make sure I’m understanding the implications of this: we have good reason to believe that the archive.today operator has tampered with the content of their archives, in a manner that suggests they were trying to further their position against the person they are in dispute with???”

“If this is true it essentially forces our hand, archive.today would have to go,” another editor replied. “The argument for allowing it has been verifiability, but that of course rests upon the fact the archives are accurate, and the counter to people saying the website cannot be trusted for that has been that there is no record of archived websites themselves being tampered with. If that is no longer the case then the stated reason for the website being reliable for accurate snapshots of sources would no longer be valid.”

One example discussed by Wikipedia editors involved Jani Patokallio’s name being inserted into an Archive.today capture of a blog post that was mentioned by Patokallio in his February 2026 write-up of the DDoS incident. This blog is related to the “Nora” alias used by the Archive.today maintainer, which now appears to be the name of an actual person.

“It appears increasingly likely that the identity of ‘Nora’ has been appropriated from an actual person, whose only connection to archive.today was a request to take down some content,” Patokallio wrote in an update to his blog today. “As a courtesy, I have redacted their last name from this post.”

Evidence presented in the Wikipedia discussion showed that Archive.today replaced Nora’s name with Patokallio’s name in the aforementioned blog post. The Archive.today capture has since been reverted to what appears to be the original version. In other cases, Archive.today captures included a “Comment as: Jani Patokallio” string on captures that previously had a “Comment as: Nora [last name redacted]” string.

Even if the snapshot alterations hadn’t helped convince Wikipedia’s volunteer editors to deprecate Archive.today, the Wikimedia Foundation itself might have stepped in. In its comments on the DDoS, the nonprofit that operates Wikipedia said on February 10 that it had not ruled out intervening due to “the seriousness of the security concern for people who click the links that appear across many wikis.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For a long time now, PC gamers have been used to the Final Fantasy series treating their platform as somewhat secondary to the game’s core console versions. There are some signs that may be starting to change, though, as director Naoki Hamaguchi has confirmed that the PC is now the “lead platform” for development of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy.

In a recent interview with Automaton, Hamaguchi clarified that the team takes the relatively common practice of creating visual assets for its multiplatform games by targeting “high-end environments first,” then performing a “reduction” for less powerful platforms. These days, that means “our 3D assets are created at the highest quality level based on PC as the foundation,” he said. Players have already noticed this graphical difference in the PC version of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Hamaguchi said, and “our philosophy will not change for the third installment.”

While PC gaming is only “gradually expanding in Japan,” Hamaguchi said the rapid growth in international PC gamers has led the company to “develop assets with the broad PC market in mind.”

The PC versions of recent Final Fantasy VII Remake games have sold well on Steam and the Epic Games Store, he added.

It’s unclear if that means PC gamers will have to wait longer than console owners for future Final Fantasy games. The first Final Fantasy VII Remake didn’t hit PCs until 19 months after the PlayStation 4 version, and Rebirth was first available on PC 11 months after its PS5 launch. Elsewhere in the franchise, the PC versions of both Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy XV didn’t hit until over a year after their console counterparts.

Elsewhere in the interview, Hamaguchi went into some detail about what he sees as the relative deficiencies of various game consoles. Compared to a high-end PC, for instance, Hamaguchi said he considers the PS5 and PS5 Pro “mid-range platforms” that require texture sizes, mesh loads, and polygon counts that are 1.5 to 3 times lower than the PC versions. Further down the line, the Steam Deck operates “at less than half the PS5’s baseline,” Hamaguchi said.

Further considerations are necessary for other consoles. On the PS4, Switch 2, and Xbox Series S, for instance, Hamaguchi said the relative limitations of the CPU generally require limiting graphics to 30 fps (rather than the 60 fps on high-end platforms), as well as reducing the number of NPCs that can appear in a town when compared to higher-end systems. Hamaguchi also specifically called out the memory limitations on the Xbox Series S, which requires specific optimizations compared to the “ample memory” available on the Switch 2.

Development of the third part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy is “progressing very smoothly,” Hamaguchi said, and the team is currently “almost exactly on schedule” with planned development milestones.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/new-dates-on-chinese-fossils-raise-question-of-how-many-times-we-left-africa/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Two skulls from Yunxian, in northern China, aren’t ancestors of Denisovans after all; they’re actually the oldest known Homo erectus fossils in eastern Asia.

A recent study has re-dated the skulls to about 1.77 million years old, which makes them the oldest hominin remains found so far in East Asia. Their age means that Homo erectus (an extinct common ancestor of our species, Neanderthals, and Denisovans) must have spread across the continent much earlier and much faster than we’d previously given them credit for. It also sheds new light on who was making stone tools at some even older archaeological sites in China.

Yunxian is an important—and occasionally contentious—archaeological site on the banks of central China’s Han River. Along with hundreds of stone tools and animal bones, the layers of river sediment have yielded three nearly complete hominin skulls (only two of which have been described in a publication so far). Shantou University paleoanthropologist Hua Tu and his colleagues measured the ratio of two isotopes, aluminum-26 and beryllium-10, in grains of quartz from the sediment layer that once held the skulls. The results suggest that Homo erectus lived and died along the Han River 1.77 million years ago. That’s just 130,000 years after the species first appeared in Africa.

(Side note: This river has been depositing layers of silt and gravel on the same terraces for at least 2 million years, and that’s just extremely cool.)

The revised date suggests that Homo erectus spread across Asia much more quickly than anthropologists had realized. So far, the oldest hominin bones found anywhere outside Africa are five skulls, along with hundreds of other bones, from Dmanisi Cave in Georgia. The Dmanisi bones are between 1.85 million and 1.77 million years old, and they (probably—more on that below) also belong to Homo erectus.

Until recently, the next-oldest Homo erectus fossils outside Africa were the 1.63-million-year-old fossils from another Chinese site, Gongwangling, a short distance north of Yunxian. (That’s not counting a couple of teeth from a site in southern China with an age that is a little less certain.) Those dates had suggested Homo erectus seemed to have taken a leisurely 140,000 years to spread east into Asia. But it now looks like hominins were living in Georgia and central China at about the same time, which means they spread out very fast, started earlier than we knew, or both.

All of this means that the Yunxian skulls are probably not—as a September 2025 study claimed—close ancestors of the enigmatic Denisovans. The authors of that paper had digitally reconstructed one of the skulls and concluded that it looked a lot like a 146,000-year-old skull from Harbin, China (which a recent DNA study identified as a Denisovan, also known as Homo longi).

The researchers had argued that the original owners of the Yunxian skulls had lived not long after the Denisovan/Homo longi branch of the hominin family tree split off from ours—in other words, that the Yunxian skulls weren’t mere Homo erectus but early Homo longi, close cousins of our own species. Using the original paleomagnetic dates for the Yunxian skulls, that study’s authors drew up a hominin family tree in which our species and Denisovans are more closely related to each other than either is to Neanderthals—one in which the branching happened much earlier than DNA evidence suggests.

There were many issues with those arguments, but the revised age for the Yunxian skulls sounds like a death knell for them. “1.77 million years is just too old to be a credible connection to the Denisovan group, which DNA tells us got started after around 700,000 years ago,” University of Wisconsin paleoanthropologist John Hawks, who was not involved in the study, told Ars in an email.

But the most interesting thing about these skulls being 1.77 million years old is that the date provides a reference point for understanding even older sites in China—sites that may suggest that Homo erectus wasn’t even the first hominin to make it this far.

Homo erectus first shows up in the fossil record around 1.9 million years ago in Africa, where it’s sometimes also called Homo ergaster because paleoanthropologists seem to enjoy naming things and then arguing about those names for several decades. A few hundred thousand years later, Homo erectus showed up everywhere: from South Africa northward to the Levant and from Dmanisi Cave in Georgia eastward to the islands of Indonesia.

We typically think of Homo erectus as the first of our hominin ancestors to expand beyond Africa, along routes that our own species would retread 1.5 million years later. More to the point, many paleoanthropologists think of them as the first hominin that could have adapted to so many different environments, each with its own challenges, along the way.

But we may need to give earlier members of our genus, like Homo habilis, a little more credit because stone tools from two other sites in China seem to be older than Homo erectus. At Shangchen, a site on the southern edge of China’s Loess Plateau, archaeologists unearthed stone tools from a 2.1-million-year-old layer of sediment. And at the Xihoudu site in northern China, stone tools date to 2.43 million years ago.

“If you have a site in China that’s 2.43 million years, and the origin of Homo erectus is 1.9 million years ago, either you need to push the origin of Homo erectus back to 2.5 or 2.6 million years or we need to accept that we need to be looking at other hominins that may have actually moved out of Africa,” University of Hawai’i at Manoa paleoanthropologist Christopher Bae, a coauthor of the new study, told Ars.

Archaeologists have unearthed stone tools but no hominin fossils at both sites, making it difficult to say for sure who the toolmakers were. But if they weren’t Homo erectus, the next most likely suspects would be older members of our genus, like Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis. That would mean hominin expansion “out of Africa” actually happened several times during the history of our genus: once with early Homo, again with Homo erectus, and yet again with our species.

“There could have been an earlier wave that died out or interbred, so there’s all kinds of possibilities open there,” Purdue University paleoanthropologist Darryl Granger, also a coauthor of the recent study, told Ars.

In fact, there’s some debate about whether the Dmanisi fossils actually belonged to Homo erectus proper. One thing the two dueling reconstructions of the Yunxian skulls agree on is that those hominins had flattish faces, more like ours—and like the 1.63-million-year-old Homo erectus skull from Gongwangling. But the Dmanisi hominins’ lower faces project dramatically forward, like those of older hominins.

Some paleoanthropologists classify the Dmanisi fossils as their own species, but others argue they’re more like early members of our genus, such as Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis. Those earlier hominins may have been more capable of migrating and adapting than we’ve realized.

It’s still very clear, from both fossil and genetic evidence, that our species evolved in Africa and spread from there to the rest of the world. But it’s also increasingly clear that there were several other species of hominins in other places, doing other things, at least off and on, for a very long time before we showed up. Yunxian, and its revised age, could help anthropologists better understand part of that story.

“Actually being able to anchor the Homo erectus sites with firm, solid dates helps us try to reconfigure this model,” said Bae. “This is where Yunxian really plays a major role in this. Now that we’ve got older dates to anchor the Yunxian Homo erectus fossils, I think we can really bring in this discussion with Xihoudu and Shangchen.”

The answers may still lie buried—maybe just a few meters below the fossil skulls and stone tools at sites like Yunxian and Gongwangling, in older sediment layers. Archaeologists may not have seen a reason to explore these, since no one lived in China before 1.7 million years ago. The age of the Yunxian skulls, along with the even older stone tools at Shangchen and Xihoudu, may warrant deeper digging.

“People haven’t been looking for artifacts and fossils in two-plus million-year-old sediments in these locations in China,” said Granger. “I can think of places that I would like to go back and look if I had more time and money.”

At other sites, researchers have already unearthed fossil animal bones from the same age range as China’s oldest stone tools, but paleoanthropologists haven’t double-checked whether any of those bones might belong to early hominins rather than other mammals. Bae said, “It’s just that they haven’t been receiving any attention, or not enough attention.”

            <div id="article-text">Stuffing an AI chatbot into a consumer electronics device and turning out with a product people actually want has proven extremely difficult.

We’ve come across creepy and widely-hated pendants designed to listen to everything you say, as well as flawed AI “pins” that turned out to be a flaming dumpster fire, leading to frustration and disbelief.

Now Sam Altman’s OpenAI, which recruited former Apple design lead Jony Ive to lead its own hardware effort, is gearing up to release its would-be showstopper — and alas, it doesn’t sound like it’s managed to iterate beyond “clunky gadget that pretty much does stuff your phone already does.”

As The Information reports, a team of over 200 employees has been working on a smart speaker that features a built-in camera, which will recognize faces and identify objects thanks to a dose of AI. It will reportedly retail for anywhere from $200 and $300 and ship no earlier than the beginning of next year.

That’s right: the best idea that the big brains at OpenAI could cook up is yet another “household gadget that talks to you” — without a single clear differentiating feature from the phone you already have in your pocket, which can already run every major chatbot.

The company is also reportedly working on a “smart lamp” — but whether OpenAI is actually looking to bring it to market, let alone if such a product could conjure any enthusiasm among consumers, remains unclear.

It’s a critical juncture for OpenAI as it continues to explore potential revenue streams to stop hemorrhaging billions of dollars a quarter. The company is already turning to ads to bring in some much-needed revenue, despite Altman having previously characterized them as a “last resort.”

Even just a smart speaker may be difficult to bring to the market. In October, the Financial Times reported that OpenAI’s partnership with Ive was encountering “technical issues,” delaying the first product’s release date from last year to this year. Considering the latest news, problems may continue to haunt the company as the release date continues to slip.

Other attempts at AI hardware have struggled to gain much traction, even with significant resources. Amazon’s AI-powered Alexa, which was launched in a barely half-working state last year, hasn’t really moved the needle.

Besides technical hiccups, OpenAI will have to tread carefully when it comes to user privacy. Marketing a device designed to ingest and analyze vast amounts of potentially intimate data isn’t exactly straightforward.

Consumers are already growing wary of AI, fearing that it’s ushering in a new era of surveillance. Case in point, Amazon’s home security subsidiary Ring completely missed the mark with its Super Bowl ad earlier this month, which showed off a new function that lets its security camera feeds scan an entire neighborhood.

Netizens criticized the ad as being “Orwellian,” leading some customers to reportedly disconnect and destroy their Ring cameras.

How users will react to an OpenAI smart speaker remains to be seen. But considering the many missed attempts we’ve come across so far, the company has a lot to prove.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Twitter founder Jack Dorsey is running into some serious issues while overhauling his financial services company, Block.

Earlier this month, the company started laying off its staff as part of what Bloomberg characterized as an “efficiency push,” potentially affecting up to ten percent of the company’s workforce.

It’s been a painful, drawn-out process that could drag on for weeks, sources told Wired, triggering major anxiety over job security.

“We don’t yet know if our livelihoods will be affected, and this makes it incredibly hard to make major life choices without knowing if we still have a job next week,” an employee said during a recent all-hands meeting, as quoted by Wired.

“Morale is probably the worst I’ve felt in four years,” another employee wrote. “The overarching culture at Block is crumbling.”

The comments highlight persistent concerns being felt by many workers as generative AI continues to be cited by executives as they cut headcounts.

For Dorsey, AI has clearly been top of mind. Block staffers are now obligated to use AI, an order that has led to frustration.

“Top-down mandates to use large language models are crazy,” one employee told Wired. “If the tool were good, we’d all just use it.”

They’re also required to send weekly update emails to him, echoing Elon Musk’s DOGE requirement for federal staffers to summarize five weekly achievements in emails. (The requirement was mostly ignored, months before DOGE largely crumbled.)

Dorsey then reportedly uses generative AI to summarize his staffers’ emails. During the all-hands meeting, he noted that “performance anxiety” and “widespread concerns about layoffs” were clearly vexing staff.

Dorsey seemingly did little to address these anxieties, accusing fired staffers of “phoning it in.” Block’s engineering lead, Arnaud Weber, also said that the firings were performance-related.

The company’s woes are symptomatic of a familiar story playing out at many other tech companies. Workers are facing immense pressure as their employers implement AI at all costs, forcing them to adopt the tech whether they like it or not.

Researchers have found that the tech isn’t reducing workloads at all, but intensifying them instead, a concerning trend that’s already leading to “AI burnout.”

The psychological effects also have experts worried. Researchers recently found that the continuing threat of being made redundant due to AI automation is manifesting in symptoms among workers including anxiety, insomnia, paranoia, and loss of identity.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Depending on who you ask, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is either the most sophisticated weapons platform ever built, or an $80 million disaster that’s too fragile for rain and its namesake lightning. What it definitely is, Dutch defense secretary Gijs Tuinman insists, is jailbreakable — “just like an iPhone.”

In an episode of the Danish podcast Boekestijn en De Wijk show, translated from Dutch by the Register, Tuinman suggested that the incredibly expensive F-35s could be maintained by European armies with or without support from the US.

“The F-35 is truly a shared product,” Tuinman told the interviewer. “The British make the Rolls-Royce engines, and the Americans simply need them too. And even if this mutual dependency doesn’t result in software updates, the F-35, in its current state, is still a better aircraft than other types of fighters.”

That being the case, he continued, “if you still want to upgrade despite everything — I’m going to say something I should never say, but I will anyway — you can jailbreak an F-35 just like an iPhone.”

Tuinman didn’t elaborate, and the Register didn’t receive any elaboration. Still, his comments reveal a fascinating anxiety between US arms manufacturers like Lockheed and European military.

Per the Register, the F-35 Lightning II gets routine software updates from Lockheed through a proprietary Automatic Logistics Information System, which pushes updates to the entire fleet every year or two. (Think of it like an expensive iOS update.)

Though European militaries might own the physical planes, the US controls the software. If Washington decides to stop sending updates — perhaps in retaliation for trade tariffs or an unfavorable deal on Greenland — there’s an implied threat that the Dutch air force will essentially be left with some very expensive bricks on the runway.

While it remains to be seen if Tuinman knows of some secret backdoor hack for the F-35, jailbreaking a world-class fighter jet is almost certainly easier said than done. Still, with fears from European countries that the US could remotely disable European fleets with a “kill switch,” it wouldn’t exactly be a bad time for the Dutch to start cracking the F-35’s codes.

            <h2>As Epstein Scandal Tightens, Trump Announces That He’s Releasing All Government Files About Alien Life</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://futurism.com/future-society/epstein-scandal-trump-files-alien-life">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">President Donald Trump has plenty of work to do to distract from a growing list of crises, from the release of the Epstein files, many of which have implicated him, to a brewing battle with the Supreme Court, which just declared his tariffs illegal.

Now, Trump has found the next carrot to dangle: aliens.

In a Thursday evening post on Truth Social, Trump said that based “on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs).” (What the difference between UAPs and UFOs is unclear, as the former term has conventionally been used by government officials to refer to the latter.)

Naturally, the surprising announcement — which likely caught many government officials off guard — was accompanied by Trump taking potshots at his predecessor, accusing former president Barack Obama of revealing “classified” information, referencing Obama’s claim that aliens “are real” during a podcast appearance last week.

When asked by YouTuber Bryan Tyler Cohen if aliens are indeed real during a “lightning round” segment, Obama demurred.

“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them. And they’re not being kept in — what is it? — Area 51.”

“There’s no underground facility unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,” he added.

Days later, Obama further clarified in an NBC News interview that he had seen “no evidence” of aliens, suggesting Trump may have woefully misinterpreted his remarks.

Whether anything will come of Trump’s theatrical promise to direct his agencies to release files on “alien and extraterrestrial life” remains uncertain as ever. The topic of UAPs has gotten plenty of media attention in the last couple of years, culminating in several releases of UFO documents throughout the Biden administration. One hotly anticipated declassified report, which was released in June 2021, turned out to be largely disappointing, further underlining that the US government still has no idea what had caused several high-profile UAP sightings, which were revealed in 2017 in an exposé by the New York Times.

The Pentagon has also been trickling out documents acknowledging its interest in these sightings for many years now.

In short, it remains entirely unclear what other documents government agencies may still be holding on to or whether we’ll actually learn anything new.

What’s far more likely is that Trump continues to desperately try to control the narrative — as even Republicans are getting tired of his antics.

“They’ve deployed the ultimate weapon of mass distraction, but the Epstein files aren’t going away… even for aliens,” representative Thomas Massie (R-KY) tweeted.

            <div id="article-text">Bitcoin is struggling to regain the momentum it had in 2025, the first year of Trump’s extremely crypto-friendly administration.

The token is still hovering around the $67,000 mark, a major loss compared to its October all-time high of just under twice that. It has experienced its worst-ever start to a year, dropping 24 percent in the first 50 days of the year.

That tooth-rattling downturn has certain critics predicting a total collapse, suggesting its value could eventually plunge to zero dollars — a controversial stance that’s sparked a fierce debate. Proponents argue the core fundamentals haven’t changed at all, and that Bitcoin’s demise was the result of major macroeconomic uncertainty, questionable Federal Reserve policy, and major selloffs triggered by fears over a growing AI bubble.

Critics, however, point to Bitcoin becoming untethered from the value of gold, an identity crisis undermining its long-touted role as a “digital gold” safe haven for investors.

It’s a conundrum that has spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt — or FUD, a popular term in crypto circles. As one viral post on X pointed out, Google Trends has shown a major uptick for the queries “Bitcoin going to zero” and “Is Bitcoin dead?”

As Decrypt points out, the “Crypto Fear and Greed Index,” a metric that’s designed to reflect the broader crypto market sentiment, has since swung to “extreme fear,” hitting its lowest mark since 2019.

For what it’s worth, users on the prediction betting platform Polymarket are also far more prone to believe that Bitcoin will hit $60,000 before recovering to $80,000.

But the claim that the coin could indeed crash down to zero, effectively wiping out all of its value, remains widely contested. If you believe Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, it’s all uphill from here.

“We may be in the middle of a crypto winter, but spring is coming — and Bitcoin is winning,” he tweeted earlier this week.

“If it’s not going to zero, it’s going to a million,” he added in a separate post today.

Skeptics, however, are far more pessimistic about Bitcoin’s chances in the long run, saying the crypto has lost its way.

“After more than 15 years of bitcoin, we’re no closer to knowing what its point is,” argued Globe and Mail investment reporter Tim Shuffelt. “There is no story behind bitcoin any more. It’s not even clear why it has had such a calamitous few months at the precise moment the Trump administration was supposed to be ushering in a golden age of crypto.”

Others predict Bitcoin will slide to $50,000 before making any recovery.

“I think we are going to see more pain and a final capitulation period for digital asset prices in the next few months,” Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, told The Block.

Michael Burry, who famously shorted the US housing market before its collapse in 2008, also warned that if Bitcoin were to crash even further, it could result in a “death spiral.”

If critics are to be believed, Bitcoin’s losses are only getting started as more people start to question its role as an untethered, highly speculative, and volatile asset. But Bitcoin has recovered from major crashes many times before, and a recovery is still far from being out of the question.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Eventually, it seems to turn out that every consumer product is killing you — from cooking utensils to menstrual care products, and literally the kitchen sink. Now, one of our most beloved creature comforts is getting its own heel turn.

A new analysis by the European Union-funded ToxFree Life for All project took a look at 81 headphone models from producers around the world. The results were pretty grim: every single model tested contained substances considered hazardous to humans, including bisphenols, phthalates, and flame retardants. Not even premium brands like Bose and Sennheiser received a clean bill of health, culminating in what ToxFree calls a “complete market failure.”

Most alarmingly, researchers found Bisphenol A — an industrial chemical linked to infertility, obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes — in 177 of the 180 total samples taken from the 81 devices.

“These chemicals are not just additives; they may be migrating from the headphones into our body,” Karolína Brabcová, a chemical researcher with ToxFree told the Guardian. “Daily use — especially during exercise when heat and sweat are present — accelerates this migration directly to the skin.”

Per Brabcová, the chemicals don’t pose an “immediate health risk,” so it’s not like your ears are about to fall off. The real danger here comes from long-term exposure to the “chemical cocktail” present in headphones, especially for vulnerable groups like expectant mothers or young children. “There is no ‘safe’ level for endocrine disruptors that mimic our natural hormones,” as Brabcová explained.

“Given the prolonged skin contact associated with headphone use, dermal exposure represents a relevant pathway, and it is reasonable to assume that similar migration of BPA and its substitutes may occur from headphone components directly to the user’s skin,” the researchers wrote in their report.

This is why, despite finding relatively low traces of most chemicals in the tested headphones, the researchers are using their findings as a rallying cry to call for sweeping bans on endocrine-disrupting chemicals in consumer products. Though chemicals like BPAs are selectively banned in the EU, critical loopholes remain that allow the substances to re-enter the market through recycled plastics.

“We urge EU policymakers to abandon the ‘substance-by-substance’ approach and implement comprehensive bans on chemical classes to prevent regrettable substitution and ensure safety is a market standard, not a consumer burden,” the researchers concluded.

Scott Rogowsky is a comedian — he knows how to make fun of himself. That’s how he ended up roaming New York City Comic Con with his own photo printed out like a “Wanted” poster, filming himself asking strangers, “Have you seen this man?”

These passersby showed a flicker of recognition, looking at the tall, bearded man like someone they had known in a past life, but couldn’t quite place.

“You look familiar! Where do I know you from?” someone asks, as though Rogowsky could be a friend of a friend they had met at a party.

“I know your face,” another person says, staring thoughtfully at the 41-year-old.

A cosplayer dressed as a Ghostbuster finally figures it out.

“Did you used to do that game show online?” he asks. “Like, every night?”

Rogowsky was just poking fun at himself, embracing the persona of a washed-up internet sensation. “I know my place,” he tells TechCrunch. “I’m not walking around like everybody’s supposed to know who I am.”

Rogowsky was once the face of HQ Trivia, an app that exploded into popular culture, then faded out of the public consciousness almost as fast. Between 2017 and 2019, Rogowsky hosted the live mobile game show twice a day. At its peak, it drew more than 2.4 million daily viewers each night. It garnered 20 million lifetime downloads.

Now the comedian is back with an app of his own called Savvy, which shares a lot of the DNA of HQ. Savvy’s first game, TextSavvy, is a daily live game show where players can earn cash — only this time, viewers are competing against Rogowsky in a word puzzle game that’s something like a hybrid of The New York Times’ Wordle and Connections, rather than trivia.

“I believe this is my calling in a weird way,” Rogowsky says. “I get up there in front of that camera, there’s thousands of people watching at home — millions, back in the HQ days — and it just flows.”

HQ Trivia was founded by the creators of Vine — the short-video platform that predated TikTok — and became a genuine cultural sensation. National news channels ran stories about office workers dropping everything in the middle of the day to play HQ at 3 p.m. It was groundbreaking — appointment entertainment in a new format for the streaming era — until the company imploded in a barrage of unfortunate circumstances.

One founder, Colin Kroll, died of a drug overdose; the other founder, Rus Yusupov, was a divisive leader who clashed with his staff. He once threatened a journalist that he would fire Rogowsky if she published an interview with Rogowsky where he mentioned liking Sweetgreen salads (Yusupov apparently didn’t want to give the fast-food chain free publicity). Most of all, HQ Trivia fell victim to the same trap that dooms so many startups. The company had raised a $15 million funding round at a $100 million valuation, but it was — quite literally — giving away money, and it never developed a meaningful plan to monetize or build a sustainable business model. The company ultimately filed for bankruptcy in February 2020, with its demise later becoming fodder for dramatic documentaries and true-crime-adjacent podcasts dissecting how such a promising app failed so spectacularly.

This was, understandably, a real blow for Rogowsky. But more bad luck followed. A baseball superfan, Rogowsky had left HQ Trivia in 2019 for a job hosting a daily MLB Network show. He felt like he finally made it — he still lights up recalling running into Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Martinez in the bathroom. But his show was canceled when the pandemic shut down baseball. He tried a handful of times over the years to recreate a company like HQ, but it was a journey of false starts.

“Crazy s–t happened that I had no control over, and I felt like I was being tossed and turned on this raft in the ocean, just getting battered by things I can’t control, and that was sort of my attitude about life in general,” he says.

He considered himself retired from show business and opened a vintage store in California. But he missed comedy.

“I went through this very meaningful personal transformation in the last couple of years,” he said. That process culminated in a seven-day mountain retreat called “the Hoffman Process,” a program that he describes as a digital detox combining lessons in psychology and neuroscience that helped him “take control of [his] life again.”

“It gave me a lot of clarity to say, you know what, I have more to do here,” Rogowsky says. “I got out of that retreat and I was like, ‘I have something to say. People find me funny and entertaining. I find myself funny and entertaining.’”

People tuned into HQ Trivia for the prospect of winning a cash prize, but the odds of winning were slim. Millions of viewers came back each night because of Rogowsky’s quick wit and charm, which earned him a cult following of fans who still call him “Quiz Daddy.”

“From the psychological, emotional side, I couldn’t really process what was going on,” Rogowsky says, reflecting on his viral fame. “And in the seven humbling years since, I have a vastly new perspective… I have my fanbase, I have my core followers right here. They’re on board with me, and it’s a matter of getting the word out.”

Rogowsky received a lot of messages over the years from people who wanted to help him build the next HQ. But last year, a direct message on X from European game designer Johan de Jager grabbed his attention.

“The idea was the host plays against the audience, so it’s like a two-way interaction,” Rogowsky says. “Imagine HQ if I wasn’t just asking the questions but also answering [them]… That adds another layer to it that no one had thought of before.”

But in the age of AI, where players can easily look up answers, Rogowsky was skeptical that a trivia game could work fairly, so Savvy embraced word puzzles instead.

The most that Savvy has paid out in a single game is around $400 — small compared to HQ’s occasional six-figure prize pools. That’s because Rogowsky and his co-founders are funding the company themselves.

“Look, I know this isn’t the thousands of dollars that you saw on HQ, the hundreds of thousands that we eventually got to,” Rogowsky said on one recent TextSavvy broadcast. “But the difference is HQ was funded by venture capital. They had $8 million in the bank to start. They got another $15 million from other venture capitalists. We don’t got that… This is a low-budge operashe because I’m paying for it!”

Rogowsky says he has spoken with investors about Savvy and even gotten some enticing offers. But venture backing often comes with pressure on founders to maximize returns as fast as they can, a model that can set a business up to fail, as HQ demonstrated.

“People want to 10x and 100x [their investment]… I’d be very happy to get to a point of profitability, to where we can just keep growing the company, keep hiring more people, keep making more games,” Rogowsky says. “I’m not looking for some type of eight-figure, nine-figure exit. This is what I want to do. I’m going to do this as long as I continue to wake up every morning and say, ‘Goddamn, I’m excited to get up there in front of that camera and have fun.’”

TextSavvy is currently running a “Season 0,” a soft launch that allows the team to work through technical kinks before formally launching on March 1. So far, without much promotion, TextSavvy has peaked at about 4,000 viewers in one night.

That’s not much compared to the HQ days. Then again, when TechCrunch first wrote about HQ, the app only had about 3,300 concurrent viewers. Who’s to say Savvy can’t do it again?

“We’re not going anywhere this time,” Rogowsky said. “There’s no one to fire me. There’s no drama, there’s no tension. There’s not going to be a documentary about Savvy the way there was about HQ.”

Late last year, New York Assembly member Alex Bores became the target of a campaign by a pro-AI super PAC to thwart his congressional bid. The group, Leading the Future, is armed with more than $100 million from backers including Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI President Greg Brockman, AI search startup Perplexity, and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale.

Bores’ response was simple: bring it on. Now, he’s got the muscle to back that challenge up.

Public First Action, a PAC backed by a $20 million donation from Anthropic, is spending $450,000 to boost Bores in the race for New York’s 12th congressional district, reports Bloomberg. Like its rival, the committee is pro-AI, but it’s pitching a different vision, one centered on transparency, safety standards, and public oversight.

Meanwhile, the industry-backed PAC, Leading the Future, has already poured $1.1 million into ads attacking Bores, largely because he sponsored New York’s RAISE Act, which requires major AI developers to disclose safety protocols and report serious misuse of their systems.

Apple this week released the latest version of its mobile operating system, iOS 26.4, which introduces several new features, including an AI-powered playlist-generation feature in Apple Music, support for video content in the Podcasts app, end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for RCS messages, and more.

The update is currently available in pubic beta, with the public release expected sometime in March or April.

One of the most noticeable improvements arrives in Apple Music — iOS 26.4 introduces a new AI-powered “Playlist Playground” feature that leverages Apple Intelligence. The feature allows users to generate a custom 25-song playlist from a text prompt, such as “upbeat workout mix” or “calm evening.” Users can then further refine the results and even select matching cover art.

In addition, Apple Music’s user interface has been refreshed to showcase full-screen artwork for albums and playlists.

Plus, Apple Music is getting a new “Concerts Near You” section that helps users discover live shows from their favorite artists. You can filter this section by Date and Genre, or switch locations if you’re traveling.

Following Spotify’s push into video, Apple’s Podcasts app is making it easy to switch back and forth between audio and video episodes with this release. Creators can publish video podcasts using HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), and listeners can seamlessly switch between audio and video playback within the same episode, moving to a full horizontal display if they choose.

At launch, the video episodes will be integrated with other Apple Podcasts features, like personalized recommendations and editorial curation on the New tab and Category pages, just as audio podcasts are.

HLS also brings an automatic quality adjustment feature, which helps videos play better whether listeners are on Wi-Fi or cellular. Plus, users will be able to download video episodes for offline viewing. At launch, HLS is supported by Acast, Amazon’s ART19, Triton’s Omny Studio, and SiriusXM, including SiriusXM Media, AdsWizz, and Simplecast.

Creators will be able to dynamically insert video ads, including host-read spots, into their podcasts, too. Apple doesn’t charge creators to distribute podcasts, but it says that, starting later this year, participating ad networks will have to pay an impression-based fee for the delivery of the dynamic ads in the HLS videos.

Messaging is also receiving an important upgrade with encrypted Rich Communication Services (RCS), which begins testing in iOS 26.4. End-to-end encryption for RCS conversations will one day help ensure messages between iPhone users and Android users are just as secure as iMessage.

Currently, Apple is only testing this between iPhones in beta. These conversations will be labeled as encrypted and cannot be read while sent between devices. The company notes that the feature will be released publicly in a later software update for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS, and the beta is not available for all devices and carriers.

Security improvements are another highlight of iOS 26.4. Stolen Device Protection is now enabled by default, adding an extra layer of biometric authentication for sensitive actions such as accessing saved passwords or making certain account changes. By requiring Face ID or Touch ID authentication in more scenarios, Apple reduces the risk of unauthorized access if a device is stolen and the passcode is compromised.

Drivers using Apple CarPlay will also notice changes. CarPlay now supports in-car video playback for select apps — including the Apple TV app —but only when the vehicle is parked to ensure safety. This enhancement introduces new entertainment options for passengers when they’re stopped or while waiting in the car for a period of time. (Hooray for parents in the pickup line at school!)

CarPlay for the first time will offer access to third-party AI services like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude.

Meanwhile, the Camera app introduces Audio Zoom. When recording video, the microphone focuses on the subject as you zoom in, reducing background noise and enhancing clarity. This feature makes it easier to capture speeches, performances, or interviews without external audio equipment.

Additionally, the Ambient Music feature is now accessible through a widget, letting users instantly play soundscapes designed for focus, sleep, or relaxation directly from the Home Screen, instead of just the Control Center as before. The feature, first introduced in iOS 18.4, added a variety of ambient sounds to stream across categories like Sleep, Chill, Productivity, and Wellbeing.

There’s also a new “Urgent” section in the Reminders app that groups high-priority tasks and can trigger more prominent alerts when deadlines approach. Setting a reminder as Urgent will add an alarm so you’re sure not to miss the event.

A few other smaller features include the following:

Notably absent from this release is a next-generation Siri experience. While Apple has signaled deeper AI ambitions for its voice assistant, those larger changes do not appear in iOS 26.4, reportedly delayed once again.

Even without a background in accounting, anyone who has ever glanced at a 10-K or 10-Q can tell that preparing financial statements is a complex, tedious process.

While legacy platforms like Workiva and Donnelley Financial Solutions aim to streamline financial reporting, longtime accountants Mary Antony (pictured right) and Kelsey Gootnick (pictured center) found themselves exhausted by various manual hurdles within these tools (co-founder and CTO Jared Tibshraeny is pictured left).

The duo met seven years ago at Flexport, where Gootnick served as the company’s controller and Antony served as assistant controller. They stayed in touch even after Antony moved to Miro and Gootnick to Hopin and later Thrive Global.

No matter where they worked, Antony and Gootnick kept running into the same manual challenges.

“The way financial statements come together, it’s just patched together in a lot of spreadsheets, moved into a bunch of Word documents, emailed back and forth between people,” Antony told TechCrunch.

So, in 2023, the pair decided to launch InScope, an AI-powered financial reporting platform that helps companies and accounting firms automate many aspects of the financial statement preparation process. The startup just raised $14.5 million in Series A funding led by Norwest, with participation from Storm Ventures and existing backers Better Tomorrow Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners.

While InScope isn’t fully automating the generation of income statements and balance sheets yet, it automates a vast amount of the manual busy work, from verifying math to formatting. Simply ensuring that dollar signs and commas are uniform and correctly placed can save accountants up to 20% of their time, according to Antony, InScope’s CEO.

Over the last 12 months, InScope has grown its customer base by 5x, attracting significant accounting firms such as CohnReznick, currently ranked in the top 15 nationally.

Of course, it may be a while before accountants — a profession Antony describes as risk-averse — feel comfortable letting AI fully automate financial statement preparation. Nonetheless, that remains InScope’s ultimate goal.

Norwest partner Sean Jacobsohn told TechCrunch that he invested in InScope after he heard from multiple clients that the startup’s product saves them a lot of time.

Jacobsohn is convinced that InScope stands out because few founders possess the specific expertise required to reinvent financial reporting technology.

“It’s a very complex space, and you need to be able to have been in the shoes of the buyer before,” he said.

Antony agrees that accountants are not typically the type to launch startups. Fortunately, she and Gootnick developed their entrepreneurial instincts through years of operating within the fast-paced cultures of other high-growth startups.

Different AI labs have different priorities. OpenAI has traditionally focused on consumer users, for instance, while its rival Anthropic tends to target enterprises. Elon Musk’s xAI, we discovered recently, has been placing particular emphasis on video-game walkthroughs.

On Friday, Business Insider’s Grace Kay published a detailed and far-reaching report about xAI, the AI startup recently acquired by SpaceX, with particular emphasis on how Musk is making life difficult for employees. But this particular anecdote stood out:

In one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game “Baldur’s Gate,” according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said.

Of course, you can imagine the frustration of any respected and experienced engineer who shows up to work thinking he’ll be tackling fundamental problems of knowledge and machine intelligence, only to be sidetracked into helping a 54-year-old man beat his video game. But the anecdote raises an even more pressing question: Did Musk end up getting the gaming skills he wanted?

To answer that question, our resident RPG enthusiast Ram Iyer put together a set of five general questions about Baldur’s Gate, which we ran against xAI and the three major models in a kind of quasi-benchmark that I’ve decided to call “BaldurBench.”

In the interest of journalistic transparency, I’ve made all the chat transcripts public, so you can see them here: Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

First, the good news: Grok actually gives pretty good information. Its responses were a bit dense with gamer jargon — “save-scumming” instead of saving and “DPS” instead of damage — but the answers were both useful and well-informed, provided you knew what it was talking about. Grok also really loves tables and theorycraft, which is about what you would expect.

There are lots of Baldur’s Gate guides out there and the models were generally drawing from the same ones, so the biggest differences were stylistic. ChatGPT prefers bulleted lists and sentence fragments, while Gemini loves to bold important words.

The biggest surprise was Claude, which was particularly concerned about giving me information that would spoil my experience of the game. When I asked about good party compositions, it closed the guidance by saying, “Don’t stress too much and just play what sounds fun to you.” Thanks, Claude!

It’s important to bear in mind, this is a subject area we know (thanks to Business Insider’s reporting) that xAI has specifically focused on reaching parity. So we shouldn’t read too much into the fact that, after the reported sprint, Grok’s advice turned out about the same as the other models. Still, it’s nice to know xAI can make it work if it tries.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Of all the kingly and capricious powers that Donald Trump enjoys exercising as president, the ability to threaten arbitrarily large tariffs is his favorite. Who could ever forget “Liberation Day” in April 2025, when America declared economic warfare on the rest of the world? Or, at least it was his favorite power—before the Supreme Court ruled today that many of the tariffs he had imposed in the past year were illegal. The ruling is a political embarrassment to the administration, which might now have to issue refunds on up to $142 billion of tariff revenue. But the Court’s decision is less significant economically—with time and effort, Trump can largely reconstitute the tariff regime that was just overthrown—than it is democratically. The Court, despite its conservative majority, has enforced the limits on arbitrary presidential authority that congressional Republicans were too timid to enforce themselves.

The case, Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump, concerned the president’s extraordinary use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which grants the president the power to regulate imports during declared national emergencies. IEEPA has been routinely used to impose sanctions but never to impose tariffs. Trump seized on that ambiguous language to impose tariffs by executive order, with no involvement of Congress (which is given the exclusive power to collect taxes and tariffs in Article I of the Constitution). After declaring national emergencies over fentanyl smuggling and illegal immigration, Trump imposed tariffs on goods entering from China, Canada, and Mexico, among other countries. The threat of such arbitrary tariffs have been a primary tool of economic and diplomatic coercion, used to extract trade agreements in which countries, including allies such as Britain and Japan, accept higher tariffs on their goods. A GOP-controlled Congress meekly watched as the executive branch seized one of its core enumerated authorities. Among Republicans, the erstwhile party of Ronald Reagan and free trade, only a few registered public dissent.

David Frum: The Supreme Court delivers Trump a humiliating gift

The Court ruled that Congress had not really inadvertently turned over its tariff authority to the president when it passed IEEPA. The opinion itself is fractured and awkward. Three conservative justices—John Roberts, Amy Coney Barrett, and Neil Gorsuch—joined with the three liberal justices to strike down Trump’s IEEPA tariffs on narrow textual grounds. “Based on two words separated by 16 others in Section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA—‘regulate’ and ‘importation’—the President asserts the independent power to impose tariffs on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate, for any amount of time. Those words cannot bear such weight,” the controlling opinion, written by Roberts, declares.

The Court heard oral arguments in November but was slow to issue its ruling. Now we can see why. Seven of the nine justices wrote opinions, spanning 170 pages, largely consumed with sniping at the arguments of their colleagues. Most of this concerns whether or not the tariffs should also be invalidated because of the “major questions” doctrine. This is a relatively new legal standard developed by conservative jurists that invalidates presidential actions that assert sweeping new authority on important policy matters based only on vague delegations from Congress. This has been used to great effect to stymie Democratic priorities such as Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, Joe Biden’s student-loan cancellations, and COVID-19 vaccine mandates. The liberal justices, who have previously criticized major questions as a doctrine that will “magically appear” when needed by conservatives, refused to sign on to its application in this case. The dissenting conservatives—Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito—who were sympathetic to major questions in its prior applications are more credulous this time. Gorsuch pillories both groups in his own opinion, saying that the conservative dissent “engages in a little grade inflation” while the liberals “all but endorse” the theory they had previously denounced.

Judicial fatalism—the idea that the Supreme Court is a rubber stamp for Trump—is a fashionable belief on the left. Although it was always doubtful, it ought now to be dispelled. The skepticism toward executive-branch overreach that stymied Democratic administrations is still being applied to a Republican administration. If the conservative justices had succumbed to the partisan instincts ascribed to them, they would have authorized a complete breakdown in the separation of powers. And not just for the present administration: A future Democratic president would have had the power to invoke a climate-change emergency and implement a large carbon tax on all imports—all without congressional involvement.

Trump has previously catastrophized the consequences of an adverse ruling. If the Supreme Court ruled against him, he predicted last month on Truth Social, “WE’RE SCREWED!” In a hastily called news conference today, he attacked the justices who ruled against him as “very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution.” The litigation over tariff refunds will indeed be a headache for Trump, but he will have plenty of other legal options to reimpose tariffs. Jamieson Greer, Trump’s top trade official, had indicated that contingency plans would “start the next day.”

The president can, after completing investigations, impose tariffs on goods that threaten national security or in response to unfair trade practices. Some of these are already in effect, which is why Americans will still face a 9.1 per cent effective tariff on imported goods even after the IEEPA-based tariffs are voided. These options are more cumbersome than the original route the president chose, but less legally vulnerable.

More exotic, untested authorities are also available to Trump. Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 15 percent for a period of 150 days to deal with trade deficits. (Trump said today that he would be invoking this to impose a 10 percent duty.) A more byzantine authority, Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, lets the president impose duties of up to 50 percent on countries that discriminate against American goods. The next year will be a blitz of actions under obscure laws. “We’ve gone from a relatively simple universe to a much more complicated one,” the Georgetown University law professor Kathleen Claussen told me.

For all these reasons, American consumers and importers should not expect permanent tariff relief. And the trade deals struck in the past year are unlikely to be unwound for the same reason. Congress has simply given a president committed to putting tariffs on the rest of the world too many options to do so. Trump could have chosen these other routes, but they require more time and deliberation than the IEEPA approach did—and lack the transgressive thrill of punishing entire countries on a whim. Throughout Trump’s reign, Republicans have done a poor job of defending actual American republicanism, but at least one branch of government is capable of doing so.</div>

If you put any stock in the ability of IQ tests to assess intelligence, we humans have spent the past century steadily getting smarter. (And if you don’t put any stock in them, well, we humans have steadily gotten better at IQ tests.)

Because IQ is a standardized measure, humankind’s average score still sits at 100—but this isn’t your granddaddy’s 100. IQ tests are regularly recalibrated, and over the past many decades, when new subjects have taken an old test, they have almost always outscored their predecessors’ average; Grandpa’s generation might have hovered around 100, but the kids are scoring 115 … which then becomes the new 100.

This phenomenon is called the Flynn effect, and researchers still aren’t sure what causes it. Perhaps it’s due to more efficient education or better nutrition. The reason could be that modern environments contain more interesting stimuli or that modern gasoline no longer contains lead.

I haven’t seen anyone propose that trivia is to thank, but the growing popularity of quizzing tracks with the IQ trend line pretty well too. I think I speak for all of science when I say we shouldn’t rule it out quite yet.

And by the way, did you know that the world’s first sweatpants were introduced in the 1920s by a French designer in search of a way to stretch with ease? Back then, they were made entirely of wool, which, while ostensibly allowable at Planet Fitness, seems rather more uncomfortable than the fabric options you can get today.

How did you do? Come back next week for more questions, and if you think up a great question after reading an Atlantic story—or simply want to share a fact—send it my way at [email protected].

And by the way, did you know that barcode scanning was initially greeted with a huge backlash? The first item ever scanned by barcode was a pack of Wrigley’s chewing gum at a supermarket in Troy, Ohio, in June 1974, but by the end of the ’70s, only about 1 percent of stores had adopted barcodes.

Consumers were worried that the tech would be used to rip them off. Advocacy groups mounted campaigns against the barcode, and protesters even picketed stores that used scanners. Others swore that the barcode was the biblical “mark of the beast.”

Obviously, it eventually caught on, and people got over their fears—though if you ever get rung up at $6.66, maybe offer to round to the next dollar, just in case.

And by the way, did you know that the University of Bologna is nearly a millennium old? It’s the world’s oldest university that was founded as such (at least one older university started as a madrasa), and its alumni include Copernicus, Dante, and more than one pope.

Imagine trying to write a halfway-decent poem for an assignment, and your classmate turns in the Divine Comedy. Then again, at least you’d have had a leg up on Copernicus, who probably got marked off plenty for insisting that the Earth actually orbits the sun.</div>

            <div id="article-text">In the 1630s, King Charles I tried to tax English people without the consent of their legislature. He lost his head.

In the 2020s, Donald Trump tried to tax Americans without the consent of Congress. He just lost his case.

A tariff is a tax. The Trump tariffs imposed in and after April 2025 were projected to raise as much as $2.3 trillion over 10 years. The Constitution assigns authority over taxes, including tariffs, to Congress. It does so for reasons that date back to English constitutional history: An executive who can tax without permission from elected representatives is on his way to becoming a tyrant.

Conor Friedersdorf: Striking down Trump’s tariffs isn’t a judicial coup

President Trump has had lots of ideas for how to spend the money he collected without Congress. He has offered it to farmers. He has mused about direct cash payments to taxpayers. He has speculated about creating a sovereign wealth fund to invest in companies. He has disregarded the fundamental principle that spending, like taxing, is a power the Constitution assigns to Congress, not the president.

Now we may be on the verge of a regime-changing war against Iran. War-making is also supposed to be a congressional power—but there’s no sign that Trump will allow Congress to vote on his war. In the past, the ultimate check on the president’s war-making powers was Congress’s power over the purse. When President Clinton intervened in the former Yugoslavia in 1999, Congress deadlocked over a vote of authorization, but approved the appropriation to pay for it, an authorization by a different name. But if Trump were allowed to tax without Congress, then he might reasonably conclude that he could fight wars without Congress.

Trump’s tariffs were advertised as a revenue source liberated from the restraints imposed by Article I of the Constitution. Had the Supreme Court upheld the tariffs, it would have wrought a constitutional revolution. Instead, the court quashed Trump’s scheme. Like every president before him, if he wants money—for an Iran war or any other purpose—he will have to ask Congress for it.

Trump’s theory was that an emergency-powers law passed in the 1970s allowed him to impose permanent revenue-raising tariffs on anyone for any reason. This argument was always far-fetched. The law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, was part of the post-Watergate reform to reduce presidential emergency powers. The IEEPA reformed the Trading With the Enemy Act passed during World War I. President Franklin Roosevelt had used that law to ban most private ownership of gold bullion in 1933, which even supporters had to concede was a fantastic legal reach. After Watergate, Congress sought to restrain the president by limiting the IEEPA to “unusual and extraordinary” threats to “the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.” The law’s powers can be invoked only after a formal declaration of national emergency, and the word tariff appears nowhere among the powers conferred upon the president by the law. To put it another way, a permanent 25 percent tax on Canadian maple-syrup-tapping technology is not what the authors of the IEEPA had in mind.

Trump gets very impatient when he’s asked about “affordability.” You can understand why he squirms. The price increases Americans have felt in 2025 and 2026 can be blamed in no small part on Trump’s tariffs. Power bill up? Trump imposed a tariff on the equipment used to generate and transmit electricity. Six-pack of beer more expensive? Trump taxed the beer cans. Kids need new shoes? Trump’s tariffs raised the cost.

Jerusalem Demsas: There’s no coming back from Trump’s tariff disaster

The ironic political question for 2026 is whether the U.S. Supreme Court acted in time to save Trump from himself. Whether or not it was the justices’ intention to help Trump, a generally Trump-friendly Supreme Court has offered the president an exit from one of his most unpopular domestic policies. Will he accept the handout? Acceptance would be smart, but humiliating. Trump holds other legal means to disrupt international trade, some of which he used in his first term. But those powers have tighter legal limits than Trump wants. They don’t raise the kind of lawless revenue he plainly hoped for, but they can still cause havoc until their abuse is checked—and the federal courts have thus far flinched on supplying such checks on the president’s power. Until and unless a future Congress acts to protect Americans from Trump protectionism, the outlook for U.S. prosperity and security will remain clouded.

While shadows dim the future, the sun shone today. U.S. stocks surged after Trump’s Supreme Court defeat. American consumers may soon feel the benefit. Liberated from this approach to economic warfare, relations with allies may recover some of their former cordiality. And unlike the case of Charles I, all of this was accomplished while allowing America’s president to lay his unsevered head on his pillow tonight.</div>

The Trump tariffs are dead. Long live the Trump tariffs?

This morning, in a 6–3 opinion, the Supreme Court struck down the bulk of the president’s sweeping global tariffs. The majority ruled that the law Donald Trump had used to carry out most of his trade policies does not, in fact, allow the president to impose tariffs at all. This is a major setback for Trump’s trade agenda, but it is far from a fatal one. The president has several alternatives that he can use to reconstruct his tariff regime, and his administration has spent months putting a plan in place to do so. Those efforts, too, may eventually be challenged in court, but fully litigating them would take years. Unless the president suddenly has a change of heart, Trump’s tariff adventure is far from over.

The case before the court centered on a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which authorizes the president to “regulate” the importation of goods in a national emergency that arises from an “unusual and extraordinary threat.” The Trump administration had interpreted this vague statute, which had never been used to justify tariffs, to mean that the president can issue tariffs of whatever kind he wants, whenever he wants, on any country he wants, so long as he says an emergency exists, all without getting congressional approval. IEEPA was the basis of Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China last February, the “reciprocal” tariffs he levied on almost every country in the world on Liberation Day, and most of the one-off tariffs he has issued or threatened to impose on trade partners such as Brazil, India, and, more recently, Europe and Canada. (Industry-specific tariffs on goods such as steel and aluminum have been imposed under separate, more legally sound authorities, and are not affected by the ruling.)

Last year, the lower courts ruled that although IEEPA might allow some tariffs, it certainly didn’t allow these tariffs—many of which were set at arbitrary levels, on an arbitrary set of countries, using justifications that could hardly be thought of as a true national emergency (such as the existence of a trade deficit or an imaginary surge of fentanyl shipments from Canada). The Supreme Court went even further. “We hold that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs,” Chief Justice John Roberts declared.

But even as it insisted that the law was on its side, the administration spent much of the past year preparing a backup plan to rebuild Trump’s tariff wall in case the courts ruled against them. Because, as the president observed on Truth Social a few hours after the ruling, “the Supreme Court did not overrule TARIFFS, they merely overruled a particular use of IEEPA TARIFFS.”

According to top Trump-administration officials such as National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the administration’s plan draws on two main authorities. The first is Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. That law allows the president to levy tariffs of up to 15 percent on any country for up to 150 days to address “large and serious balance-of-payment deficits,” a term that refers to more money leaving the country than coming into it. After the initial window, the tariff must be reauthorized by Congress. According to estimates by Clark Packard and Stan Vueger, trade experts at the Cato Institute and the American Enterprise Institute, respectively, this technique alone would allow Trump to reinstate 70 percent of the tariff revenue struck down by the Supreme Court. This would be a temporary solution, and overbroad use of Section 122 could also be invalidated by the courts. It would most likely be intended only as a stopgap measure to buy time while the administration begins work on the second part of its plan.

Phase two would draw on Section 301 of the same law. Section 301 allows a presidential administration to levy essentially permanent tariffs of any kind on any country in response to “unfair” trade practices. The catch is that the tariffs can come into effect only after the federal government has navigated several layers of bureaucratic process, including launching an official investigation into the unfair practices of the country in question, compiling a report detailing those practices, and offering a public notice-and-comment period. That’s where the 150 days come in. The administration could use that time to launch investigations into the U.S.’s major trading partners so that once the five months are expired, the paperwork is already in place to switch to indefinite tariffs under Section 301. This authority rests on stronger constitutional grounds. The first Trump administration and the Biden administration both used section 301 to impose or raise tariffs on Chinese goods. Courts have generally been deferential to how presidents use the authority as long as the proper process has been followed.

Trump has already signaled that he plans to use all the legal authorities at his disposal. “Therefore, effective immediately, all National Security TARIFFS, Section 232 and existing Section 301 TARIFFS, remain in place, and in full force and effect,” he wrote in his Truth Social post. “Today I will sign an Order to impose a 10% GLOBAL TARIFF, under Section 122, over and above our normal TARIFFS already being charged, and we are also initiating several Section 301 and other Investigations to protect our Country from unfair Trading practices.”

Most experts I spoke with think that this one-two combination will allow Trump to functionally rebuild most of the current tariff regime in a way that could survive in court. “Nearly 90 percent of U.S. trade comes from our 20 largest trading partners,” Peter Harell, who served as a top trade adviser in the Biden administration, told me before the ruling came down. “I don’t think it would be too difficult to reconstitute tariffs on most of them in 150 days.”

Less clear is the degree to which the Court’s ruling will restrain Trump’s ability to impose new tariffs. The president is not really a notice-and-comment kind of guy. He prefers to use the threat of sudden, unpredictable tariffs to coerce other countries to do his bidding or punish them for crossing him. So far this year, he has threatened 25 percent tariffs on Europe over their unwillingness to hand Greenland over to him and100 percent tariffs on Canada for making a deal with China; he has also threated to “raise tariffs very quickly” on India for buying Russian oil. Such threats will be less intimidating if they have an upper bound of 15 percent (Section 122) or require a drawn-out bureaucratic process before implementation (Section 301). “They will lose quite a bit of flexibility,” Vueger told me. “Trump loves to threaten higher and higher tariffs on whatever country for whatever reason—and these tools just weren’t designed to do that.”

The administration appears to acknowledge this reality. Part of its legal argument for upholding IEEPA was that the alternatives would deny the president flexibility and immediacy. As Howard Lutnick, Trump’s commerce secretary, has noted in previous testimony, “other tools” are “procedurally time-consuming and do not allow for immediate action.”

Rogé Karma: So, about those big trade deals

Perhaps Trump will simply make a mockery of the procedural requirements under Section 301. He could threaten Canada on Monday morning, have his trade representative launch an “investigation” into Canadian trade practices that afternoon, and issue a “report” by Tuesday detailing why those tariffs are justified. Or he might try to rely on an even older legal provision: Section 338 of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. This allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 50 percent on any country if the president determines that it has discriminatory trade practices toward the United States.

Either of these options would be vulnerable to court challenges. Courts are likely to strike down Section 301 tariffs on purely procedural grounds if the administration rushes them through without proper process. Section 338 of Smoot-Hawley, meanwhile, has never been used, and some question exists as to whether it still applies as law at all or whether it was superseded entirely by the 1974 bill. Even if it’s still good law, courts may rule that its use requires approval from the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent agency that conducts investigations into trade disputes, or that the “discriminatory acts” justification doesn’t apply to countries with which the U.S. has “most favored nation” trading status—every country except Cuba, North Korea, Russia, and Belarus.

But those legal challenges, even if successful, might not constrain Trump all that much. The president could simply keep pushing the boundaries of different authorities to keep some version of tariffs in place while litigation takes its sweet time to resolve. The courts already took a year to decide on IEEPA. Who knows how long it would take them to overturn each one of these potential alternative efforts? “If you’re issuing separate country-by-country tariffs, then it’s likely they will have to be litigated one by one,” Vueger said.

But this type of strategic legal brinkmanship would create a logistical nightmare for businesses, with potentially painful economic consequences. Tariffs would constantly be overturned and refunded. Businesses would have no certainty to make investments. Companies would probably raise prices preemptively. “It would be total, complete chaos,” Harrell told me.

One institution could put an end to all of this at any time: Congress. The Constitution gives the legislative branch the power to regulate international trade; the only reason Trump is able to levy tariffs at all is because of previous laws passed by Congress that have given him that authority. Congress could decide to take that authority away. So far, a handful of Republicans have complained loudly about tariffs, but almost none have been willing to actually do anything about them.

If Trump were behaving purely rationally, he probably wouldn’t try any more tariff workarounds, given how unpopular his tariffs are and how much the cost of living dominates voter sentiment. He would simply accept a loss at the Supreme Court and move on. Without the tariffs in place, prices would likely come down, and the Federal Reserve might be more confident about lowering interest rates.

But for Trump, the tariff power is about a lot more than tariffs. It’s the primary way he exerts dominance over American companies and foreign countries. And he has shown little indication that he would ever be willing to give that up.</div>

            <div id="article-text">In my stupid and insignificant opinion, Xbox hasn&#39;t been a relevant gaming platform since the days of the Xbox 360.

And now that Phil Spencer is stepping down and being replaced by M$&#39; AI boss, it would seem the clankers are about to creep in to the ecosystem.

I know Sharma says she&#39;s not looking to incorporate &quot;soulless AI slop&quot; into the Xbox ecosystem, but on the other hand, Micro$oft has stated in recent years that they love open-source. In either case, I trust that statement about as much as I&#39;d trust John Wayne Gacy around a small child.

At this point, then, I wouldn&#39;t be upset in the slightest if Micro$oft decided to just kill Xbox once and for all. If that happened, it&#39;d be a great opportunity for Sega to come along and announce a new console. That would absolutely go wild online and in game journals. In fact, that&#39;s the future I&#39;d want.

So unless Ms. Sharma holds true to her promise of a return to the classic Xbox experience (I&#39;m hoping she means that of the 360 or earlier), then for all I care, Xbox is dead. Netcraft confirms it.

I have yet to see how AI will really enhance gaming or game development besides making poor-quality art assets and low poly 3d models, neither of which will make Microslop very much money. The microsoft store is still a disaster too.

Microslop has had a long track record of trying and failing at building software though, so I&#39;m sure this is just a new trainwreck in the making.

The point of any website, television show, or radio program is to sell ads. Anything else is secondary to that goal.  Welcome to hell.

Why on earth would someone work in such high level positions at a profitable company for 38 full years?  I like to think I would have retired a lot sooner in the same situation.

Harry Potter is an example of something that is popular, but not very good. The movies were better, they cleaned up a lot of the worst parts, but the books really needed some proper editing.

All that matters is which sides seeker gets the snitch.The rest of the game and team is totally irrelevant.

In the World Cup, the team the caught the Snitch still lost.

Likely intentionally so, though.  JK said that she designed the money system (17 Sickles to a Galleon and 29 Knuts to a Sickle, making 493 Knuts equal to one Galleon) because her sister hated the old duodecimal money system in England.

So she probably had some other reason for making Quidditch such a stupid game.

Blame it on AI trained on Harry Potter...and call it the &quot;Slytherin Effect&quot; J.K. Rowling&#39;s literary contribution in the 21st century. ;-)

Not even any pretence to behaving legally or ethically

By marking a dataset with a flag, how could that lead anyone to believe that Harry Potter books are in the public domain and can be freely used.

It&#39;s not about the quality of the writing - if Harry Potter is fair game then what is off limits?

I guess that being in an environment where cheating is the norm gets into the blood.

They&#39;re spending a trillion dollars without a plan and without a product. They are literally disrupting every single consumer electronics supply chain for the next three years without a plan and without a product.

I like to see it as proof that we do have the money to spend on non-capitalism things that people claim we don&#39;t. Just need the will to tax and implement it.

Only if that kind of use works on one of those NVidia H200s or whatever the newest one is.Odds are, the software for protein folding would have to be rewritten to use an H200-style board.

If you are building solutions in the Microsoft Azure Cloud, it is very easy to get immediate access to GPT models to power your AI pipelines (whatever they may be).  Very affordable, too.

By contrast, you cannot gain access to the Gemini models, and there is a big hill to climb to gain access to Claude.  I don&#39;t know about Meta&#39;s models, I never checked.

My point being, this is a bit of a vendor lock in that makes use of GPT models the path of least resistance for many businesses that are building AI powered solutions.  Maybe that will help.  Though I think not for long.

GPT models are weaksauce compared to Gemini and Claude.  They have been very far surpassed by these.  Businesses that really need the power of these other models can use Google Vertex and integrate that with their Azure cloud, or set up an Anthropic account and just beam the web requests right over.  Anthropic is problematic in that it doesn&#39;t allow you to ensure that data never leaves specific global regions (which many people need for legal reasons), but Google Vertex sure does.

So, I think that advantage that OpenAI currently has will not last long.

It is sad to see an innovator lose out, but that is also how things normally go.  We tell ourselves feel-good stories about how copyright law or patent law can protect the small innovator against the huge corporations, but that isn&#39;t how things play out in realty.  By hook or by crook, the major players wind up leveraging what they have to get control over the shiny new thing, and that&#39;s how the cookie crumbles.

You can&#39;t have a &quot;deliberate product strategy&quot; when inventing totally new stuffThat is 100% true. But it also isn&#39;t how trillion dollar companies get their valuations. They get it by having a deliberate product strategy and a strong moat that will defend their revenue for decades to come.

You can&#39;t have a &quot;deliberate product strategy&quot; when inventing totally new stuff

Right. Which is why businesses don&#39;t do that. Publicly funded universities don&#39;t even do that.

Industrial research, even the legendary Bell Labs and Xerox Parc, is a small part of what a compay is otherwise doing. You might exploit something coming out of your research lab, but you&#39;re not depending on it.

The biggest problem with this is that 12TF cards are expensive, but more importantly, the ones with enough memory for the models to be much more than a curiosity (say, 32GB+) are extremely expensive, and frankly, not terribly available.

The state of the technology needs to improve a lot for general local inference. Yes, you can do a lot with smaller specialized models (things like whisper) or do minor things with free models like lfm2.5 or mistral but these aren&#39;t even in the same ballpark

Didn&#39;t they buy up like half the memory chips, which caused a massive shortage starting in September?

OpenAI is only planning to buy those chips. But first they have to get the money. OpenAI has run out of big investors and Nvidia is getting shaky about round tripping. Now Sam Altman has to convince big banks that Gemini and Claude Code aren&#39;t going to turn ChatGPT into a streak in a pair of dirty underpants. I won&#39;t be surprised if we see OpenAI dramatically scale back all those big expensive capex plans in the near future.

&quot;Analyst invested in other companies claims OpenAI is no good.&quot;

As I put together in 2010 citing writings from 1964 and later: &quot;Beyond a Jobless Recovery:A heterodox perspective on 21st century economics&quot; https://pdfernhout.net/beyond-...  [pdfernhout.net] &quot;This article explores the issue of a &quot;Jobless Recovery&quot; mainly from a heterodox economic perspective. It emphasizes the implications of ideas by Marshall Brain and others that improvements in robotics, automation, design, and voluntary social networks are fundamentally changing the structure of the economic landscape. It outlines towar

For coding purposes, Anthropic&#39;s Claude wins hand down in my experience and Gemini is next. GPT is several months behind in quality, and Meta is barely visible.

OpenAI merely needs to be shipping superior product in order to do well in that space, and there&#39;s still plenty of runway for them. The real danger for them in my opinion is losing the tech race.

I use ChatGPT because there is NOT any lock in. They want to start playing that game, they lose my money.

The analysts have it all wrong.  OpenAI&#39;s business plan is not based on motes, tech edge, lock-in, business fundamentals, or anything like that; it&#39;s based on hype.  And AI excels at generating hype.  That&#39;s the killer feature.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Executive Dysfunction, a weekly newsletter that surfaces under-the-radar stories about what Trump is doing to the law—and how the law is pushing back.

The Supreme Court’s 6–3 ruling against Donald Trump’s global tariffs prompted the president to berate the justices in the majority at a seething press conference on Friday. Trump declared that he was “absolutely ashamed of certain members of the court for not having the courage to do what’s right for the country.” He condemned these justices as “fools and lapdogs for the RINOs and the radical left Democrats” who are “very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution,” adding that “the court has been swayed by foreign interests.” And he then singled out Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, whom he himself appointed, as “an embarrassment to their families.” (By way of contrast, Trump praised Justice Brett Kavanaugh—who strongly dissented—for “his genius and his great ability,” noting that he was “very proud of that appointment.”)

This furious reaction should come as no surprise: The president has been pressuring the justices to side with him for months, warning that the United States’ economy would be “screwed” without the tariffs and calling the case “one of the most important” in history. But this strong-arming clearly failed. After nearly a year of indulging almost every presidential wish, the Roberts court drew a line. The court’s opinion evinces no concern about political backlash or economic ruin. Instead, the majority reflects a kind of serene intellectual indifference toward the consequences of this ruling, with both Gorsuch and Barrett far more interested in an academic debate over statutory construction than the potential for a presidential tantrum that could further destabilize an embattled judicial branch. And there is no indication that these justices ever wavered in their resolve to strike down Trump’s signature second-term policy.

On this week’s episode of Amicus, co-hosts Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the agreements and fractures among the six-justice majority, and all the ways in which the White House’s pressure campaign clearly fell flat, if it was experienced at all. A preview of their conversation, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Dahlia Lithwick: A lot of people seem to think this is an incredibly fractured opinion with so many separate parts and concurrences and dissents. To me, the upshot of Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion for the court is that this is just an unvarnished loss for Donald Trump. The liberals are not prepared to deploy the major questions doctrine, and the dissenters are big mad, but in the end, Trump just loses 6–3.

Mark Joseph Stern: I understand why it’s confusing. There is so much separate writing by justices on both sides. But the bottom line is that six justices say Trump’s global tariffs exceed his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. They all agree with the bottom line that IEEPA does not give the president power to unilaterally tax foreign goods by allowing him to “regulate” foreign imports in an emergency. There is a split within the majority, though. Chief Justice John Roberts, along with Gorsuch and Barrett, uses the major questions doctrine to bolster their conclusion. This trio says: We have a rule that when the president is claiming a major power of “economic and political significance,” he needs explicit statutory authorization. And IEEPA is not it.

But the liberals have never embraced that rule, which SCOTUS used to block much of President Joe Biden’s agenda. And in her separate concurrence, Justice Elena Kagan—joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson—says she still doesn’t agree with the major questions doctrine. Nor does she think it’s needed to get to the correct result here. But she also says that she agrees with “the bulk of the principal opinion’s reasoning.” So there is a solid six-justice supermajority here. This is not like the first Obamacare case where you had to count heads to find a majority.

There was also none of that weird, very visible horse-trading we saw in the Obamacare opinions—it was clear that justices were crossing their fingers and doing deals under the table. It didn’t feel like there was horse-trading here. There was a legitimate question about the major questions doctrine. The justices in the majority found slightly different ways to say no, but they were still saying no.

To me, that hints at the possibility that the six-justice majority firmed up very quickly after arguments. I think when the justices discussed this case at conference, it was clear that Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett were firmly against these tariffs. We speculated, at the time, whether the liberals would have to sign on to the major questions doctrine in order to get to a majority against the tariffs. Would Roberts team up with Gorsuch and Barrett to pressure the liberals into finally endorsing and legitimizing the major questions doctrine? It seems like that didn’t happen here because the three liberals held the line, and there is no indication they ever wavered. They said: We agree with the statutory interpretation, but we are still not on board with major questions.

If there had been the kind of horse-trading that we saw in the Obamacare case, maybe Roberts could have forced those three liberals into the major-questions fold. Instead, they stood in their own camp. That allowed those three to maintain their integrity and broader principles while still reaching the right conclusion.

CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported on Friday that Trump completely blew up in a meeting after learning of the ruling on tariffs. She said “he started ranting about the decision, not only calling it a disgrace, but started attacking the courts and at one point saying ‘these effing courts,’ but using the actual language there.” We’ve known for the last couple of weeks that Donald Trump is not feeling it from some of “his” justices. And this is actually a pretty serious moment to think about Donald Trump making these threats against the courts.

I don’t think Roberts, Gorsuch, or Barrett were at all cowed by Trump’s bullying before, and they won’t be now. He pressured them for months, insisting that he should be able to do what he wants, and that we’ll be a “poor country” if the court strikes down his tariffs. I don’t get the sense that the three conservatives in the majority cared at all. Roberts’ opinion is so crisp and confident—a classic “this is what the law is” ruling. To the extent there’s any wavering or disagreement between Barrett and Gorsuch, it’s an academic fight about the major questions doctrine! Gorsuch has a 46-page concurrence defending the major questions doctrine against the liberals’ criticism of it. Barrett has her own concurrence outlining her view that it’s a more modest rule of statutory construction; not as substantive as Gorsuch says. Yet they’re seemingly on the same page with Roberts about applying it here.

These justices were not scared watching Trump make these threats on CNN. They had their heads in the casebooks! Their brains were miles away. I do find that somewhat encouraging, because we obviously need a judiciary that can function independently of the executive branch and stand up to it when it breaks the law. And one gets the comforting sense that that is indeed what happened here.

It’s such a funny corrective to our constant complaint that some members of the Supreme Court have no idea what’s happening in Congress, no idea about the enormity of the insurrection that happened across the street a few years back, no idea about those rendition flights to El Salvador, no idea about anything. Today was their equal opportunity to have no idea of what’s really going on with Donald Trump, and weirdly, it saves the day? If he wanted this to feel like an existential threat to them, they’re not having it. They’re just going to do eggheaded judicial construction all day long.

In a way, that’s the most satisfying part of the opinion: They have their heads in the sand no matter what. It’s still going to be Professor Barrett at the chalkboard explaining the difference between a substantive canon and a rule of statutory construction. While Donald Trump absolutely fumes in the White House and unleashes the fury on the court, Barrett may never even see what he says.

The Supreme Court struck down Donald Trump’s sweeping “emergency” tariffs on Friday, ruling 6–3 that they far exceed what federal law allows. With its decision in Learning Resources v. Trump, the court wiped out Trump’s signature economic agenda, a withering rebuke to a president who has insisted that these tariffs are foundational to the success of his second term. Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion for the court sends the blunt message that Trump should not expect SCOTUS to rubber-stamp all of his expansions of executive power, no matter how much political pressure he puts on the justices. This rejoinder may be surprising given the Republican-appointed supermajority’s previous tolerance for the president’s assertions of king-like authority. But as Roberts’ crisp, confident opinion explains, allowing the president to impose taxes unilaterally—at least without clear congressional authority—is an existential threat to the very “existence and prosperity” of the nation.

In truth, Trump’s tariffs were always on shaky legal ground, no matter how confidently the White House insisted they were permissible. The president claimed the freedom to impose tariffs on any nation, of any amount, for as long as he wished, based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. But IEEPA does not mention tariffs, duties, taxes, or anything else that would hint at Congress’ desire to delegate tariff authority to the executive branch. Instead, it allows the president to “regulate” foreign “importation” to “deal with” an “unusual and extraordinary threat” abroad. Trump’s Justice Department insisted that he could “regulate” “importation” by slapping any tariff on any country he wanted. And it claimed two different “emergencies” that justified these duties: a long-standing trade imbalance with many other nations, and the smuggling of fentanyl into the United States.

Roberts—joined by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson—rejected this interpretation. All six justices agreed on the bottom-line conclusion that “those words cannot bear such weight.” As the chief explained, the Constitution assigns primary authority over tariffs to Congress, not the president. “Recognizing the taxing power’s unique importance,” the Framers gave Congress alone “access to the pockets of the people.” And tariffs, of course, are “a tax levied on imported goods and services.”

Congress has delegated some tariff authority to the executive branch, but those laws impose “strict limits” on the scope and duration of tariffs that the president may dictate. IEEPA’s grant of authority to “regulate” foreign imports, by contrast, contains none of these “procedural limitations.” So if it did permit tariffs, Roberts noted, it would leave the president “free to issue a dizzying array of modifications at will.” And “all it takes to unlock that extraordinary power is a presidential declaration of emergency, which the government asserts is unreviewable.” That is one clue that Congress did not intend IEEPA to encompass such freewheeling tariff authority.

Another clue: The government could not identify “any statute in which the power to regulate includes the power to tax.” In the entire U.S. Code, not a single law uses “regulation” to mean “taxation.” The court, Roberts wrote, was “therefore skeptical that in IEEPA—and IEEPA alone—Congress hid a delegation of its birth-right power to tax within the quotidian power to ‘regulate.’ ” Rather, “Congress’s pattern of usage” reveals that when it “grants the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly and with careful constraints. It did neither here.” Combining these hints with “breadth, history, and constitutional context,” the chief found that IEEPA cannot plausibly be read to hand Trump the boundless freedom over tariffs that he claimed.

There was, however, a rift within the six-justice majority. Roberts, joined by Gorsuch and Barrett, invoked the “major questions doctrine” to bolster their conclusion that IEEPA does not cover tariffs. This controversial rule holds that the president must point to an explicit delegation of authority when addressing a matter of immense “economic and political significance.” The conservative supermajority has previously invoked the doctrine to strike down President Joe Biden’s student debt relief plan, climate regulations, and other progressive goals.

Trump’s Justice Department argued that the doctrine does not apply to “foreign affairs,” attempting to gerrymander a massive exception to accommodate its trade policy. But Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett rejected this contention, particularly when those “affairs” implicate “the core congressional power of the purse.” The trio therefore applied the doctrine to confirm the court’s reading of IEEPA. Kagan, joined by Sotomayor and Jackson, wrote that there was no need to invoke “major questions” in this case. Rather, she wrote, “the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation amply support today’s result,” without any resort to rules that put “a thumb on the interpretive scales.” (In dueling concurrences, Gorsuch and Barrett also battled about the true meaning of the “major questions doctrine,” which confirms that the liberals were right to resist legitimizing this slippery, ill-defined rule here.)

Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s principal dissent—joined by Justices Thomas and Alito—is an embarrassment that cannot be squared with much of his jurisprudence under Biden. After consistently reading statutes narrowly to hem in Biden’s authority, the justice interpreted IEEPA as expansively as possible, declaring that “tariffs are a traditional and common tool to regulate importation.” And after touting the major questions doctrine for his entire judicial career, he announced that it does not apply “in the foreign affairs context” (at least when Trump is in office). Thomas’ separate, lone dissent is even worse: The justice has long endorsed the “non-delegation doctrine,” which holds that Congress cannot delegate its core powers to the executive branch. Yet on Friday, he revised his view, writing that this doctrine does not apply to former “powers of the Crown.” Those powers, Thomas wrote, include tariffs, which are ostensibly not “within the core legislative power.” It is difficult to read this dissent as anything other than Thomas amending his views to accommodate Trump’s power-grabs.

Should we be shocked that this court—which has, for 13 months, enabled Trump’s abuses of office over the shadow docket—smacked down Trump’s marquee economic policy so emphatically? Not really. For one thing, this case is pretty easy: As Roberts explained, no sensible reading of IEEPA would hand over unlimited tariff authority to the president. Moreover, the business community does not like these tariffs; even the Chamber of Commerce urged the justices to strike them down. The conservative justices are sympathetic toward corporate interests, and did them a favor by ending Trump’s whim-based tariff regime. These justices are also economically literate and must understand that tariffs are bad for the economy. As with Trump’s efforts to fire members of the Federal Reserve, this case gave the conservatives an opportunity to flaunt their independence while delivering a victory to corporate America. From that angle, it’s a pure win-win.

But we should not be entirely cynical about Friday’s ruling. It does take courage for the justices to stand up to the president this way, especially when he has tried to bully them into ruling in his favor. Since Trump returned to the White House, we have wondered whether the Supreme Court could muster enough independence to save our constitutional system from his efforts to consolidate all power in the Oval Office. Too often, SCOTUS has shirked this duty. But there are still some lines it won’t let Trump cross. As Roberts wrote, the Framers viewed taxation as “the one great power upon which the whole national fabric is based.” And in the end, he and his colleagues felt obliged to protect this thread of our national fabric from the man who would unravel it.

            <div id="article-text">Sign up for Executive Dysfunction, a weekly newsletter that surfaces under-the-radar stories about what Trump is doing to the law—and how the law is pushing back.

This week the Environmental Protection Agency took the momentous—and disastrous—step of repealing the government’s “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gases “harm public health or welfare,” which is a prerequisite for regulating these pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The text of the Clean Air Act and robust congressional debates at the time of its enactment bely EPA’s central justification for repealing the endangerment finding and the greenhouse gas emission standards for motor vehicles—that the Clean Air Act of 1970 was concerned only with local and regional pollutants. It wasn’t. But EPA’s repeal contains even more flaws. In particular, the agency relies on three key Supreme Court climate change cases to support its action but mischaracterizes each of them.

Most significantly, EPA mangles Massachusetts v. EPA, the 2007 case in which the Supreme Court decided that greenhouse gases are “air pollutants” for the purposes of the Clean Air Act. According to EPA, that case involved an interpretation of the statute’s general definition of “air pollutant” and was not a decision specific to the law’s section 202(a)(1), which governs the regulation of motor-vehicle emissions. Thus, EPA contends that “Massachusetts did not consider or have reason to interpret the scope of the EPA’s authority” under the portion of the Clean Air act releveant to vehicle emissions.

This proposition is flatly wrong. Indeed, in Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide a specific question: “Whether the EPA Administrator has authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other air pollutants associated with climate change under section 202(a)(1).” In its opinion, the court reiterated this question: “The first question is whether §202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it forms a ‘judgment’ that such emissions contribute to climate change.’” And in the next sentence the Supreme Court provided the answer: “We have little trouble concluding that it does.”

EPA would be wrong even in the absence of this explicit language in the opinion. Its revisionist reading of Massachusetts also conflicts with that bedrock principle that a case holding is the narrowest principle necessary to resolve the controversy. And that principle is that greenhouse gases are “air pollutants” that may be regulated under section 202(a)(1). EPA’s suggestion that the Supreme Court decided the broader question but not the narrower 202(a)(1) question turns basic legal reasoning on its head.

EPA’s mischaracterization of Supreme Court caselaw is not confined to Massachusetts v. EPA. The agency also provides a grievously misleading account of the 2014 Supreme Court opinion in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA. That case has four key components. First, the Supreme Court held that EPA lacked the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources. Second, however, it also held that the agency had the authority to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions of other sources. Third, as a result of these two holdings, as Justice Antonin Scalia noted in announcing the court’s opinion, EPA could regulate the vast majority of the emissions—over 90 percent—that were at stake in the case. And, fourth, Justice Scalia’s majority opinion reaffirmed the holding in Massachusetts v. EPA, which it described as “’authoriz[ing] EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles’” if the agency “form[ed] a ‘judgment’ that such emissions contribute to climate change.’”

Yet, in its repeal of the endangerment finding, EPA repeatedly refers to the first component of this decision to cast doubt on its authority to regulate greenhouse gases. But the agency never mentions the remaining three components, which are significantly more important and which paint a very different picture.

Similarly, EPA misconstrues the core holding of West Virginia v. EPA, decided in 2022, which struck down certain EPA greenhouse gas emission standards for power plants. The problem that the court identified was that the regulation was premised on the requirement of a specified proportion of “generation shifting” from dirtier power sources to clean ones: from coal to natural gas and from coal and natural gas to renewables. The court held that EPA did not have the authority to require such generation shifting in Clean Air Act power-sector standards. But the court recognized that “there is an obvious difference between (1) issuing a rule that may end up causing an incidental loss of coal’s market share, and (2) simply announcing what the market share of coal, natural gas, wind, and solar must be, and then requiring plants to reduce operations or subsidize their competitors to get there.” The court viewed the first category as an uncontroversial consequence of standard environmental regulation—indeed, it is a ubiquitous consequence of practically all regulation. Only the second category is impermissible for power-sector standards.

In its regulation of the greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles, which started in the Obama administration, EPA has never required a specific market shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles. These regulations are therefore conceptually different from the one struck down in West Virginia v. EPA. Also, in EPA’s earlier vehicle regulations for greenhouse gases, the market shift that resulted from the regulation was minor and clearly “incidental,” since manufacturers primarily met the regulatory standard by making their internal combustion vehicles more efficient. And, even if a court were to find that the Biden administration’s later standards were impermissibly premised on large market shift toward EVs, the proper remedy would be to strike down those standards, not to eliminate EPA’s ability to put in place any greenhouse gas standards for motor vehicles, including ones that did not have this feature.

Lee Zeldin, the EPA Administrator, repeatedly says that his primary concern is with following the law. His characterization of the key Supreme Court cases on EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases tells a very different story.

The term Orwellian is often trotted out as a cliché, but it suits the confluence of President Donald Trump’s two big actions today—holding the first meeting of his “Board of Peace” and finishing the mobilization of a massive military force on the flanks of Iran, ready to attack the Islamic Republic as soon as this weekend.

His Board of Peace, to which Trump said the U.S. would commit $10 billion (for what, it’s unclear), seems largely theatrical. The war in Gaza, which Trump claims to have ended, persists—Israel continues its demolitions, while Hamas is tightening its grip on the place and refusing to disarm—and the board’s larger goal of supplanting or overseeing the United Nations worldwide is fanciful, to say the least.

Meanwhile, the point of the armed buildup around Iran—the largest assembly of U.S. warplanes and warships in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq—is remarkably unclear. The U.S. armada mobilized to the region includes 18 warships (two of which are aircraft carriers) and many fighter jets, bombers, antimissile systems, and electronic jammers on nearby bases. This is enough to fight a weekslong battle, hitting targets related to any and all of those missions and disabling or intercepting most of the missiles that Iran might launch in response. But for what purpose—and with what chance of success, whatever the purpose might be—is another question.

Does Trump want to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, dismantle its ballistic missile sites, pull down the regime, or simply threaten a combination of all three to pressure the Iranians to make a “deal”—but a deal to do what?

In January, Trump threatened “strong” military action against Iran if its leaders killed any of the growing mass of anti-government protesters. Tehran canceled the execution of one protester, leading Trump to pronounce his demand satisfied. However, troops and police proceeded to mow down thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of protesters in the streets, to no objection from Washington. As was the case in Venezuela, democracy and human rights were pieces of Trump’s original war rhetoric—but not in his war policy.

Many were shocked when his real policy in Venezuela turned out to be abducting its criminal president, Nicolás Maduro, and compelling his successors—who had been deputies in Maduro’s Cabinet—to cede control of their country’s oil to the United States. Maria Corina Machado, the leader of Venezuela’s democratic opposition, who expected to take power if Maduro were overthrown, was pushed under the bus. (Her attempt to gain Trump’s favor—giving him the Nobel Peace Prize trophy that she won but that he thought he’d deserved—was a futile gesture.)

So what, exactly, is Trump up to in Iran?

Is he now going after its oil? Probably not, though keeping the oil from being traded to Iran’s biggest customer, China, might be part of the equation. Still, the assembled armada seems overkill for that goal.

Trump says his main concern is to keep Iran from building a nuclear weapon. The irony is that Trump claimed to “obliterate” the nation’s nuclear program in last June’s attack—known as Operation Midnight Hammer—on Iran’s mountain-buried enriched-uranium site. As many noted at the time, Trump exaggerated the extent of the damage; for one thing, Iranians might have removed much of the uranium in anticipation of the assault. However, the damage did significantly set back Iran’s program, perhaps by a few years. What is the rush now?

Iran’s ballistic missiles endanger Israel and U.S. bases in the region. In the brief Iran-Israel war last summer, 90 percent of Iran’s missiles were shot down or crashed before reaching their targets. But Iran launched 550 missiles, as well as 1,000 drones, and the 50 or so that pierced through the defenses inflicted considerable damage. It is not known how many missiles Iran has now—probably a few thousand. Manufacturing sites are concentrated and can be taken out fairly easily, but the missiles themselves are small and mobile. Many would survive an initial onslaught, and if Tehran’s leaders think their regime is about to be crushed, they might decide to launch a massive retaliation, bringing down their enemies along with themselves. In fact, in recent weeks, some Middle East leaders, notably the Saudis and other Sunnis (who have been fighting proxy wars against Iran on various fronts) urged Trump not to attack Iran, fearing that Iran would return fire against their lands too. They have barred U.S. planes from flying over their territory if Trump does decide to attack.

Here, then, is another irony. As a result of last summer’s missile exchanges, June’s Midnight Hammer, and a string of devastating attacks on Iran’s main proxy militias, Hamas and Hezbollah, Israel is now stronger and Iran is weaker than they have been in decades. Trump’s mobilization in the region underlines this disparity. Does Iran really pose a threat that justifies such a massive U.S. reaction?

Then again, from Israel’s perspective, Iran’s relative weakness is the point. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long pushed for regime change in Tehran. Though he never said so explicitly, his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, which President Barack Obama and six other leaders signed in 2014, wasn’t so much fear of an Iranian bomb (the accord really did all but stop its development) as fear that the removal of Iran’s sanctions and its integration into the world economy—the rewards for dismantling its nuclear apparatus—would solidify the Islamic Republic’s position, strengthen its international standing, and thereby increase Israel’s vulnerability, if not to nuclear bombs, then to other forms of intimidation. During Trump’s first term, Netanyahu persuaded him to rip up the nuclear deal; with the president now in his second term, the prime minister is hoping to lasso him into finishing off the regime.

The Iranian government is a horror. It represses its own people, now more than ever; it assists terrorists; and it’s an economic disaster as well. But it’s worth asking: If the mullahs are toppled or lose their grip on power in one way or another, who replaces them? It’s extremely unlikely that the successors would be the Western-leaning urban youth who have been demonstrating in the streets. They lack leaders and organizers, mainly because the regime has imprisoned or killed rising potential leaders—and disabled or co-opted tools and technologies that could enable organization.

If the mullahs fell, power would likely be picked up by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This is the Iranian army’s elite unit, with more than 150,000 personnel, who protect the regime, control much of the economy, and are no less hostile than the supreme leader and his mullahs toward Israel, Sunnis, and the West.

It’s possible that U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies have made contact with certain IRGC officers, discussing terms of mutual support in the event of regime change. We now know that the CIA infiltrated the Venezuelan leadership, which helped the U.S. Special Forces track down Maduro. However, we don’t yet know whether or how long Venezuela’s old-new leaders will keep to their side of whatever long-term bargain they might have struck. It’s doubly uncertain whether any emerging IRGC strongmen—with whom the U.S. has had no aboveground relationship at all—would honor any deal. It’s a very poor bet to act on the assumption that they would.

Which leads to the final possibility: that Trump is amassing all this firepower to pressure the Iranians to make a deal. He has said that, to avoid dreadful consequences, Iran must agree to enrich no uranium, dismantle its ballistic missiles, and sever relations with Shiite militias in the region.

The problem is that these terms are untenable to Iran, and would be even if the country had more-pliant leaders.

In the early stages of negotiation toward the 2014 nuclear deal, Obama also pushed for a ban on enrichment but soon realized that this was a dead end. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (which is observed by 191 nation-states, including Iran) not only allows its signatories to enrich uranium to 3 percent purity, but it enshrines that level of enrichment as a right. This level is very low. “Highly enriched” uranium is defined as 20 percent, “weapons-grade” as 90 percent. The treaty further allows international inspectors to verify whether countries are abiding with this limit. Obama’s Iran nuclear deal had tight inspection procedures; Iran was declared in compliance.

For Iran to accept a ban on enrichment, when the rest of the world is entitled to some, would be tantamount to surrender before a shot has been fired. No leader, Islamist or otherwise, would accept this.

A ban on ballistic missiles is also unlikely, as they are Iran’s main source of deterrence. Iran’s support for radical militias—such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis—does clarify the regime’s nature: A government can legitimately observe a right to bear conventional arms and enrich uranium (a little bit, anyway) but not to arm havoc-wreaking militias. Still, the Iranians have relied so heavily on these militias for power in the region that they would need tangible benefits to cut the cord.

What is the Trump administration offering Iran in return for taking such extraordinary measures? The question is misleading. There is no “Trump administration” when it comes to such matters. There is only Trump and his two emissaries, fellow real-estate tycoon Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. They have supplanted, and for the most part ignored, the experienced experts in the State Department and the National Security Council who usually hammer out positions and handle negotiations.

Witkoff has no diplomatic experience whatever. Kushner did play a role in the Abraham Accords, which formalized diplomatic and economic relations between Israel and some Arab states (the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco), but those nations already had informal relations, and they were not at all in a state of war.

Like Trump, they seem to believe that diplomacy requires no special knowledge and that dealmaking is dealmaking, whether you’re dealing with the Kremlin, the Islamic Republic of Iran, or the New York City Buildings Department. This blithe arrogance is naivete disguised as hardheadedness, and it goes a long way toward explaining the pair’s utter failure at settling the war in Ukraine. (There, they don’t grasp Russian President Vladimir Putin’s motive for war. If they did, they would realize that he doesn’t want peace without the complete subjugation of Kyiv.)

What happens these next few days in and around Iran? Who knows. It’s possible Trump himself doesn’t know. The Iranians will try to stretch out the negotiations, which they probably see as inherently fruitless. Trump may wait them out for a while, but perhaps not for long. If he starts a war, he may try to keep it limited at first, but the Iranians may escalate, anticipating their worst-case scenario, which Trump may then make a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Wars, once started, sometimes spiral out of control. This is why it’s smart for leaders to know what they want, and know how far they want to press things, before they make their first move. It’s also why, in negotiating a peaceful way out of a crisis, it’s good for them to know what the other side wants too—not necessarily to appease them but to scope out the boundaries of what’s possible without war and, given that, whether it’s better to modify peace terms or go to war.

At this point, it looks like Trump, pushed by Netanyahu, is rushing into conflict recklessly.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">PayPal has notified about 100 customers that their personal information was exposed online during a code change gone awry, and in a few of these cases, people saw unauthorized transactions on their accounts.

All of these customers have been fully refunded, according to a PayPal spokesperson.

&quot;When there is a potential exposure of customer information, PayPal is required to notify affected customers,&quot; the spokesperson told The Register. &quot;In this case, PayPal&#39;s systems were not compromised. As such, we contacted the approximately 100 customers who were potentially impacted to provide awareness on this matter.&quot;

According to a February 10 data breach notification sent to affected customers and shared with The Register, the online payment company spotted the unauthorized activity on December 12. It was due to a coding error in its PayPal Working Capital loan application that inadvertently leaked customers&#39; business contact information - including names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers, and business addresses - between July 1, 2025, and December 13, 2025.

&quot;PayPal has since rolled back the code change responsible for this error, which potentially exposed the PII,&quot; the letter said [PDF].

As soon as it noticed the leak and fraudulent transactions, PayPal says it began an investigation and blocked the unauthorized access, resetting passwords of affected accounts and requiring customers to set a new password the next time they log in.

&quot;A few customers experienced unauthorized transactions on their account and PayPal has issued refunds to these customers,&quot; according to the notification.

The company is also offering affected customers two years of free credit monitoring.

This data incident follows an earlier - and much worse - PayPal breach that also occurred in December, during which &quot;unauthorized parties&quot; accessed customers&#39; accounts using their valid login credentials.

In that 2022 security snafu, personal info belonging to 35,000 PayPal users was exposed including customers&#39; names, addresses, Social Security numbers, individual tax identification numbers, and dates of birth. ®

            <div id="article-text">Anthropic this week revised its legal terms to clarify its policy forbidding the use of third-party harnesses with Claude subscriptions, as the AI biz attempts to shore up its revenue model.

Anthropic sells subscriptions to its Claude platform, which provides access to a family of machine learning models (e.g. Opus 4.6), and associated tools like Claude Code, a web-based interface at Claude.ai, and the Claude Desktop application, among others.

Claude Code is a harness or wrapper – it integrates with the user&#39;s terminal and routes prompts to the available Claude model in conjunction with other tools and a control loop that, together, make it what Anthropic calls an agentic coding tool.

Many other tools serve as harnesses for models, such as OpenAI Codex, Google Antigravity, Manus (recently acquired by Meta), OpenCode, Cursor, and Pi (the harness behind OpenClaw).

Harnesses exist because interacting with a machine learning model itself is not a great user experience – you feed it a prompt and it returns a result. That&#39;s a single-turn interaction. Input and output. To create a product that people care about, model makers have added support for multi-turn interaction, memory of prior interactions, access to tools, orchestration to handle data flowing between those tools, and so on. Some of this support has been baked into model platforms, but some of it has been added through harness tooling.

This can pose a business problem for frontier model makers – they&#39;ve invested billions to train sophisticated models, but they risk being disintermediated by gatekeeping intermediaries that build harnesses around their models and offer a better user experience.

One of the ways that Anthropic has chosen to build brand loyalty is by selling tokens to subscription customers at a monthly price, with usage limits, that ends up being less costly than pay-as-you-go token purchases through the Claude API. Essentially, the economics are similar to an all-you-can-eat buffet that&#39;s priced with certain usage expectations.

That practice, effectively a subsidy for subscribers, led to token arbitrage. Customers accessed Claude models via subscriptions linked to third-party harnesses because it cost less than doing the same work via API key.

The AI biz&#39;s Consumer Terms of Service have forbidden the use of third-party harnesses, except with specific authorization since at least February 2024. The contractual language in Section 3.7, which remains unchanged from that time, says as much – any automated access tool not officially endorsed is forbidden.

Despite the presence of that passage for more than two years, a variety of third-party tools have flouted that rule and have allowed users to supply a Claude subscription account key.

The added rule explicitly states that OAuth authentication, the access method used for Claude Free, Pro, and Max tier subscribers, is only intended for Claude Code and Claude.ai (the web interface for Claude models).

&quot;Using OAuth tokens obtained through Claude Free, Pro, or Max accounts in any other product, tool, or service — including the Agent SDK — is not permitted and constitutes a violation of the Consumer Terms of Service,&quot; the updated legal compliance page says.

According to Anthropic, the update represents an attempt to clarify existing policy language to make it consistent throughout company documentation.

Anthropic appears to have decided to police its rules at the start of the year. In a January social media thread, Anthropic engineer Thariq Shihipar said the company had taken steps to prevent third-party tools from &quot;spoofing the Claude Code harness.&quot;

&quot;Third-party harnesses using Claude subscriptions create problems for users and are prohibited by our Terms of Service,&quot; he wrote. &quot;They generate unusual traffic patterns without any of the usual telemetry that the Claude Code harness provides, making it really hard for us to help debug when they have questions about rate limit usage or account bans and they don&#39;t have any other avenue for this support.&quot;

The prohibition proved unpopular enough to elicit a response from the competition. OpenAI&#39;s Thibault Sottiaux pointedly endorsed the use of Codex subscriptions in third-party harnesses.

After banning accounts for attempting to game its pricing structure, Anthropic has now clarified its legalese, as Shihipar indicated would happen, and makers of third-party harnesses are taking note.

On Thursday, OpenCode pushed code to remove support for Claude Pro and Max account keys and Claude API keys. The commit cites &quot;anthropic legal requests.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Someone compromised open source AI coding assistant Cline CLI&#39;s npm package earlier this week in an odd supply chain attack that secretly installed OpenClaw on developers&#39; machines without their knowledge.

The incident occurred on Tuesday, when an &quot;unauthorized party&quot; used a compromised token to publish an update to Cline CLI on its npm registry that installs OpenClaw - the AI agent platform slash security nightmare - on users&#39; computers when they install cline@2.3.0.

&quot;Users who installed Cline CLI cline@2.3.0 during the approximately 8-hour window between 3:26 AM PT and 11:30 AM PT on February 17 will have openclaw globally installed,&quot; Cline&#39;s maintainers said in a security advisory. &quot;The openclaw package is a legitimate open source project and is not malicious, but its installation was not authorized or intended.&quot;

The maintainers also revoked the compromised token, and added that &quot;npm publishing now uses OIDC provenance via GitHub Actions.&quot;

Anyone who installed Cline during this time period should update to a fixed version (2.4.0 or higher) and check their environment for a surprise OpenClaw installation.

Earlier this month, security researcher Adnan Khan found and disclosed a prompt injection vulnerability (since fixed) to Cline that could be abused for this exact purpose.

&quot;To make sure it&#39;s clear in the midst of the NPM package situation: I did NOT conduct overt testing on Cline&#39;s repository,&quot; Khan said in an update to his research.

&quot;I conducted my PoC on a mirror of Cline to confirm the prompt injection vulnerability,&quot; he added. &quot;A different actor found my PoC on my test repository and used it to directly attack Cline and obtain the publication credentials.&quot;

Microsoft did note a &quot;small but noticeable uptick in installations of OpenClaw initiated by Cline CLI installation script&quot; during the eight-hour supply chain incident on February 17.

StepSecurity, meanwhile, reported that the compromised version was downloaded about 4,000 times before the package maintainers deprecated it.

We don&#39;t know who&#39;s responsible for slipping OpenClaw into Cline&#39;s npm registry - and for what purposes other than creating more chaotic AI agents.  ®

            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/spacex_falcon_europe_breakup_lithium_plume/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that burned up over Europe last year left a massive lithium plume in its wake, say a group of scientists. They warn the disaster is likely a sign of things to come as Earth&#39;s atmosphere continues to become a heavily trafficked superhighway to space.

In a paper published Thursday, an international group of scientists reports what they say is the first measurement of upper-atmosphere pollution resulting from the re-entry of space debris, as well as the first time ground-based light detection and ranging (lidar) has been shown to be able to detect space debris ablation.

The measurements stem from a SpaceX Falcon 9 upper stage that sprung an oxygen leak about a year ago, sending it into an uncontrolled re-entry. Then it broke up and rained debris down on Poland. The rocket not only littered farm fields, but also injected lithium into the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT), where ground-based sensors detected a tenfold increase at an altitude of 96 km about 20 hours after the rocket re-entered the atmosphere, according to the paper.

Lithium was selected for the study because of its considerable presence in spacecraft, both in lithium-ion batteries and lithium-aluminum alloy used in the construction of spacecraft. A single Falcon 9 upper stage, like the one that broke up over Poland and released the lithium plume, is estimated to contain 30 kg of lithium just in the alloy used in tank walls.

By contrast, around 80 grams of lithium enter the atmosphere per day from cosmic dust particles, the researchers noted.

&quot;This finding supports growing concerns that space traffic may pollute the upper atmosphere in ways not yet fully understood,&quot; the paper notes, adding that the continued re-entry of spacecraft and satellites is of particular concern given how the composition of spacecraft is different from natural meteoroids.

&quot;Satellites and rocket stages introduce engineered materials such as aluminium alloys, composite structures, and rare earth elements from onboard electronics, substances rarely found in natural extraterrestrial matter,&quot; the paper explained. &quot;The consequences of increasing pollution from re-entering space debris on radiative transfer, ozone chemistry, and aerosol microphysics remain largely unknown.&quot;

The effect on Earth&#39;s atmosphere posed by spacecraft and satellite re-entry is one that&#39;s been a growing concern for astrophysicists like Harvard sky-watcher Jonathan McDowell, who has echoed similar concerns to The Register as the European scientists raised in their paper.

&quot;Using the upper atmosphere as an incinerator&quot; is a massive blind spot, McDowell told us in a discussion last year. He said today that he hadn&#39;t yet had a chance to review the Falcon 9 lithium plume paper, but told us it&#39;s important research to further our understanding of a largely unknown risk to the planet and all life on it.

As we noted previously, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has reported that roughly 10 percent of sampled sulfuric acid particles in the stratosphere contain aluminum and other exotic metals consistent with the burn-up of rockets and satellites. The body believes that number could grow to as much as 50 percent in the coming years as launch cadences, and re-entries, increase.

&quot;Beyond this single event, recurring re-entries may sustain an increased level of anthropogenic flux of metals and metal oxides into the middle atmosphere with cumulative, climate-relevant consequences,&quot; the researchers explained in the Falcon 9 paper.

This latest bit of research from Europe shows that we can at least trace atmospheric space launch aerosols to their source, the research team says, no matter how many unknowns remain to be discovered.

They also warn that &quot;coordinated, multi-site observations&quot; and &quot;whole-atmosphere chemistry-climate modelling&quot; will be needed to better understand how re-entry emissions influence atmospheric chemistry and particle formation.

We reached out to the authors for more information, including the potential health effects if any, and will update this if we hear back. ®

            <h2>Cerebras plans humongous AI supercomputer in India backed by UAE</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/20/india_ai_supercomputer_cerebras_uae/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Nvidia rival Cerebras Systems&#39; dinner plate-sized accelerators will power a new supercomputing cluster in India capable of 8 exaFLOPS of AI compute.

The installation, announced in New Delhi during the AI Impact Summit this week, is part of a collaboration between the United Arab Emirates&#39; Mohamed Bin Zayed University of AI (MBZUAI) and India&#39;s Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC).

The system itself will be deployed by the UAE&#39;s AI crown jewel, technology company G42, in a bid to bolster the nation&#39;s sovereign compute capacity. If G42 sounds familiar, that&#39;s because the UAE-based cloud provider and AI model dev is one of Cerebras&#39; largest backers, having previously financed the chip startup&#39;s Condor Galaxy deployment effort at an estimated cost of $900 million.

G42 has sought to carve out a niche by helping other nations build sovereign AI models trained in their native languages. Late last year, the cloud provider released NANDA 87B, an 87 billion parameter open weights model trained in Hindi and English.

&quot;Sovereign AI infrastructure is becoming essential for national competitiveness,&quot; CEO of G42 India Manu Jain said in a canned statement. &quot;This project brings that capability to India at a national scale, enabling local researchers, innovators, and enterprises to become AI-native while maintaining full data sovereignty and security.&quot;

While the system will be deployed by G42, the company says it&#39;ll be operated under India-defined governance frameworks and that all data will remain within the nation&#39;s borders. Once operational, the supercomputer will be made available to Indian universities, startups, and small and mid-sized businesses.

Cerebras tells El Reg the super will be powered by its WSE-3 wafer-scale accelerators. A little back-of-the-napkin math tells us that the machine will likely feature 64 of Cerebras&#39; WSE-3 wafer-scale accelerators, each of which is capable of churning out 125 petaFLOPS of highly sparse 16-bit floating point performance.

These massive chips are somewhat unique in that they don&#39;t rely on pricey high-bandwidth memory (HBM) commonly found in Nvidia and AMD GPUs, and instead use lightning-fast on-chip SRAM. Each of Cerebras&#39; 23 kW CS-3 systems features 44 GB of SRAM good for 21 petabytes a second of memory bandwidth. That&#39;s roughly 1,000x faster than the HBM4 on Nvidia&#39;s newly announced Rubin GPUs.

Originally designed for AI training, the chip&#39;s speedy SRAM has made it particularly potent for memory-bound AI inference workloads. Artificial Analysis reports Cerebras can serve gpt-oss 120b High at nearly 2,853 tokens a second per user, more than 3x faster than the next fastest GPU-based inference provider. This no doubt played into OpenAI&#39;s decision to begin deploying select models on Cerebras&#39; hardware last month.

Today’s announcement comes just days after AMD and Nvidia unveiled several large-scale deployments in India powered by their respective compute platforms. As part of the partnership with Tata Consultancy Services, AMD will deploy 200 MW of its next-gen Helios racks powered by its MI455X.

Indian cloud service provider Yotta said it planned to field a cluster of 20,000 Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Bit barn builders Larsen and Toubro also laid out plans for a giga-scale AI datacenter network, beginning with a 30 MW facility in Chennai and a 40 megawatt site in Mumbai. Among its first tenants will be E2E Networks’ deployment of B200 accelerators. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Las Vegas hotel and casino giant Wynn Resorts appears to be the latest victim of data-grabbing and extortion gang ShinyHunters.

On Friday, the cybercrime crew listed the hospitality company on its blog, claiming to have stolen more than 800,000 records containing employees&#39; Social Security numbers and other private details. The extortionists set a February 23 deadline for Wynn to &quot;reach out&quot; and threatened to leak the data, &quot;along with several annoying (digital) problems that&#39;ll come your way,&quot; if the resort chain did not comply with the demands.

Samples of the stolen data seen by The Register contain employees&#39; full names, emails, phone numbers, positions, salaries, start dates, birthdays, and other personal information.

Wynn Resorts, which owns five resorts, 81 restaurants, and 200 high-end retail outlets, did not immediately respond to The Register&#39;s inquiries. We will update this story when we hear back from the company.

ShinyHunters set a fee of 22.34 Bitcoin (about $1.5 million) as the &quot;starting price&quot; for the stolen files, according to a spokesperson for the crime group, who told The Register that the digital intruders gained initial access to Wynn&#39;s systems in September 2025 via an Oracle PeopleSoft vulnerability using an employee&#39;s credentials.

Shiny declined to say if it got the Wynn employee to give up the credentials via a social engineering trick, or simply paid the individual for access. The group has previously used Telegram to solicit insider access, and in one case reportedly claimed it agreed to pay a CrowdStrike employee $25,000 for access, though the security shop said no systems were breached.

The claimed Wynn Resorts breach follows a slew of recent ShinyHunters intrusions, several of which involved voice phishing to obtain single-sign-on codes from users of Okta, Microsoft, and Google services.

It&#39;s also notable that nearly three years ago, a group with ties to ShinyHunters&#39; crime collaborative hacked two other major Vegas hotel and casino chains: Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts.

In late 2023, Scattered Spider abused Okta SSO codes and help-desk calls to break into both resort chains&#39; networks, deployed ransomware on their networks, and stole data belonging to tens of thousands of customers.

In September 2025, Las Vegas cops cuffed a teen linked to the casino hacks shortly after British police arrested two other teens accused of being members of the notorious cybercrime gang.

At least seven other suspected Scattered Spider members were arrested in 2024 as part of wider probes following the Las Vegas resort intrusions.  ®

Any ebook reader will let you cram a Beauty and the Beast-sized library’s worth of books in your pocket, but so will your phone. An ebook reader offers a more book-like reading experience, with fewer distractions and less eye strain, and many include extra features, like adjustable frontlighting. Some really are pocketable. Others are waterproof or offer physical page-turning buttons, while a few even let you take notes.

I’ve been using ebook readers for more than a decade, and I’ve gone hands-on with dozens, from the Kindle Paperwhite to lesser-known rivals like the PocketBook Era. Whether you want something your kid can throw against the wall or a waterproof, warm-glow Kindle that won’t ruin your spa ambiance, these are the best ebook readers for everyone.

Upgrades aren’t as significant as the last PaperwhiteLacks stylus support and page turn buttonsSignature Edition wireless charging is frustrating without magnetsSignature Edition back panel feels less grippy

Dimensions: 7 x 5 x .3 inches / Weight: 211 grams / Screen area and resolution: 7-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / Storage: 16GB / Other features: IPX8 waterproofing, Bluetooth audio support

If you mostly buy ebooks from Amazon, you’ll want a Kindle, and the 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite is the best choice for most people. It’s $70 cheaper than the Kobo Libra Colour — my top non-Amazon e-reader — yet offers many of the same features, including a spacious 7-inch 300pi display with rich contrast levels. Unlike Amazon’s entry-level Kindle, it also features IPX8 water resistance and an adjustable warm frontlight that reduces blue light, which can interrupt melatonin production. The $199.99 Signature Edition Paperwhite also supports wireless charging, a rare feature in an e-reader.

Amazon dominates the US ebook market, so Kindle owners have access to advantages that owners of other ebook readers don’t. Much of Amazon’s hardware strategy depends on offering cut-rate discounts to pull you into its content ecosystem. If you have Prime and buy a lot of Kindle ebooks, the Paperwhite is the best choice because its ebooks and audiobooks are often on sale at Amazon, and Prime members get more free content through Prime Reading. Rivals like Kobo offer sales, too, but it’s hard for them to offer discounts as steep as Amazon.

There are downsides, though. The Paperwhite includes lockscreen ads unless you pay $20 to remove them, and its size can make one-handed reading uncomfortable. More significantly, like all Kindles, it uses a proprietary format and doesn’t natively support EPUB, the open standard used by most other ebook stores. If you often shop from Kobo’s bookstore, Barnes & Noble, or Google Play Books, you’ll need to convert and transfer file formats in order to read them on a Kindle. If you mostly stick with Amazon, though, you’ll be more than happy with the Paperwhite.

Getting books from other stores onto the device can be toughMore expensive than the Kindle PaperwhiteLacks the vibrancy of other color e-readersNo wireless charging

Dimensions: 5.69 x 6.34 x 0.33 inches / Weight: 199.5 grams / Screen area and resolution: 7-inch screen, 300ppi (black-and-white), 150ppi (color) / Storage: 32GB / Other features: Physical page-turning buttons, waterproofing, Kobo Stylus 2 support, Bluetooth audio support

The Kobo Libra Colour is a great alternative to Amazon’s ebook readers, particularly for readers outside the US or anyone who prefers not to buy into Amazon’s ecosystem. It offers many of the standout features found on the 12th-gen Paperwhite — including waterproofing, USB-C, and a 300ppi display — along with a few extra perks. Most notably, it uses E Ink’s latest Kaleido color technology, delivering soft, pastel-like hues that still pop in direct sunlight. Resolution drops to 150ppi when viewing color, but it still makes viewing a wider range of content more pleasant, even if images aren’t nearly as vivid as those on a traditional tablet or the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition.

Unlike Amazon’s Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition, the Libra Colour also works with a stylus (sold separately), letting you highlight in multiple colors, annotate books, and use Kobo’s integrated notebooks. It borrows some more advanced tools from the Kobo Elipsa 2E, too, including handwriting-to-text conversion and math-solving, allowing it to double as a small digital notebook. It also includes physical page-turn buttons, lacks lockscreen ads, supports more file formats (including EPUB), and makes borrowing from OverDrive libraries relatively straightforward. A recent update even provides support for Instapaper, letting you save articles, blog posts, and other content for offline viewing.

However, at $229.99, the Libra Colour costs $70 more than the entry-level Paperwhite — and that’s without Kobo’s $69.99 stylus, which is required to perform certain tasks. The gap widens further when the Paperwhite is on sale, which happens more frequently. The Libra Colour also can’t easily access Amazon’s ebook library, either, so longtime Kindle users may need third-party tools to convert their purchases. Still, if those things don’t matter or apply to you, the Libra Colour offers the most versatile and enjoyable reading experience of any e-reader on this list. It remains my personal favorite.

Excellent, high-resolution displayEasy to hold with one handFaster than its predecessor with improved battery lifeFun color options

No waterproofingLacks adjustable color temperatureSlightly more expensive than its predecessor

Dimensions: 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32 inches / Weight: 158 grams / Screen area and resolution: 6-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / Storage: 16GB / Other features: USB-C support, Bluetooth audio support

The base-model Kindle ($109.99 with ads) is the best cheap ebook reader. Its 300ppi resolution makes text clearer and easier to read than the lower-resolution screens on other ebook readers in its price range. Plus, it has USB-C for relatively fast charging.

Reading on its six-inch screen feels a little more cramped than it does on the larger displays of the Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Libra Colour. However, the flip side is that its small size makes it pocketable, light, and easy for small hands to hold. Combined with its relatively affordable price, the Kindle is also the best ebook reader for kids — especially the Amazon Kindle Kids Edition, which costs $20 more. The kid-friendly version shares the same specs but is ad-free with parental controls, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a case. It also includes six months of Amazon Kids Plus, which grants kids access to thousands of children’s books and audiobooks for free. After that, though, you’ll have to pay $79 per year (or $48 with Amazon Prime).

The base Kindle doesn’t have extra conveniences like the waterproofing, which you’ll find in the entry-level Kobo Clara BW and aforementioned Kindle Paperwhite. You also don’t get the physical page-turning buttons found on entry-level e-readers like Barnes & Noble’s Nook GlowLight 4e (though the Kindle is a lot snappier than the Nook). And because it’s an Amazon ebook reader, you’re also locked into the Amazon ecosystem and have to pay extra to remove ads. But if you can do without that, the Kindle delivers the essentials for under $110.

Of all the large ebook readers I’ve tested, the Kobo Elipsa 2E stood out the most because it’s a good e-reader with solid note-taking abilities. You can write directly on pages just as in a physical book. The Kindle Scribe lets you annotate book pages as well, but it’s complicated, involving resizable text boxes that mess up the page formatting and prevent you from doing basic things like circling words. In contrast, taking notes on the Elipsa 2E feels far more intuitive and natural.

The Elipsa 2E offers other helpful note-taking tools and capabilities. Like the Kobo Libra Colour, it’s capable, for example, of solving math equations for you. You can also insert diagrams and drawings, and it’ll automatically snap them into something that looks cleaner and nicer. You can also sync your notes with Dropbox or view them online and convert handwriting to typed text. The Kindle Scribe offers the latter capability, too, but again, Kobo does it faster and better within the original notebook document rather than on a separate page. The only thing missing from the Elipsa 2E is the Scribe’s note-summarization feature, but that’s a tradeoff I am okay with given how much easier it is to take notes.

Note-taking capabilities aside, the Kobo Elipsa 2E is also a good e-reader with the same strengths and weaknesses as other Kobo devices. There’s support for a wide range of file formats, but you can’t easily read Kindle books without converting them first. Its 227ppi display is also slightly less sharp than the 300ppi screen found on the Kindle Scribe and the Kobo Libra Colour. However, the 10.3-inch screen balances things out a bit and makes text easier to read, so it’s not a noticeable drawback. Plus, the Elipsa 2E comes with an adjustable warm light for nighttime reading. That’s a feature rival e-readers with more advanced note-taking capabilities — including the $409.99 Onyx Boox Go 10.3, which lets you insert links to notes — lack.

There are some other ebook readers my colleagues and I have tested that I didn’t feature above, but are still worth highlighting. Here are the most notable:

The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is the first Kindle to feature E Ink’s color screen technology, and it stands out from other color e-paper devices with customizations. It offers improved contrast, more vibrant colors, and faster screen refreshes. With a $279.99 price tag, it’s the most expensive Kindle model currently available that doesn’t support a stylus for note-taking, and it includes premium features like wireless charging that are convenient but not really necessary for a device with months of battery life. If you want a color screen and want to stick with Amazon, the Colorsoft Signature is your best option. - Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter

Amazon recently introduced a more affordable alternative to the $279.99 Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition called the Kindle Colorsoft. It’s $30 cheaper and delivers a nearly identical reading experience, but lacks wireless charging and only offers 16GB of storage. That’s plenty of space for ebooks, but it might not be enough if you own a lot of graphic novels. The entry-level Kindle Colorsoft also supports Amazon’s new “Send to Alexa Plus” feature, which lets you send notes or documents to Amazon’s Alexa Plus assistant for summaries, to-do lists, reminders, or brainstorming. After a day of testing, I found it useful overall, though it sometimes lacked nuance.

The biggest drawback for me, as a bedtime bookworm, is the lack of an auto-adjusting front light, which can make nighttime reading much easier (however, its brightness and color temperature can be manually adjusted). Given that the Colorsoft Signature Edition costs just $30 more, complete with a front light that adjusts when the room gets dim, 32GB of storage, and wireless charging, I’d opt for that instead if you’re in Amazon’s ecosystem. Unless the standard Colorsoft goes on sale for less, it’s not a great value at its regular price.

If you’re looking for a non-Amazon alternative that’s more affordable than the Kobo Libra Colour, the Kobo Clara Colour — the successor to the Kobo Clara 2E — is worth a look. At $159.99, the ad-free e-reader costs more than the Kobo Clara 2E, but I think it’s worth the extra $10. It continues to offer the same six-inch display and IPX8 waterproof design, but the e-reader now offers color. It’s also noticeably faster — something I was happy to see, considering the occasional lag on the Clara 2E sometimes got on my nerves. You don’t get the Clara Colour’s physical buttons or stylus support, but that’s a fair tradeoff at this price point.

Last year, the company also announced a white version for the same price that touts a slightly larger 1,900mAh battery (up from 1,500mAh on the black model), which Kobo says can last over a month on a single charge.

In 2023, Barnes and Noble released the Nook Glowlight 4 Plus. If you own a lot of digital books from Barnes and Noble, this could be a good Kindle alternative. Otherwise, I’d still recommend the Kobo Libra Colour to everybody else. The $199.99 Nook Glowlight 4 Plus is a good e-reader with a lot to offer, including a lovely 300ppi screen, waterproofing, physical page-turning buttons, and even a headphone jack. However, it’s just not as snappy, which makes setting it up, buying books from the device itself, and navigating the interface a slow ordeal. It didn’t help that the screen sometimes froze, too, which meant I had to restart the device while in the middle of a book.

Despite all the advantages of E Ink display technology, your smartphone is probably still a more convenient device for reading given how pocket-friendly it is. The Boox Palma 2 is a smartphone-sized E Ink device that’s just as easy to slip into a pocket, but with more capabilities than an e-reader. Its 6.3-inch E Ink display is great for reading books, but the $299.99 Palma 2 also runs Android 13, so you can install productivity apps like email and messaging — assuming you’ve got access to Wi-Fi, of course, because the compact e-reader lacks cellular connectivity. If you already have the original Palma, the sequel isn’t worth the upgrade. But if you’re looking for a smaller alternative to Kindles and Kobos, the Palma 2 could be worth the splurge. - Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter

The $409.99 Onyx Boox Go 10.3 is another ad-free ebook reader you can use to take notes. It’s excellent as a note-taking device, and it offers an impressively wide range of writing tools and more prebuilt notebook templates than Kobo’s Elipsa 2E. Jotting down notes using the built-in notebook felt more akin to writing on paper as well, and its slim design makes the device feel more like a traditional notebook. Like all Boox devices, it also provides quick access to the Google Play Store, so you can download multiple reading apps — including both Kindle and Kobo apps. The slate’s crisp 300ppi display is sharper than that of the Kobo Elipsa 2E, too, which is a plus.

However, compared to the easy-to-use Elipsa 2E, the Go 10.3 lacks a front light and has a steeper learning curve. Notes you take on a Kindle or Kobo device won’t transfer over (and vice versa), and you can’t annotate books in either app using the Boox. I also felt like access to Google Play can be a double-edged sword as it grants easy access to distracting apps, including games, streaming services, and TikTok. It’s too slow to use the latter, but it’s fast and comfortable enough that I found myself playing around with the Word Search app far too often. For me personally, I need my e-reader to be devoid of such distractions — it’s one of the biggest things that distinguishes it from a tablet, after all. But if you’ve got more self-control than I do, the Go 10.3 could be worth a look.

In April, Boox introduced the Go Color 7 Gen II, which retails for $279.99. This water-resistant e-reader offers a 300ppi display that drops to 150ppi when displaying color content, much like its Kobo and Kindle rivals. However, similar to the Kobo Libra Colour, this ad-free model offers physical-page turning buttons and supports note-taking. A stylus isn’t included, so you’ll need to spend an extra $45.99 for Boox’s pressure-sensitive InkSense pen if you want to take notes. And, like other Boox devices, it runs on Android, giving you access to a wide range of apps and online bookstores through the Google Play Store.

While I appreciated not having to sideload my Kindle and Kobo library, along with greater flexibility to fine-tune color settings, I ultimately prefer the Kobo Libra Colour. In my testing, the Go Color 7 Gen II felt frustratingly sluggish by comparison to the Libra Colour, which is disappointing given the Boox costs $50 more. Responsiveness is a core part of the reading experience for me, so I’d only recommend Boox’s model to readers who value having Android app flexibility over performance.

The $629.99 Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is Amazon’s first color e-reader that’s also designed for note-taking. In her review, my colleague Victoria Song praised its thin, lightweight design, long battery life, and minimal ghosting effect. However, she thought the 11-inch display feels too large for reading or note-taking, and that the muted E Ink colors limit the appeal for artists who want to draw things beyond basic doodles. It’s also a shame that many of its best annotation features — including in-line writing and the AI-powered summarization and search tools — don’t extend to other document types, such as PDFs.

When testing a new ebook reader, I make sure to use it as my primary device for at least a full week. For those seven days, if not longer, that e-reader is my principal way of consuming ebooks, audiobooks, and most articles from the web (if applicable). If the device has note-taking capabilities, I’ll use it to annotate books and jot down various reminders, to-do lists, and notes. I’ll even use it for some light journaling, as well as doodling.On average, I tend to read for about an hour a day — longer on weekends — either for work or to unwind at the beach, in bed, or in the bathtub. I buy books directly from each e-reader’s respective bookstore, borrow library books via Overdrive, and try to sideload various file formats to see how easy it is to do.

How easy is it to use and read on? A sharp display and relatively fast performance are essential to an enjoyable reading experience, as are size and weight.

Some e-readers come with different features, like waterproofing, which means you really can read anywhere. Others offer buttons that make using the e-reader more intuitive to use.

There must be easy, direct access to a wide selection of digital titles, including audiobooks and various file formats.

Is the price justified, given what the e-reader offers?

Update, February 20th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added a mention of Amazon’s new “Send to Alexa Plus” feature. Andrew Liszewski also contributed to this post.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After nearly 40 years at Microsoft, Xbox chief and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer is leaving the company, along with Xbox president Sarah Bond. Spencer’s retirement was announced in a memo from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on February 20th, stating, “Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we’ve been talking about succession planning.”

Last summer, Microsoft responded to rumors of Spencer’s retirement, saying at the time that he was “not retiring anytime soon.” Microsoft’s CoreAI president, Asha Sharma, will be moving into Spencer’s former role as Microsoft Gaming CEO, while Matt Booty is being promoted to EVP and chief content officer.

Follow along below for the latest updates on Microsoft’s Xbox leadership changes

Xbox has new leaders today, now that Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond are out — and you’d be forgiven for assuming that means yet another round of layoffs and shuttered studios, especially one day after Sony jettisoned a beloved developer.

Not yet, it seems. “To be clear, there are no organizational changes underway for our studios,” Microsoft Gaming EVP Matt Booty wrote in his memo today. It’s a little buried under everything else Microsoft’s outgoing and incoming gaming CEOs are saying, so figure it’s worth dragging to the surface!

The big shakeup at Xbox means that Asha Sharma is taking over for Phil Spencer as CEO of Microsoft Gaming. Her previous role at Microsoft was AI-focused, and here’s what she has to say about utilizing AI for games:

As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.

Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer has just announced he’s leaving the company after 12 years leading Xbox and nearly 40 at Microsoft in total. His replacement: Asha Sharma, formerly head of development for Microsoft’s AI enterprise teams. Before that, she was COO of Instacart for three years, and spent four at Meta in charge of the company’s messaging apps.

What will Sharma do with Xbox? Read for yourself in her first internal memo, which we’ve printed in full below.

Xbox chief Phil Spencer has just announced to employees that he’s leaving Microsoft after 38 years. In a memo entitled “A new chapter for Microsoft Gaming,” Spencer reveals to Xbox employees that he made the decision to retire from Microsoft last fall.

He also reveals Xbox president Sarah Bond is leaving Microsoft, triggering a big change in management at Xbox. Asha Sharma, currently the president of CoreAI product at Microsoft, is stepping into the Microsoft Gaming CEO role, reporting directly to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

Xbox chief Phil Spencer is leaving Microsoft after nearly 40 years at the software giant. Xbox president Sarah Bond is also leaving Microsoft, in what is a major shake-up to the management of Xbox and Microsoft’s gaming efforts. Asha Sharma, currently president of CoreAI product, is taking over as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced Phil Spencer’s retirement in a memo to all Microsoft employees today. “Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we’ve been talking about succession planning,” says Nadella. “I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership. Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it.”

Sarah Bond, the president and COO of Xbox, is leaving the organization, along with CEO of Microsoft Gaming Phil Spencer. Her departure is being announced at the same time as Spencer’s, with Asha Sharma moving into the EVP and CEO of Gaming role and Matt Booty being promoted to EVP and chief content officer.

Microsoft is making the changes as it is undergoing some dramatic shifts to its Xbox plans, including bringing Windows and Xbox closer together to empower devices like the Xbox Ally handheld instead of relying entirely on first-party Xbox hardware. The company is also navigating increased pressures on the Xbox business, major layoffs, and hits to Xbox studios.

We have good reasons to believe in what’s ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.

My focus is on supporting the teams and leaders we have in place and creating the conditions for them to do their best work. To be clear, there are no organizational changes underway for our studios.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">﻿In a 6-3 decision, the US Supreme Court said that some of Donald Trump’s aggressive tariffs on imports were not permitted.

﻿In a 6-3 decision, the US Supreme Court said that some of Donald Trump’s aggressive tariffs on imports were not permitted.

The US Supreme Court struck down some of Donald Trump’s tariffs on foreign imports, which have become a hallmark of the chaos of the second Trump administration.

The court’s ruling deals specifically with duties levied using a law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), something no other president has done — the 1977 law was initially created to limit presidential ability to declare a national emergency only to times when the threat came from outside the US. The legality of using the IEEPA to tariff imports has been in question since the taxes were announced last year; the IEEPA was used to try to justify steep tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as so-called “reciprocal” tariffs applied to goods coming into the US from just about every other country on Earth. The IEEPA was also invoked to end the de minimis exemption, which allowed for packages under a certain value to enter the US duty-free.

Other tariffs imposed outside of the IEEPA — like those on steel and aluminum and other industry-specific taxes — won’t find relief from Friday’s Supreme Court ruling. Additionally, the Trump administration is looking for other ways to impose tariffs: At a press briefing on Friday, Trump railed against the Supreme Court justices while praising dissenting Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and he vowed to levy additional blanket tariffs and open investigations into unfair trade practices in the future.

“Bottom line, industry should expect a continued high tariff environment for the foreseeable future.”

It’s still unclear what this will mean for importers, small businesses, and consumers who have paid billions in taxes as a result of Trump’s tariffs — the ruling does not directly address how refunds would work, if at all. In his dissent, Kavanaugh notes that the US Treasury may be required to refund importers who paid tariffs under the IEEPA, and that the process to return the money could be a “mess.” The New York Times reports that refund requests could total $120 billion, although consumers, who are often the party ultimately paying for tariffs, are unlikely to get that money back. Monica Gorman, managing director at Crowell Global Advisors who worked on manufacturing under Joe Biden, told The Verge in an email that the issue will now go to the Court of International Trade and could take months to sort out.

“The president has announced Section 122 tariffs effective almost immediately at a 10 percent rate. Although the 122 statute is limited to 150 days without a subsequent act of Congress, this will buy time for the administration to pursue additional tariff actions under Section 301 and other tariff statutes,” Gorman said. “Bottom line, industry should expect a continued high tariff environment for the foreseeable future.”

The National Retail Federation said the decision “provides much-needed certainty for US businesses and manufacturers,” and called for “a seamless process to refund the tariffs to U.S. importers.”

Small businesses were some of the first and most vocal opponents of Trump’s tariffs, and US-based companies relying on components and parts from abroad sounded the alarm early on. We Pay the Tariffs, a coalition of hundreds of small businesses, issued a statement celebrating the ruling but cautioned that “a legal victory is meaningless without actual relief for the businesses that paid these tariffs.

“The administration’s only responsible course of action now is to establish a fast, efficient, and automatic refund process that returns tariff money to the businesses that paid it. Small businesses cannot afford to wait months or years while bureaucratic delays play out, nor can they afford expensive litigation just to recover money that was unlawfully collected from them in the first place. These businesses need their money back now.”

From the beginning, Trump used tariffs as a cudgel for obedience from foreign governments and big corporations, meaning the taxes were both massively disruptive and subject to change at any moment, especially if a party rolled over for the administration. The rapidly changing nature of tariffs meant that businesses and consumers were reacting in real time. Now, we’re in a new era of uncertainty but with different questions — some consumers and businesses will want to once again stock up for an unclear future.

To be sure, the SCOTUS decision is a blow to Trump’s agenda, but businesses and consumers are still living in a trade nightmare of the president’s own making: The Port of Los Angeles told CNN it’s expecting an influx of cargo ships as American importers rush to bring inventory into the country. Kathryn Anne Edwards, economist and policy consultant, told The Verge in an email that there’s still uncertainty after the ruling.

“Taking control of tariffs out of [Trump’s] hands is unequivocally good for the economy,” she said. “That’s not to say the ruling won’t cause harm, but he was using the American consumer as leverage.”

As economists warned, the American consumer is likely to foot the bill — for future tariffs imposed by Trump, for refunds, and for a new normal of higher prices that companies have no reason to roll back.

“I think the political blowback could be incredible, given that companies are poised to see a refund, but consumers are not,” Edwards said. Approval rates and attitudes toward businesses had hit historic lows as it is, she said.

“Many people will view this as a payoff to companies at their expense.”

His replacement: Asha Sharma, formerly head of development for Microsoft’s AI enterprise teams. Before that, she was COO of Instacart for three years, and spent four at Meta in charge of the company’s messaging apps.

What will Sharma do with Xbox? Read for yourself in her first internal memo, which we’ve printed in full below.

Sharma says she is committed to “the return of Xbox,” games in “new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most,” and that games will “always will be art, crafted by humans” while promising not to “flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop.”

However, she also says that “monetization and AI will evolve and influence this future,” and it sounds like Microsoft will still pursue Xbox Everywhere — she isn’t returning to the definition of Xbox as a physical box alone. While she does promise “a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console,” she writes that Xbox will “expand across PC, mobile, and cloud” as well.

Today I begin my role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.

I feel two things at once: humility and urgency.

Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction.

I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward.

Thank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it.

Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most.I promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.

We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world.

We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.

Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.

We are witnessing the reinvention of play.

To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.

As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.

The next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through. We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not.

Thank you for welcoming me into this journey.

And here’s the full memo from Matt Booty, who is now Microsoft’s chief content officer and EVP of Microsoft Gaming:

I read Phil’s note with much gratitude. He has been a steady champion for game creators and our studio teams, and I’ve learned so much from his leadership over the years. All our games have benefited from his foundational support. I’m also grateful to Satya for his ongoing commitment to gaming and holding a vision of how it can connect back to the larger company.

Looking forward, I’m excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO. Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success. She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.

We have good reasons to believe in what’s ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.

My focus is on supporting the teams and leaders we have in place and creating the conditions for them to do their best work. To be clear, there are no organizational changes underway for our studios.

Thanks for everything you do for players and for each other.

Asha Sharma is now stepping into the role of Microsoft Gaming CEO.

Xbox chief Phil Spencer has just announced to employees that he’s leaving Microsoft after 38 years. In a memo entitled “A new chapter for Microsoft Gaming,” Spencer reveals to Xbox employees that he made the decision to retire from Microsoft last fall.

He also reveals Xbox president Sarah Bond is leaving Microsoft, triggering a big change in management at Xbox. Asha Sharma, currently the president of CoreAI product at Microsoft, is stepping into the Microsoft Gaming CEO role, reporting directly to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

Here’s Phil Spencer’s full memo on his retirement:

When I walked through Microsoft’s doors as an intern in June of 1988, I could never have imagined the products I’d help build, the players and customers we’d serve, or the extraordinary teams I’d be lucky enough to join. It’s been an epic ride and truly the privilege of a lifetime.

Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life. From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.

Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team.Working with her over the past several months has given me tremendous confidence. She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we’re committed to getting it right. I’ll remain in an advisory role through the summer to support a smooth handoff.

I’m also grateful for the strength of our studios organization. Matt Booty and our studios teams continue to build an incredible portfolio, and I have full confidence in the leadership and creative momentum across our global studios. I want to congratulate Matt on his promotion to EVP and Chief Content Officer.

As part of this transition, Sarah Bond has decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter. Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history. I’m grateful for her partnership and the impact she’s had, and I wish her the very best in what comes next.

Most of all, to everyone in Microsoft Gaming, I want to say “thank you”. I’ve learned so much from this team and community, grown alongside you, and been continually inspired by the creativity, courage, and care you bring to players, creators, and to one another every day.

I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together over the last 25 years, and I have complete confidence in all of you and in the opportunities ahead. I’ll be cheering you on in this next chapter as Xbox’s proudest fan and player.

Microsoft has a new plan to prove what’s real and what’s AI online

AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views.It is into this mess that Microsoft has put forward a blueprint, shared with MIT Technology Review, for how to prove what’s real online.An AI safety research team at the company recently evaluated how methods for documenting digital manipulation are faring against today’s most worrying AI developments, like interactive deepfakes and widely accessible hyperrealistic models. It then recommended technical standards that can be adopted by AI companies and social media platforms. Read the full story.

Measles cases are rising. Other vaccine-preventable infections could be next.

There’s a measles outbreak happening close to where I live. Since the start of this year, 34 cases have been confirmed in Enfield, a northern borough of London.It’s another worrying development for an incredibly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Since October last year, 962 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Carolina. Large outbreaks (with more than 50 confirmed cases) are underway in four US states. Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant reason children are missing out on important vaccines. And if we’re seeing more measles cases now, we might expect to soon see more cases of other vaccine-preventable infections, including some that can cause liver cancer or meningitis.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Twenty years ago, Joanna Wakefield-Scurr was having persistent pain in her breasts. Her doctor couldn’t diagnose the cause but said a good, supportive bra could help. A professor of biomechanics, Wakefield-Scurr thought she could do a little research and find a science-backed option. Two decades later, she’s still looking. Wakefield-Scurr now leads an 18-person team at the Research Group in Breast Health at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. Their research shows that the most effective high-impact-sports bras have underwires, padded cups, adjustable underbands and shoulder straps, and hook-and-eye closures. These bras reduce breast movement by up to 74% when compared with wearing no bra. But movement might not be the only metric that matters.

Few anatomical structures hang outside of the body unsupported by cartilage, muscle, or bone—meaning there wasn’t much historical research to build on. Wakefield-Scurr’s lab was the first to find that when women run, the motion of the torso causes breasts to move in a three-dimensional pattern—swinging side to side and up and down—as well as moving forward and backward. In an hour of slow jogging, boobs can bounce approximately 10,000 times.

Wearing a bra that’s too tight can limit breathing. Wearing one that’s too loose can create back, shoulder, and neck pain. Pain can also be caused by the lag between torso and breast movement, which causes what is scientifically known as “breast slap.”

The lab’s research has also found that the physical discomfort of bad bras, combined with the embarrassment of flopping around, is the one of the biggest barriers to exercise for women and that if women have a good sports bra, they’re more willing to go for a run.

Some bras function by deliberately compressing breasts. Others encapsulate and support each individual breast. But scientists still don’t know whether it’s more biomechanically important to reduce the breasts’ motion entirely, to reduce the speed at which they move, or to reduce breast slap. Will women constantly be forced to choose between the comfort of a stretchier bra and the support of a more restrictive one?

Wakefield-Scurr is excited about new materials she’s tested that tighten or stretch depending on how you move. She’s working with fabric manufacturers and clothing companies to try out their wares.

As more women take up high-impact sports, the need to understand what makes a good bra grows. Wakefield-Scurr says her lab can’t keep up with demand. Their cups runneth over.

Speaking with popular AI content creators convinces me that “slop” isn’t just the internet rotting in real time, but the early draft of a new kind of pop culture.

I asked my MIT class to consider why some of the advances that MIT Technology Review’s journalists thought would change our world never really did—and what we can learn from the flops.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The bird is a beautiful silver-gray, and as she dies twitching in the lasernet I’m grateful for two things: First, that she didn’t make a sound. Second, that this will be the very last time.

They’re called corpse doves—because the darkest part of their gray plumage surrounds the lighter part, giving the impression that skeleton faces are peeking out from behind trash cans and bushes—and their crime is having the ability to carry diseases that would be compatible with humans. I open my hand, triggering the display from my imprinted handheld, and record an image to verify the elimination. A ding from my palm lets me know I’ve reached my quota for the day and, with that, the year.

I’m tempted to give this one a send-off, a real burial with holy words and some flowers, but then I hear a pack of streetrats hooting beside me. My city-issued vest is reflective and nanopainted so it projects a slight glow. I don’t know if it’s to keep us safe like they say, or if it’s just that so many of us are ex-cons working court-ordered labor, and civilians want to be able to keep an eye on us. Either way, everyone treats us like we’re invisible—everyone except children.

I switch the lasernet on the bird from electrocute to incinerate and watch as what already looked like a corpse becomes ashes.

“Executioner” is not my official title. The branch of city government we work for is called the Department of Mercy, and we’re only ever called technicians. But that doesn’t matter to the child, who can’t be more than eight but has the authority of a judge as she holds up a finger to point me out to her friends.

“Guys, look!” she says, then turns her attention to me. “You hunting something big?”

I shake my head, slowly packing up my things.

“Something small?” she asks. Then her eyes darken. “You’re not a cat killer, are you?”

I don’t know why I lied, but as the suspicion leaves her face and a smile returns, I’m glad I did.

“You should come down by the docks. We’ve got flies! Make your quota in a day.”

The girl tosses her hair, making the tinfoil charms she’s wrapped around her braids tinkle like wind chimes.

“It’s my last day. But if I get flies again for next year, I’ll swing by.”

Another lie, because we both know the city would never send anyone to the docks for flies. Flies are killed because they are a nuisance, which means people only care about clearing them out of suburbs and financial districts. They’d only send a tech down to the docks to kill something that put the city proper at risk through disease, or by using up more resources than they wanted to spare.

LeeLee is expecting me home to sit through the reassignments with her and it’s already late, so I hand out a couple of the combination warming and light sticks I get for winter to the pack of children with nowhere to go. As I walk away, the children are laughing so loud it sounds like screaming. They toss the sticks in the air like signal flares, small bright cries for help that no one will see.

LeeLee’s anxiety takes the form of caretaking, and as soon as I’ve stepped through the door I can smell bread warming and soup on the stove. I take off my muffling boots. Another day, I’d leave them on and sneak up on her just to be irritating, and she’d turn and threaten me with whatever kitchen utensil was at hand. But she’ll be extra nervous today, so I remove the shoes that let me catch nervous birds, and step hard on my way in.

Sometimes it seems impossible that I can spend a year killing every fragile and defenseless thing I’ve encountered but still take such care with Lee. But I tell myself that the killing isn’t me—it’s just my sentence, and what I do when I have a choice is the only thing that really says anything about me. For the first six months and 400 birds, I believed it.

LeeLee flicks on a smile that lasts a whole three seconds when she sees me, then clouds over again.

“Soup’s too thin. There wasn’t enough powder for a real broth.”

“Not like this. It doesn’t even cover up the taste of the water.”

“I like the taste of the water,” I say, which breaks her out of her spiraling enough to roll her eyes.

I put my hands on her shoulder to stop her fussing.

“The soup is going to be fine,” I say. “So will the reassignment.”

I’m not much taller than she is, but when we met in juvie she hadn’t hit her last growth spurt yet, so she still tilts her head back to look me in the eyes. “What if it’s not?”

“What if you get whatever assignment Jordan got?”

There it is. Because two of us didn’t leave juvie together to start community service—three of us did. But Jordan didn’t last three weeks into his assignment before he turned his implements inward.

I notice she doesn’t say What if  I get what Jordan got? Because LeeLee is more afraid of being left alone than of having to kill something innocent.

“We don’t know what his assignment was,” I say.

It’s true, but we do know it was bad. Two weeks into our first stretch, a drug meant to sterilize the city’s feral cat population accidentally had the opposite effect. Everyone was pulled off their assigned duty for three days to murder litters of new kittens instead. It nearly broke me and Lee, but Jordan seemed almost grateful.

“Besides, we don’t know if his assignment had anything to do with … what he did. You’re borrowing trouble. Worry in”—I check my palm—“an hour, when you actually know there’s something to worry about.”

You’d think it would hover over us too insistently to be ignored, but after we sit down and talk about our day I’m at ease, basking in the warmth of her storytelling and the bread that’s more beige than gray today. When the notification comes in, I am well and truly happy, and I can only hope it isn’t for the last time.

We both stiffen when we hear the alert. She looks at me, and I give her a smile and a nod, and then we look down. In the time between hearing the notification and checking it, I imagine all kinds of horrors that could be in my assignment slot. I imagine a picture of kittens, reason enough for the girl I met earlier to condemn me. For a moment, just a flash, I imagine looking down and seeing my own face as my target, or LeeLee’s.

But when I finally see the file, the relief that comes over me softens my spine. It’s a plant. Faceless, and bloodless.

I look up, and LeeLee’s eyes are dark as she leans forward, studying my face, looking for whatever crack she failed to see in Jordan. I force myself to smile wide for her.

She reaches forward and squeezes my hands. Hers are shaking.

She waves away my question. “I got rats. I can handle it. I was just worried about you.”

I spend the rest of the night unbelievably happy. For the next year, I get to kill a thing that does not scream.

“You get all that?” the man behind the desk asks, and I nod even though I didn’t.

I’ve traded in my boots and lasernet for a hazmat suit and a handheld mister with two different solutions. The man had been talking to me about how to use the solutions, but I can’t process verbal information very well. The whole reason I was sent to the correctional facility as a teen was that too many teachers mistook my processing delays for behavioral infractions. I’m planning to read the manual on my own time before I start in a few hours, but when I pick up the mister and look down the barrel, the equipment guy freaks out.

“They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”

“Did you not hear me? Don’t even look at that thing without your mask on.” He takes a breath, calmer now that I’ve lowered my hands. “Look, the first solution—it’s fine. It’s keyed to the plant itself and just opens its cells up for whatever solution we put on it. You could drink the stuff. But that second? The orange vial? Don’t even put it in the mister without your mask on. It dissipates quickly, so you’re good once you’re done spraying, but not a second before.”

He looks around, then leans in. “They were supposed to add sulfur to this batch, but they didn’t. So you won’t smell it. It won’t make you cough or your eyes water. It’ll just be lights out. Good night. You got me?”

I nod again as I grab the mask I hadn’t noticed before. This time when I thank him, I mean it.

It takes me an hour to find the first plant, and when I do it’s beautiful. Lush pink on the inside and dark green on the outside, it looks hearty and primitive. Almost Jurassic. I can see why it’s only in the sewers now: it would be too easy to spot and destroy aboveground in the sea of concrete.

After putting on my mask, I activate the mister and then stand back as it sprays the plant with poison. Nothing happens. I remember the prepping solution and switch the cartridges to coat it in that first. The next time I try the poison, the plant wilts instantly, browning and shrinking like a tire deflating. I was wrong. Plants this size don’t die silently. It makes a wheezing sound, a deep sigh. By the third time I’ve heard it, I swear I can make out the word Please.

When I get home, LeeLee’s locked herself in the bathroom, which doesn’t surprise me. I heard that they moved to acid for rats, and the smell of a corpse dissolving is impossible to get used to and even harder to get out of your hair. I eat dinner, read, change for bed, and she’s still in the bathroom. I brush my teeth in the kitchen.

The next morning, I have to take a transport to the plant’s habitat on the other end of the city, so I spend the time looking through the file that came with the assignment. Under “Characteristics,” some city government scientist has written, “Large, dark. Resource-intensive. Stubborn.”

I stare at the last word. Its own sentence, tacked on like an afterthought. Stubborn. The same word that was written in my file when I got sent from school to the facility where I met LeeLee and Jordan. Large, dark, stubborn, and condemned. I’ve never been called resource-intensive. But I have been called a waste.

When I get to my last plant of the day, I don’t reach for the mister. This one is small, young, the green still neon-bright and the teeth at the edges still soft. I pick it up, careful with its roots, and carry it home. I find a discarded water container along the way and place it inside. When I get home I knock on LeeLee’s door. She doesn’t answer, so I leave the plant on the floor as an offering. They aren’t proper flowers, but they smell nice and earthy. It might keep the residual odor from melted organs, fur, and bones from taking over her room.

“Killing things is a dumb job,” says the girl.

After a week of hearing the death cries of its cousins, I was moved to use some of my allowance to buy cheap fertilizer and growth serum for my plant. The girl and her friends, fewer than before, were panhandling at the megastore across the way. She ran over, braids jingling, as soon as she saw me. I thought she’d leave once I gave her more glowsticks for her friends, but she stayed in step and kept following me.

“It’s not a dumb job,” I say, even though it is.

I shift my bag to point at the bottom of my vest. Beneath “Mercy Dept.” the department’s slogan is written in cursive: Killing to Save!

She sees the text but doesn’t register it, and I have to remind myself that even getting kicked out of school is a privilege. The city had decided to stop wasting educational resources on me. They’d never even tried with her or the other streetrats.

Suddenly, all I can think about is Jordan. “Maybe they don’t mind.”

I think of the plants. Maybe they hadn’t been pleading. Maybe they’d been sighing with relief. I think of the birds that eventually stopped running away.

“Maybe they’re tired. The city’s right, and their existence isn’t compatible with the world we made. And that’s our fault for being stupid and cruel, but it makes their lives so hard. We’ve made it so they can only live half a life. Maybe the least we can do is finish the job.”

It’s a terrible thing to say—even worse to a kid.

Her eyes go hard. “What are you killing now, executioner?”

The question surprises me. “Sewer plants. Why?”

I’d wanted her to leave me alone, but when she runs away I feel suddenly empty.

I have an issue at work when I can’t find my poison vial. I tell them it rolled away in the sewer and I couldn’t catch it in time, because I don’t want to tell them I was unobservant enough to let a street kid steal from me. After a stern warning and a mountain of forms, they issue a new vial and don’t add to my service time.

Pulling overtime to make up for the day I didn’t have my poison means it’s days before I get to fertilize my houseplant. LeeLee’s door is open, so I bring in the fertilizer and serum. She’s put the plant on her windowsill, but it prefers indirect sunlight, so I move it to the shelf next to her boxes of knickknacks and trinkets. I add the fertilizer to its soil and am about to spray it with the growth serum when I get an idea. I get the mister from my kit and set it up to spray the prepping solution on the little plant to prime it. I open the window and put on my mask, just in case, but I’m sure the man was telling the truth when he called the first liquid harmless. After its cells are open, I spray it with my store-bought growth serum.

I’m halfway through making dinner when I hear the crash and run into LeeLee’s room.

The plant has grown huge, turning adult instantly, and its new weight has taken down LeeLee’s shelf. Dainty keepsake boxes are shattered on our concrete floor.

I bend to my knees quickly, so focused on fixing my mistake that I don’t register the oddness of the items I’m picking up—jacks, kids’ toys, a bow—until my fingers touch something small and shimmering. It’s a scrap of silver, still rounded in the shape of the braids it was taken from.

I’d forgotten the city has more than one kind.

I’m waiting up when Lee gets home. I don’t make her tell me. I just grab her kit and rummage through it. Where my kit has a hazmat suit, hers has a stealth mesh to render her invisible. Where I keep my mister, she has a gun loaded with vials too large for rats. I have a mini-vac to suck up excess plant matter to prevent seeds from sprouting. She has zip ties.

By the time I’m done, she’s already cracking under the weight of everything she tried to protect me from. Within moments she’s sobbing on the floor. I carry her to her bed and get in beside her. I try not to listen too closely as she recounts every horrible moment, but I’m listening at the end, when she tells me she can’t do it anymore. When she confesses that she’s the one who stole my poison, and has only been waiting to take it because she didn’t have the stomach to do to me what Jordan did to us.

I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.

I leave her for just a moment, but by the time I lie back in bed beside her I’ve figured it out.

I tell her that she won’t have to take her shift tomorrow. I tell her I’m going to go around the city with my mister and my growth serum. That I’ll move plants from sewers to the yards around City Hall and every public space and the support pylons of important people’s companies, and then spray them so they become huge. The city will freak. I tell her it will be like the kittens, but this time we’ll all be pulled off our assignments to kill plants. And maybe the serum will work too well. Maybe the city was right to fear these plants, and they will grow and grow and eat our concrete while the roots crack our foundations and cut our electricity and everything will crumble. And the people with something to lose might suffer, but the rest of us will just laugh at the perfection of rubble. I tell her how we’ll make playgrounds of dead data centers and use hoses to fill the holes where skyscrapers were, and kids will play Marco Polo swimming over a CEO’s sunken office.

She asks if I’ll put any at our old detention center.

I talk long enough that her eyes close, and loud enough that neither of us can hear the sound of my mister blowing. The man who gave it to me was right. Even without the mask, it doesn’t smell like sulfur. It doesn’t smell like anything.

            <h2>Measles cases are rising. Other vaccine-preventable infections could be next.</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/20/1133365/measles-cases-rising-vaccine-preventable-infections-mumps-hepatitis-b/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">There’s a measles outbreak happening close to where I live. Since the start of this year, 34 cases have been confirmed in Enfield, a northern borough of London. Most of those affected are children under the age of 11. One in five have needed hospital treatment.

It’s another worrying development for an incredibly contagious and potentially fatal disease. Since October last year, 962 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Carolina. Large outbreaks (with more than 50 confirmed cases) are underway in four US states. Smaller outbreaks are being reported in another 12 states.

The vast majority of these cases have been children who were not fully vaccinated. Vaccine hesitancy is thought to be a significant reason children are missing out on important vaccines—the World Health Organization described it as one of the 10 leading threats to global health in 2019. And if we’re seeing more measles cases now, we might expect to soon see more cases of other vaccine-preventable infections, including some that can cause liver cancer or meningitis.

Some people will always argue that measles is not a big deal—that infections used to be common, and most people survived them and did just fine. It is true that in most cases kids do recover well from the virus. But not always.

Measles symptoms tend to start with a fever and a runny nose. The telltale rash comes later. In some cases, severe complications develop. They can include pneumonia, blindness, and inflammation of the brain. Some people won’t develop complications until years later. In rare cases, the disease can be fatal.

Before the measles vaccine was introduced, in 1963, measles epidemics occurred every two to three years, according to the WHO. Back then, around 2.6 million people died from measles every year. Since it was introduced, the measles vaccine is thought to have prevented almost 59 million deaths.

But vaccination rates have been lagging, says Anne Zink, an emergency medicine physician and clinical fellow at the Yale School of Public Health. “We’ve seen a slow decline in people who are willing to get vaccinated against measles for some time,” she says. “As we get more and more people who are at risk because they’re unvaccinated, the higher the chances that the disease can then spread and take off.”

Vaccination rates need to be at 95% to prevent measles outbreaks. But rates are well below that level in some regions. Across South Carolina, the proportion of kindergartners who received both doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella, has dropped steadily over the last five years, from 94% in 2020-2021 to 91% in 2024-2025. Some schools in the state have coverage rates as low as 20%, state epidemiologist Linda Bell told reporters last month.

Vaccination rates are low in London, too. Fewer than 70% of children have received both doses of their MMR by the time they turn five, according to the UK Health Security Agency. In some boroughs, vaccination rates are as low as 58%. So perhaps it’s not surprising we’re seeing outbreaks.

The UK is one of six countries to have lost their measles elimination status last month, along with Spain, Austria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan. Canada lost its elimination status last year.

The highly contagious measles could be a bellwether for other vaccine-preventable diseases. Zink is already seeing signs. She points to a case of polio that paralyzed a man in New York in 2022. That happened when rates of polio vaccination were low, she says. “Polio is a great example of … a disease that is primarily asymptomatic, and most people don’t have any symptoms whatsoever, but for the people who do get symptoms, it can be life-threatening.”

Then there’s mumps—another disease the MMR vaccine protects against. It’s another one of those infections that can be symptom-free and harmless in some, especially children, but nasty for others. It can cause a painful swelling of the testes, and other complications include brain swelling and deafness. (From my personal experience of being hospitalized with mumps, I can attest that even “mild” infections are pretty horrible.)

Mumps is less contagious than measles, so we might expect a delay between an uptick in measles cases and the spread of mumps, says Zink. But she says that she’s more concerned about hepatitis B.

“It lives on surfaces for a long period of time, and if you’re not vaccinated against it and you’re exposed to it as a kid, you’re at a really high risk of developing liver cancer and death,” she says.

Zink was formerly chief medical officer of Alaska, a state that in the 1970s had the world’s highest rate of childhood liver cancer caused by hepatitis B. Screening and universal newborn vaccination programs eliminated the virus’s spread.

Public health experts worry that the current US administration’s position on vaccines may contribute to the decline in vaccine uptake. Last month the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved changes to childhood vaccination recommendations. The agency no longer recommends the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns. The chair of the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel has also questioned broad vaccine recommendations for polio.

Even vitamin injections are being refused by parents, says Zink. A shot of vitamin K at birth can help prevent severe bleeding in some babies. But recent research suggests that parents of 5% of newborns are refusing it (up from 2.9% in 2017).

“I can’t tell you how many of my pediatric [doctor] friends have told me about having to care for a kiddo in the ICU with … bleeding into their brain because the kid didn’t get vitamin K at birth,” says Zink. “And that can kill kids, [or have] lifelong, devastating, stroke-like symptoms.”

All this paints a pretty bleak picture for children’s health. But things can change. Vaccination can still offer protection to plenty of people at risk of infection. South Carolina’s Department of Public Health is offering free MMR vaccinations to residents at mobile clinics.

“It’s easy to think ‘It’s not going to be me,’” says Zink. “Seeing kiddos who don’t have the agency to make decisions [about vaccination] being so sick from vaccine-preventable diseases, to me, is one of the most challenging things of practicing medicine.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot, like when White House officials recently shared a manipulated image of a protester in Minnesota and then mocked those asking about it. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views, like the videos that Russian influence campaigns are currently spreading to discourage Ukrainians from enlisting.

It is into this mess that Microsoft has put forward a blueprint, shared with MIT Technology Review, for how to prove what’s real online.

An AI safety research team at the company recently evaluated how methods for documenting digital manipulation are faring against today’s most worrying AI developments, like interactive deepfakes and widely accessible hyperrealistic models. It then recommended technical standards that can be adopted by AI companies and social media platforms.

To understand the gold standard that Microsoft is pushing, imagine you have a Rembrandt painting and you are trying to document its authenticity. You might describe its provenance with a detailed manifest of where the painting came from and all the times it changed hands. You might apply a watermark that would be invisible to humans but readable by a machine. And you could digitally scan the painting and generate a mathematical signature, like a fingerprint, based on the brush strokes. If you showed the piece at a museum, a skeptical visitor could then examine these proofs to verify that it’s an original.

All of these methods are already being used to varying degrees in the effort to vet content online. Microsoft evaluated 60 different combinations of them, modeling how each setup would hold up under different failure scenarios—from metadata being stripped to content being slightly altered or deliberately manipulated. The team then mapped which combinations produce sound results that platforms can confidently show to people online, and which ones are so unreliable that they may cause more confusion than clarification.

The company’s chief scientific officer, Eric Horvitz, says the work was prompted by legislation—like California’s AI Transparency Act, which will take effect in August—and the speed at which AI has developed to combine video and voice with striking fidelity.

“You might call this self-regulation,” Horvitz told MIT Technology Review. But it’s clear he sees pursuing the work as boosting Microsoft’s image: “We’re also trying to be a selected, desired provider to people who want to know what’s going on in the world.”

Nevertheless, Horvitz declined to commit to Microsoft using its own recommendation across its platforms. The company sits at the center of a giant AI content ecosystem: It runs Copilot, which can generate images and text; it operates Azure, the cloud service through which customers can access OpenAI and other major AI models; it owns LinkedIn, one of the world’s largest professional platforms; and it holds a significant stake in OpenAI. But when asked about in-house implementation, Horvitz said in a statement, “Product groups and leaders across the company were involved in this study to inform product road maps and infrastructure, and our engineering teams are taking action on the report’s findings.”

It’s important to note that there are inherent limits to these tools; just as they would not tell you what your Rembrandt means, they are not built to determine if content is accurate or not. They only reveal if it has been manipulated. It’s a point that Horvitz says he has to make to lawmakers and others who are skeptical of Big Tech as an arbiter of fact.

“It’s not about making any decisions about what’s true and not true,” he said. “It’s about coming up with labels that just tell folks where stuff came from.”

Hany Farid, a professor at UC Berkeley who specializes in digital forensics but wasn’t involved in the Microsoft research, says that if the industry adopted the company’s blueprint, it would be meaningfully more difficult to deceive the public with manipulated content. Sophisticated individuals or governments can work to bypass such tools, he says, but the new standard could eliminate a significant portion of misleading material.

“I don’t think it solves the problem, but I think it takes a nice big chunk out of it,” he says.

Still, there are reasons to see Microsoft’s approach as an example of somewhat naïve techno-optimism. There is growing evidence that people are swayed by AI-generated content even when they know that it is false. And in a recent study of pro-Russian AI-generated videos about the war in Ukraine, comments pointing out that the videos were made with AI received far less engagement than comments treating them as genuine.

“Are there people who, no matter what you tell them, are going to believe what they believe?” Farid asks. “Yes.” But, he adds, “there are a vast majority of Americans and citizens around the world who I do think want to know the truth.”

That desire has not exactly led to urgent action from tech companies. Google started adding a watermark to content generated by its AI tools in 2023, which Farid says has been helpful in his investigations. Some platforms use C2PA, a provenance standard Microsoft helped launch in 2021. But the full suite of changes that Microsoft suggests, powerful as they are, might remain only suggestions if they threaten the business models of AI companies or social media platforms.

“If the Mark Zuckerbergs and the Elon Musks of the world think that putting ‘AI generated’ labels on something will reduce engagement, then of course they’re incentivized not to do it,” Farid says. Platforms like Meta and Google have already said they’d include labels for AI-generated content, but an audit conducted by Indicator last year found that only 30% of its test posts on Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, and YouTube were correctly labeled as AI-generated.

More forceful moves toward content verification might come from the many pieces of AI regulation pending around the world. The European Union’s AI Act, as well as proposed rules in India and elsewhere, would all compel AI companies to require some form of disclosure that a piece of content was generated with AI.

One priority from Microsoft is, unsurprisingly, to play a role in shaping these rules. The company waged a lobbying effort during the drafting of California’s AI Transparency Act, which Horvitz said made the legislation’s requirements on how tech companies must disclose AI-generated content “a bit more realistic.”

But another is a very real concern about what could happen if the rollout of such content-verification technology is done poorly. Lawmakers are demanding tools that can verify what’s real, but the tools are fragile. If labeling systems are rushed out, inconsistently applied, or frequently wrong, people could come to distrust them altogether, and the entire effort would backfire. That’s why the researchers argue that it may be better in some cases to show nothing at all than a verdict that could be wrong.

Inadequate tools could also create new avenues for what the researchers call sociotechnical attacks. Imagine that someone takes a real image of a fraught political event and uses an AI tool to change only an inconsequential share of pixels in the image. When it spreads online, it could be misleadingly classified by platforms as AI-manipulated. But combining provenance and watermark tools would mean platforms could clarify that the content was only partially AI generated, and point out where the changes were made.

California’s AI Transparency Act will be the first major test of these tools in the US, but enforcement could be challenged by President Trump’s executive order from late last year seeking to curtail state AI regulations that are “burdensome” to the industry. The administration has also generally taken a posture against efforts to curb disinformation, and last year, via DOGE, it canceled grants related to misinformation. And, of course, official government channels in the Trump administration have shared content manipulated with AI (MIT Technology Review reported that the Department of Homeland Security, for example, uses video generators from Google and Adobe to make content it shares with the public).

I asked Horvitz whether fake content from this source worries him as much as that coming from the rest of social media. He initially declined to comment, but then he said, “Governments have not been outside the sectors that have been behind various kinds of manipulative disinformation, and this is worldwide.”

Backlash against ICE is fueling a broader movement against AI companies’ ties to President Trump.

            <div id="article-text">A private premiere screening of “Holiguards Saga — The Portal of Force,” the pilot installment of the planned Holiguards Saga franchise, was held on February 16 at ASTOR Film Lounge Berlin.

The event took place in a closed format with invited industry guests, partners, and media representatives. The screening was organized as a formal black-tie occasion and took place in Berlin during the same period as the Berlin International Film Festival, when international filmmakers, producers, distributors, and investors traditionally gather in the city.

“Holiguards Saga — The Portal of Force” is an independently developed film project intended to launch a multi-installment franchise.

According to the producers, the project is structured as a long-term cinematic universe concept, with discussions currently underway regarding financing and production of subsequent chapters.

The film was directed by Kevin Spacey, who also portrays one of the central characters. This marks his first directorial work in approximately two decades. The ensemble cast includes Dolph Lundgren, Tyrese Gibson, Brianna Hildebrand, Disha Patani, Swen Temmel, Lado Okhotnikov, Harry Goodwins, and Sonia Pim Couling. Production was led by Elvira Paterson and Vadim Degtiarev.

Elledgy Media Group, under Paterson’s leadership, supported both the production coordination and the international promotion strategy for the project.

Set in the near future, “Holiguards Saga — The Portal of Force” presents a fictional universe in which two ancient ideological orders, the Holiguards and the Statiguards, engage in a covert struggle over humanity’s direction.

The Holiguards advocate personal freedom and individual agency, while the Statiguards promote systemic order and centralized control. The central narrative follows Jessica, portrayed by Disha Patani, the daughter of leaders representing opposing factions. Positioned between conflicting legacies, her decisions influence the balance of power surrounding a mysterious cosmic energy source known as the Portal of Force.

The pilot installment introduces the mythological framework of the saga and establishes the political and philosophical tensions intended to expand in future chapters.

Ahead of the Berlin premiere, the production team reported receiving formal inquiries from international sales agents, distribution representatives, and private investors regarding potential collaboration and participation in future installments. Previous joint appearances by Elvira Paterson and Kevin Spacey were accompanied by private screenings and gala dinners in Cannes and Venice.

Following the Berlin premiere, a series of additional private screenings is planned in select international markets. Further announcements concerning festival participation, distribution strategy, and release scheduling will be made separately. At this stage, no official worldwide theatrical or streaming release date has been confirmed.

            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-20</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/zurichs-rapidata-raises-e7-2m-to-build-a-real-time-human-feedback-network-for-ai">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">A growing number of startups are rushing to build software that thinks fast. But one of the hardest parts of teaching machines to improve isn’t raw computing power, it’s human insight at scale.

Zurich-based startup Rapidata has just taken a significant step toward fixing that with a €7.2 million seed round aimed at scaling a global network for human feedback, the essential ingredient for aligning and refining AI models.

The round was disclosed today by EU-Startups, positioning Rapidata as an early player in what could become a major layer of AI infrastructure: a system that compresses feedback loops from humans into AI training systems from weeks or months down to hours or days.

Modern AI systems have become astonishingly capable at generating text and images, but they still struggle with nuance, judgement and context, the very aspects humans excel at.

That’s why many advanced models are trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where people judge outputs and rate responses to shape the model’s behaviour.

Rapidata claims to change that by tapping a continuously available, worldwide network of real people, enabling AI teams to gather large volumes of high-quality human judgments far more quickly and flexibly than before.

Founded in 2023, Rapidata sits at the intersection of crowd intelligence and advanced machine learning infrastructure.

Instead of static pools of annotators or traditional data labeling services, Rapidata’s platform gives teams on-demand access to human insight everywhere. That means feedback isn’t limited by geography or segmentation, it scales with demand.

Rapidata’s mission also highlights a broader trend in AI infrastructure: investors and developers alike are beginning to treat human judgment as a core part of the stack, not just an afterthought.

As models become more capable, contextual human insight determines whether those capabilities are useful, safe, and aligned with real-world expectations.

With fresh capital in hand, Rapidata plans to accelerate growth of its human feedback network, onboarding more participants worldwide and improving integration with AI development workflows.

The company believes that the next major scarcity in AI won’t be compute, it will be high-quality human signal, and it wants to build the platform to serve it.

For an industry still figuring out how to scale both intelligence and alignment, a real-time feedback network could be a key piece of the puzzle, and Rapidata is positioning itself as one of the early builders of that future.

            <h2>Gartner $110M sale of Digital Markets division in latest SEC filing</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-20</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Gartner first disclosed that it had agreed to part with its Digital Markets ( business unit that included its major software review, specifically Capterra, GetApp, and Software Advice) business in early 2026, the announcement was forward-looking and economical with detail: it named the buyer and the assets involved, but it left out any financial terms.

That lack of financial detail naturally made people wonder exactly how much the transaction was worth.

It was only later, in the company’s audited annual report on Form 10-K, filed on February 12, 2026, that a clearer picture of how the transaction was treated in the company’s regulatory filings became visible. That document, which is public, notes that the sale was completed on February 5, 2026, placing the divestiture within the broader contours of Gartner’s financial disclosures.

This most recent filing, accession number 0000749251-26-000112, stands in stark contrast with Gartner’s prior 10-K, covering the year ended December 31, 2024, and filed on February 13, 2025, under accession 0000749251-25-000008.

In that earlier report, there is no reference to this transaction or to any figure associated with it, consistent with the fact that the deal was not agreed or closed until 2026.

The January 29, 2026 announcement publicly identified G2 as the buyer, and specified the assets involved: Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp, but it did not disclose any financial terms, a detail that was equally absent from contemporaneous coverage.

In Gartner’s 10-K, the recorded consideration is described as being “before customary purchase price adjustments,” a phrase that signals the number reported in the filing is an initial headline value that may change once post-closing reconciliations tied to balance sheet items are completed.

These adjustments are common in sales agreements and are meant to align the agreed price with the business’s actual financial situation at closing.

A related 8-K filed on February 3, 2026, which included an earnings release, did not include any price details about the sale.

When we looked for the earliest relevant documents, we found that an earlier annual report,  Form 10-K filed on February 13, 2025 (accession 0000749251-25-000008), covers Gartner’s results through the end of 2024 and makes no reference to Digital Markets or the brands that were later sold.

That absence simply reflects the timing: the deal was agreed and completed in 2026, so it could not have been reported in a document covering the prior year.

Thus, the first SEC filing in which the transaction clearly appears is Gartner’s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025, filed on February 12, 2026, under accession 0000749251-26-000112.

It is in this later annual report that Gartner formally records the sale of the business and constitutes the first document in the public record to show how the company accounted for the transaction in its audited disclosures.

Reading the February 12, 2026, 10-K, the Digital Markets sale shows up in several sections. Early in the document, in the business overview, Gartner notes that the sale was completed on February 5, 2026, alongside the headline figure that appears in the record.

Later in the same report, in a section discussing recent developments, the company lays out the context around the divestiture, reporting that Digital Markets was classified as “held for sale” as of December 31, 2025, and listing the related assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.

The same description of the sale is repeated once more in a note on subsequent events, which walks through the timeline from signing to closing.

Notably, none of these references in the annual report names the buyer. Within the text of the 10-K, a search reveals that “G2” and the individual brands that were part of the business being sold do not appear, underscoring that Gartner’s disclosure is focused on the transaction as a financial event rather than on the identity of the counterparty.

When a company states that a sale price is described as being “before customary purchase price adjustments,” it means the number reported is only a starting point.

In most deals, the buyer and seller agree on an initial figure but include mechanisms in the contract that can revise that figure after closing to reflect the business’s actual financial position at transfer of control.

These post-closing adjustments are designed to ensure a fair final amount based on what the business truly delivered at closing, rather than on estimates made when the agreement was signed.

The most common of these adjustments is tied to working capital, the cash and short-term assets a business needs to operate. Parties negotiate a target level; if the actual working capital at closing is higher than expected, the seller may receive more. If it’s lower, the buyer may pay less.

Other adjustments can relate to net cash or debt, where the purchase price is recalculated based on the actual cash and debt assumed by the buyer, and to mechanisms such as escrows or deferred payments that hold portions of the sale price until certain conditions are resolved.

Because Gartner’s public filing does not include the underlying sale agreement or a detailed reconciliation of these adjustment mechanisms, the exact formulas or thresholds that could change the final amount are not visible in the public record.

What the 10-K does make clear is that the figure reported is a headline number, subject to later review and revision once the closing accounts are finalized.

In many deals, the headline price is agreed on a “cash-free, debt-free” basis, meaning that after closing, the buyer and seller adjust the purchase price to reflect the target business’s actual cash and debt position.

If the business ends up with more debt or less cash than expected, the effective price the seller receives can be reduced. Conversely, if it has more cash or less debt than anticipated, it can increase the amount paid.

In Gartner’s public disclosures, there is no way to tell from the 10-K whether the Digital Markets sale was structured this way or how any such adjustment would be calculated because the underlying agreement and detailed terms are not part of the filings.

What the 10-K does show is the initial figure; whether and how it changes through these common adjustment mechanisms remains outside the public record.

Gartner’s most recent Form 10-K, filed on February 12, 2026, shows that the company completed the sale of its Digital Markets business on February 5, 2026, using language that describes the consideration as “approximately $110.0 million, before customary purchase price adjustments.” This is the only financial figure tied to the deal that appears in the public filings.

The earlier public announcement from January 29, in which G2 said it had agreed to buy Capterra, Software Advice, and GetApp from Gartner, did not include any financial terms, and subsequent media coverage similarly reported that price details were not disclosed at the time.

In filings, the phrase “purchase price adjustments” refers to standard mechanisms in sale agreements, often tied to working capital and other balance-sheet items, that can increase or decrease the final amount paid after closing.

Gartner’s 10-K does not name the buyer in the sale disclosure, but it confirms the closing date and the approximate consideration while noting that the figure could change through those adjustments.

Taken together, Gartner’s own regulatory filings tell a more complete story of the Digital Markets sale than the initial announcement did. The only financial detail available in the public record comes from the company’s 10-K, which notes the closing date and describes the consideration in broad terms, but it leaves several questions unanswered.

We also reached out to both sides for further comment and clarification ahead of publication, seeking confirmation of the figures, insight into the structure of the deal, and any context that might illuminate how the transaction was negotiated and reported.

By the time of publication, neither party had responded.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google’s announcement that its Gemini app now writes music for you isn’t just one of those “blowing my mind” product updates. It feels like a symbolic surrender to a long-standing refrain from Big Tech: creative work is now just another checkbox for a machine.

If you don’t know what I am talking about, yesterday Google launched a new feature, Lyria 3, in the Gemini app, that allows us to cook up 30-second tracks complete with lyrics and cover art from a text prompt or a photo, of course, generated by Nano Banana; basically, no instruments, no experience, no pesky tactile skill required.

It’s essentially a LEGO set for “songs” that lasts about as long as a TikTok loop. They say it’s designed for YouTube Creators, and I tend to agree with them, because you can’t make to much with 30 seconds.

Still, the underlying problem is another one, as I am seeing different projects/songs made with AI, including AI artists. And this is what I want to highlight in this piece.

“Behind every beautiful thing, there’s some kind of pain, “ said Bob Dylan, and I could not agree more.

If we take a look at the history ( art, music, literature, poetry, and so on), the main fuel for creation was indeed pain.

Now, how should I put this? Probably the only pain that Lyria can feel is more like a faint server-overload alert than heartbreak.

Real songwriters know that soul isn’t born in a 30-second prompt, it’s extracted through years of mistakes, late nights, losses, and tiny revelations.

Call it a toy if you like. Google will, too.

They even watermark the outputs with a SynthID tag so the 30-second ditties are officially AI-generated, not “inspired.” That’s a nod to copyright concerns, but it also reads like an admission: these aren’t really art, they’re chemical by-products of pattern statistics.

What’s striking isn’t the novelty. Much of this has been possible in labs and APIs for years, and creators have been experimenting with generative music tools as collaborators.

What Lyria 3 does, and what makes this moment worth watching, is normalising the idea that anyone can “write” a song with a chatbot and a mood descriptor. That’s not empowerment; it’s a devaluation of craft.

Just because you pay a subscription to Suno, that’s another AI music generator, and that one is more complex, that doesn’t make you an artist or a singer. Just because you learn how to write a prompt for any LLM model and generates you pages, you are not a writer.

Imagine a world where every blog has AI-generated copy, not that we are not almost in the middle of this, and every company can churn out half-baked music for their ads or social posts.

In that economy, a professional songwriter’s unique skill becomes as optional as knowing how to use a metronome.

You could ask Gemini for an “emotional indie ballad about a lost sock,” and voilà, you have something. Whether it has actual coherence or soul is left to the listener to decide. It is fun to use it with your friends, shorts, to impress your date.

Video: Gemini Lyria Music Generation Feature – Socks, uploaded by Google on YouTube

Still, Lyria 3’s music is capped at 30 seconds, and that’s no accident. It sidesteps deeper legal and ethical quarrels about training data and mimicry of existing works by keeping outputs short and legally fuzzy. That’s a thumbs up from me.

But even within that limit, it’s now possible for someone with no craft or cultural context to generate riffs, lyrics, and chord progressions that sound, to the casual ear, adequately musical. In an attention economy obsessed with shareability, “adequate” quickly becomes plenty.

This matters because real songs, the ones that endure, that carry human experience, aren’t just collections of musical atoms. They’re shaped by story, risk, cultural memory, and sometimes contradiction.

One of my favorite artists, Tom Waits, said, ”I don’t have a formal background. I learned from listening to records, from talking to people, from hanging around record stores, and hanging around musicians and saying, “Hey, how did you do that? Do that again. Let me see how you did that.”

This was the research and prompting before, and it’s not only about reducing time, or getting things faster, and “having more time for you.”

It’s about the entire process, the contact with other artists, humans, and IDEAS.

Those are qualities machines can mimic but not originate. When the machines own the first pass at creation, and the commercial ecosystem embraces that output because it is cheap and fast, the incentives shift. Not gradually. Suddenly.

The record industry is already grappling with AI. Streaming services, publishers, and even labels have begun experimenting with algorithmic playlists and automated composition.

What Gemini’s Lyria 3 does is extend that experiment to public perception. A whole generation may come to think that “making music” means typing a description and choosing a style. Songwriting becomes a UX problem, not a craft one.

That raises a serious question: in a world where AI can conjure up a half-decent hook on demand, what will distinguish professional artists?

If the answer is only brand story or marketing muscle, we aren’t celebrating creativity; we are monetising it out of existence.

Tech companies like Google will frame this as liberation. And in a literal sense, anyone who’s ever wanted to hear a short tune about a sock’s existential crisis now can. But liberation without value for the creator is just consumerism by another name.

Lyria 3 might be good for GIF soundtracks and social clips, and TikTok viral reels, but it doesn’t make professional musicians obsolete; it makes their work less necessary to the platforms that reward hyper-consumable content.

That’s a different threat from outright replacement: it’s obsolescence by trivialisation.

If AI is going to be part of musical creation, then let it be as an assistant to the composer,  someone who improves ideas, not replaces them. What we’re seeing with Gemini is not collaboration but outsourcing.

And the lesson for artists isn’t to fear the algorithm. It’s to insist on clarity about where AI replaces labour and where it augments human sensibility.

Because once the marketplace equates the two, the humans who do the work will be the ones left asking for royalties in a language no one else wants to speak.

And, as a personal recommendation, not sponsored, there are streaming platforms like Deezer that have built AI detection tools that flag and label AI-generated tracks, excluding them from recommendations and royalties so that human songwriters aren’t buried under synthetic spam, and consumers can make the difference between AI and human.

If you care about preserving real artistry in a world of text-to-tune generative models, start paying attention to how platforms handle AI-tagging and choose services that give you transparency about what you’re actually listening to.

Yet, I’m not here to throw shade at Lyria 3; if anything, the idea of letting people turn a photo or a mood into a short track sounds like fun for casual use and creative experimentation. It is what Google says it’s meant for.

Yet the reality is that as these models proliferate, we risk confusing novelty with art. And here, the big tech companies are not the ones to blame, but us.

            <div id="article-text">Plato, a Berlin-based startup, has raised $14.5 million in seed funding to bring generative AI into wholesale distribution, a massive industry that rarely makes tech headlines but quietly moves a significant share of the world’s goods.

The round was led by Atomico, with Cherry Ventures, Discovery Ventures, and D11Z joining in.

Wholesale distribution accounts for roughly one-fifth of global production flows. Yet much of it still runs on aging ERP systems, Excel spreadsheets, and manual quoting workflows that haven’t meaningfully evolved in years.

While AI has flooded marketing, customer support, and coding, distribution sales teams are often still copy-pasting numbers between systems.

Plato’s thesis is simple: instead of adding another dashboard, embed AI directly into the operational core. The company connects to existing ERP systems and turns historical sales data into automated actions, flagging revenue opportunities, generating quotes, and identifying risks before they surface in quarterly reports.

The idea grew out of lived frustration. Co-founder Benedikt Nolte experienced the inefficiencies firsthand in his family’s distribution business. Generic CRM tools, he concluded, weren’t designed for the complexity of distributor operations. Plato was built specifically for that environment, not retrofitted from SaaS templates designed for startups.

Early traction suggests the industry is paying attention. Plato reportedly works with several large distributors on six-figure contracts, a sign that AI adoption in traditional sectors is less about hype and more about whether it can save time and unlock revenue.

The fresh capital will help Plato expand beyond sales intelligence into areas like procurement and customer service automation, while pushing into new European markets and eventually the U.S.

More broadly, the round highlights a shift in AI investing. The next wave isn’t just about bigger language models; it’s about embedding intelligence into industries that haven’t been rewritten by software yet. Wholesale distribution may not be glamorous, but it is structurally essential. If AI can modernize that layer of the economy, the impact will be far larger than another chatbot demo.

            <div id="article-text">David Silver, a British AI researcher known for his role at Google’s DeepMind lab, has helped build some of the most influential AI systems and is now leading his own ambitious start-up. He is in the middle of raising a $1 billion seed round for his new London-based venture, Ineffable Intelligence.

If the fundraising will be completed, would be the largest seed round ever seen in Europe.

The round is being led by Sequoia Capital, with titans such as Nvidia, Google and Microsoft reportedly in talks to participate, according to industry sources familiar with the deal.

The proposed investment would place Ineffable Intelligence’s pre-money valuation at around $4 billion, an eye-watering figure for a company that hasn’t yet shipped a product.

David Silver’s name is synonymous with some of the most memorable milestones in AI. During more than a decade at Google DeepMind, he helped develop AlphaGo, the first AI to defeat a world champion at the ancient game of Go, and later AlphaStar, which bested professional players in StarCraft II.

His work has shaped how modern AI systems learn and make decisions.

In late 2025, David Silver left DeepMind, where he also contributed to the development of the Gemini family of large language models, to launch Ineffable Intelligence. .

In the current days billion-dollar seed rounds are no longer unheard of, but they remain exceptionally rare, especially in Europe.

If Sequoia and its partners follow through on their commitments, the round would serve as both a vote of confidence in David Silver’s vision and a broader signal that venture capitalists are increasingly willing to fund ambitious, research-driven AI ventures well before traditional product milestone

The sheer size of the potential round also reshapes the narrative around Europe’s role in the global AI race.

Historically, most of the industry’s capital and rich technical talent have gravitated to Silicon Valley and other U.S. hubs. A £737 million-plus round led by a top U.S. investor shows that world-class AI ideas can still attract world-class capital in Europe.

David Silver’s dual role – as an entrepreneur and as a professor at University College London,  hints at a blend of academic ambition and commercial pressure that may define the next era of AI innovation.

His thesis suggests that the path to genuinely powerful AI may not be simply scaling up models, but teaching systems to learn and improve through real-world experience, a direction he believes could outpace approaches grounded solely in data accumulated from human interactions.

Whether Ineffable Intelligence ultimately delivers on its lofty vision remains to be seen.

But the enthusiasm around its fundraising reflects a broader trend: AI is entering a phase where conviction in founders and ideas can translate directly into unprecedented capital flows.

For Europe, a successful $1 billion cap table would be a milestone moment, not just financially, but symbolically,  in positioning the continent as a contender for the future of AI research and deployment.
