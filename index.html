            <h2>Trump admin threatens to break up major climate research center</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/12/trump-admin-threatens-to-break-up-major-climate-research-center/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, announced that a major climate research center will be “broken up.” The National Center for Atmospheric Research, or NCAR, is a significant contributor to research on the weather, climate, and other atmospheric phenomena. The move will be a crippling blow to climate research in the US and is being widely decried by scientists.

Vought initially gave a statement regarding NCAR to USA Today and later confirmed the outlet’s reporting on social media. Calling it “one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,” Vought also decried what he termed “woke” activities at NCAR. These appear to be fairly typical efforts made to attract underrepresented groups to the sciences—efforts that were uncontroversial prior to the current administration.

NCAR is primarily based in a complex on the outskirts of Boulder, Colorado, and maintains a supercomputing center in Wyoming. Much of its funding comes from the National Science Foundation, but the day-to-day management is handled by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), a nonprofit that represents 130 individual educational institutions. In addition to climate science, researchers based there study Earth and space weather, atmospheric chemistry, and their impacts on the environment and humans. NCAR hosts a series of webpages that explain its research and all the ways it helps society.

Vought indicates that the government will specifically target what were termed “green new scam research activities,” while moving other aspects of the center’s work to different institutions. The government doesn’t directly manage activities at NCAR, though, and it’s not clear whether its agreement with UCAR allows it to directly order these sorts of changes (we’ve reached out to the National Science Foundation to ask but haven’t received a response yet). UCAR, for its part, has issued a statement indicating that the USA Today article was the first it has heard of the matter.

In many cases where the administration has attempted to take drastic actions like this, courts have ruled that they run afoul of a legal prohibition against “arbitrary and capricious” federal actions. That said, courtroom losses haven’t inhibited the administration’s willingness to try, and the time spent waiting for legal certainty can often accomplish many of its aims, such as disrupting research on politically disfavored subjects and forcing scientists to look elsewhere for career stability.

Scientists, meanwhile, are reacting with dismay. “Dismantling NCAR is like taking a sledgehammer to the keystone holding up our scientific understanding of the planet,” said Texas Tech climate researcher Katharine Hayhoe. “Everyone who works in climate and weather has passed through its doors and benefited from its incredible resources.”

Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, called NCAR a “unique and valuable asset” and emphasized the wide range of research conducted there.

Obviously, shutting down one source of information about climate change won’t alter what’s happening—greenhouse gases will continue to behave as physics dictates, raising global temperatures. But the Trump administration seemingly views everything through the lens of ideology. It has concluded that scientists are its ideological opponents and thus that its own ideologically driven conclusions are equal to the facts produced by science. Because of that perspective, it has been willing to harm scientists, even if the cost will eventually be felt by the public that Trump ostensibly represents.</div>

            <h2>Google releases Gemini 3 Flash, promising improved intelligence and efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/12/google-releases-gemini-3-flash-promising-improved-intelligence-and-efficiency/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Google began its transition to Gemini 3 a few weeks ago with the launch of the Pro model, and the arrival of Gemini 3 Flash kicks it into high gear. The new, faster Gemini 3 model is coming to the Gemini app and search, and developers will be able to access it immediately via the Gemini API, Vertex AI, AI Studio, and Antigravity. Google’s bigger gen AI model is also picking up steam, with both Gemini 3 Pro and its image component (Nano Banana Pro) expanding in search.

This may come as a shock, but Google says Gemini 3 Flash is faster and more capable than its previous base model. As usual, Google has a raft of benchmark numbers that show modest improvements for the new model. It bests the old 2.5 Flash in basic academic and reasoning tests like GPQA Diamond and MMMU Pro (where it even beats 3 Pro). It gets a larger boost in Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), which tests advanced domain-specific knowledge. Gemini 3 Flash has tripled the old models’ score in HLE, landing at 33.7 percent without tool use. That’s just a few points behind the Gemini 3 Pro model.

Google is talking up Gemini 3 Flash’s coding skills, and the provided benchmarks seem to back that talk up. Over the past year, Google has mostly pushed its Pro models as the best for generating code, but 3 Flash has done a lot of catching up. In the popular SWE-Bench Verified test, Gemini 3 Flash has gained almost 20 points on the 2.5 branch.

The new model is also a lot less likely to get general-knowledge questions wrong. In the Simple QA Verified test, Gemini 3 Flash scored 68.7 percent, which is only a little below Gemini 3 Pro. The last Flash model scored just 28.1 percent on that test. At least as far as the evaluation scores go, Gemini 3 Flash performs much closer to Google’s Pro model versus the older 2.5 family. At the same time, it’s considerably more efficient, according to Google.

One of Gemini 3 Pro’s defining advances was its ability to generate interactive simulations and multimodal content. Gemini 3 Flash reportedly retains that underlying capability. Gemini 3 Flash offers better performance than Gemini 2.5 Pro did, but it runs workloads three times faster. It’s also a lot cheaper than the Pro models if you’re paying per token. One million input tokens for 3 Flash will run devs $0.50, and a million output tokens will cost $3. However, that’s an increase compared to Gemini 2.5 Flash input and output at $0.30 and $2.50, respectively. The Pro model’s tokens are $2 (1M input) and $12 (1M output).

Google’s rapid-fire release of new AI models and tools has occasionally made the Gemini app a bit confusing. Over recent weeks, the settings have been pared down and rearranged. With the release of Gemini 3 Flash, that will become the new default model in the Gemini app and web interface—that’s the Fast setting in the app, as well as the one labeled Thinking, which uses simulated reasoning for better outputs.

Gemini 3 Pro will continue to be available under the Pro option. That’s still a bit misleading, though, as both versions of Gemini 3 can use the reasoning process that Google likes to call “thinking” to generate answers. Whichever one you choose in the app, you can then select tools like image generation, canvas, and Deep Research.

In addition to its debut in the Gemini app, the new Flash model will be coming to search immediately. When Google says “search” in this context, it mostly means AI Mode. Gemini 3 Flash will be the default model in AI Mode going forward. That means free users will see a notable improvement when using the Gemini app.

There are no specific changes to AI Overviews. Google says AI Overviews will continue to use the best model for the job. Due to its place at the top of organic search results, though, you’ll probably see it lean on less capable (but faster) models. Gemini 3 Flash could show up there—even Gemini 3 Pro could power some complex queries in AI Overviews for paying subscribers.

Gemini 3 Pro is also expanding in AI Mode for all US-based users. Likewise, Gemini 3 Pro Image (Nano Banana Pro) will also arrive in AI mode for all. There will be limits on free access to these models, but Google hasn’t specified what those are. It does say that Pro and Ultra subscribers will enjoy much higher usage limits.</div>

            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/12/browser-extensions-with-8-million-users-collect-extended-ai-conversations/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Browser extensions with more than 8 million installs are harvesting complete and extended conversations from users’ AI conversations and selling them for marketing purposes, according to data collected from the Google and Microsoft pages hosting them.

Security firm Koi discovered the eight extensions, which as of late Tuesday night remained available in both Google’s and Microsoft’s extension stores. Seven of them carry “Featured” badges, which are endorsements meant to signal that the companies have determined the extensions meet their quality standards. The free extensions provide functions such as VPN routing to safeguard online privacy and ad blocking for ad-free browsing. All provide assurances that user data remains anonymous and isn’t shared for purposes other than their described use.

An examination of the extensions’ underlying code tells a much more complicated story. Each contains eight of what Koi calls “executor” scripts, with each being unique for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and five other leading AI chat platforms. The scripts are injected into webpages anytime the user visits one of these platforms. From there, the scripts override browsers’ built-in functions for making network requests and receiving responses.

As a result, all interaction between the browser and the AI bots is routed not by the legitimate browser APIs—in this case fetch() and HttpRequest—but through the executor script. The extensions eventually compress the data and send it to endpoints belonging to the extension maker.

“By overriding the [browser APIs], the extension inserts itself into that flow and captures a copy of everything before the page even displays it,” Koi CTO Idan Dardikman wrote in an email. “The consequence: The extension sees your complete conversation in raw form—your prompts, the AI’s responses, timestamps, everything—and sends a copy to their servers.”

Besides ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, the extensions harvest all conversations from Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok, and Meta AI. Koi said the full description of the data captured includes:

The executor script runs independently from the VPN networking, ad blocking, or other core functionality. That means that even when a user toggles off VPN networking, AI protection, ad blocking, or other functions, the conversation collection continues. The only way to stop the harvesting is to disable the extension in the browser settings or to uninstall it.

Koi said it first discovered the conversation harvesting in Urban VPN Proxy, a VPN routing extension that lists “AI protection” as one of its benefits. The data collection began in early July with the release of version 5.5.0.

“Anyone who used ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or the other targeted platforms while Urban VPN was installed after July 9, 2025 should assume those conversations are now on Urban VPN’s servers and have been shared with third parties,” the company said. “Medical questions, financial details, proprietary code, personal dilemmas—all of it, sold for ‘marketing analytics purposes.&#39;”

Following that discovery, the security firm uncovered seven additional extensions with identical AI harvesting functionality. Four of the extensions are available in the Chrome Web Store. The other four are on the Edge add-ons page. Collectively, they have been installed more than 8 million times.

The extensions come with conflicting messages about how they handle bot conversations, which often contain deeply personal information about users’ physical and mental health, finances, personal relationships, and other sensitive information that could be a gold mine for marketers and data brokers. The Urban VPN Proxy in the Chrome Web Store, for instance, lists “AI protection” as a benefit. It goes on to say:

Our VPN provides added security features to help shield your browsing experience from phishing attempts, malware, intrusive ads and AI protection which checks prompts for personal data (like an email or phone number), checks AI chat responses for suspicious or unsafe links and displays a warning before click or submit your prompt.

On the privacy policy for the extension, Google says the developer has declared that user data isn’t sold to third parties outside of approved use cases and won’t be “used or transferred for purposes that are unrelated to the item’s core functionality.” The page goes on to list the personal data handled as location, web history, and website content.

Koi said that a consent prompt that the extensions display during setup notifies the user that they process “ChatAI communication,” “pages you visit,” and “security signals.” The notification goes on to say that the data is processed to “provide these protections,” which presumably means the core functions such as VPN routing or ad blocking.

The only explicit mention of AI conversations being harvested is in legalese buried in the privacy policy, such as this 6,000-word one for Urban VPN Proxy, posted on each extension website. There, it says that the extension will “collect the prompts and outputs queried by the End-User or generated by the AI chat provider, as applicable.” It goes on to say that the extension developer will “disclose the AI prompts for marketing analytics purposes.”

All eight extensions and the privacy policies covering them are developed and written by Urban Cyber Security, a company that says its apps and extensions are used by 100 million people. The policies say the extensions share “Web Browsing Data” with “our affiliated company,” which is listed as both BiScience and B.I Science. The affiliated company “uses this raw data and creates insights which are commercially used and shared with Business Partners.” The policy goes on to refer users to the BiScience privacy policy. BiScience, whose privacy practices have been scrutinized before, says its services “transform enormous volumes of digital signals into clear, actionable market intelligence.”

It’s hard to fathom how both Google and Microsoft would allow such extensions onto their platforms at all, let alone go out of their way to endorse seven of them with a featured badge. Neither company returned emails asking how they decide which extensions qualify for such a distinction, if they have plans to stop making them available to Chrome and Edge users, or why the privacy policies are so unclear to normal users.

Messages sent to both individual extension developers and Urban Cyber Security went unanswered. BiScience provides no email. A call to the company’s New York office was answered by someone who said they were in Israel and to call back during normal business hours in that country.

Koi’s discovery is the latest cautionary tale illustrating the growing perils of being online. It’s questionable in the first place whether people should trust their most intimate secrets and sensitive business information to AI chatbots, which come with no HIPAA assurances, attorney-client privilege, or expectations of privacy. Yet increasingly, that’s exactly what AI companies are encouraging, and users, it seems, are more than willing to comply.

Compounding the risk is the rush to install free apps and extensions—particularly those from little-known developers and providing at best minimal benefits—on devices storing and transmitting these chats. Taken together, they’re a recipe for disaster, and that’s exactly what we have here.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Waymo’s self-driving taxis are at it again, this time blocking a widely trafficked street during the annual Venice Beach canals holiday boat parade in Los Angeles.

Footage of a Waymo getting confused at a narrow canal bridge was shared by local resident Ryan Light on Instagram. It shows a Waymo cautiously waiting to enter the bridge, as a single line of cars piles up on the one-way street behind it.

“One narrow bridge, an unusual amount and positioning of pedestrian chaos… and suddenly it panicked, froze and blocked traffic for a mile,” Light wrote. “All the pedestrian activity just made it shut down, though folks weren’t directly in the way.”

Along with the video, Light wrote in a comment that the wayward Waymo blocked traffic for an agonizing 45 minutes, as pedestrians shuffled to the side of the bridge so it could make its way across.

“Here and there it would inch forward, usually in a non-helpful direction,” Light observed.

Footage shows a police officer walking alongside the self-driving vehicle as it slowly tries to cross, an agonizing bit at a time. “The bridge was cleared numerous times, only to refill with pedestrians,” Light recalled. “Any movement would get the people as excited as the best floats in the parade below.”

As Waymo glitches go, it’s pretty ironic: in a sense, attempts by law enforcement to jockey the crowd around in order to clear vehicle traffic are a perfect illustration of who gets the right-of-way in US cities.

Yet until the boat parade ends, the crowd was able to hold the Waymo off — effectively creating a car-free footbridge that otherwise would’ve been traveled by “hundreds of cars,” as Light observed.

Light comes to a similar conclusion. After the Waymo passes, he has “no idea what happened to it at the next bridge, but watching a self driving car struggle with a decades old neighborhood tradition was endlessly entertaining, and more memorable than the parade (though that was great too).”More on self-driving cars: Waymo Haunted by Killing of Beloved Neighborhood Cat</div>

            <h2>Scientists Say They’ve Found Another Anomaly About 3I/ATLAS</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We’re mere days away from mysterious interstellar object 3I/ATLAS making its closest approach to Earth before it speeds back out of the solar system, never to be seen again.

The object, which scientists believe is a comet visiting from far away, is expected to come within just shy of twice the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. While that may sound like an enormous divide, astronomers are eager to point ground- and space-based telescopes at the extremely rare object during the best opportunity they’ll ever have to study it.

As we wait to hear more about those observations, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb — who has long championed the far-fetched hypothesis that the object could be an alien spacecraft coming to visit — is continuing to closely track 3I/ATLAS, while taking note of what he calls its many “anomalies.”

The main thing that got his attention was that the object’s trajectory is almost exactly aligned with the solar system’s planets, in a striking coincidence. And that’s without getting into the object’s unusually large suspected size, its close approach of several solar system planets, its unexpectedly high concentration of carbon dioxide ice and gas, and a “Sunward jet” that he suggests could be a beam designed to “mitigate the risk from micrometeorites or rocks,” among several other “anomalies.”

Now, he’s pointing to a new letter published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, in which a team of astronomers in Spain detailed the “detection of a wobbling high-altitude jet” in the interstellar comet that showed up in observations taken by the Two-meter Twin Telescope in Tenerife, Spain, between early July and September.

According to the findings, this Sun-facing “anti-tail” jet is “offset by less than eight degrees from the poles associated with the rotation axis of the nucleus,” as Loeb explained in his latest blog post, which means that “3I/ATLAS has a steady dayside and a steady nightside, which switch roles at perihelion,” or its closest approach to the Sun.

3I/ATLAS reached perihelion on October 29, coming within 126 million miles of the Sun.

Loeb argued that it’s extremely unlikely — a probability of just 0.5 percent, according to his calculations — that the object’s rotation axis would be aligned within just eight degrees with the direction of the Sun, giving it a smooth transition from dayside to nightside.

“If not for that special alignment, the anti-tail jet towards the Sun would have been oriented at a much larger angle relative to the rotation axis and would have shown a much larger wobble in position angle than the observed value of eight degrees,” he wrote.

“With a larger misalignment angle, it could have featured prominent gaps in activity as its base exits the dayside and enters the nightside of 3I/ATLAS,” Loeb explained.

3I/ATLAS’ Sunward anti-tail didn’t disappear after it reached its closest point to the Sun, adding to the mystery. To Loeb, this would imply that there’s a “new pocket of ice near the opposite pole of the rotation axis, that gives rise to a prominent new anti-tail jet after perihelion.”

“Of course, a technological spacecraft might have a reason for aligning the outflow of gas from its thrusters in the direction of the Sun,” he suggested, arguing that “we do not have high-resolution images of the jet direction near perihelion.”

Plenty of questions remain, and Loeb hopes that “upcoming spectroscopic observations of the material” inside 3I/ATLAS’ anti-tail will shed more light on the matter.

            <h2>MIT Fusion Physicist Murdered in His Home</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Lauded theoretical physicist and director of the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center Nuno Loureiro has been murdered at the age of 47.

The professor was shot “multiple times” at this home in Brookline, Massachusetts, according to officials, and died on Tuesday morning in the hospital.

The Norfolk County District Attorney’s Office has since said that the incident is being treated as an “active and ongoing homicide investigation.”

It’s a baffling incident, with no motive in sight — and no clue as to whether the homicide was in any way related to Loureiro’s illustrious career in the fusion energy field.

For decades, scientists have attempted to harness the energy released by fusing atoms inside highly complex reactors, a green and potentially safer alternative to nuclear fission. Scientists are only beginning to crack the point at which fusion plants generate more energy than they require to operate, and plenty of questions remain about our ability to scale up these operations — despite enormous interest from the private sector and major investments from the likes of Amazon cofounder Jeff Bezos and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

Loureiro was known for his award-winning fusion science research, studying the motion of charged particles in the presence of an external magnetic field.

His research “helped inform the design of fusion devices that could harness the energy of fusing plasmas, bringing the dream of clean, near-limitless fusion power closer to reality,” according to an MIT obituary.

Loureiro was convinced that “we are really progressing towards finally having electricity from fusion,” plasma physicist Bruno Soares Gonçalves told Nature.

MIT head of the department of physics Deepto Chakrabarty described him as a “wonderful and engaging colleague, and an inspiring and caring mentor for graduate students working in plasma science.”

“His recent work on quantum computing algorithms for plasma physics simulations was a particularly exciting new scientific direction,” Chakrabarty added.

As we await more news about ongoing investigations into Loureiro’s death, users on social media immediately spun up the rumor mill. Many proposed it had to do with his unusual career.

“I wonder which 3-letter agency did it?” one user speculated.

“It is so obvious what THEY are doing,” another user argued, conspiratorially. “But there will be zero outrage. Zero coverage. This will get swept under the rug just like THEY do to every other cure.”

As we await word from officials and law enforcement, one thing is clear: Loureiro will be sorely missed. He leaves behind a wife and three young children.

“Nuno was not only an extraordinary scientist and educator, but also a tremendous colleague, mentor, and friend who cared deeply about his students and his community,” head of the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT, Benoit Forget, told MIT Tech News in an email. “His absence will be felt profoundly across [Nuclear Science & Engineering] and far beyond.”

            <div id="article-text">In a new experiment, Meta is limiting the number of links users can post on Facebook, unless they have a paid Meta Verified subscription.

Over the last week, several users have spotted Meta’s test, which impacts link posting. Social media strategist Matt Navvara noted that users part of the test can only post two links unless they pay for a Meta Verified subscription, which starts from $14.99 per month.

According to the screenshot posted by Navarra, users can still post affiliate links, comments, and links to Meta platform posts, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

The company confirmed the test to TechCrunch and said it impacts those people using professional mode and Facebook Pages. Professional mode lets you convert your personal profile into a creator profile while making your content eligible for discovery by a wider audience.

“This is a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value for Meta Verified subscribers,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch.

This would directly impact creators and brands posting links from their blogs or other platforms to reach a wider audience.

The company said it is trying to learn how it can add more value to Meta Verified subscribers, and this test is one such experiment to enhance that paid plan. The company added that, at the moment, publishers are not included in this test. It also said that users can still post links in comments, and they are not impacted by the limit.

In its transparency report for Q3, Meta said that more than 98% views on the feed in the U.S. come from the posts that don’t have any links. It is not clear if this signal pushed the company to experiment with limits on link sharing, however. The company said that the majority of the 1.9% of views of posts with links came from a page they followed. Linked posts shared by friends and groups were minimal.

The same report noted that YouTube and TikTok, along with GoFundMe, were the top domains amid the links posted. With the new link posting limit test, creators and brands would be forced to post content from other Meta platforms if they reached their limit, or stop posting altogether if they didn’t want to pay for a subscription.

As AI has taken over the internet, there is an ever-raging debate about the link-based web. AI summary and search have impacted the publishing industry negatively. In the past few years, social networks like X have toyed with demoting linked posts to encourage users to post content on the platforms natively.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced in a message to staff on Wednesday that longtime AWS executive Peter DeSantis will lead a new AI-focused organization within the company.

This organization will be responsible for Amazon’s AI models like Nova, as well as silicon development and quantum computing, which help make AI tools faster and more efficient.

DeSantis has spent 27 years at Amazon, including eight years as an SVP for AWS, the cloud provider that powers about one-third of the internet. At AWS’s recent re:Invent event, Amazon hammered home its commitment to AI for enterprise use, so it makes sense that the company is spinning out a new team from AWS leadership.

“With our Nova 2 models just launched at re:Invent, our custom silicon growing rapidly, and the advantages of optimizing across models, chips, and cloud software and infrastructure, we wanted to free Peter up to focus his energy, invention cycles, and leadership on these new areas,” Jassy wrote.

Amazon’s increasing emphasis on AI comes at a time when the company is eager to strengthen its foothold in the AI race, perhaps more through investments than its own innovations. Last month, AWS announced a $50 billion investment in the U.S. government’s AI infrastructure. Amazon is also reportedly in talks to invest $10 billion in OpenAI, and has already invested $8 billion in OpenAI rival Anthropic.

            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/rad-power-bikes-files-for-bankruptcy-and-is-looking-to-sell-the-business/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Electric bike company Rad Power Bikes filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday, weeks after it warned employees that it could shut down without new funding.

The company will continue to operate while the bankruptcy case proceeds, and it’s looking to sell the business within 45-60 days, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.

“This step allows us to keep operating in the ordinary course of business while we pursue the best possible outcome for the people who rely on Rad every day,” they said in a statement. “Our goal is to keep the company intact and preserve the relationships we have built with riders, vendors, suppliers, and partners.”

Rad Power is the latest in a series of e-bike companies from around the world to go through bankruptcy after pandemic-era excitement for the category wore off. Some of those companies have re-emerged, though, with VanMoof and Cake finding new owners during their respective court-led restructuring processes.

Rad itself had told employees in November that there had been a “very promising” option to keep the company afloat that was “likely to close,” but the deal fell apart. The company has not shared more details about that potential deal.

Weeks later, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued a warning that older Rad Power batteries posed “a risk of serious injury and death” after receiving 31 reports of fires. Rad Power said it “strongly disagrees” with the CPSC’s characterizations.

Rad’s tough November came at the end of a fairly tumultuous few years for the company. It has gone through multiple rounds of layoffs and swapped CEOs earlier this year, bringing in an executive with decades of experience turning around underperforming companies. That new CEO, Kathi Lentzch, said Rad was shifting away from the direct-to-consumer model that had helped fuel its rise and towards a retail-focused approach.

“This shift creates new opportunities to reach more riders, strengthen customer relationships, and evolve the brand in meaningful ways,” she said in a statement at the time. “[I]t’s an incredible time to come on board.”

The company said it entered the bankruptcy process with $32 million in assets and $73 million in liabilities. More than $8 million of its debt was owed to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency for unpaid tariffs. (The company has listed this claim as ‘disputed’ in the bankruptcy paperwork.)

It’s not clear how much that contributed to Rad’s slide into bankruptcy. But it wouldn’t be the first time that Donald Trump’s tariffs helped push a micromobility company over the edge. During his first term, Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports helped take the remaining wind out of electric skateboard company Boosted’s sails. Boosted went under shortly after.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">How much does an American family of four need to earn to avoid poverty? According to the Census Bureau, $32,130. But what if it were really $140,000? Late last month, the investor and Substack writer Michael Green advanced this attention-grabbing claim, which implies that a majority of Americans are living in poverty today. He argued, further, that families earning $40,000 to $100,000 were stuck in a “valley of death” because “benefits disappear faster than wages rise.” These figures have launched a thousand subsequent takes—most of them skeptical but some sympathetic. Chris Arnade, the author of the book Dignity: Seeking Respect in Back Row America, wrote that “the core of its argument is correct” because too many people in “the ‘aspirational bottom’ are being squeezed.”

Under modest examination, Green’s empirical claims fall apart. But they bespeak a troubling trend among the commentariat—and even some scholars—of exaggerating the extent of poverty in America. Social-justice discourse, whether about environmentalism, racism, sexism, or poverty, has a tendency to advance maximalist claims as a sign of maximal concern. The intention is usually to express solidarity with the oppressed. But collapsing the distinction between the actual poor and the lower-middle class obscures more than it helps. And talking about poverty as intractable or unfixable is a kind of demotivational speaking.

Green’s miscalculations start in an understandable place: his bewilderment when he realizes that the American government’s official poverty line is arbitrary. As the War on Poverty was beginning in the 1960s, the federal government needed to properly define the enemy. The task fell to Mollie Orshansky, an economist at the Social Security Administration. Orshansky estimated the cost of the minimum amount of food needed to sustain a family, then—based on original surveys showing that poor families spent one-third of their income on food—multiplied the cost by three. Today’s official poverty thresholds, which vary by household size and other factors, are the result of taking those monetary values and indexing them for inflation.

Green argues that because families spend a smaller portion of their income on food today, the real multiplier should not be three, but 16. That gets him to a poverty line in the neighborhood of $140,000. This number fails common sense, but Green defends its soundness by calculating the basic cost of modern living, including child care, housing, and health care. He does so by pointing to data aggregated from the MIT Living Wage Calculator based on expenses in Essex County, New Jersey, which suggest that a family of four with two working members would need to earn $136,500 a year. Yet Essex County is a high-cost-of-living area whose expenses are not at all representative of the country. He later modified his estimate to $94,000 using data from Lynchburg, Virginia—a level still triple the official poverty measure. Green told me he stands by his analysis, and believes critics are attacking him to avoid addressing the rise in inequality and lack of progressivity in the tax code.

Many economists and sociologists who study poverty understand that the federal threshold is flawed, and seek to improve its measurement. First, the problems: The official poverty measure has accounted for very few variations in cost of living; it’s the same in rural Louisiana as it is in San Francisco. It also does not capture transfers such as the earned-income and child tax credits—probably the most important anti-poverty programs currently operating—and excludes the value of food stamps and health insurance provided through Medicaid. As a result, although the official poverty measure is a fine tool to gauge a family’s eligibility for benefits, it is a bad way to measure actual poverty once those programs have gone into effect.

A lot of work has been put into creating poverty measures that can capture deprivation after accounting for welfare benefits. The most important of these is the “supplemental poverty measure,” which the Census Bureau began reporting in 2011. The supplemental poverty measure includes benefit programs ignored by the official poverty measure and accounts for regional differences in cost of living, as well as necessary health- and child-care expenses. Analysis by the Columbia Center on Poverty and Social Policy found that the United States had an overall poverty rate in 2024 of 12.9 percent. The center’s calculations also show what the welfare state actually accomplishes: Without it, the poverty rate that year would have been nearly double, at 23.7 percent. And they show how much poverty has declined over the decades. The share of adults in poverty is down roughly 30 percent from 1967; for children, it is down 35 percent; and among the elderly, it is down about 60 percent.

But admission of progress against poverty seems to be anathema. In 2019, when Joe Biden was running for president, he claimed that “almost half” of Americans were living in poverty. His campaign cited numbers from the Poor People’s Campaign, which argued that 43 percent of Americans were poor. This statistic turned out to be a category error: Americans living below 200 percent of the poverty level are classified as “poor or low-income.” (But this standard perhaps helps explain the Biden administration’s ironclad pledge to not increase taxes on Americans making less than $400,000—as though this were the dividing line for the middle class.)

A cottage industry of other indexes insists that huge swaths of the country not currently classified as poor deserve that consideration. One report based on the MIT Living Wage Calculator argued that only 56 percent of full-time workers in the United States are making a living wage. The charity United Way has constructed an index called ALICE, which implies that 42 percent of American households are either in poverty or unable to afford basic necessities. There are right-coded spin-offs of the idea too: The Cost-of-Thriving Index put out by the heterodox-conservative think tank American Compass argues that to support a family of four, a full-time working man would need to work 62 weeks a year. To paraphrase Daniel Patrick Moynihan, this is a collective effort of defining poverty upward.

Even prominent academics are not immune to this tendency. In his best-selling 2023 book, Poverty, by America, the Princeton sociologist Matthew Desmond argues that “poverty persists because some wish and will it to.” Desmond claims that there has been a “lack of progress on poverty” because the share of Americans below the official poverty level has fluctuated between 10 and 15 percent for decades. He pays less attention to the supplemental poverty measure—the one actually capable of measuring progress that’s due to government policy—which shows significant improvement.

The acclaimed book $2.00 a Day, by the researchers Kathryn Edin, of Princeton, and H. Luke Shaefer, of the University of Michigan, argued that millions of Americans were living on less than $2 a day—an extremely low standard of poverty that the World Bank used in reference to developing countries. The economist Bruce Meyer and his colleagues subsequently debunked this premise, finding that the reported calculation was an artifact from the underreporting of benefits such as food stamps in income surveys. Once you account for them, Meyer and his colleagues argued, more than 90 percent of such households originally labeled extremely poor turned out to be misclassified.

The tendency toward declinism—the idea that poverty cannot simply be bad, but rather must be getting worse—generates ineffective policy because it obscures the extent to which redistribution of money already works as intended. But its psychological appeal is worth scrutinizing. Americans are dour about an economy that is enviable to other countries. Consumer confidence today is as low as it was during the Great Recession—despite the fact that real median household income is 19 percent higher than it was in 2009 (and the S&P 500 is roughly 10 times its nadir in March that year). The culprits are the recent bout of inflation and the inaccessibility of the housing market, which have soured most Americans’ perceptions of the economy. This economic discontent propelled Donald Trump back into office in 2024; Democrats hope that the same force can push his party out of office in 2026. “There’s this past-five-year problem that gets translated into a past-50-years problem,” Scott Winship, of the American Enterprise Institute, told me. “It strengthens all of these strong nostalgia-laden claims about life being better 50 years ago.”

Complacency about poverty isn’t required. Though much progress has been made against child poverty, the present level is still too high. But it is remediable by, for example, expanding child tax credits at the federal and state levels and creating baby-bond programs that build wealth that is accessible upon a child reaching adulthood. These achievable goals are obscured by assertions that households with six-figure salaries are the truly disadvantaged, or that “late capitalism” inevitably requires Dickensian exploitation of the poor. It breeds fatalism among the already convinced and disbelief among the critics. Exaggerating poverty hinders, rather than hastens, its eradication.</div>

            <h2>Democrats Sound Like They’re in Doha</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/12/democrats-israel-criticism-qatar-alliance/685232/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">No one attends the Doha Forum to hear balanced discussions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The annual conference—the Qatari government funds business-class travel and accommodation for some 5,000 people—allows this pocket-size monarchy to showcase its central diplomatic role. And the prerogative of the host is to shape the narrative.

The topics covered are broad and diverse, but on Israeli-Palestinian matters, in addition to touting their own role in negotiating a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages, the Qataris made space for a wide range of strongly critical voices of Israel: former Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif (whose position is that Israel should simply disappear), the American scholars and think tankers Rob Malley and Trita Parsi, Tucker Carlson, numerous distinguished Palestinians. Only Hillary Clinton offered a different perspective. (Although some Israelis with second-country passports attended the conference, none spoke from a stage.)

That I found myself ideologically isolated in Qatar was unsurprising. But in some respects, I find myself in a similar position at home among some of my fellow Democrats—and that’s a new and more alarming development.

I was in Doha to speak with Qatari officials about the steps they must take to get President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza under way. After Israel’s attempt to kill Hamas leaders in Doha in mid-September, Qatar (together with Turkey) finally exerted enough pressure on Hamas to agree to release all remaining Israeli hostages without a full withdrawal of Israeli troops. At the same time, Trump pressured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a cease-fire without the complete dismantlement of Hamas. It was a major breakthrough, and all involved deserve credit.

Graeme Wood: Why the Gaza peace deal is like an Anglican wedding

But implementation of the second phase of Trump’s plan has stalled. The plan calls for the full disarmament of Hamas—relinquishing its weapons, the means of producing or smuggling new ones, and tunnels. And that is the sine qua non for every other element of the plan—deployment of an international stabilization force, releasing tens of billions of dollars in reconstruction funds, standing up technocratic transitional Palestinian leadership, achieving a full Israeli withdrawal. None of those other steps—or the better life for Palestinians in Gaza they promise to provide—will happen unless Hamas is fully removed from power and disarmed. And I know of no actors besides Qatar and Turkey that have the leverage and influence to persuade Hamas, which they have supported financially, logistically, and ideologically, to take that step. I told the Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, that he’d proved as much by getting the hostages released.

If others at the conference shared this focus, we were a distinct minority. There were plenty of calls for treating Israel as an international pariah, labeling the country’s response to the October 7, 2023, Hamas invasion as a genocide, criticizing the United States for its support for Israel, and even treating Hamas as a legitimate “resistance” organization rather than a violent terrorist group.

More surprising is that such views have become prominent among Democrats in the United States. My former Obama-administration colleague Ben Rhodes argued in a lengthy essay in The New York Times that Democrats should take the lead on ending U.S. support for Israel. He grounds his case in both morality—this is the appropriate response to Israeli military operations in Gaza—and politics, arguing that this policy responds to the demands of American voters, especially younger ones. His argument fails on both of those grounds, but it fails in another important dimension as well: the strategic. But given the spread of this perspective, it’s worth following the logic of his argument, exploring what it overlooks, and seeing where the policies he advocates would lead.

First, it’s important to say that Rhodes got some things right. No caring person can be blind to the violence, hunger, and displacement that Palestinian civilians have endured in Gaza over the past two years. The number of civilian deaths is smaller than the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry’s tally of some 70,000 killed, a number that purposefully does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. But the only appropriate answer to how many civilians have been killed is: too many. Each one represents an entire world and a tragedy.

Without a doubt, aspects of Israel’s conduct of the war have resulted in too much civilian death and deserve criticism. I served in the Department of Defense during much of the war and was in frequent contact with Israeli counterparts. They described targeting protocols that closely resembled those of other Western militaries and argued, correctly, that Hamas embedded its fighters and weapons within and beneath civilians, including in schools and hospitals; hijacked humanitarian assistance; and welcomed civilian casualties as a propaganda tool. We acknowledged that Hamas is ultimately responsible for the health and safety of Gazans, but we argued, in turn, that Hamas’s perfidy did not alleviate Israel’s responsibility to make every effort to minimize civilian casualties. At times, Israel’s tolerance of such casualties in pursuit of an ostensibly legitimate military target was higher than ours, and higher than it should be for any nation governed by the rule of law.

And, of course, Netanyahu’s leadership has been severely lacking. He has prioritized his own self-interest, which led him to include racists and extremists such as Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich in his cabinet, on whom he then became dependent. That led to delays in humanitarian assistance reaching civilians in need, disruptions at key moments in negotiations to free Israeli hostages, calls for the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza and for Gaza’s annexation to Israel, and unchecked Israeli extremist violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank.

Yair Rosenberg: Netanyahu just admitted he’s unfit to lead Israel

These facts are not in serious dispute and together presented a major challenge to U.S. interests and values, as Washington sought to provide support for an ally in distress.

But to end the analysis here completely misses the broader frame of what was happening, or at least dismisses multiple things that were happening at the same time.

Hamas’s massive, vicious terrorist attack against Israel on October 7 could not go without a response. Just as the United States could not fail to respond to the September 11 attack by al-Qaeda (or, for that matter, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor), Israel—facing an assault that resulted in proportionately several times the toll of 9/11, with civilians slaughtered in their homes and at a music festival, and 251 hostages dragged into Gaza—needed to defend its citizens and ensure that such an attack could not be repeated. It had to do so while facing immediate attacks on two other fronts, from Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Later, the sponsor of this entire network, Iran, joined the fray with two massive barrages of missiles and drones against Israel.

At the outset, there was bipartisan support for a strategic Israeli response. Former president Barack Obama—my ex-boss, and Rhodes’s ex-boss—had it right when he wrote two weeks after the surprise attack, “Israel has a right to defend its citizens against such wanton violence, and I fully support President Biden’s call for the United States to support our long-time ally in going after Hamas, dismantling its military capabilities, and facilitating the safe return of hundreds of hostages to their families.” (Obama also wrote movingly about the need for Israel to protect civilians in Gaza, even as he acknowledged that Hamas used those civilians as cover.)

The story of the attack and its aftermath—so often ignored in commentaries about the past two years—affirms that what the United States was dealing with was not a genocidal nation out to destroy all Palestinians but a deeply imperfect democratic partner beset by enemies, actual genocidal enemies, and terrorists sworn to its physical destruction.

Israel has a powerful military. But this war has proved that even an uncoordinated set of attacks by members of the Iranian axis can do significant damage to Israel’s society and economy, functionally shrink its usable sovereign territory, and call into question its ability to sustain itself. There is no doubt about the commitment of these adversaries to their ideological crusade. Even after suffering humiliating blows from Israel and the United States against its nuclear facilities in June, Iran’s leaders seem determined to spend their last rial to rebuild their ability to attack Israel, rearm their proxies, and prepare for another round—even as their citizens can no longer rely on running water in Tehran. Facing such adversaries, Israel needed to deliver decisive defeats to discourage future attacks.

But even as it pursued this necessary strategy, it had to remember that it is a democracy. President Joe Biden’s rush to Israel to provide comfort and support days after October 7—Rhodes, in his Times essay, bizarrely suggests that a visit to Israel under attack was inappropriate in and of itself—included his warning to the Israelis, drawn from America’s post-9/11 failings, not to let justified grief and outrage consume reason.

Some of what Netanyahu and his war cabinet subsequently did may have failed that test. But the notion that the United States should wash its hands of its relationship with Israel rests on a glaring error: conflating a government with its people. Those who told the world that the United States’ mistakes after 9/11 should not define us, and that the world should work with us as we tried, unevenly, to find our way to a better path, should recognize as much. So should Democrats, disgusted by Trump’s repulsive and immoral leadership, who hope that our partners abroad will not believe that he represents America in its entirety and write us off. Similarly, Netanyahu, the longtime prime minister of Israel with whom we have to deal, does not equal Israel. The hundreds of thousands of Israelis who gathered in the streets for weekly protests are enough to tell us that.

President Obama believed that we don’t get to choose the leaders of our partners and that we can’t make decisions for them. But we must work with them, attempt to resolve disagreements as best we can, and preserve cooperation and core mutual commitments that advance our interests.

At times, that approach can and should mean using U.S. leverage to achieve better results. I don’t claim that Biden always got that balance right after October 7. But even in that instance there were examples of the use of such tools to good effect.

In the spring of 2024, when Israel was preparing an offensive to attack four Hamas battalions in Rafah, where 1.8 million Palestinians had taken shelter, Biden insisted on a pause. He was determined to avoid rates of civilian casualties similar to those inflicted on Gaza City and Khan Younis. Over several weeks, U.S. and Israeli civilian and military officials discussed approaches. When Israel ultimately proceeded, it did so in a far more precise and deliberate manner that enabled it to reach legitimate Hamas targets while giving civilians time to evacuate and producing far less harm.

Weeks later, in May 2024, Biden paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs, upset by their use in areas congested with civilians. This caused major tension with Israel. But by June, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was prepared to sign a letter committing to not using such weapons in Gaza, which would still enable him to use them against Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Iran, where major threats lurked but civilian casualties were much easier to avoid. Although that agreement stalled, these examples of dialogue between the U.S. and Israeli militaries and agreements reached at the political level point to the proper use of U.S. leverage, to ensure that an ally under fire from terrible adversaries—its and ours—can defend itself, but in a way that upholds U.S. standards and values.

Those who argue that Biden should have cut off Israel much earlier in the war make clear that they would accept an outcome in which Hamas emerged largely unscathed and almost certainly still holding hostages. (Hamas, like Netanyahu, also found reason to delay hostage negotiations at every turn.) Although the task of removing Hamas from power remains unfinished, anyone who cares about Palestinian suffering should at least spare a thought for the way Hamas’s misrule has ruined the lives of the people of Gaza.

Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib: War is coming back to Gaza

At the political level, some envision a broad coalition forged around opposition to U.S. support for Israel propelling Democrats to victory. Notwithstanding polling that shows a significant decline in Israel’s standing among various sectors of the American public, it’s a thin reed on which to build a political coalition. U.S. elections rarely hinge on foreign-policy issues, and the intense emotions of this war will compete with new outrages—Trump provides them daily—that will absorb attention. Establishing opposition to aid to Israel as a litmus test for Democratic candidates is a means of subtraction, not addition. Democrats need to find a way to assemble a governing majority, not drive out elements of their coalition.

But there is a darker danger to the approach that Rhodes and others endorse. Nearly by definition, calls for ending all U.S.-Israel security cooperation draw those making them into alignment with others on a much more extreme fringe—those for whom it is not enough to end U.S. military assistance to Israel, who fundamentally believe that there is no legitimacy for Israel to exist as a Jewish state. They have found their voice and are making it heard.

If the test of fealty for the Democratic Party becomes supporting international efforts to pressure Israel to define itself out of existence, or expressing indifference to the campaign of Israel’s enemies to destroy it, we will be in a much uglier place. That is not a policy that would meet any moral test, and it would likely be a political loser among the voters who actually determine the outcome of elections. Those calling for an end to U.S. support for Israel need to be mindful that, perhaps inadvertently, they are abetting this camp.

There is also strategic blindness in the proposal to cut off Israel. Its advocates do not honestly wrestle with its likely consequences for U.S. interests and influence in the region.

The end of the U.S.-Israel security partnership would have three immediate effects. First, it would make Israel appear vulnerable, leading Iran and its allies to accelerate their efforts, already under way, to rearm and prepare for another, perhaps decisive, war. Far from advancing the cause of peace, such a move would likely intensify the region’s conflicts.

Second, it would undermine bipartisan efforts to build an integrated coalition of U.S. partners—Israel and moderate Arab states—that assist one another and allow the United States to play a supporting, but not always leading, role in maintaining regional stability. Arab states are deepening their relationship with Israel in large part because they believe that it will bring them closer to the United States. When we are seen as a less reliable partner for our closest regional ally, they will draw obvious conclusions. Cutting off Israel would thus lead to a less stable, more conflict-ridden region. And it would actually set back Palestinian aspirations by undermining the Saudi-Israeli normalization deal that might advance them.

Third, the end of security assistance to Israel would soon mean the same for Jordan and Egypt, whose assistance programs derive from their peace treaties with Israel. Jordan’s stability could be placed at immediate risk, with spillover dangers in Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the West Bank. Egypt would not stop arming itself; it would simply buy weapons from Russia and China. Gulf states, boxed out from purchasing U.S. equipment by ongoing U.S. legal requirements to sustain Israel’s qualitative military edge, would do the same. There is no better or faster way to open the door to our competitors’ planting their flag in a strategic and volatile region than by cutting off Israel.

The net result of these trends will be a dramatic decline in U.S. influence in the Middle East. For those embracing the impulse to look inward, that may seem fine. Early in the cycle of isolationism, as in the 1930s or after the Cold War, it always does. But eventually, a shock or crisis—World War II, 9/11, or one that we can’t yet name but that will surely come—will draw us back into the region, but under far worse conditions and at a much higher cost.

Sustaining a functional relationship with Israel, with all of its flaws, is manifestly more beneficial to U.S. interests than the alternative. And we need to keep perspective. Netanyahu will not govern forever. The Israeli public has moved rightward, but there are reasonable leaders from the center right and the center left to cultivate. A Palestinian state will not be on the agenda in the Israeli election campaign of 2026, but as the war recedes, there will be various ways to engage the Israeli public—an imperative that Israel’s critics utterly ignore but that is crucial for obtaining the outcomes we want in a democracy—to incentivize them to vote in a more moderate direction. Bidding them good riddance and telling them that they are on their own would do the opposite. Ignoring the responsibility of other actors—such as Palestinian Authority leaders who must embrace reform and demonstrate the capacity to govern and defeat extremists—would do the same.

If Israel wants to see Democrats pursue engagement, then it must help. Expressing conceptual openness to Palestinian statehood as part of a regionally integrated framework—even if it takes longer than Palestinians might hope and assumes a form that looks different from previous efforts—will be important. Keeping extremists out of the Israeli government, and cracking down on extremist violence, is crucial. And recognizing that legitimate security operations must include maximum efforts to protect civilians is essential. Although Israel Defense Forces commanders were always clear that their intent was to target Hamas, not civilians, their tolerance of civilian casualties in pursuit of legitimate military targets was far too high. An intense military-to-military dialogue could help persuade them to adjust that calculation. As in any war, specific charges that soldiers committed war crimes must be investigated and adjudicated in a credible military-justice system—something the United States military has done, albeit imperfectly.

Democrats, and all Americans, face a choice in upcoming elections. We can make the moral, political, and strategic error of trying to wash our hands of a relationship with a democratic partner under stress that has made many mistakes as it has fought to defend itself. Or we can commit to working with that partner and its current, flawed leadership while we wait for new leaders to emerge. We can choose to sustain crucial aspects of a relationship that serves our moral and strategic interests, while insisting on changes that conform with U.S. values. The latter course is clearly the better choice.</div>

ISIS attacks over the past week in Australia and Syria have led some to wonder whether the Islamist terrorist organization, once also known as the Islamic State, is making a comeback.

“Actually,” says Bruce Hoffman, “it never went away.”

Hoffman is a professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations. “We defeated the caliphate,” he told me on Tuesday, referring to the stretch of land—one-third of Syria and two-fifths of Iraq—that ISIS ruled from 2014–19, until a coalition of 90 nations crushed it militarily. But ISIS itself “reverted to its roots and has emerged as a highly capable international terrorist organization” that “still poses a threat to the security of Western countries.”

About 1,000 U.S. troops are still based in Syria, mainly to fight the group’s surviving remnants. So it shouldn’t be too surprising that ISIS militiamen killed two of them, as well as an American translator, in an ambush over the weekend.

Australia is a different case; ISIS has never mounted a political or military challenge to the existing order. But antisemitic incidents have soared in the two years since Hamas’ assault on Israel; the pace of incidents since then is five times as high as in the decade before the war in Gaza got underway. Some of these incidents have been theatrical (anti-Israel graffiti), but some have been deadly—for instance last year’s burning of a synagogue in Melbourne, an event that, like this week’s mass shooting on Bondi Beach, took place around the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah.

This latest attack killed at least 15 people.

News outlets have reported that the two gunmen, a father and a son, were “inspired” by ISIS. But Hoffman suspects that the connection is more direct. The pair had recently spent time—and might have been trained—in the southern Philippines, a region he describes as a “hotbed” of ISIS activity.

The Australian people stepped up in response to the latest attack. A Syrian immigrant, the owner of a nearby fruit stand, tackled and disarmed one of the gunmen at great personal risk. More than 20,000 citizens lined up to donate blood for the dozens who were injured in the attack—most of them Jews gathered to celebrate the beginning of Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights. The Australian government also moved swiftly to tighten laws on firearms; the two shooters had bought their weapons legally.

It is hard to say how many ISIS adherents are still around and active. A “counterterrorism guide” published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence estimates between 8,800 and 13,100 (though the document doesn’t explain how it came to such precise figures). Hoffman thinks this number is too low, placing the figure somewhere between 13,000 and 20,000.

At the height of the caliphate, Hoffman says, ISIS had recruited 53,000 foreign fighters from more than 80 countries. Some were subsequently killed; many more likely deserted. But others simply moved. The ODNI fact sheet describes the organization as “a global enterprise, overseeing at least 15 branches and networks in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, as well as supporters worldwide.”

The burning of the Melbourne synagogue wasn’t even the most damaging assault by ISIS last year. In January 2024, two ISIS suicide bombers killed 84 Shiite Muslims who were attending a memorial service for Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran’s terrorist operations throughout the Middle East, on the fourth anniversary of his assassination. (ISIS is a radical Sunni Muslim group.) Two months later, agents of ISIS-K (the K denotes the Khorasan region, which overlaps parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran) planned and carried out a mass shooting at a concert hall in Moscow, killing 137 and injuring at least 100. (U.S. intelligence officials had warned the Kremlin of the impending attack, but Moscow ignored them.)

“Iran and Moscow are police states,” Hoffman said. “If ISIS can operate in police states, they can operate in Western countries”—as the attack on the open beach in Australia tragically demonstrated.

According to the ODNI document, “ISIS elements use ambushes, IED [improvised-explosive-device] attacks, kidnappings, military-style assaults, suicide operations, and targeted killings,” and the organization “encourages supporters worldwide to conduct operations in their own countries using readily available weapons.” The intelligence agency, however, adds that the group’s ability to train and deploy agents against civilian targets in Europe has been “significantly degraded during the past decade.” Certainly, its ability to mount centralized or coordinated attacks has sharply diminished.

Still, the global war on terrorism, like global terrorism itself, is far from over.

Discussions of race are everywhere and nowhere in 2025. On one hand, President Donald Trump is openly insulting Somali immigrants, describing entire nations as “shithole” countries, and insisting that the most persecuted class of humans are white South Africans. On the other, none of this is actually registering as anything other than Trump being Trump, and so when the Supreme Court agrees to revisit a foundational doctrine like birthright citizenship, too many of us shrug it off. On this week’s Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick spoke to civil rights attorney Sherrilyn Ifill about her recent Substack, “Is It Too Late,” in which she argued that it is not too late to save American ideals of democracy and equality, but it is assuredly too late to remain indifferent. Part of that conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity below.

Dahlia Lithwick: There is a very human propensity, especially in times of crisis, to normalize and rationalize and temporize. We comfort the comfortable, and we look for hope in norms and in institutions and in rationality. So many people have this perpetual hope that something’s going to come along and life is going to go back to 2010 or 2012. This hope says that with enough time, and even if it’s uncomfortable right now, someone else is going to come along, or some institution is going to come along, and put us in the DeLorean and we’re all going to go back. Can you talk about the ways in which American exceptionalism and the American normalization bias and the profound—just to talk about the Supreme Court as an example—American trust in institutions can get us to the point where it’s not that we don’t see the fire, we can’t even smell the smoke. You write, “everyone should be on full alert,” but you and I both know that not only are people not on full alert, I’m not even sure what could put them on full alert.

Sherrilyn Ifill: I think things are unraveling pretty fast and people will get on full alert. The only question is, when they get on full alert, will it be too late? That’s why I’m saying: “You might want to do that now.” I’ve been guilty of this as well: not ringing the alarm bell with sufficient urgency. This is something lawyers do all the time, because we’re used to finding the little interstices and figuring out how to move within these small spaces so that we can get where we want to go and so that we can make change. I was trained in that tradition—you find a way, you find a pathway, and all of that presumes the legitimacy of the framework.

I’m not a nihilist. I actually always do have hope. And I think one of the reasons I feel so clear, in this moment, is that I have no desire to return to 2010. I have no desire to return to the ’80s. I’ve been a civil rights lawyer for 35 years. The ’80s were a nightmare.

What are we returning to? I don’t have a dream time calling out to me. People will say, “When Obama was president.” I mean, really? Because most of the videos you’ve seen of police killing unarmed black men, most of that was in the second Obama administration. That was Eric Garner. That was Ferguson. That was Walter Scott running in that park. So if you’ve been doing the work that I’ve been doing, you’re always invested in the future.

I have excitement and hope in this time because as this whole thing begins to unravel, we have the opportunity to create something new. This is where the 14th Amendment is so helpful for me, because it’s one of the biggest moments of creating something absolutely new in this country, so I use it as inspiration, not only its very words and provisions and guarantees, but also to remind me that we have the right and the obligation to refound our country when it goes astray. That’s what those young kids in college during the Civil Rights Movement did. They did a version of refounding. So I don’t want to suggest that I don’t feel hope for the future. I do feel quite hopeful. But I also feel that pretending that all we need to do is just make some incremental changes to get us back to 2010 interferes with our ability to do that reset. What has been laid bare is that 2010 ain’t it.

We have some serious structural problems. As a litigator, I don’t know how anyone can purport to pretend that they know what the rules are at the Supreme Court anymore. We have a Supreme Court that not only has the power to say what the law is, pursuant to Chief Justice John Marshall and Marbury v. Madison, but they’ve now decided that they have the power to say what the facts are. That has never been part of our system of adjudication and litigation. Assigning factual findings to the Supreme Court? No, that is for the trial courts, for district courts. But we are now seeing a majority on the Supreme Court that regularly swats away the findings of the district court. That is the power of the district court. They are closest to the conflict. They can evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. They’re seeing the exhibits, the documents, all of it. It’s playing out in real time. It’s not theoretical for them. And now we have a Supreme Court that months later will swat away a two-week trial and the findings of fact over 160 pages by a district court. That’s real. That is real and structural. And it should not be dependent on the personnel of the court.

Last week was a startling and arresting moment for me in terms of the Trump v. Slaughter arguments about Humphrey’s Executor. Put aside originalism, that’s gone, there’s not even a pretense of text and history. But the idea that, “Well, you know, since agencies don’t look like they did 100 years ago, I guess we don’t have to think about them the same way.” It is so strange to see serious people pretending to be doing serious work in this serious place, when all pretense of intellectual seriousness has fallen away. Instead you have feelingsball and “How does executive power make me feel today?” There is no commitment to the principles that were laid out and in which people like you and I as institutionalists took a lot of solace. Part of what is so challenging about this moment is that by the time most Americans get around to the point that they can say the sentence “Amy Coney Barrett’s not going to save us,” or “Brett Kavanaugh is not going to save us,” it’s all going to be too late. It seems we are so committed to the principle that they are originalists, that they are textualists, that they care about a precedent, and so committed to the proposition that the U.S. Supreme Court is going to save us in the end.

The irony of it is that the U.S. Supreme Court got this reputation and the confidence of the American public after Brown. And that’s why, as much as this court is hollowing out Brown, they’ll never overturn it because that is how they became—how they got the reputation, certainly among Black people, for many decades, of being the people who come to your rescue. The shift started to happen with the Burger court in the 1980s.

So many of those who have the greatest platforms are still speaking and behaving in a way that suggests that this is something easily solved, or this is just how it goes, or we can just do this for a couple of years. But if you are watching the videos of people being chased by masked figures who claim to be federal agents, but we don’t know, and who are kidnapping people and throwing them in vans and doing this to American citizens and holding them? The danger is just there. It  is apparent. The more we treat it as though this is just Trumpism, this is Trump 2.0—all the little things that we say to tamp down the alarm are really profoundly problematic.

Many of those who have the greatest microphones frankly don’t know very much about race or racism or the history of it in this country. They want to be experts, so they play to their expertise. These are also the people who have said, “We talk about race too much. We talk about identity too much. We’re scaring people off with that. Everything’s not race.” We’ve made it seem illegitimate to talk about racism. It’s almost like you’re being soft, you’re being anti-intellectual, you’re not doing the rigorous work of politics if you’re talking about race.

In fact, race is threaded through every institutional structure of this country. And we have someone who is exploiting it every day. It’s not that I’m talking about race, it’s that he just stood up the other day and said, We want the Danes, the Swedes, and the Norwegians. We don’t want people from shithole countries. We’re being told that it’s illegitimate to keep talking about race when we’re confronting a tsunami of a movement that uses racism as its stalking horse. It is the lure that brought so many people into this movement. It’s important to help people understand that that’s the bait they’re using. The bait that says, “Yeah, I’m not sure that those people are qualified,” right? Yeah, all of that stuff that just lives in this country, that’s being used as the bait for this smash-and-grab, for this power grab. And I don’t think we’re doing this country any favors by steering people away from that realization.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/github_charge_dev_own_hardware/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">GitHub customers, take notice: Come March, the Microsoft-owned repository host will begin charging for some uses of self-hosted Actions runners.

The change comes in the form of a $0.002 per minute charge for self-hosted runners executing jobs on private GitHub repositories. At the same time, GitHub noted in a Tuesday blog post that it&#39;s lowering the prices of GitHub-hosted runners beginning January 1, under a scheme it calls &quot;simpler pricing and a better experience for GitHub Actions.&quot; Self-hosted runner usage on public repositories will remain free, we note.

Regardless of the public repo distinction, enterprise-scale developers who rely on self-hosted runners were predictably not pleased about the announcement.

&quot;Github have just sent out an email announcing a $0.002/minute fee for self-hosted runners,&quot; Reddit user markmcw posted on the DevOps subreddit. &quot;Just ran the numbers, and for us, that&#39;s close to $3.5k a month extra on our GitHub bill.&quot;

The powers-that-be at GitHub owner Microsoft seem to understand that the change to self-hosted runner billing would piss off a number of customers, as the very first question in the FAQ attached to Tuesday&#39;s blog post is &quot;why am I being charged to use my own hardware?&quot;

To be fair to GitHub, it’s not exactly free for the company to run the GitHub Actions infrastructure and services that self-hosted runners rely on, and that’s the company’s justification for the change.

&quot;Historically, self-hosted runner customers were able to leverage much of GitHub Actions&#39; infrastructure and services at no cost,&quot; the repo host said in its blog FAQ. &quot;This meant that the cost of maintaining and evolving these essential services was largely being subsidized by the prices set for GitHub-hosted runners.&quot;

The move, GitHub said, will align costs more closely with usage. Like many similar changes to pricing models pushed by tech firms, GitHub says &quot;the vast majority of users … will see no price increase.&quot;

GitHub claims that 96 percent of its customers will see no change to their bill, and that 85 percent of the 4 percent affected by the pricing update will actually see their Actions costs decrease. The company says the remaining 15 percent of impacted users will face a median increase of about $13 a month.

For those using self-hosted runners and worried about increased costs, GitHub has updated its pricing calculator to include the cost of self-hosted runners.

As the company noted, it&#39;s also decreasing the costs of many GitHub-hosted runners, and while some will be up to 39 percent less, self-hosted runners can still work out cheaper for teams with their own hardware. The cheapest standard GitHub hosted runners using a 1-core Linux system come in at the same price as $0.002 per minute for a self-hosted runner, and haven&#39;t been adjusted under the new pricing scheme.

Many commenters concerned over the self-hosted runner price change also expressed worry that their runners would eat into free quota minutes associated with their GitHub plan, and that appears to be a valid concern.

&quot;Billable self-hosted runner usage will be able to consume minutes from the free quota associated with your plan,&quot; GitHub said. In other words, the time spent using runners on your own hardware will eat into your free time and further increase your GitHub costs.

&quot;We believe this is a sustainable option that will not deeply impact our lightly- nor heavily-active customers, while still delivering fast, flexible workloads for the best end user experience,&quot; GitHub said. ®

            <h2>NASA tries savin' MAVEN as Mars probe loses contact with Earth</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/nasa_maven_mars_probe_loses_contact/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA is still trying to recontact the MAVEN Mars orbiter after it stopped responding earlier this month, with fragmentary tracking data hinting the craft may be tumbling and off its predicted trajectory.

Earlier this week, the US space agency revealed that the MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) team had managed to recover a fragment of tracking data from December 6 that indicated the spacecraft was &quot;rotating in an unexpected manner&quot; when it emerged from behind Mars. The signal&#39;s frequency also suggested that the orbit&#39;s trajectory might have changed.

In the update, NASA wrote, &quot;The team continues to analyze tracking data to understand the most likely scenarios leading to the loss of signal.

&quot;Efforts to reestablish contact with MAVEN also continue.&quot;

The agency did not confirm whether the spacecraft had entered safe mode, in which an anomalous event causes the probe to shut down all non-essential systems and enter a safe state until communication with controllers can be restored. One space industry insider told The Register that &quot;Safe mode will change the orbit as it involves firing the thrusters,&quot; and went on to explain that on their mission, recovery involves performing a maneuver &quot;to undo the damage that safe mode entry has done to the orbit.&quot;

This is assuming that MAVEN&#39;s orbit has changed. NASA&#39;s language (&quot;may have changed&quot;) is deliberately vague. There is, after all, precious little data for engineers to work with – just a fragment of Doppler data to hint that something is different. Our source noted that the team responsible for tracking the trajectory of their spacecraft typically needed an hour of decent signal, though the MAVEN team&#39;s needs might differ.

Engineers do not have the luxury of time for regaining control of the spacecraft. A solar conjunction (where Mars is obscured from the Earth by the Sun) is due shortly, during which the Deep Space Network (DSN) will be unable to communicate with spacecraft on or around Mars.

That mysterious trajectory change further complicates things. If the trajectory has changed, then engineers will have difficulty pinpointing where the spacecraft should be at any given time, hampering recovery efforts.

Having launched in 2013, MAVEN is a relative spring chicken when it comes to NASA&#39;s Mars fleet. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) arrived in 2006, and the Mars Odyssey entered orbit in 2001. The latter, however, is running on fumes at the moment, having outlived its original mission by decades.

Other Mars orbiters include the European Space Agency&#39;s Mars Express, which was launched in 2003, and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter.

Should MAVEN be lost, there is a chance that NASA might find itself down to two operational but aging spacecraft orbiting the red planet sooner rather than later. ®

            <h2>Blockchain company Nomad to repay users under FTC deal after $186M cyberattack</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/nomad_ftc_settlement/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In proposing a settlement agreement, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says that Illusory Systems must repay users funds lost in a 2022 cyberattack.

Illusory Systems, which trades as Nomad, allegedly misled users about the security of its cryptocurrency bridge, which was compromised in 2022 in an attack that led to $186 million worth of funds being stolen.

The FTC alleged that Nomad pushed an update in June 2022 containing &quot;inadequately tested code&quot; that, in turn, introduced a &quot;significant vulnerability&quot; that was exploited around a month later.

The FTC acknowledged that some of these funds were recovered, but Nomad&#39;s customers ultimately lost out on approximately $100 million.

Soon after the breach, Nomad established a &quot;white hat&quot; bounty program open to anyone who stole funds during the attack.

It said those who return at least 90 percent of what they stole will be considered a &quot;white hat,&quot; and in return, it would not pursue legal action against them. Those who complied would also receive 10 percent of whatever sum they returned as a gesture of goodwill.

The FTC&#39;s proposed settlement agreement, published this week, would require Nomad to repay around $37.5 million to users who remain out of pocket within a year of the agreement being signed, or 30 days after the end of any litigation related to the breach, whichever comes later.

Nomad would also be required to implement a comprehensive security program, assign an employee to maintain that program, and agree to regular, third-party assessments.

The company would also be barred from making any further misrepresentations about the security of its products.

The complaint against Nomad alleges that, despite pitching its blockchain bridge as a &quot;security-first&quot; product at the time, the organization behind it fell short in various aspects of cybersecurity.

The FTC alleges that it failed to adopt secure coding practices, implement a vulnerability management program, and deploy technologies that would have limited the impact of a breach on its users.

It went on to claim that these failures and lack of incident response capabilities contributed to the total loss of funds.

Nomad has agreed to the terms of the proposed settlement, which will be finalized following a public comment period and a second, final FTC vote.

&quot;The FTC Act requires companies to take reasonable security measures,&quot; said Christopher Mufarrige, director at the FTC&#39;s Bureau of Consumer Protection. &quot;It&#39;s important that companies live up to their security promises to consumers.&quot;

The company has a highly limited digital presence at present. Public communications have been nonexistent since 2023, and its website displays no information about how to contact it.

The Register reached out to Nomad&#39;s lawyer for more information, but did not hear back by publication time. ®

Aaron Moten explains how his character fits into Amazon’s take on the wasteland.

As we tuck into Fallout season 2, eager to see Amazon bring New Vegas to life, there’s one person who stands out — and not just because of his power armor. Knight Maximus of the Brotherhood of Steel is the most important of Fallout’s three main characters, and I’m glad the new season is finally getting into why.

Each member of the cast represents one of the factions warring over control of the Mojave Desert. The vault dwellers have the doggedly optimistic Lucy (Ella Purnell), the wretches of the wasteland get the Ghoul (Walton Goggins), and the “order at any cost” Brotherhood has Maximus (Aaron Moten). But more than either Lucy or the Ghoul, it’s Maximus’ character across both seasons that best represents the heart of all Fallout storytelling: when society has broken down, do you choose evil or good?

Lucy and the Ghoul pretty clearly declare their own sides early in the show. Lucy is determined, no matter the extensive grief it brings her, to be a good, helpful person in the wasteland. On the other hand, the Ghoul is a selfish “the ends justify the means” kinda guy where the “means” is often “kill whatever’s in the way.” Throughout the first season and into the second, both characters are firmly set in their respective outlooks. But what makes Maximus interesting in this context is that he hasn’t figured his perspective out yet. He struggles with the choice Lucy and the Ghoul have already made.

“I would put him right in the middle of the two of them,” said Aaron Moten in an interview with The Verge. Speaking on where he falls in personality between Lucy and the Ghoul, Moten says Maximus has the best and worst of both worlds. “[Maximus] can share in [Lucy’s] naivete, but [he] also has lived a life above ground in the wasteland,” he said.

In inhabiting the middle, Maximus bounces between both ends of the good versus evil spectrum. In the first season, Maximus lets Titus, the knight he’s assigned to, die of his wounds before taking his power armor and identity. When Maximus gets his own squire, Maximus bullies him, perpetuating the bullying he experienced as a Brotherhood initiate. Thanks to some helpful flashback storytelling in season 2, we know Maximus was taught by his family to be better than that. So maybe, when Maximus saves Lucy for the first time, or when he steps in to resolve a dispute between two wastelanders, we’re seeing those teachings finally kick in.

When we catch up with Maximus at the start of season 2 though, it seems he’s back flirting with the Ghoul’s end of the continuum. He’s a fully fledged Brotherhood knight with the admiration of his peers. He also has authority over them that he has no reservations about flexing. But even when Maximus has reached his pinnacle of achievement, he knows he’s not living up to the ideals his family instilled in him, and it creates an inner tension unique to Maximus. Lucy is looking for her dad; the Ghoul is looking for his family. Their tensions are external and, now that they’re back on the road again together, often aimed at each other.

But Maximus achieved his goals at the end of season 1 — he got to be a knight. He’s the show’s most conflicted character and it makes him the one most like the prototypical Fallout game protagonist, even if he’s overshadowed by his more charismatic colleagues. On paper, Maximus has nowhere else to go, so his war turns inward. And you know what Fallout likes to say about war.

            <h2>Tesla would have to rein in FSD under new Democratic bill</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/846387/level-2-operational-design-domain-markey-bill">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Automakers would be required to restrict their Level 2 driving system to safe road environments. That could seriously hamper Tesla’s Full Self-Driving rollout.

Automakers would be required to restrict their Level 2 driving system to safe road environments. That could seriously hamper Tesla’s Full Self-Driving rollout.

Tesla and other automakers working on Level 2 and higher driving systems would be required to restrict their vehicles to specific road types or clearly defined operational domains under a new bill introduced today by Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey (D).

Operational design domains, or ODDs, are a set of conditions, either geographic or weather-related, in which an autonomous or partially autonomous vehicle can operate. Examples include the city maps in which Waymo’s Level 4 autonomous robotaxis operate, or the highways where GM’s hands-free Super Cruise can be used.

But the bill, called the Stay in Your Lane Act, appears to be mostly aimed at Tesla, which has enabled its customers to use its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system on any road, including in cities and low-speed residential neighborhoods, generally without restrictions. Under the bill, Tesla would be required to dial back FSD’s operational domain to a “safer” road environment defined by the company.

“Self-driving cars aren’t a danger of the distant future—they are a pressing safety threat today,” Markey said in a statement to The Verge. “Too often, certain car companies are rolling out autonomous driving features without responsible limitations on when and where they can be used, leading to avoidable injuries and deaths. My Stay in Your Lane Act would help keep the public safe by ensuring self-driving cars only operate in the road conditions that the system is smart enough to handle.”

Markey’s office notes in a one-pager on the bill that most Level 2 systems, like GM’s Super Cruise or Ford’s BlueCruise, are restricted to “pre- mapped roads where the engineers have designed the technology to safely operate.” The bill would make that voluntary design decision a requirement of automakers working on this technology.

The legislation doesn’t require the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to go through a lengthy rulemaking process. Instead, it creates “a brightline statutory requirement for manufacturers to define a safe operational design domain for their driving system, and to restrict the driving systems to that domain,” the one-pager explains. Under this authority, NHTSA can investigate or fine companies that breach their operational design domains, or define their domains “too broadly” where the system can no longer safely operate.

As a Democratic sponsored bill in a Republican controlled Congress, Markey’s legislation likely faces an uphill battle. That said, if Democrats reclaim the majority after the midterm elections, its likely that the bill could face a smoother path to adoption.

            <div id="article-text">Astronomers and environmental scientists are skeptical.

Astronomers and environmental scientists are skeptical.

Tech billionaires have been obsessed with space for a long time. Now, as the largest AI companies race to build more data centers in a frenzied pursuit of profitability, space is looking less like a pet project and more like a commercial opportunity. In 2025 alone, six proposals for giant AI data centers needing multiple gigawatts of power — a capacity only rumored of in 2024 — have been announced. Earthlings are catching on to the fact that power-hungry data centers take up land and water, while providing few jobs, too much pollution, and rising electricity costs.

Hence the idea to put the data centers in orbit around the Earth, not on the Earth. Space-based data centers — in the form of satellites with solar panels — are Big Tech’s latest fad and Silicon Valley’s newest investable venture. In space, they theorize, the sun’s unlimited rays could provide endless amounts of energy to power your latest AI-generated Sora video. But it’s not likely to be that easy.

Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, and Eric Schmidt ​​(former Google CEO and current CEO of startup Relativity Space), have all recently expanded the focus of their rocket companies to include space data centers. Startups exclusively focused on this idea, like the US-based Aetherflux, have laid out deployment plans. Others have snagged partnerships with big names, like Planet’s partnership with Google and Nvidia’s backing of Starcloud, which launched a satellite containing H100 GPUs in November as part of the latest SpaceX mission. Earlier this year, China launched a dozen supercomputer satellites that can process data in space. Europe wants in on the action too — one European think tank called space data centers the next “rapidly emerging opportunity.”

Yet, scientists who study space remain skeptical of the idea. Astronomer Jonathan McDowell has been tracking every object launched into space since the late 1980s. He told The Verge that, unsurprisingly, it is very expensive to launch something into space. Many business ventures, he said, start from the idea that “‘space is cool, let’s do something in space,’ rather than, ‘we really need to be in space to do this.’”

“As the number of spacecraft increases, you have to dodge more often, so you have to use more fuel.”

The main perk of orbital data centers is access to free, limitless solar power when traveling around the Earth from pole to pole in the sun-synchronous orbit. (Musk’s Starlink satellites, in contrast, avoid the poles and stick close to paying customers around the planet’s populated middle.) The centers would have to remain in low Earth orbit around 600 to 1,000 miles up from the ground in order to communicate without very large antennas.

In November, Google laid out plans for a sun-synchronous low Earth orbital data center called Project Suncatcher, which is slated to kick off in early 2027 with a launch of two prototype satellites. Ultimately, Google says there could be 81 satellites, each carrying TPU chips, traveling together in an arranged cluster one kilometer-square in size. Only 100 to 200 meters would separate each satellite. (For context, typical GPS and Starlink satellites move around individually, not in 81-unit fleets.) Whereas wires connect GPUs together on Earth, Google plans to connect the TPU chips with inter-satellite lasers.

Some experts say it would not be smooth sailing, however. The group of satellites would need to travel through millions of pieces of space debris, or “a minefield of random objects, each moving at 17,000 miles an hour,” Mojtaba Akhavan-Tafti, associate research scientist of space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan, explained to The Verge. This space debris is especially concentrated in popular orbits like the Sun-synchronous orbit. This is why Google’s plan is looking, well, “a little iffy,” he said. Dodging each object requires a tiny propulsion to move out of the way. For context, Akhavan-Tafti wrote in a recent Fortune article that the approximately 8,300 Starlink satellites made over 140,000 such maneuvers in just the first half of 2025. Given the close proximity of each satellite in Google’s plan, Akhavan-Tafti thinks that the entire constellation, rather than each individual satellite, would need to move out of the way of any incoming debris. “That’s really the big challenge,” he said.

Similarly, McDowell says that a group of 81 satellites traveling together just 100 to 200 meters apart would be “unprecedented” — typically only two or three, maybe four, spacecraft would travel that close together. The size and closeness present “concerning failure modes.” “If a thruster gets stuck, stuck on, or fails, and now you’ve got a rogue one in among all the others in this cluster of 81,” he explains.

However, Jessica Bloom, an astrophysicist on Google’s Project Suncatcher, told The Verge that the group of 81 satellites is “illustrative,” for now, because the final number will depend on money and results from preliminary tests scheduled for 2027. Regardless, satellites can move individually or as a group to avoid debris, Bloom said, and the closeness of the traveling satellites is the most novel part of Google’s plan.

Bloom explained that the satellites will orbit at the same speed relative to each other, and “relative velocity, rather than proximity, is the key risk factor for damage from impact between objects,” she said. “We take our responsibility to the space environment extremely seriously; our approach prioritizes space sustainability and compliance with both current and emerging rules to minimize risk from debris in orbit,” Bloom said.

In addition to the bones of old satellites, the number of new spacecraft in orbit has dramatically increased over the last few years. There are now more than 14,000 active satellites, roughly two-thirds of which are Starlink, as tracked by McDowell. “As the number of spacecraft increases, you have to dodge more often, so you have to use more fuel,” he said. This presents a circular problem: More fuel means a bigger spacecraft, which is a bigger object for other spacecraft to dodge, which means it’s more likely to contribute to space debris.

Space data centers also have to contend with the uniquely extraterrestrial problem of getting rid of heat in a vacuum. Philip Johnston, CEO of Nvidia-backed startup Starcloud, told The Verge that his company dissipates heat from large infrared panels. In order to keep the electronics safe from radiation, Johnston said they stripped the Nvidia H100 GPU “down to the basics” and shielded the electronics with tungsten, lead, and aluminium, among other materials that are dense and lightweight.

But infrared radiation also has the potential to interfere with telescopes, according to John Barentine of the advocacy group the Center for Space Environmentalism. The group has not come out for or against space data centers, Barentine said, but they are concerned about the impact of potential light pollution from reflective surfaces on the spacecraft on astronomy research. Space companies often classify those spacecraft details as “trade secrets,” leading to a “chicken-and-egg situation right now,” Barentine said. “We can’t really say with a lot of certainty what the impacts will be because we don’t know the details because the companies haven’t or won’t disclose them.”

Starcloud’s Johnston said their satellites will never be visible in the night sky, only when the Sun is just about to appear or just after it’s set. “You can’t really do astronomy at dawn or dusk, anyway,” Johnston said.

“That is not entirely true,” McDowell, who has worked for 37 years as an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told The Verge. “There are things that we do need to observe at dawn and dusk, particularly things near the sun, like asteroids that might be coming close to the Earth — which we really don’t want to miss,” he said.

“How do we keep low Earth orbit open for business for generations to come?”

Practically, data centers on Earth require regular maintenance to keep the racks of chips humming along, and trained human operators are already in short supply. Repairs of satellites in space, meanwhile, don’t happen. Astronauts fix telescopes and equipment attached to the International Space Station or NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. The prospect of robots reorienting or refueling satellites in orbit is theoretically possible but rare.

Despite earthly wariness from astronomers outside Big Tech, the popularity of space data centers is likely to continue for years and even decades. Both Google and startup Aetherflux plan to launch satellites in early 2027. Starcloud plans to launch its second satellite in October 2026 and then “ramp up production in 2027, 2028,” Johnston said. He views SpaceX as Starcloud’s main competitor, despite no official mention from Musk’s company on when a space data center might be launched, only a post on X from Musk about SpaceX “simply scaling up Starlink V3 satellites” to achieve this. Blue Origin has reportedly been working on space data centers for over a year but has also not publicly commented on any plans.

Constellations close to Earth present good opportunities for “trying to make life better here back on Earth,” space scientist Akhavan-Tafti said. But it needs to be done in a sustainable way: “How do we keep low Earth orbit open for business for generations to come?”

One option? Avoid launching more stuff into orbit, according to Seth Gladstone of Food & Water Watch, the environmental group leading a petition to halt data center construction. “Why is it that Big Tech always seems to think a solution to its many Earth-bound problems is to blast more stuff into space?”

            <h2>This Nobel Prize–winning chemist dreams of making water from thin air</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-17</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/17/1129259/omar-yaghi-chemist-nobel-prize-crystals-water-air/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Omar Yaghi was a quiet child, diligent, unlikely to roughhouse with his nine siblings. So when he was old enough, his parents tasked him with one of the family’s most vital chores: fetching water. Like most homes in his Palestinian neighborhood in Amman, Jordan, the Yaghis’ had no electricity or running water. At least once every two weeks, the city switched on local taps for a few hours so residents could fill their tanks. Young Omar helped top up the family supply. Decades later, he says he can’t remember once showing up late. The fear of leaving his parents, seven brothers, and two sisters parched kept him punctual.

Yaghi proved so dependable that his father put him in charge of monitoring how much the cattle destined for the family butcher shop ate and drank. The best-­quality cuts came from well-fed, hydrated animals—a challenge given that they were raised in arid desert.

Specially designed materials called metal-organic frameworks can pull water from the air like a sponge—and then give it back.

But at 10 years old, Yaghi learned of a different occupation. Hoping to avoid a rambunctious crowd at recess, he found the library doors in his school unbolted and sneaked in. Thumbing through a chemistry textbook, he saw an image he didn’t understand: little balls connected by sticks in fascinating shapes. Molecules. The building blocks of everything.

“I didn’t know what they were, but it captivated my attention,” Yaghi says. “I kept trying to figure out what they might be.”

That’s how he discovered chemistry—or maybe how chemistry discovered him. After coming to the United States and, eventually, a postdoctoral program at Harvard University, Yaghi devoted his career to finding ways to make entirely new and fascinating shapes for those little sticks and balls. In October 2025, he was one of three scientists who won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for identifying metal-­organic frameworks, or MOFs—metal ions tethered to organic molecules that form repeating structural landscapes. Today that work is the basis for a new project that sounds like science fiction, or a miracle: conjuring water out of thin air.

When he first started working with MOFs, Yaghi thought they might be able to absorb climate-damaging carbon dioxide—or maybe hold hydrogen molecules, solving the thorny problem of storing that climate-friendly but hard-to-contain fuel. But then, in 2014, Yaghi’s team of researchers at UC Berkeley had an epiphany. The tiny pores in MOFs could be designed so the material would pull water molecules from the air around them, like a sponge—and then, with just a little heat, give back that water as if squeezed dry. Just one gram of a water-absorbing MOF has an internal surface area of roughly 7,000 square meters.

Yaghi wasn’t the first to try to pull potable water from the atmosphere. But his method could do it at lower levels of humidity than rivals—potentially shaking up a tiny, nascent industry that could be critical to humanity in the thirsty decades to come. Now the company he founded, called Atoco, is racing to demonstrate a pair of machines that Yaghi believes could produce clean, fresh, drinkable water virtually anywhere on Earth, without even hooking up to an energy supply.

That’s the goal Yaghi has been working toward for more than a decade now, with the rigid determination that he learned while doing chores in his father’s butcher shop.

“It was in that shop where I learned how to perfect things, how to have a work ethic,” he says. “I learned that a job is not done until it is well done. Don’t start a job unless you can finish it.”

Most of Earth is covered in water, but just 3% of it is fresh, with no salt—the kind of water all terrestrial living things need. Today, desalination plants that take the salt out of seawater provide the bulk of potable water in technologically advanced desert nations like Israel and the United Arab Emirates, but at a high cost. Desalination facilities either heat water to distill out the drinkable stuff or filter it with membranes the salt doesn’t pass through; both methods require a lot of energy and leave behind concentrated brine. Typically desal pumps send that brine back into the ocean, with devastating ecological effects.

I was talking to Atoco executives about carbon dioxide capture earlier this year when they mentioned the possibility of harvesting water from the atmosphere. Of course my mind immediately jumped to Star Wars, and Luke Skywalker working on his family’s moisture farm, using “vaporators” to pull water from the atmosphere of the arid planet Tatooine. (Other sci-fi fans’ minds might go to Dune, and the water-gathering technology of the Fremen.) Could this possibly be real?

It turns out people have been doing it for millennia. Archaeological evidence of water harvesting from fog dates back as far as 5000 BCE. The ancient Greeks harvested dew, and 500 years ago so did the Inca, using mesh nets and buckets under trees.

Today, harvesting water from the air is a business already worth billions of dollars, say industry analysts—and it’s on track to be worth billions more in the next five years. In part that’s because typical sources of fresh water are in crisis. Less snowfall in mountains during hotter winters means less meltwater in the spring, which means less water downstream. Droughts regularly break records. Rising seas seep into underground aquifers, already drained by farming and sprawling cities. Aging septic tanks leach bacteria into water, and cancer-causing “forever chemicals” are creating what the US Government Accountability Office last year said “may be the biggest water problem since lead.” That doesn’t even get to the emerging catastrophe from microplastics.

So lots of places are turning to atmospheric water harvesting. Watergen, an Israel-based company working on the tech, initially planned on deploying in the arid, poorer parts of the world. Instead, buyers in Europe and the United States have approached the company as a way to ensure a clean supply of water. And one of Watergen’s biggest markets is the wealthy United Arab Emirates. “When you say ‘water crisis,’ it’s not just the lack of water—it’s access to good-quality water,” says Anna Chernyavsky, Watergen’s vice president of marketing.

In other words, the technology “has evolved from lab prototypes to robust, field-deployable systems,” says Guihua Yu, a mechanical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin. “There is still room to improve productivity and energy efficiency in the whole-system level, but so much progress has been steady and encouraging.”

MOFs are just the latest approach to the idea. The first generation of commercial tech depended on compressors and refrigerant chemicals—large-scale versions of the machine that keeps food cold and fresh in your kitchen. Both use electricity and a clot of pipes and exchangers to make cold by phase-shifting a chemical from gas to liquid and back; refrigerators try to limit condensation, and water generators basically try to enhance it.

That’s how Watergen’s tech works: using a compressor and a heat exchanger to wring water from air at humidity levels as low as 20%—Death Valley in the spring. “We’re talking about deserts,” Chernyavsky says. “Below 20%, you get nosebleeds.”

That still might not be good enough. “Refrigeration works pretty well when you are above a certain relative humidity,” says Sameer Rao, a mechanical engineer at the University of Utah who researches atmospheric water harvesting. “As the environment dries out, you go to lower relative humidities, and it becomes harder and harder. In some cases, it’s impossible for refrigeration-based systems to really work.”

So a second wave of technology has found a market. Companies like Source Global use desiccants—substances that absorb moisture from the air, like the silica packets found in vitamin bottles—to pull in moisture and then release it when heated. In theory, the benefit of desiccant-­based tech is that it could absorb water at lower humidity levels, and it uses less energy on the front end since it isn’t running a condenser system. Source Global claims its off-grid, solar-powered system is deployed in dozens of countries.

But both technologies still require a lot of energy, either to run the heat exchangers or to generate sufficient heat to release water from the desiccants. MOFs, Yaghi hopes, do not. Now Atoco is trying to prove it. Instead of using heat exchangers to bring the air temperature to dew point or desiccants to attract water from the atmosphere, a system can rely on specially designed MOFs to attract water molecules. Atoco’s prototype version uses an MOF that looks like baby powder, stuck to a surface like glass. The pores in the MOF naturally draw in water molecules but remain open, making it theoretically easy to discharge the water with no more heat than what comes from direct sunlight. Atoco’s industrial-scale design uses electricity to speed up the process, but the company is working on a second design that can operate completely off grid, without any energy input.

Yaghi’s Atoco isn’t the only contender seeking to use MOFs for water harvesting. A competitor, AirJoule, has introduced MOF-based atmospheric water generators in Texas and the UAE and is working with researchers at Arizona State University, planning to deploy more units in the coming months. The company started out trying to build more efficient air-­conditioning for electric buses operating on hot, humid city streets. But then founder Matt Jore heard about US government efforts to harvest water from air—and pivoted. The startup’s stock price has been a bit of a roller-­coaster, but Jore says the sheer size of the market should keep him in business. Take Maricopa County, encompassing Phoenix and its environs—it uses 1.2 billion gallons of water from its shrinking aquifer every day, and another 874 million gallons from surface sources like rivers.

“So, a couple of billion gallons a day, right?” Jore tells me. “You know how much influx is in the atmosphere every day? Twenty-five billion gallons.”

“Just the greater Phoenix area gets influx of about 25 billion gallons of water in the air,” he says. “If you can tap into it, that’s your source. And it’s not going away. It’s all around the world. We view the atmosphere as the world’s free pipeline.”

Besides AirJoule’s head start on Atoco, the companies also differ on where they get their MOFs. AirJoule’s system relies on an off-the-shelf version the company buys from the chemical giant BASF; Atoco aims to use Yaghi’s skill with designing the novel material to create bespoke MOFs for different applications and locations.

“Given the fact that we have the inventor of the whole class of materials, and we leverage the stuff that comes out of his lab at Berkeley—everything else equal, we have a good starting point to engineer maybe the best materials in the world,” says Magnus Bach, Atoco’s VP of business development.

Yaghi envisions a two-pronged product line. Industrial-scale water generators that run on electricity would be capable of producing thousands of liters per day on one end, while units that run on passive systems could operate in remote locations without power, just harnessing energy from the sun and ambient temperatures. In theory, these units could someday replace desalination and even entire municipal water supplies. The next round of field tests is scheduled for early 2026, in the Mojave Desert—one of the hottest, driest places on Earth.

“That’s my dream,” Yaghi says. “To give people water independence, so they’re not reliant on another party for their lives.”

Both Yaghi and Watergen’s Chernyavsky say they’re looking at more decentralized versions that could operate outside municipal utility systems. Home appliances, similar to rooftop solar panels and batteries, could allow households to generate their own water off grid.

That could be tricky, though, without economies of scale to bring down prices. “You have to produce, you have to cool, you have to filter—all in one place,” Chernyavsky says. “So to make it small is very, very challenging.”

Difficult as that may be, Yaghi’s childhood gave him a particular appreciation for the freedom to go off grid, to liberate the basic necessity of water from the whims of systems that dictate when and how people can access it.

“That’s really my dream,” he says. “To give people independence, water independence, so that they’re not reliant on another party for their livelihood or lives.”

Toward the end of one of our conversations, I asked Yaghi what he would tell the younger version of himself if he could. “Jordan is one of the worst countries in terms of the impact of water stress,” he said. “I would say, ‘Continue to be diligent and observant. It doesn’t really matter what you’re pursuing, as long as you’re passionate.’”

I pressed him for something more specific: “What do you think he’d say when you described this technology to him?”

Yaghi smiled: “I think young Omar would think you’re putting him on, that this is all fictitious and you’re trying to take something from him.” This reality, in other words, would be beyond young Omar’s wildest dreams.

            <h2>Creating psychological safety in the AI era</h2>
            <p><strong>MIT Technology Review | 2025-12-16</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Rolling out enterprise-grade AI means climbing two steep cliffs at once. First, understanding and implementing the tech itself. And second, creating the cultural conditions where employees can maximize its value. While the technical hurdles are signiﬁcant, the human element can be even more consequential; fear and ambiguity can stall momentum of even the most promising initiatives.

Psychological safety—feeling free to express opinions and take calculated risks without worrying about career repercussions1—is essential for successful AI adoption. In psychologically safe workspaces, employees are empowered to challenge assumptions and raise concerns about new tools without fear of reprisal. This is nothing short of a necessity when introducing a nascent and profoundly powerful technology that still lacks established best practices.

“Psychological safety is mandatory in this new era of AI,” says Rafee Tarafdar, executive vice president and chief technology officer at Infosys. “The tech itself is evolving so fast—companies have to experiment, and some things will fail. There needs to be a safety net.”

To gauge how psychological safety influences success with enterprise-level AI, MIT Technology Review Insights conducted a survey of 500 business leaders. The ﬁndings reveal high self-reported levels of psychological safety, but also suggest that fear still has a foothold. Anecdotally, industry experts highlight a reason for the disconnect between rhetoric and reality: while organizations may promote a safe to experiment message publicly, deeper cultural undercurrents can counteract that intent.

Building psychological safety requires a coordinated, systems-level approach, and human resources (HR) alone cannot deliver such transformation. Instead, enterprises must deeply embed psychological safety into their collaboration processes.

This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review. It was not written by MIT Technology Review’s editorial staff. It was researched, designed, and written by human writers, editors, analysts, and illustrators. This includes the writing of surveys and collection of data for surveys. AI tools that may have been used were limited to secondary production processes that passed thorough human review.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you’ll see it’s a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won&#39;t compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

            <div id="article-text">This is today&#39;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#39;s going on in the world of technology.

Some disillusionment was inevitable. When OpenAI released a free web app called ChatGPT in late 2022, it changed the course of an entire industry—and several world economies. Millions of people started talking to their computers, and their computers started talking back. We were enchanted, and we expected more.Well, 2025 has been a year of reckoning. For a start, the heads of the top AI companies made promises they couldn’t keep. At the same time, updates to the core technology are no longer the step changes they once were.To be clear, the last few years have been filled with genuine “Wow” moments. But this remarkable technology is only a few years old, and in many ways it is still experimental. Its successes come with big caveats. Read the full story to learn more about why we may need to readjust our expectations.

This story is part of our new Hype Correction package, a collection of stories designed to help you reset your expectations about what AI makes possible—and what it doesn’t. Check out the rest of the package here, and you can read more about why it’s time to reset our expectations for AI in the latest edition of the Algorithm, our weekly AI newsletter.

Quantum navigation could solve the military’s GPS jamming problem

Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, thousands of flights have been affected by a far-reaching Russian campaign of using radio transmissions that jammed its GPS system.The growing inconvenience to air traffic and risk of a real disaster have highlighted the vulnerability of GPS and focused attention on more secure ways for planes to navigate the gauntlet of jamming and spoofing, the term for tricking a GPS receiver into thinking it’s somewhere else.One approach that’s emerging from labs is quantum navigation: exploiting the quantum nature of light and atoms to build ultra-sensitive sensors that can allow vehicles to navigate independently, without depending on satellites.

            <div id="article-text">Not long ago, like many of you, I read what I feared might be The Next Web’s final article. In late September, TNW’s co-founder announced that the tech conference and news site would be winding down, no more events, no new stories. It felt like the end of an era; the news hit hard.

Yet, just a few weeks ago, a twist arrived: the tech platform Tekpon acquired 100% of TNW’s media and events brand from the Financial Times, ensuring that this nearly two-decade legacy will continue to thrive.

While, myself, trying to read people’s opinions on this topic, I read this comment in one article, from one former TNW editor-in-chief that said: “The Next Web shaped my career, my life… it’s very sad to see it die”.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

I asked myself: Why do we always assume that just because one chapter ends, the whole story is over? Yes, taking over TNW is a heavy inheritance, especially with all eyes on us and expectations sky-high.

And I’ll admit, doubts crept in: Am I too small for this? Could someone more experienced do it better? Probably. But here I am, stepping up regardless. Because this isn’t just another blog or brand; TNW is a living ecosystem, a vital community. Its story deserves to continue, and I’m determined to help write the next chapter.

I also know some of you might be wondering: Who is she? What does she know? How many articles has she written? What recommends her?

Before reading all sorts of titles and, let me briefly introduce myself.

I’ve been writing since high school, with thousands of articles under my belt; covering everything from culture, art, and hip hop to design, politics, history, and food. I landed my first content writer job at 18, and alongside writing I pursued another passion: becoming a chef.

(Fun fact: I even made it to the semifinals of MasterChef, a journey that taught me about creativity under pressure and staying cool when the heat is on.)

Now, I channel my storytelling skills into helping businesses better understand technology and use it to their advantage. I help companies tell their stories, the real ones, finding meaning and flow in every word.

Over the years, I’ve specialized in blending creative storytelling with the technical precision of a chef’s knife. (My colleagues at Tekpon might say I can be as sharp as that knife – true to my values and quick to cut through the nonsense.) I am also the “No, we have to do it right” person in the team.

I’ve reviewed countless software products, interviewed founders, and explored how digital innovation can be a force for good in society. Or not. In other words, I’ve always cared about the why behind the tech, the real impact on people’s lives, not just the buzz. That perspective will be behind every story we will publish at TNW.

If there’s a place for those who still think stories written by humans matter, tell me where it is. I’m already on my way.

I’m not here to change TNW’s DNA; I’m here to reinforce it with fresh energy and a clear vision for the future.

To the loyal TNW readers, to the startup founders who looked to us for inspiration, to the healthy tech skeptics who counted on us for a reality check, and to our global audience spread across continents: we hear you.

We all know the world of tech news has changed dramatically. Today, everyone has a megaphone, social media overflows with hot takes, and AI algorithms can crank out content in seconds. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by this sea of opinions and auto-generated articles. In such a world, the role of a publication like TNW is more critical than ever: to be a filter, not just another firehose of content.

We will focus on curation and clarity, distilling the noise so you don’t have to.

Here’s the good news: despite the deluge of AI-written text out there, readers are actively looking for authentic, human journalism. Every article we will publish will be created by a human writer who is accountable for the facts and who brings context, analysis, and yes, a bit of personality too.

Our mission isn’t to chase every trending headline algorithmically; it’s to help you understand which innovations actually matter, and why.

If a story is everywhere but lacks substance, we won’t regurgitate it; we’ll analyze it or debunk it. If a breakthrough is genuinely promising, we’ll explain why it’s important and how it impacts real people. Being a thoughtful filter in this age of information overload (and AI-generated noise) isn’t just a catchy slogan for us; it’s a responsibility we embrace.

You’ll also notice something different in our approach: an emphasis on storytelling and the human side of tech. Technology doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s built and used by people with dreams, dilemmas, and diverse backgrounds.

I believe, and I suspect many of you do too, that the best tech journalism zooms out from the gadgets and code to highlight those human stories. Practically speaking, expect to see more features, interviews, and narrative-driven pieces on TNW.

We’ll talk to founders about the messy, human journey of building a startup, not just the press releases or funding announcements. We’ll spotlight the engineers, designers, and thinkers who are trying to solve big problems (or even small ones that make a big difference). We’ll explore tech’s impact on society: the good, the bad, and the complicated.

This won’t be a place for recycled press releases or surface-level takes. It will be a place for conversation and insight.

Importantly, none of this focus on storytelling means we’ll skimp on rigor. Being engaging doesn’t mean sacrificing accuracy or depth. My team will continue to prioritize thorough research and fact-checking, those good old-school journalism values, even as we experiment with new formats and new voices. In short, we won’t publish anything we wouldn’t want to read ourselves.

Today, looking forward means acknowledging that how we cover tech is as important as what we cover. It means committing to journalism that cuts through the clutter, to storytelling that puts people first, and to a vision of tech’s future that is both hopeful and honest. That’s my vision for TNW as I step into this role, and I hope it resonates with you.

Now, I’d like to turn it over to you, our community. This is your TNW as much as it is ours. I invite you to join the conversation. Tell us what you want to see more of (or less of). Hold us accountable,if we ever fall short, let us know. Share your stories and perspectives with us, because they can inspire our coverage.

In the coming weeks, you’ll start to see this vision take shape on the site. You’ll see familiar faces and new voices. You’ll find articles that make you think, others that make you smile, and hopefully quite a few that make you proud to be a TNW reader.

Whether you’re a long-time follower who’s stuck with us through thick and thin, a startup founder looking for insight, a skeptic keeping us honest, or a curious mind tuning in from anywhere in the world – thank you.  We do this for you, and we couldn’t do it without you.

The Next Web is back. We’re here to inform you, inspire you, challenge you, and occasionally even surprise you. I’m honored to have you with us on this journey. Here’s to the road ahead, to storytelling, to journalism (the real kind), and to making sense of the future together.

Thank you for reading, and welcome to TNW’s next chapter. Let’s build it, day by day, story by story, together.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When OpenAI announced its new shopping search capabilities, I took the news with a grain of salt (perhaps the whole shaker).
For the past decade, we have watched the slow evolution of traditional search engines. What began as tools for pure information discovery gradually morphed into ecosystems dominated by SEO-optimized content and sponsored results. My initial fear with ChatGPT’s update was simple: Are we seeing the beginning of a similar shift? Is the purity of the “reasoning engine” being diluted by the necessity of commerce?
After testing the new shopping integration, the results suggest that we are at a pivotal moment in the user experience of Generative AI, one that requires an open discussion about what we actually want these tools to be.

The defining characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to handle nuance. When we interact with ChatGPT, we expect a Socratic dialogue. We expect the AI to ask clarifying questions to narrow down our intent.
To test this, I entered a simple prompt: “I want to buy a vacuum.”
I anticipated a conversation, questions about my home’s square footage, my floor type, or my budget. Instead, the conversational nuance was replaced by a display that felt familiar: a grid of product photos, names, prices, and direct links to retailers.

While efficient, this experience felt like a regression. It mirrored the “keyword search” experience of Web 2.0 rather than the “intent-based” promise of GenAI. It replied to my prompt, but it stripped away the intelligence.

TNW City Coworking space - Where your best work happens

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

Scrolling down, I engaged with the new feature in a call to action: “Research the best vacuums.”
This is where the user experience (UX) friction became most apparent. Rather than synthesizing data or comparing technical specifications in a chat format, the tool presented a polling interface designed to filter results.

The experience is oddly time-sensitive; pause too long to think or drink water, and the screens will skip forward, dumping you back into a list of product cards.
The interface presents products with a binary choice: “More like this” or “Not interested.” It offers brand names and price tags, but virtually no information to help the user actually make a choice.

For a user seeking genuine research, being presented with a list of brands and prices without deep comparative analysis feels like a missed opportunity.
It raises a question: If I wanted to filter products by price and brand, wouldn’t I use a traditional retailer? The value proposition of Gen AI should be synthesis, not just aggregation.

The Tension Between Reasoning and Revenue
This update highlights the inevitable tension facing major AI companies: the balance between user utility and business sustainability.
As OpenAI scales, the pressure to demonstrate revenue models to investors is natural. However, there is a risk in prioritizing transactional features before the core product, reasoning and logic, is fully matured. By introducing a shopping experience that feels closer to a “click-through” engine than a “knowledge” engine, the platform risks blurring its own identity.
Is ChatGPT a research partner that helps me think? Or is it a shopping assistant trying to speed me to checkout?

To be clear, I believe there is a place for shopping within AI. But the execution matters.
A truly Generative AI shopping experience shouldn’t just list products; it should understand the user. It should read between the lines of a prompt to understand that a user asking for a vacuum might actually be solving a problem about pet hair or allergies.

The current iteration feels like a beta test of a business model rather than an evolution of intelligence. As we move forward, the hope is that OpenAI will refine this tool to prioritize the “Chat” over the transaction. We don’t want it to be just another place to see ads. We need a better way to make decisions.
