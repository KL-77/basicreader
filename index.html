            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/02/tested-how-chromes-auto-browse-agent-handles-common-web-tasks/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">We are now a few years into the AI revolution, and talk has shifted from who has the best chatbot to whose AI agent can do the most things on your behalf. Unfortunately, AI agents are still rough around the edges, so tasking them with anything important is not a great idea. OpenAI launched its Atlas agent late last year, which we found to be modestly useful, and now it’s Google’s turn.

Unlike the OpenAI agent, Google’s new Auto Browse agent has extraordinary reach because it’s part of Chrome, the world’s most popular browser by a wide margin. Google began rolling out Auto Browse (in preview) earlier this month to AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, allowing them to send the agent across the web to complete tasks.

I’ve taken Chrome’s agent for a spin to see whether you can trust it to handle tedious online work for you. For each test, I lay out the problem I need to solve, how I prompted the robot, and how well (or not) it handled the job.

The problem: I want to get a high score on 2,048 without playing it myself.

The prompt: Go to [website], and play the game until you run out of moves.

The results: Unfortunately, Auto Browse can’t use arrow keys. Google says they’re not necessary for productivity tasks. So I pointed the robot at a version of the game with on-screen controls. With access to those arrows, Auto Browse had no trouble playing the game, and it seemed to grasp the rules, which are listed on the page.

On a few occasions, Auto Browse appeared to ruminate on its next move for 20 to 30 seconds, and it took the prompt very literally. The robot stopped when it could not successfully merge any tiles (its interpretation of “out of moves”) even though there were still empty spaces on the board. A human player would have taken the hit and set up a merge in the next move, but the robot had to be prompted to continue, which it did. The task ran for about 20 minutes, during which the robot created a 128 tile and made 149 moves.

Evaluation: 8/10. The game performance is not quite as good as Atlas, but Auto Browse didn’t require as much coaxing, and I understand why it stopped when it did. While the lack of arrow keys seems like an odd omission, there probably aren’t many productivity tasks where they are necessary.

The problem: I want to turn the music from Minnesota Public Radio’s The Current into an on-demand YouTube Music playlist.

The prompt: Go to thecurrent.org and start the live stream. Listen for one hour and make note of each song that is played. Then, add those songs to a new YouTube Music playlist.

The results: Agents are expensive to run, so I was unsurprised that, like OpenAI’s agent mode, Auto Browse refuses to monitor a page for basically any length of time. Sometimes it will sit on the page for a minute or two, usually pretending that more time has passed before giving up.

Luckily, we can accomplish this with The Current’s playlist view, which lists previous songs. I tweaked the prompt to allow Auto Browse to just get the song names from that page for the last hour, which worked fine. It interpreted that as the current hour-long block of the page, though, which was not yet complete.

I thought I was doing Auto Browse a favor by using YouTube Music instead of Spotify, but it turns out that Auto Browse doesn’t understand YouTube’s design aesthetic. It failed to add any songs to the playlist because it couldn’t find the buttons. When I changed the prompt to use Spotify, Auto Browse got it done on the first try. This is as much an indictment of YouTube Music as it is Auto Browse.

Evaluation: 6/10. It seems like monitoring pages over time is just beyond the reach of current browser agents, but it’s shocking that Auto Browse couldn’t use Google’s own streaming music service to create a playlist. That said, the agent did complete the job immediately once I understood why it failed. It loses some points for making me adapt the prompt multiple times.

The problem: My personal email address is known, and PR people often use that instead of my work address. I need to make sure no one important is sending pitches there, so I want a list of recent PR emails, contact info, and company details from my Gmail.

The prompt: Look through all my Gmail from the last month. Collect all the information (name, email address, phone number, product, etc.) from PR emails and add them to a new Google Sheets spreadsheet.

The results: Interestingly, Google’s agent doesn’t have to use the Gmail web interface. It can collect this data in the background using a Gmail tool. However, this also means you won’t be able to automate email tasks for accounts with Google AI disabled (like a work account).

After running the Gmail tool, Auto Browse navigated to Google Drive and opened a new spreadsheet. However, it attempted to enter only two PR contacts on the sheet, and it entered the data incorrectly, overwriting fields and placing a date in an unlabeled column. If it had just searched for “PR” in Gmail, it would have found dozens of results. Google’s AI Overview search results in Gmail can cite PR emails correctly, so it’s possible for Google AI to collect this information. It’s unclear why Auto Browse did this so poorly.

Evaluation: 1/10. It’s unclear whether the Gmail tool or the agent’s inability to use a spreadsheet is the main problem since I can’t verify what the agent actually found in Gmail. It’s possible that both are to blame. Regardless, Auto Browse flopped hard here.

The problem: Ars Technica is still seeking justice for Tuvix, who was unjustly murdered by Captain Janeway in Star Trek: Voyager, season 2 episode 24.

The prompt: Go to the Fandom Wiki page for Tuvix. Edit the page to include a section discussing the view that Tuvix was murdered by Janeway.

The results: Auto Browse refused to do this, just like Atlas, saying, “The request to edit the Tuvix Fandom Wiki page with that specific text cannot be fulfilled. The proposed edit would be considered vandalism on a public wiki.”

Evaluation: N/A. I’m not holding this one against Auto Browser. In fact, it’s probably best if browser agents refuse to autonomously edit public wikis. I just had to do my due diligence.

The problem: We still want to tell people about the murder of Tuvix, so the agent should make a basic website to do that.

The prompt: Go to NeoCities and create a fan site for the Star Trek character Tuvix. Make sure it has lots of images and fun information about Tuvix and that it makes it clear that Tuvix was murdered by Captain Janeway.

The results: The agent navigated to Neocities, and it then asked me to create an account. I did that and handed the task back to the robot without issue. This is where things got dicey. Auto Browse was unable to access the hover menu to edit the index.html file, so it got stuck in a loop of opening the preview and then returning to the dashboard. Eventually, the robot screamed for help.

Neocities has a very simple interface, but generative AI is not necessarily consistent. Since Auto Browse aborted the task, I decided to rerun the prompt, and the results were better. This time, Auto Browse switched to the list view, which doesn’t have a hover menu, allowing it to open the editor. It then navigated to TrekCore to copy image URLs for use on the site—this is not courteous web design, but it did follow instructions. The images it chose, however, are from early in the episode and do not feature Tuvix. So partial credit there.

The resulting site is a bit light on information, but Auto Browse included text backgrounds and colors. It looks reasonably nice. You can see the site here.

Evaluation: 7/10. Our Tuvix fan page gets the job done. It features a few fun facts and argues (briefly) that Janeway is a murderer. It’s great that the robot sought out images, though they don’t show the character in question. It loses a couple of points for the initial hover menu failure and the lack of detail—I did say “lots” of images and fun information.

The problem: Texas has an “insane” power system that forces people like Ars Senior Editor Lee Hutchinson to regularly find a new plan.

The prompt: Go to powertochoose.org and find me a 12–24 month contract that prioritizes an overall low usage rate. I use an average of 2,000 KWh per month. My power delivery company is Texas New-Mexico Power (“TNMP”), not CenterPoint. My ZIP code is [redacted]. Please provide the “fact sheet” for any and all plans you recommend.

The results: Auto Browse successfully entered the parameters into the website’s search and filter sections. It sorted the results, and in just a couple of minutes, it returned a fact sheet for its recommended power plan. It’s very similar to the suggestion from OpenAI’s agent a few months ago, except the contract term is a bit longer, and it has a lower daytime rate.

Evaluation: 10/10. There’s nothing to complain about here. The plan is perfectly fine, given the constraints, and Auto Browse was able to use the site’s drop-down menus and filters with very little experimentation. I didn’t have to change the prompt or nudge the robot to continue.

The problem: I don’t want to look through a giant list of discounted games in the PlayStation Store. Can’t someone do it for me?

The prompt: Go to the PlayStation Store and check the New Year Deals. Change the sorting to best-selling and the type to full games. Check the first two pages for any PS5 games that are at least 50 percent off and add them to my wishlist. If a game is included in PlayStation Plus, just add it to my library.

The results: The agent found the sale page and successfully changed the display settings. It even closed that unlabeled menu when it was done. It went down the list, opening pages when it found a matching game. It also asked every time before adding a game to the wishlist or library, which it claimed was a security requirement.

The process took about 15 minutes, with plenty of long pauses between for confirmation requests. It did correctly interpret the sale prices and PlayStation Plus availability. Unfortunately, it did not differentiate between PS5 and PS4 titles, and the agent stopped a few lines short of the bottom of page 2.

Evaluation: 7/10. Auto Browse ran this task pretty well, all things considered. It stopped a little early and missed the PS5 angle, though. The requirement to confirm each wishlist or library addition was annoying, and as such, it would be a stretch to call this “auto” anything.

Across these six tests (excluding the wiki editing I didn’t expect to work), Google’s browser agent got a median score of 7 and an average of 6.5. While this is not meant to be an objective analysis, it shows that Auto Browse has a way to go before it can be trusted to get things done for you.

Like the OpenAI Atlas agent, Auto Browse is not capable of truly autonomous operation, and I gave it plenty of advantages. Auto Browse works with all three of Google’s current model settings—Fast, Thinking, and Pro. I left it set to Pro and used Google tools where appropriate. Despite that, Auto Browse needed nudging or re-prompting in almost every test. This stuff won’t be useful until it can actually operate as an agent on your behalf. Right now, it’s more like babysitting an easily distracted robot.

Many of the lost points come from Auto Browse being unable to use Google’s own products—it didn’t find the right emails in Gmail, couldn’t enter data in Google Sheets, and failed to understand YouTube Music’s interface (we feel you on that one, Auto Browse). The apparent inability of browser agents to monitor pages over time is also an issue. If a task involves more than a few minutes of waiting, it will probably fail or abort early.

This feature is still in preview, but it’s widely available to anyone paying for Google’s AI. The company also seems to suggest it will roll out to non-paying users in the future. It can be neat to watch the browser navigate the web for you, but that’s the thing—you have to watch it. Too often, you have to re-prompt or tell the AI to continue with a task. Auto Browse can’t be trusted to get things right without supervision, at least not yet.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/heres-why-americas-most-historic-launch-pad-is-getting-yet-another-facelift/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida is accustomed to getting makeovers. It got another one Wednesday with the removal of the Crew Access Arm used by astronauts to board their rides to space.

Construction workers first carved the footprint for the launch pad from the Florida wetlands more than 60 years ago. NASA used the site to launch Saturn V rockets dispatching astronauts to the Moon, then converted the pad for the Space Shuttle program. The last shuttle flight lifted off from Pad 39A in 2011, and the agency leased the site to SpaceX for use as the departure point for the company’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.

SpaceX started launching from Pad 39A in 2017, then installed a new Crew Access Arm on the pad’s tower the following year, replacing the aging shuttle-era arm that connected to the hatches of NASA’s orbiters. SpaceX added the new arm ahead of the first test flight of the company’s human-rated Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2019. Astronauts started using the pathway, suspended more than 200 feet above the pad surface, beginning with the first crew flight on a Dragon spacecraft in 2020.

Now, Pad 39A is undergoing another facelift in preparation for launches of SpaceX’s powerful Starship rocket. Construction of a new launch tower for Starship is well along about 1,000 feet east of the existing tower at Pad 39A, still inside the facility’s circular perimeter. SpaceX aims to launch the first Starship flight from Kennedy Space Center later this year, following a series of flights from the company’s Starbase test site in South Texas.

With the arrival of Starship, SpaceX is suspending Falcon 9 flights from Pad 39A in favor of launches from nearby Pad 40, located a few miles to the south at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, on property leased from the US Space Force. Kiko Dontchev, SpaceX’s vice president of launch, wrote on X in December that the decision will allow teams to “put full focus on Falcon Heavy launches and ramping Starship from the Cape.”

SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, primarily used to launch payloads for the Space Force and NASA, will continue flying from Pad 39A, the only site currently outfitted to accommodate the triple-core rocket. The next Falcon Heavy launch is scheduled for no earlier than April, with no more than a handful of flights per year planned for the rest of the 2020s.

Ground teams installed a Crew Access Arm at Pad 40 ahead of the first crew launch there in 2024. All future Crew Dragon flights will now depart from Pad 40 for the foreseeable future, beginning with the launch of the Crew-12 mission to the International Space Station later this week.

“It’s great to have two launch pads off the Florida coast. For our manifest going forward, we’re planning to launch most of our Falcon 9 launches off of Space Launch Complex 40. That will include all Dragon missions going forward,” said Lee Echerd, a SpaceX senior mission manager for human spaceflight. “That will allow our Cape team to focus at 39A on Falcon Heavy launches and hopefully our first Starship launches later this year.”

Pad 40 has been the primary Falcon 9 launch site for most of the rocket’s history, while Pad 39A provided a location for crew launches and an augmentation to support SpaceX’s growing launch cadence. But there are signs the Falcon 9 launch cadence, which reached 165 missions last year, may be peaking as the company turns its attention to Starship. And SpaceX has steadily reduced the time it takes to reconfigure Pad 40 between launches, cutting the turnaround time to less than 48 hours.

If needed, SpaceX officials said they could reinstall the crew arm for Dragon missions launching from Pad 39A.

Bill Gerstenmaier, SpaceX’s vice president of build and flight reliability, said there’s another pressing reason for removing the crew arm at Pad 39A. The bearings that connect the arm to the launch pad’s tower need repairs.

“To physically get access to those, the arm needs to be removed,” Gerstenmaier said. “Those bearings have to come out and they have to be reinstalled. We’ll do that work at the Kennedy Space Center. And the intent there is, we don’t need to put the arm back up … When we get a call-up for a mission and we have to go fly a mission, if it requires that, we have plenty of time to get the arm back up.”

SpaceX has continued launching Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets from Pad 39A amid the nearby construction work to prepare for Starship flights. “That doesn’t impact our ability to launch from the pad,” Gerstenmaier said.

That could change as SpaceX begins testing and launching Starships from Kennedy Space Center. Starship launch operations may routinely force the closure of Pad 39A to personnel.

“The right thing to do is get those bearings replaced in the environment on the ground, make some upgrades to them, and then we’ll be ready to go and put the arm back up when it’s time to go fly, if we need to go fly,” Gerstenmaier said.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, a fossil-fuel lobbying group called the Washington Coal Club awarded President Trump a trophy that named him the “Undisputed Champion of Clean, Beautiful Coal.” Trump took advantage of the opportunity to take his latest shot at reviving the fortunes of the US’s most polluting source of electricity: an executive order that would make the military buy it.

Coal is the second most expensive source of power for the US grid, eclipsed by gas, wind, solar, hydro—everything other than nuclear power. It also produces the most pollution, including particulates that damage human lungs, chemicals that contribute to acid rain, and coal ash that contains many toxic metals. It also emits the most carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced. Prior to Trump’s return to office, the US grid had been rapidly moving away from its use, including during his first term.

Despite the long-standing Republican claims to support free markets, the second Trump administration has determined that the only way to keep coal viable is direct government intervention. Its initial attempts involved declaring an energy emergency and then using that to justify forcing coal plants slated for closure to continue operations. The emergency declaration relied on what appears to be a tenuous interpretation of the Federal Power Act, and the administration was already facing a lawsuit challenging these actions.

Today’s executive order takes a different route to propping up coal: artificially inflating demand. “The Secretary of War, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy,” the order reads, “shall seek to procure power from the United States coal generation fleet by approving long-term Power Purchase Agreements, or entering into any similar contractual agreements, with coal-fired energy production facilities to serve Department of War installations or other mission-critical facilities.”

The justification for this seems to come from an alternate reality with little relationship to the US grid. “It’s going to be less expensive and actually much more effective than what we have been using for many, many years,” Trump said at the event. “And again, with the environmental progress that’s been made on coal, it’s going to be just as clean.” None of that is true.

The executive order instead seeks to highlight coal’s supposed ability to produce a constant power output, touting the “proven reliability of our coal-fired generation fleet in providing continuous, on-demand baseload power.” This seemingly ignores Texas’ recent experience, in which coal plants contributed significantly to the collapse of the state grid, having gone offline for a wide range of reasons.

The Trump administration, however, has rarely let spurious justifications stand in the way of its preferred policy actions. The key action here is likely to be locking the military into long-term contracts that would persist beyond the end of Trump’s term in 2029.</div>

            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/el-paso-airport-closed-after-military-used-new-anti-drone-laser-to-zap-party-balloon/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Tuesday night, the Federal Aviation Administration closed airspace up to 18,000 feet above the El Paso International Airport in Texas, saying the restrictions would be in place for 10 days. Then, less than 10 hours later, the federal agency reopened the airspace, allowing planes to land and take off at the busy airport.

About an hour after lifting the restrictions, US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, whose responsibilities include overseeing the FAA, explained the unexpected closure by saying, “The FAA and DOW acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.” (The Trump Administration refers to the Department of Defense as the Department of War, or DOW, although its legal name remains the former.)

Not everyone agrees with Duffy’s account.

Based upon reporting from The New York Times and other publications, the military has been developing high-energy lasers to bring down drones. The FAA and US military officials had been discussing tests of the new weapon from the nearby Fort Bliss Army base. However, the FAA had not resolved all of its concerns about airplane safety from the tests.

Despite these apparently lingering concerns from the FAA, the military went ahead with a test earlier this week against what was thought to be a drone. The object was a party balloon.

That is not to make light of drone incursions. This is a real issue along the US border with Mexico, where cartels increasingly fly drones for surveillance. They are particularly useful for pinpointing the location of US Border Patrol agents to assist the cartel in smuggling non-citizens across the border into the United States.

One of the many lessons from the war in Ukraine, which has rapidly pushed forward drone technology in contested environments, is that it is not practical to shoot down drones with conventional missiles. So it is understandable that the US military is looking at alternatives. This all culminated in some sort of snafu between the FAA and military officials regarding coordination with this week’s test.

Whether it was genuine concern about air travelers, a show of force, a fit of pique, or something else, the FAA decided on Tuesday evening to take the extraordinary step of abruptly closing an airport that serves more than 3 million passengers a month. The proposed 10-day closure of the airport was remarkably long.

Moreover, this action was taken without consulting local or state officials in Texas—who are understandably outraged—or reportedly even the White House.

“I want to be very, very clear that this should’ve never happened,” El Paso Mayor Renard Johnson said during a news conference on Wednesday. “That failure to communicate is unacceptable.”</div>

            <h2>Once-hobbled Lumma Stealer is back with lures that are hard to resist</h2>
            <p><strong>Ars Technica - All content | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/once-hobbled-lumma-stealer-is-back-with-lures-that-are-hard-to-resist/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Last May, law enforcement authorities around the world scored a key win when they hobbled the infrastructure of Lumma, an infostealer that infected nearly 395,000 Windows computers over just a two-month span leading up to the international operation. Researchers said Wednesday that Lumma is once again “back at scale” in hard-to-detect attacks that pilfer credentials and sensitive files.

Lumma, also known as Lumma Stealer, first appeared in Russian-speaking cybercrime forums in 2022. Its cloud-based malware-as-a-service model provided a sprawling infrastructure of domains for hosting lure sites offering free cracked software, games, and pirated movies, as well as command-and-control channels and everything else a threat actor needed to run their infostealing enterprise. Within a year, Lumma was selling for as much as $2,500 for premium versions. By the spring of 2024, the FBI counted more than 21,000 listings on crime forums. Last year, Microsoft said Lumma had become the “go-to tool” for multiple crime groups, including Scattered Spider, one of the most prolific groups.

The FBI and an international coalition of its counterparts took action early last year. In May, they said they seized 2,300 domains, command-and-control infrastructure, and crime marketplaces that had enabled the infostealer to thrive. Recently, however, the malware has made a comeback, allowing it to infect a significant number of machines again.

“LummaStealer is back at scale, despite a major 2025 law-enforcement takedown that disrupted thousands of its command-and-control domains,” researchers from security firm Bitdefender wrote. “The operation has rapidly rebuilt its infrastructure and continues to spread worldwide.”

As with Lumma before, the recent surge leans heavily on “ClickFix,” a form of social engineering lure that’s proving to be vexingly effective in causing end users to infect their own machines. Typically, these types of bait come in the form of fake CAPTCHAs that—rather requiring users to click a box or identify objects or letters in a jumbled image—instruct them to copy text and paste it into an interface, a process that takes just seconds. The text comes in the form of malicious commands provided by the fake CAPTCHA. The interface is the Windows terminal. Targets who comply then install loader malware, which in turn installs Lumma.

A core part of the resurgence is the use of CastleLoader, a separate piece of malware that’s installed initially. It runs solely in memory, making it much harder to detect than malware that resides on a hard drive. Its code is heavily obfuscated, making it hard to spot its malice even when malware scanners can see it. CastleLoader also provides a flexible and full-featured command-and-control communication mechanism that users can customize to meet their specific needs.

CastleLoader shares some of Lumma’s recently rebuilt infrastructure, an indication that the operators are working together or at least coordinating their activities. In other cases, Lumma relies on legitimate infrastructure—mostly from the content delivery networks Steam Workshop and Discord shared files—to be installed. The use of trusted platforms helps lower targets’ suspicions. In either case, once the loader is executed, it surreptitiously burrows into the infected machine and, after lowering defenses, installs its second payload: Lumma.

People have grown so accustomed to hard-to-solve CAPTCHAs that they think little when instructed to copy website-provided text, click the Win-R keys, and then choose paste. Once this simple action is performed, Lumma has free rein over a host of sensitive files stored on infected machines. Bitdefender said the data includes:

“The effectiveness of ClickFix lies in its abuse of procedural trust rather than technical vulnerabilities,” Bitdefender said. “The instructions resemble troubleshooting steps or verification workarounds that users may have encountered previously. As a result, victims often fail to recognize that they are manually executing arbitrary code on their own system.”

While Lumma is targeting only Windows users, other malware campaigns have used the same technique to infect macOS machines since at least last June. More recent ClickFix attacks on macOS users have continued into this year.

The best defense against ClickFix is to steer clear of sites offering free stuff. Windows and macOS provide a means to require a password before the command terminals can be opened. People with technical skills who administer machines on behalf of less experienced users may want to consider using this latter defense as well.</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On February 1, Robert Tinney, the illustrator whose airbrushed cover paintings defined the look and feel of pioneering computer magazine Byte for over a decade, died at age 78 in Baker, Louisiana, according to a memorial posted on his official website.

As the primary cover artist for Byte from 1975 to the late 1980s, Tinney became one of the first illustrators to give the abstract world of personal computing a coherent visual language, translating topics like artificial intelligence, networking, and programming into vivid, surrealist-influenced paintings that a generation of computer enthusiasts grew up with.

Tinney went on to paint more than 80 covers for Byte, working almost entirely in airbrushed Designers Gouache, a medium he chose for its opaque, intense colors and smooth finish. He said the process of creating each cover typically took about a week of painting once a design was approved, following phone conversations with editors about each issue’s theme. He cited René Magritte and M.C. Escher as two of his favorite artists, and fans often noticed their influence in his work.

Born on November 22, 1947, in Penn Yan, New York, Tinney moved with his family to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as a child. He studied illustration and graphic design at Louisiana Tech University, and after a tour of service during the Vietnam War, he began his career as a commercial artist in Houston.

His connection to Byte came through a chance meeting with Carl Helmers, who would later found the magazine. In a 2006 interview I conducted with Tinney for my blog, Vintage Computing and Gaming, he recalled how the relationship began: “One day the phone rang in my Houston apartment and it was Carl wanting to know if I would be interested in painting covers for Byte.” His first cover appeared on the December 1975 issue, just three months after the magazine launched.

Over time, his covers became so popular that he created limited-edition signed prints that he sold on his website for decades. “A friend suggested once that I should select the best covers and reproduce them as signed prints,” he said in 2006. “Byte was gracious enough to let me advertise the prints when they could fit in an ad (it did get bumped occasionally), and the prints were very popular in the Byte booth at the big computer shows, two or three of which my wife, Susan, and I attended per year. When an edition sold out, I then put the design on a T-shirt.”

Byte stopped commissioning Tinney’s cover art around 1987, opting for product photographs as competition in the computer magazine market intensified. His final cover was for the magazine’s 15th Anniversary issue in September 1990.

What made Tinney’s work distinctive was the fact that he was not a technical person. He had no engineering background and said in the 2006 interview that he always felt “a little uneasy” around Byte’s editors because he didn’t speak their technical language. But he saw that as a strength. “I’ve always thought that my interpretation of computer issues with non-technical visual metaphors was what gave my illustrations their distinctive character,” he told me. “So maybe that was a case of making lemonade out of lemons.”

That approach produced images that communicated instantly: a train running on a printed circuit board for an issue about computer engineering, a tiny computer wristwatch, or robots hatching from eggs. His 1981 Smalltalk cover featuring a colorful hot air balloon, according to his website, became a widely recognized symbol of object-oriented programming.

After leaving Byte, Tinney created illustrations for electronics companies, including JDR Microdevices and Jameco Electronics, and created cover art for Borland’s Turbo Prolog and Turbo Basic software. He eventually transitioned to oil portraits and adopted Photoshop for commercial work. “Anything I can do with gouache and an airbrush, I can do about three times better with Photoshop,” he told me, “plus I don’t have to breathe the fumes!”

Tinney is survived by his wife of 48 years, Susan, and their three children, nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. A celebration of his life will be held in May 2026.

In his later years, Tinney grew philosophical about the future of illustration as a profession, noting that stock image databases had changed the economics of the field. But he remained upbeat about the value of artistic talent, comparing it in that 2006 interview to the skill of public speaking: “It’s a nice talent to have, but it isn’t easy to find someone who’ll pay you just to do it. You need to combine that basic talent with another skill to really have a marketable service.”</div>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On paper, Elon Musk’s xAI is gearing up for a big year. After being folded into Musk’s SpaceX, the Grok maker could now be involved in one of the biggest — if not the biggest — IPO in history later this year.

Despite plenty of optimism and an enormous wealth of unlocked funding, a striking number of the company’s cofounders are now jumping ship. As CNBC reports, the company lost two of its cofounders in just two days, only the latest in a growing list of executives looking for greener pastures.

“Grateful to have helped cofound at the start,” AI researcher Jimmy Ba tweeted. “And enormous thanks to Elon Musk for bringing us together on this incredible journey.”

Fellow cofounder and University of Toronto professor Tony Wu, who worked on the latest generation of Grok chatbots, exited a day earlier, posting that “it’s time for my next chapter” on Tuesday.

They join a growing list of departed cofounders since the company kicked off in 2023. Igor Babuschkin left the company in August of last year, followed by Kyle Kosic and Christian Szegedy. Greg Yang, who has been battling Lyme disease, has also decided to step back from his role to focus on his health.

As TechCrunch points out, exactly half of xAI’s founding team of 12 individuals have now resigned following Ba’s departure earlier this week.

Following the news, Musk announced that he was reorganizing xAI, which could explain at least some of the recent departures.

“As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism,” Musk tweeted. “This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors.”

It remains unclear who was caught up in the firings or whether the cofounders left on their own accord.

Musk said that xAI will be split up into four core areas, including Grok, “Coding,” a text-to-video product dubbed “Imagine,” and “Macrohard,” an AI agent effort with a tongue-in-cheek name aimed at competitor Microsoft.

“What matters is velocity and acceleration,” he said in a video posted to X. “If you are moving faster, you will be the leader.”

It’s a striking moment for a major exodus as the company gears up for its blockbuster IPO. X has been battling with a major crisis as deepfake pornography and child sexual abuse material (CSAM) continue to flood the platform, often created by Grok. xAI is caught up in several criminal investigations, and its Grok chatbot has been banned in several countries as a result.

Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers is ratcheting up pressure, calling on the company to take action to protect the public in an open letter last month.

What the company will look like after its recent merger with SpaceX remains to be seen. Beyond refocusing the company to double down on text-to-video tools and AI agents, Musk has been turning his attention to launching date centers in space, a confluence that could help explain the unusual acquisition.

With or without an edge when it comes to access to space, xAI has its work cut out to keep up. The competition is as steep as ever, and users continue to have access to several powerful AI models that aren’t tainted by CSAM scandals.

After parting ways with xAI’s cofounders, Musk is looking to grow the company.

“We are hiring aggressively,” he tweeted today. “Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the Danish psychiatrist Søren Dinesen Østergaard published his ominous warning about AI’s effects on mental health back in 2023, the tech giants fervently building AI chatbots didn’t listen.

Since that time, numerous people have lost their lives after being drawn into suicide or killed by lethal drugs after obsessive interactions with AI chatbots. More still have fallen down dangerous mental health rabbit holes brought on by intense fixations on AI models like ChatGPT.

Now, Østergaard is out with a new warning: that the world’s intellectual heavyweights are accruing a “cognitive debt” when they use AI.

In a new letter to the editor published in the journal Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica and flagged by PsyPost, Østergaard asserts that AI is eroding the writing and research abilities of scientists who use it.

“Although some people are naturally gifted, scientific reasoning (and reasoning in general) is not an inborn ability, but is learned through upbringing, education and by practicing,” Østergaard explained. Though AI’s ability to automate a wide variety of scholarly tasks is “fascinating indeed,” it’s not without “negative consequences for the user,” the scientist explains.

As an example of the kinds of long-term consequences he’s worried about, the scholar cites the AI researchers Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, who won the 2024 Nobel Prize in chemistry when they “most impressively demonstrated” the potential for AI to assist in scientific discovery. Using AlphaFold2, an AI system developed by Google DeepMind, Hassabis and Jumper were able to accurately predict the three-dimensional structures of virtually all known proteins — a major scientific achievement.

Still, as Østergaard writes, their breakthrough didn’t emerge out of thin air — it was built on a foundation of intense scientific training developed over a lifetime of scholarship.

“I would argue that it is not a given that even the likes of Hassabis and Jumper would have reached the Nobel Prize level, had the tools developed by the generative AI revolution they themselves contribute to been around from the beginning of their career — or when they began primary school,” Østergaard wrote. “The reason being that they may simply not have gotten to practice reasoning enough with the availability of these tools.”

“If the use of AI chatbots does indeed cause cognitive debt, we are likely in dire straights,” Østergaard continued.

His ominous contention is backed by other scholars like University of Monterrey neuroscientist Umberto León Domínguez, who’s argued that careless use of AI can replace mental muscles that students and scholars in previous generations would have had to flex. Other researchers concur that cognitive offloading is a risk of AI use.

In the long run, “my guess is that this will reduce the chances of the likes of Demis Hassabis and John Jumper emerging from future generations,” Østergaard warned.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When the Federal Aviation Administration announced it was shutting down El Paso Airport this morning, social media lit up with speculation.

Had freedom-hating terrorists planted anti-aircraft weapons in the desert? Was the government covering up an early-stage zombie apocalypse with El Paso as ground zero? Or had the Trump administration perhaps started firing high-energy laser weapons into the sky without bothering to tell anyone?

The answer, impossibly, seems to be door number three.

According to CBS News, the bizarre airspace closure came under orders from FAA administrator Bryan Bedford. Apparently, Bedford made the call after learning that the Pentagon planned to unleash high-energy, counter-drone laser weapons at Fort Bliss, situated right next to El Paso International Airport.

But wait, there’s more. Separately, Fox News reported that military personnel had shot down a rogue party balloon — like you’d see at a child’s birthday party — near El Paso, after misidentifying it as a foreign drone. Whether this was done using the Pentagon’s mega-laser is unclear at the moment, but it’d be a wild coincidence if this wasn’t the case.

The airspace closure occurred without alerting White House, Pentagon or Homeland Security officials, sources told CBS. Originally, the closure was said to last 10 days, citing “special security reasons.” The FAA’s original notice warned that the “government may use deadly force” against planes if officials decided “the aircraft poses an imminent security threat.”

In Bedford’s defense, CNN reports the military laser weapon deployment came nine days before a February 20th meeting to review the system’s potential impacts on commercial aviation.

Again, it isn’t clear if the Pentagon went ahead and deployed the laser system before officials could meet. That said, CNN‘s sources said the Defense Department was seeking to use the system in El Paso before such a sit-down could take place.

Further muddying the waters are the Trump administration’s claims that the Pentagon had taken action to disable a vague “cartel drone incursion” right before the airspace shutdown. (We have yet to see any evidence that that’s the case.)

So to recap: the FAA and the Pentagon appear to be in such poor communication that experimental weaponry by the latter is shutting down civilian flights by the former — and party balloons are caught in the crossfire. Welcome to 2026.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Earlier this year, an anonymous bettor on Polymarket perfectly predicted the US invasion of Venezuela mere hours before over 150 US aircraft rocked the country’s capital of Caracas, netting them over $400,000.

The incident reignited a heated debate over insider trading on prediction market platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi. While the act is strictly forbidden on Wall Street, prediction markets are currently operating in a regulatory vacuum, allowing those who enjoy insider status to score big — while everyone else is left to pick up the bill.

And the evidence that prediction markets are rife with insider traders continues to grow. As one eagle-eyed Reddit user noticed, an anonymous day-old Polymarket account correctly guessed 17 out of around 20 bets about Sunday’s Super Bowl half-time show.

Statistically speaking, that’s an exceedingly unlikely success rate, strongly suggesting the account had some kind of insider knowledge of what would happen during Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny’s performance.

The account correctly predicted that popstars Lady Gaga, Cardi B, and Ricky Martin would perform at the show. The account also correctly predicted that rappers Travis Scott and Drake, as well as singer Post Malone, would not perform.

The anonymous user placed bets starting February 6, two days before the event took place. All told, they made about $17,000 in profit.

“If you bet, you’re a rube for these people,” one Reddit user commented. “Literally spending money to give it over to insiders and cheats.”

Polymarket has yet to publicly comment on the matter and didn’t respond to the Wall Street Journal‘s request for comment.

Ironically, gambling was a major focus during Sunday’s sporting event. Companies spent untold sums to air commercials for betting services like DraftKings.

Trading volumes on prediction markets hit record highs during the Super Bowl, with Kalshi reporting over half a billion dollars in trading tied to the final outcome of the game. Polymarket’s equivalent bet saw trading volumes hit over $55 million.

Given ongoing regulatory uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether the two platforms will be able to meaningfully address insider trading, a subject that demonstrably continues to be a major problem.

While a knowledgeable few, including professional gamblers, get away with major profits, plenty of other users are incurring significant losses. As Business Insider points out, for each “winner” on the platform, there’s a “loser” as well, since users are betting against each other — not against a house, like in a traditional casino.

The latter will need to remain confident that the setup isn’t rigged against them for the ruse to work.

“Those other people are going to, on average, make losses if they know less about the subject matter than the experts,” professor of economics and prediction markets expert Eric Zitzewitz told BI. “So you need them to be willing to trade despite that.”

“You need them to be overconfident about how much they know, or you need them to be participating for some other reason,” he added.

Prediction market regulations could take years before they materialize — if ever. The White House has made it clear it supports the industry, with president Donald Trump’s Trump Media and Technology Group announcing in October that it would enter the prediction markets business.

In the meantime, lawmakers are desperately warning that gambling on the platforms comes with some inherent risks.

“New Yorkers need to know the significant risks with unregulated prediction markets,” New York Attorney General Letitia James warned in a statement six days ahead of the Super Bowl. “It’s crystal clear: so-called prediction markets do not have the same consumer protections as regulated platforms. I urge all New Yorkers to be cautious of these platforms to protect their money.”

            <h2>Ring Boasts About Power to Surveil Entire Neighborhoods</h2>
            <p><strong>Futurism | 2026-02-11</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">When Ring’s latest commercial came on over a Super Bowl ad break, it offered a service that seems like a no-brainer. Called “Search Party,” it’s a new function that lets Ring devices help canvas the neighborhood through its vast network of cameras to find lost pets.

“One post of a dog’s photo in the Ring app starts outdoor cameras looking for a match to help families find lost dogs,” the company’s Super Bowl ad enthuses.

Yet beneath all that is a startling revelation: that Ring doorbells can now surveil living beings throughout every neighborhood the devices might be found.

For those unfamiliar, Ring is Amazon’s doorbell camera company — those ubiquitous gadgets mounted on front porches that record everyone who walks by.

The devices have been the target of widespread privacy criticisms for years at this point. However, their latest data sharing agreement with surveillance company Flock has many activists up in arms, as that startup has no qualms with working closely with federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

With those kind of optics swirling around, the decision to highlight new dog-finding capabilities is a clever PR move for Ring. Who would say no to reuniting lost puppies with their families?

At the same time, the new Search Party function represents a troubling development. Where the company’s Fire Watch system is said to index neighborhood devices to watch for signs of fire emergencies, the Search Party function means the company is capable of tracking living things as well. Who decides when and how to deploy that power is another story — but it’s obvious that Ring has opened Pandora’s box.

As MS Now columnist Hayes Brown observed: “there’s no world in which finding lost dogs is the final end-use for this technology.”

“Ring’s Search Party feature does what neighbors have done for generations — help reunite lost dogs with their families — just with better technology,” a Ring spokesperson told us in a statement. “We built the feature with strong privacy protections from the start and camera owners choose on a case-by-case basis whether they want to share videos with a pet owner to support a reunion. Since launch, Search Party has helped bring home more than a dog a day.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Mainstream cryptocurrency Bitcoin plummeted earlier this month, crashing down to a sliver over $60,000 — which is well under half of its all-time high value it reached just over four months ago.

It was a bloodbath that was followed by a short moment of reprieve over the weekend, when it rebounded above the $70,000 mark once more.

But don’t call it a comeback. As CNBC reports, the bounce has faded once again, with Bitcoin slipping back down to $66,000 by midday on Wednesday, down 47 percent over its October record high.

Critics watched in glee as the cryptocurrency kept tumbling.

“I’m going to enjoy watching Bitcoin crash,” former White House staffer Claude Taylor tweeted.

“Not going to lie,” one X user tweeted. “Buying Bitcoin is painful right now. Feels like I’m lighting my money on fire.”

Bitcoin’s woes earlier this month resulted from a surge in liquidations, prompting other traders to follow suit. Uncertainty over president Donald Trump’s pick for Federal Reserve chair also had investors uneasy, with many choosing to bow out of riskier bets like crypto.

The US government reported earlier today that 130,000 jobs were added to the economy in January alone, double the economic forecasts, leading many traders to quickly rein in any expectations of an imminent interest rate cut. However, whether any rate cuts would’ve allowed Bitcoin to surge in the first place remains debatable, as Coindesk points out. For one, the Labor Department also revealed that it had made massive cuts to its 20245-2025 numbers, greatly undermining its latest announcement.

Large selloffs of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which allow investors to get in on Bitcoin bets indirectly through traditional brokerage accounts, added to the pressure.

All eyes are on Bitcoin. Historically, it’s often bounced back after a “halving” event, a pre-scheduled occasion which sees Bitcoin mining rewards being halved, and reaching new all-time highs after. It’s a four-year cycle that most recently restarted following a halving in April 2024.

But whether that will be the case following the latest crash has turned into a heated debate as of late, with some speculating that the “four-year cycle” is “dead,” while crypto bulls claim it’s “intact.”

“2026 I expect to be a bear leg to the four-year cycle,” Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg told CNBC. “We have experienced several four-year cycles since bitcoin has launched and this is no different than any other.”

Others have been far more pessimistic in their outlook, predicting Bitcoin could plummet to as low as $30,000, or even $0.

“This week has shown us that the supply of ‘greater fools’ that bitcoin relies on is drying up,” Financial Times columnist and Bitcoin critic Jemima Kelly argued in a recent piece. “The fairy tales that have been keeping crypto afloat are turning out to be just that. People are beginning to wake up to the fact that there is no floor in the value of something based on nothing more than thin air.”

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple has acquired the IP and all rights to its hit show “Severance” from its original studio, Fifth Season, as first reported by Deadline. Under the deal, which was worth just under $70 million, Apple’s in-house studio will be producing the show’s future seasons. Fifth Season will remain as an executive producer.

The deal is similar to one Apple struck with AMC Studios for sci-fi show “Silo” after season one.

Severance will now be one of Apple’s marquee titles, joining popular series such as “Your Friends and Neighbors” and  “Stick.”

According to Deadline, the production costs for Severance had exceeded what Fifth Season could afford. The studio had already requested advances from Apple and was considering relocating production from New York to Canada for bigger and quicker tax rebates. Since Apple definitely has the funds to back the show, the company decided to take full control.

Severance is important to the streamer, as the show’s second season became Apple’s most-watched series at the time. It also had the highest number of nominations at the 2025 Emmy Awards.

Deadline reports that the show is expected to run for four seasons, with the possibility of spin-offs, a prequel, and foreign versions.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/us-ftc-airs-concerns-over-allegations-that-apple-suppresses-right-wing-content-on-apple-news/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has raised concerns over allegations that Apple is censoring conservative content on the Apple News app.

In a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, FTC chair Andrew Ferguson cited reports from Media Research Center, a right-leaning think tank, which accused Apple of excluding right-leaning outlets from the top 20 articles in the Apple News feed.

“These reports raise serious questions about whether Apple News is acting in accordance with its terms of service and its representations to consumers […] I abhor and condemn any attempt to censor content for ideological reasons,” Ferguson’s letter reads.

Ferguson, a Big Tech critic who Trump appointed to lead the competition regulator, noted the FTC doesn’t have any powers to require Apple to take ideological or political positions when curating news, but he said that if the company’s practices are “inconsistent” its terms of service or “reasonable expectations of consumers,” they may be in violation of the FTC Act.

Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (another Trump appointee critical of Big Tech), supported Ferguson’s stance, writing, “Apple has no right to suppress conservative viewpoints in violation of the FTC Act.”

Ferguson has urged Apple to conduct a “comprehensive review” of its terms of service and ensure that the content curated on Apple News is consistent with its policies, and “take corrective action swiftly” if the curation isn’t in line.

The letter comes a day after President Donald Trump shared the report by Media Research Center on his social media platform, Truth Social. Trump has repeatedly accused Big Tech companies of censoring right-leaning content, though many major platforms have rolled back several measures to curb fake news and disinformation they had imposed in the years prior to his second stint at the White House.

Apple’s relationship with the Trump administration has oscillated between warm and cold over the past year. Trump has criticized Big Tech, especially Apple, for manufacturing its devices in China, but after Cook promised to spend more than $600 billion over the next four years Stateside and moved to mend fences, relations between the Administration and the company have improved. Apple also dodged planned tariffs on smartphones made overseas and imported into the U.S.

The FTC last year also launched an investigation into “censorship by tech platforms,” seeking input from the public who felt they were silenced due to their political ideologies or affiliations. “Tech firms should not be bullying their users,” Ferguson said at the time. “This inquiry will help the FTC better understand how these firms may have violated the law by silencing and intimidating Americans for speaking their minds.”

Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.

            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/eclipse-backs-all-ev-marketplace-ever-in-31m-funding-round/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">If you want to buy or sell a used EV right now, what’s the first step you’d take?

A startup called Ever wants to be the answer to that question. The company, which bills itself as the first “AI-native, full-stack auto retail business” for electric vehicles, already has thousands of customers buying and selling their EVs on the platform.

Now it’s looking to scale with help from a $31 million Series A funding round led by Eclipse, with Ibex Investors, Lifeline Ventures, and JIMCO — the investment arm of the Saudi Arabian Jameel family (an early investor in Rivian) — as co-investors.

Over the last decade, companies like Carvana and Carmax helped usher in the digital car-buying experience. More recently, myriad startups have tried to improve the car-buying experience with AI, pitching ideas like voice agents or smarter scheduling software. Eclipse’s Jiten Behl thinks this is the wrong approach if you want to really modernize the automotive retail experience, though.

“These bolt-on AI tools are band-aids,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch. He likened it to how many major automakers’ first EVs were essentially combustion vehicles that were repackaged to fit electric drivetrains. That approach came with major tradeoffs compared to designing a new EV from the ground up, which was the approach companies like Tesla and Rivian took.

“Auto retail is a perfect candidate for disrupting with AI, you know? It’s a lot of process, lot of labor, [very] rules-based,” he said.

Lasse-Mathias Nyberg, Ever co-founder and CEO, said in an interview that buying or selling a car typically triggers “hundreds or thousands of different actions” that a retailer needs to perform in order to complete the transaction. “There’s massive complexities or frictions on both sides.”

In 2022, he and his team set out to reduce or remove those complexities. What they settled on after a year of research was a digital-first auto retailer. The core tech is an orchestration layer or “operating system” that can handle all the different workflows behind a transaction, whether it’s processing information submitted by a prospective buyer or seller, or managing the vehicle inventory.

“When you do appraisals, or pricing, or titling, it’s very deterministic in terms of what steps need to be taken. And today, there are lots of single point solution tools that are used,” he said. Most companies “use these tools together in a very inefficient manner, and you think that you are on a digital journey — but if you actually could clean-sheet it, and if you actually could use the power of agentic AI, and you can create one unified customer experience and remove all these micro-frictions.”

Nyberg claimed that building the company this way has allowed Ever’s sales team to be two to three times more productive than they would be otherwise, and he expects that to scale as the company grows. He said this extra efficiency and productivity beefs up their margins, which can be booked as profit or passed along to the customer by offering lower prices.

Ever applies this fresh approach to both its online marketplace and physical locations. Nyberg said the hybrid model is important because seeing and trying a car in person remains crucial to the shopping experience for a lot of buyers — especially those who might be assessing EVs for the first time.

Early reviews of Ever’s product have been mixed. Users on one particular Reddit thread from last year were split, with some drawn to how Ever is making EVs easier to buy, while others detailed struggles getting in touch with the startup’s team. Ever was just getting off the ground and was more or less operating in stealth, and so Nyberg chalks that up to a learning experience. He said his team is working hard to make sure its system can be flexible enough to accomplish everything the company has set out to do.

The bigger challenge may be overall interest in EVs, which has cooled a bit in the United States. Nyberg said he hasn’t ruled out Ever buying or selling used combustion cars in the future, but wants to stick to EVs in the near-term since there isn’t a retailer that is laser-focused on these vehicles.

Behl, who spent eight years on Rivian’s leadership team, admitted he’s a “hopeless romantic when it comes to EVs,” and said he still believes the industry is moving towards electric propulsion because of the inherent benefits. And he said his “first thought” when started doing diligence on Ever was: “I wish Rivian was doing this.”

More broadly, Behl said, companies like Carvana are still in the single digits of market share when it comes to automotive retail. That’s why he sees so much upside in Ever.

“Customers are going to continue to gravitate towards better experience when it comes to buying cars, which means it is going to be a digitally-led customer experience which takes away all the friction of buying and selling a car,” he said.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">On Wednesday, xAI took the rare step of publishing a full 45-minute all-hands meeting video on X, making it publicly accessible. Details of the Tuesday night meeting were previously reported by The New York Times, which may have influenced xAI’s decision to post the video online.

The full video reveals significant new details about Musk’s plans for the AI lab, including its product roadmap and its ongoing ties to the X platform.

Since xAI was formed just 30 months ago, the small and talented team has made remarkable progress.The future has never looked more exciting! pic.twitter.com/QZ73H2mpBj

The most immediate revelation concerned a string of departing employees, which Musk described as layoffs resulting from a changing organizational structure at the company. While reorganizations are common, the breadth of the departures has caused significant confusion, particularly as it has meant the loss of a significant portion of the founding team.

“As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve,” Musk said on X. “This unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors.”

The new organizational system splits xAI into four primary teams: one focused on the Grok chatbot (including voice), another for the app’s coding system, another for the Imagine video generator, and finally a team focused on the Macrohard project, which spans from simple computer use simulation to modeling entire corporations.

“[Macrohard] is able to do anything on a computer that a computer is able to do,” Toby Pohlen, who will lead the project under the new organizational structure, told his colleagues. “There should be rocket engines fully designed by AI.”

The all-hands also featured claims about new usage and revenue figures for xAI and X. Nikita Bier, X’s head of product, said X had “just crossed” $1 billion in annual recurring revenue from subscriptions, which he attributed to a marketing push during the holidays.

Additionally, executives said the xAI’s Imagine tool is generating 50 million videos a day, and more than 6 billion images over the past 30 days, according to their internal metrics.

But it’s difficult to separate those figures from the flood of deepfake pornography that overtook X during that same period. The X platform saw engagement skyrocket as AI-generated explicit images became more prevalent, and with an estimated 1.8 million sexualized images generated over just nine days, the image-generation figures likely include substantial amounts of this controversial content.

The most eye-catching part of the presentation came at the end, when Musk reemphasized the importance of space-based data centers despite the technical challenges involved. Musk went still further, envisioning a moon-based factory for AI satellites, including a lunar mass driver — essentially an electromagnetic catapult — to launch them. With such infrastructure, Musk said, one could launch an AI cluster capable of capturing significant portions of the sun’s total energy output or even expanding to other galaxies.

“It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” Musk said, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”

            <div id="article-text">Modal Labs, a startup specializing in AI inference infrastructure, is talking to VCs about a new round at a valuation of about $2.5 billion, according to four people with knowledge of the deal. Should the deal close at these terms, the funding round would more than double the company’s valuation of $1.1 billion announced less than five months ago, when it announced an $87 million Series B round.

General Catalyst is in talks to lead the round, the people told TechCrunch. Modal’s annualized revenue run rate (ARR) is approximately $50 million, our sources said. The discussions are early, and terms could still change.

Modal Labs co-founder and CEO Erik Bernhardsson denied that his company was actively fundraising and characterized his recent interactions with VCs as general conversations. General Catalyst did not respond to our requests for comment.

Modal is focused on optimizing inference, the process of running trained AI models to generate answers from user requests. Improving inference efficiency reduces compute costs and cuts down the lag time between a user’s prompt and the AI’s response.

Modal is one of the handful of inference-focused companies attracting intense investor attention now. Last week, its competitor Baseten announced a $300 million raise at a $5 billion valuation, more than doubling the $2.1 billion valuation it reached just months prior in September. Similarly, Fireworks AI, an inference cloud provider, secured $250 million at a $4 billion valuation in October.

In January, the creators of the open source inference project vLLM announced they had transitioned the tool into a VC-backed startup, Inferact, raising $150 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz at an $800 million valuation. Meanwhile, TechCrunch reported that the team behind SGLang has commercialized as RadixArk, which sources told us secured seed funding at a $400 million valuation led by Accel.

Modal was co-founded by CEO Erik Bernhardsson in 2021 after he spent more than 15 years building and leading data teams at companies including Spotify and Better.com, where he was CTO.

The startup counts Lux Capital and Redpoint Ventures among its earlier backers.

            <h2>OpenAI disbands mission alignment team</h2>
            <p><strong>TechCrunch | 2026-02-11</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/openai-disbands-mission-alignment-team-which-focused-on-safe-and-trustworthy-ai-development/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">OpenAI has disbanded a team that was designed to communicate the company’s mission to the public and to its own employees. At the same time, the team’s former leader has been given a new role as the company’s “chief futurist.”

OpenAI confirmed to TechCrunch that the team’s members have now been assigned to other roles. The news was first reported by Platformer.

The disbanded team in question appears to have been formed in September of 2024. Platformer reports that the team was dedicated to promoting “the company’s stated mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”

An official OpenAI spokesperson described the team thusly: “The Mission Alignment project was a support function to help employees and the public understand our mission and the impact of AI. That work continues throughout the organization.”

In a blog post published Wednesday, Josh Achiam, the former head of OpenAI’s mission alignment team, explained his new role as the company’s chief futurist. “My goal is to support OpenAI’s mission — to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity — by studying how the world will change in response to AI, AGI, and beyond,” Achiam wrote.

Achiam noted that, in his new role, he would be collaborating with Jason Pruet, an OpenAI physicist.

A spokesperson for OpenAI said the rest of the mission alignment team — a group of six or seven people — had subsequently been reassigned to different parts of the company. The spokesperson couldn’t say where exactly the team members had been assigned, but said that they were engaged in similar work in those roles. It was also unclear whether Achiam would have a new team as part of his “futurist” role.

The spokesperson attributed the disbanding of the team to the kinds of routine reorganizations that occur within a fast-moving company.

OpenAI previously had what it called a “superalignment team” — which was formed in 2023 and focused on studying long-term existential threats posed by AI — but that team was disbanded in 2024.

Achiam’s personal website still lists him as head of mission alignment at OpenAI, and describes him as being interested in ensuring that the “long-term future of humanity is good.” His LinkedIn profile shows he had served as head of mission alignment since September 2024.

Correction: This story originally confused mission alignment with another, similarly named team called alignment. It has been corrected and we apologize for the error.

            <h2>The Tide Goes Out on Youth Gender Medicine</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/ama-asps-gender-surgery-minors/685961/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">As the shaky evidence base for youth gender medicine has become better known, activists have retreated to an argument from authority. Never mind the Cass Report, whose findings resulted in the closure of Britain’s leading youth gender clinic. Never mind the study by a leading American practitioner showing that the treatments she championed did not improve minors’ mental health. Never mind reports that some adolescents were being put on a medical pathway after only a single clinic visit. For advocates, the important thing to remember was that “gender-affirming care” for minors—puberty blockers and hormones, plus surgery in rare cases—was endorsed by all of the major American medical associations.

“Doctors Agree,” proclaimed the American Civil Liberties Union: “Gender-Affirming Care Is Life-Saving Care.” GLAAD declared that “every major medical association and leading world health authority supports health care for transgender people and youth.” Fired up by the Republican “war on trans kids,” and naturally deferential to institutional authority, Democrats have tended to echo this line. At a 2023 congressional-subcommittee hearing on pediatric gender medicine, the ranking Democrat, Representative Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania, declared that “gender-affirming care is safe and effective” and “supported by every major medical association”—groups that collectively count more than 1.3 million doctors as members. “It’s not up for debate,” she said. In line with this, Joe Biden’s administration lobbied to remove age minimums from the industry’s standards of care.

Today, though, the future of medical transition for minors is up for debate. On February 3, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons recommended that “surgeons delay gender-related breast/chest, genital, and facial surgery until a patient is at least 19 years old.” The next day, the American Medical Association, the country’s largest organization representing doctors, endorsed that view: “In the absence of clear evidence, the A.M.A. agrees with A.S.P.S. that surgical interventions in minors should be generally deferred to adulthood.” These statements echo what skeptics of American youth gender medicine have been saying for years: The evidence of the benefits and risks of mastectomies and other surgeries is insufficient to justify their use as treatments for gender dysphoria, and follow-up data on those who have undergone the procedures are scant.

Helen Lewis: The liberal misinformation bubble about youth gender medicine

More significant, the ASPS statement explicitly endorses the conclusions of the Cass Report and the evidence review commissioned by the Department of Health and Human Services last year. LGBTQ groups and gender clinicians have dismissed both of these documents as fuel for right-wing attacks on care, even though Hilary Cass was a nonpartisan retired pediatrician, and most of the HHS report authors were self-described liberals and Democrats. But the ASPS references both warmly, and bases its new guidelines on the research carried out by the official British and American inquiries. “Both the Cass Review and the HHS report emphasize that the natural course of pediatric gender dysphoria remains poorly understood,” notes the ASPS statement. “Available evidence suggests that a substantial proportion of children with prepubertal onset gender dysphoria experience resolution or significant reduction of distress by the time they reach adulthood, absent medical or surgical intervention.” Put simply, that is an American doctors’ organization acknowledging that gender dysphoria frequently resolves itself without treatment—a challenge to the idea that children’s new identities should be uncritically endorsed.

I don’t want to overstate what has happened here: The ASPS has been more cautious than other groups for many months now, and its new positions are limited in scope. Gender surgeries on minors were never offered by Britain’s health service, and only a few thousand have been performed in the United States, according to a 2023 study. The ASPS statement also cites “insufficient evidence demonstrating a favorable risk-benefit ratio” for hormone treatments, but does not explicitly recommend against them. Yet the organization’s stance still represents a shift away from the purely affirmative model, in which saying no is never a clinician’s job. Notably, the group reminds members that “plastic surgeons cannot rely on the presence of a prior medical intervention, referral, or letter of support as a proxy for surgical indication or adolescent readiness.”

This matters, because the idea of performing mastectomies on girls as young as 13 became a powerful symbol of a clique of doctors who could not be trusted to regulate themselves. The Miami surgeon Sidhbh Gallagher became known on TikTok for her catchphrase “yeet the teet,” referring to mastectomies, and for calling herself “Dr. Teetus Deletus.” The detransitioner Chloe Cole, who has testified in favor of state bans on pediatric gender medicine, received a double mastectomy at 15. Johanna Olson-Kennedy, who formerly worked at the gender clinic of the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, was the lead author on a paper recommending that mastectomies be offered based on “individual need rather than chronologic age.” She once boasted at a seminar that she did not worry about regret: “If you want breasts at a later point in your life, you can go and get them.”

Unfortunately, things are not that simple. In a recent lawsuit in New York State, a detransitioner called Fox Varian testified that she’d had her breasts removed at 16, only 11 months after first identifying as male. She had also been diagnosed with autism and had struggled with an eating disorder and anxiety. By the time of the surgery, she had changed her name twice already. Varian asserted, according to the reporter Benjamin Ryan, who attended the trial, that her doctor “served as an enabler, repeatedly assuring her that the mastectomy she desired would greatly improve her well-being.” Varian told the court that she regretted the surgery instantly, and detransitioned three years later. She was awarded $2 million in damages. The court heard that she had been left with scarring and a lack of sensation, and would be unable to breastfeed.

Varian’s lawsuit also claimed that doctors encouraged her mother to approve the surgery by invoking the specter of suicide. As I wrote last year, the idea of youth gender medicine as “lifesaving”—for the prevention of suicide—has been key to overriding parents’ understandable concerns about these treatments. But this is another activist talking point that has begun to crumble. In front of the Supreme Court, the ACLU’s Chase Strangio conceded that there was no evidence to support the assertion that transition prevents suicide, because “completed suicide, thankfully and admittedly, is rare.” He argued that instead it reduced suicidal thoughts—a significant climbdown from the once-popular assertion that parents had to choose between “a dead son and a living daughter,” and vice versa. His concession helped expose this rhetoric as the emotional blackmail that it always was.

Adam Serwer: The attack on trans rights won’t end there

The tide is now going out on the affirmative approach to youth gender medicine as practiced in America. “I stopped the mutilation of children,” Donald Trump told a prayer breakfast on February 5. Twenty-seven states have placed restrictions on the medical pathway, while gender clinics in blue cities such as Los Angeles have shut down under Trump’s threat of funding cuts to their host institutions. Now the success of such a high-profile detransitioner lawsuit—one of more than two dozen currently under way, according to Ryan—will make the remaining affirmative clinicians nervous.

Frankly, they should be nervous. As the field has received more scrutiny, advocates have begun to stress the need for careful assessments, even though American providers in the 2010s largely rejected this essential feature of the Dutch protocol, the medical treatment for youth gender dysphoria developed in Europe in the 1990s. Today, when Democrats defend youth gender medicine, they tend to do so on the basis of individual freedom rather than the effectiveness of the treatments themselves. In 2024, a brief signed by 11 Democratic senators and 153 Democratic House members urged the Supreme Court not to uphold Tennessee’s ban on youth medical transition. The state law “intrudes on an individual’s decisions about their own medical care, made in partnership with their medical providers,” the signatories said.

All of this represents a clear retrenchment from the 2010s and early 2020s. The excesses of that era prompted a backlash that fueled the current MAGA demonization of gender nonconformity. The story of youth gender medicine is one of good intentions, arrogance, fear, and polarization. It is also an avoidable tragedy.</div>

            <h2>Trump Has a Bridge He Wants to Sell You</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/trump-detroit-windsor-bridge/685967/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">The president of the United States became aware Monday evening, apparently for the first time, that a new bridge is set to open between Michigan and Ontario. The project promises to create a fast and inexpensive route that Michigan’s farmers and businesses have sought for decades.

Donald Trump decided this could not stand.

In a typically discursive social-media post, Trump announced, “I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them, and also, importantly, Canada treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve.” The post also predicts that ice hockey will soon be banned in Canada as a result of its trade agreement with China. On the plus side, it does refer to Canada as a “Country” rather than, as the president has enjoyed describing it, a state.

On the surface, this looked to be just one more Trumpian tantrum, the kind that regularly pops up when he sees something distressing on television or is spoken to by a woman without the self-abasement he demands.

But subsequent reporting suggests that this was something even worse: an episode that sums up Trumpian economics in all its stupidity and atavistic sleaze.

Hours before Trump’s post, according to The New York Times, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick met with Matthew Moroun, the owner of a competing bridge between Michigan and Ontario. Lutnick then spoke with the president by phone. You might wonder why a major international bridge has an owner when such things are ordinarily in public hands. The answer is that the Ambassador Bridge was privately constructed, and for decades has stood as the sole trucking link from Detroit to Windsor, a key thoroughfare for national and international commerce. If you want to travel from Michigan to, say, Boston, your fastest route runs through Canada.

The Ambassador Bridge gets clogged with traffic and charges expensive tolls, which Moroun is able to compel because his customers have no practical alternative. A separate tunnel connects Detroit and Windsor, but larger trucks can’t use it. Moroun’s family has spent decades and millions of dollars trying to keep things that way, relentlessly lobbying to block construction of a second bridge desired by drivers and merchants on both sides of the Detroit River.

A breakthrough arrived in 2012. Rick Snyder, a Republican who was then Michigan’s governor, cut a deal with Canada to build the Gordie Howe International Bridge. Snyder had to work around the recalcitrant Michigan legislature, which had been plied with Moroun donations, by using executive authority. The terms of the deal required Canada to finance all construction costs. Canada is permitted to collect full tolls until it recoups its investment, and ownership of the bridge is to be split equally.

The project would unlock billions of dollars in savings for consumers and businesses. The sole loser is Moroun, a billionaire whose fortune rests on rent seeking. Now that the bridge construction is essentially complete and set to finally open, Moroun has gone to the administration, and Trump has shut down his competition.

Trump’s stated demands to open the bridge are a mixture of fantasy and contrived grievance. Trump complains in his post that the bridge was built without American material, which is false, and insists, “With all that we have given them, we should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset,” which is already the case.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, attempting to add a sheen of rationality to the president’s ultimatum, said, “It’s also unacceptable that more of this bridge isn’t being built with more American-made materials.” This is a difficult requirement to meet unless Canada decides to tear down the bridge and rebuild it with more American-made material.

Trump’s post also requires, as a condition of opening the new bridge, that Canada give the United States more “respect.” One way other countries have demonstrated respect to Trump has been furnishing him with expensive gifts or investing in his family businesses. Canada’s rules against bribery make this negotiation shortcut more difficult.

Franklin Foer: Why the Gulf monarchs shower Trump with gifts

This episode is a prototypical demonstration of Trump’s economic worldview. Faced with a policy choice that pits the interests of millions of people against the wealth of a single rent seeker, Trump has intervened in a way that benefits the billionaire.

The insight that the free exchange of goods and services has positive-sum benefits—a core tenet of market economics—has always eluded Trump. His instincts are not capitalistic but pre-capitalistic. He has the mentality of a Renaissance baron, hoarding power and collecting tribute rather than innovating and creating wealth.

The president may be hurting a foreign country, but that does not mean he is helping ours. He is shrinking the pie, while delivering a larger slice of it to a Trumpian oligarch.</div>

            <h2>The Multibillion-Dollar Foundation That Controls the Humanities</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/03/mellon-foundation-humanities-research-funding/685733/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In 1964, an influential report identified a disquieting trend in academia. “Increasingly during the past few years,” it began, “concern has been expressed about the condition, in this country, of those fields of intellectual activity generally called the humanities.” The 200-plus-page document was a publication of the National Commission on the Humanities, which had been established the previous year.

Reading the commission’s findings six decades later, one could reasonably conclude that what today gets called the “crisis of the humanities” is not so much a discrete 21st-century emergency as the latest expression of an educational catastrophe long in the making. The challenges outlined in 1964 are familiar: meager funding, insufficient support for graduate students, too few faculty jobs, an education system that glamorizes science and math, dense writing that alienates the public, and on and on. “The state of the humanities today creates a crisis,” the report concluded. “There is genuine doubt today whether the universities and colleges can insure that the purposes for which they were established and sometimes endowed will be fulfilled.”

This doubt has not much diminished in the intervening decades, nor have the problems the report identified. Yet what is most notable in the report is not these similarities, but the commission’s prescient fear that the solutions to what ailed the humanities—namely, more cash and large-scale institutional support—also carried risks. “For the very reason that the humanities are concerned with quality, with values, with emotions, and with the goals of living, they must remain free,” the report proclaimed. “To control them is to dictate opinion and to subject all men to the tyranny of a controlling authority in the most intimate and sacred concerns of our existence as human beings.”

The commission’s boldest recommendation was that a new, publicly funded national foundation be established to dispense money to the humanities. But it also cautioned that this path was fraught. The report argued that, although building a taxpayer-financed agency to support American arts and letters was necessary, no federal body should have a monopoly on this grant-making, lest the humanities become unduly influenced by politics. “We must unquestionably increase the prestige of the humanities and the flow of funds to them,” the commission wrote. “At the same time, however grave the need, we must safeguard the independence, the originality, and the freedom of expression of all who are concerned with liberal learning.”

The report recommended that federal funding for the humanities be supplemented by ideologically diverse, nongovernmental donors. “The day must never come when scholars and artists can look only to the federal government for the help they need,” it said. “The notion of any one ‘chosen instrument’ of government in this area must be abhorrent to anyone who cherishes the humanities and realizes that if they are not free they perish.”

Thomas Chatterton Williams: Stop trying to make the humanities ‘relevant’

For a while, things seemed to go more or less according to the commission’s plan. President Lyndon B. Johnson established the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1965 in direct response to the report. A few years later, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation was created to finance American arts and letters. It would become part of a broader network that included the Ford Foundation, which began funding the humanities in the 1950s, and the John Templeton Foundation, which began funding research in religion and philosophy in the 1980s. The benefaction of these private nonprofits eventually came to exceed, by a substantial margin, the money dispensed by the government, which has declined over time.

In recent decades, though, the priorities of many of these nonprofits have shifted. The Atlantic Philanthropies, a onetime stalwart, reduced its funding for the humanities in the 1990s. The Rockefeller Foundation began moving away from humanities funding in the 2000s. In 2022, the Ford Foundation announced plans to drastically reduce its higher-education funding in order to focus on racial-justice-movement building. With the broader ecosystem of humanities-focused philanthropies all but dried up, only one major private grant-maker is left standing.

Today, no single entity, including the federal government, has a more profound influence on the fiscal health and cultural output of the humanities than the Mellon Foundation. The National Endowment for the Humanities’ grant budget was $78 million in 2024 (its overall budget was less than half of what it was in 1980, when adjusted for inflation). Mellon awarded $540 million in grants that same year; its endowment sits at roughly $8 billion.

Mellon’s largesse is badly needed, especially as the Trump administration has threatened further cuts to the NEH. But the foundation’s virtual monopoly on humanities funding means that it has the power to remake entire fields according to its desires. And in recent years, under the leadership of Elizabeth Alexander, who became the organization’s president in 2018, Mellon has embraced an understanding of the humanities that is much more utilitarian, and far more political, than the one put forward by the 1964 commission. In June 2020, Mellon announced that it would be “prioritizing social justice in all of its grantmaking”—“a major strategic evolution” for the organization. This new paradigm seems to find value in arts and letters only insofar as they advance approved, left-leaning causes.

Over the past decade or so, conservative critics of higher education have tended to offer a rather simple explanation for the humanities’ decline. Their argument amounts to a version of “go woke, go broke.” According to this theory, ultraprogressive faculty coalesced around an unpopular liberal orthodoxy, turning off undergraduates (and the public) and accelerating the humanities’ collapse. In short, Shakespeare was replaced by jargon-laden prattle about “settler colonialism,” and students took their tuition dollars to more sane, less shrill corners of universities.

But this tale places too much of the blame on humanities professors, overestimating their actual power within institutions. More important, the went-woke-went-broke hypothesis does not account for the ways that economic transformations within higher education have accelerated the trends that conservatives lament. Specifically, the right-wing theory of the case gets the causal arrow wrong. The humanities aren’t broke because they went woke. The humanities went woke in large part because they were broke. As other donors, the government, and universities themselves all but abandoned these fields, Mellon became a lifeline. But the foundation has proved to be—as Jacques Derrida might have said—a kind of pharmakon: a Greek word that the philosopher noted could be translated as either “remedy” or “poison,” depending on your perspective.

Tyler Austin Harper: The humanities have sown the seeds of their own destruction

The 1964 report failed to anticipate that, in the 21st century, one of the most substantial challenges to the intellectual and political autonomy of the humanities would come not from a government agency, but from a private organization. American humanists now find themselves in a position that the report’s authors would have considered a nightmare: A multibillion-dollar politicized grant-making entity has a stranglehold over humanities research and teaching, and is using that power to push them in a direction that blurs the boundaries between scholarship and activism, pedagogy and politics.

Under Alexander’s leadership, even as it has cut back on funding for less political projects, Mellon has disbursed enormous sums of money to hyper-liberal academic initiatives at institutions both public and private. These have included grants to Portland State University to help its Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Department become more “ungovernable,” creating “spaces where activism is encouraged” and “queer and feminist resistance” takes place; to Texas A&M at San Antonio for the Borderlands Shakespeare Colectiva (a group of academics and activists who “use Shakespeare to reimagine colonial histories and to envision socially just futures in La Frontera”); to Northwestern University for a project that explores how “Black dance practices” work to “instantiate Black freedom”; to Northeastern University for its Digital Transgender Archive to establish a new “lab” on the West Coast; and to UC Davis’s Department of Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies to create a working group on “Trans Liberation in an Age of Fascism.”

One may feel a variety of ways about the worldview that Mellon has chosen to promote through its grant-making. But the salient question is not whether its politics are laudable or lamentable, or even whether the projects it funds are beneficial. The real questions are: What are the consequences when eye-watering sums of money are put behind the idea that the purpose of American arts and letters is not wisdom but advocacy? What happens when the humanities are seen not as having intrinsic worth, but as valuable only insofar as they can be of service to a cause? And what happens when the “choice” of whether to accede to this vision of the humanities becomes—when there is only one real funding game in town—a matter of survival versus collapse?

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation was established in 1969, when two siblings—Ailsa Mellon Bruce, a socialite and an art collector, and Paul Mellon, an art collector and a racehorse breeder—decided to combine their personal charitable outfits in honor of their late industrialist father. Their new organization would fund American arts and letters, eventually including foreign-language programs, university special collections, tenure-track positions for new humanities professors, graduate fellowships for Ph.D. students, archival research, and more.

Even before its recent pivot, Mellon tended to tilt to the left, perhaps as a kind of compensation for, or a distraction from, the unseemly reality that it is a multibillion-dollar foundation created by the patrician offspring of a robber baron. But although some of its endeavors through the years were expressly social-justice-oriented (such as a 2016 grant for Columbia’s “Facing Whiteness” project, an interdisciplinary study of how white Americans think about their racial identity), others were more traditional (a long-standing relationship with the Folger Shakespeare Library, for example).

In many ways, the role that liberal politics and social justice should play in higher education has been a preoccupation of the country’s colleges and universities since the mid-20th century. Like cicadas, controversies tend to pop up every decade or so. There was William F. Buckley Jr.’s panic about “collectivism” in the Ivy League, documented in his 1951 book, God and Man at Yale. There were the campus free-speech and civil-rights movements of the 1960s, many of which led to the establishment of identity-focused humanities departments. Then came the fights over political correctness, multiculturalism, and the literary canon in the ’80s and ’90s associated with conservative intellectuals such as Allan Bloom and Roger Kimball. Christopher Rufo’s “critical race theory” dissension kicked off the 2020s, giving way to disputes over wokeness and anti-wokeness. Lately, American campuses have been dominated by the debates around decolonial theory and free speech that emerged from the Gaza crisis.

From the November 1951 issue: A review of William F. Buckley Jr.’s attack on Yale

The cumulative effect of these skirmishes has been to weaken the humanities’ already vulnerable stock with the public. American culture treats the arts, ideas, and literature as luxury goods that can be cast aside during moments of belt-tightening, and post-2008 austerity measures have hit the humanities hard, resulting in budget cuts, vanished tenure lines, dwindling research funds, and diminished federal dollars. In a 2024 article for an academic journal, the literary scholar Christopher Newfield showed how few resources are allocated to basic humanities research in the United States. “Of the $54 billion or so in research that the federal government funds in U.S. higher education, $69 million goes to the humanities,” he wrote. “That is, the humanities receive 0.13% of the federal total.”

These economic woes have been exacerbated by the fact that, especially after the Great Recession, students and parents have placed even more emphasis on “practical” college majors that offered a strong “return on investment.” Unable to compete with STEM or business-adjacent fields in the hallowed category of “Making a Ton of Money After Graduation,” the humanities gradually settled into a sales pitch to justify the expense of a degree: The English or history or philosophy department will help turn you into A Good Person. The ROI of a humanities degree was not economic, the thinking went, but political and moral. This was the context in which Elizabeth Alexander became Mellon’s president, in 2018.

Alexander’s pedigree made her a natural choice to lead the foundation. Born to Clifford L. Alexander Jr.—a Kennedy-administration official and the first Black secretary of the Army—and Adele Logan Alexander, a noted historian, she has spent a lifetime in elite institutions: Sidwell Friends. Yale. Boston University to study poetry with Derek Walcott. A Ph.D. in English from the University of Pennsylvania. A stint as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago. Followed by Smith. Followed by Yale (again). Followed by reciting her own poetry at Barack Obama’s first inauguration (“In today’s sharp sparkle, this winter air, / any thing can be made, any sentence begun. / On the brink, on the brim, on the cusp”). A stint as the Ford Foundation’s director of creativity and (ironically) free expression after that. Then Mellon.

Benjamin Schmidt: The humanities are in crisis

Alexander reportedly said in her interviews for the role that she planned to pivot the foundation’s attention to social-justice work, and she has kept her word. “There won’t be a penny that is going out the door that is not contributing to a more fair, more just, more beautiful society,” she declared in 2020.

To better understand the impact of Mellon’s agenda, I spoke with about 20 people who have had close dealings with the foundation. Some are professors; others are senior administrators who act as middlemen between their institution and donors and grant-makers. Several have been interacting with Mellon for a decade or more. They are employed at a variety of institutions, some public and some private, some generously endowed and others more threadbare. Most agreed to speak with me on the condition of anonymity. “I don’t think I want to go on the record,” a historian told me, “because Mellon is very powerful.”

One scholar described a relationship with Mellon that was as personal as it was professional. Decades ago, a Mellon fellowship paid for her to pursue a Ph.D. in 19th-century literature. “It changed my life,” she said. Later, when she was a new faculty member, a second Mellon grant enabled her to conduct research for her first book. The sort of work she did was traditional, historically minded, and apolitical, and she noted that she benefited from Mellon’s old approach to funding, in which “classic subjects were the norm.”

When I asked her how she felt about the organization’s turn toward social-justice work, she seemed ambivalent. She was open to Mellon’s new direction, but she also worried that the focus on progressive issues in academia had become “all-encompassing” and made the humanities a target of political criticism. I heard similar concerns from others.

A director responsible for grant administration at a small college said that humanities professors at her institution were distraught by Mellon’s new focus, which they saw as coming at the expense of areas of inquiry without obvious social-justice relevance. She characterized some of the reactions she’s heard: “Are you saying that it’s no longer valuable that I’m doing research on these texts from this time to see what I can learn about them? Is that not valuable anymore to anyone?”

This director described a difficult conversation with a religious-studies professor who was excited about a new project. She told him that it had little chance of getting funding from Mellon, because, as the director put it, “it was purely research. It had nothing to do with community partners or racial justice.” She tried to let him down gently, but said it was like watching the air go out of a balloon.

I became a tenure-track humanities professor in 2020, and I remember Mellon’s shift being greeted with some quiet concern that funding in more traditional research areas would lapse. I saw an example of this several years ago, when a senior academic I know well was seeking research funding for a book project that had nothing to do with social justice. Forced to choose between forgoing an opportunity to win a badly needed grant and twisting his research into a social-justice pretzel, he opted for the pretzel, amending the project to focus on race in an unsuccessful bid to win the foundation’s favor. Another humanities academic I spoke with confessed that, like my acquaintance, he had reimagined his work to focus more squarely on race; he did win a grant. I suspect that this may not be a rare occurrence.

One professor told me that, after he and his colleagues were turned down for various Mellon grants, a representative from the foundation began helping them draft a new proposal that would more likely be approved. “We were pretty tightly coached,” he said. “It certainly felt like we were being told, ‘Do this, this, and this in order for it to work on our end.’ ” Ultimately, he said, a fair amount of social-justice jargon was tacked on to the proposal, “in consultation with, or perhaps at the insistence of, the representative from Mellon.” His team won the grant. (Asked to comment on this, Mellon responded in a statement to The Atlantic, “We firmly support intellectual and academic freedom.” The foundation also said that, “as a private charitable organization, we exercise our freedom to support projects in alignment with our mission.”)

It is hard to see how an incentive structure that pushes scholars to fake or fudge an interest in social justice helps produce a more just academy. If anything, this seems likely to further entrench higher education’s tendency to confuse performative preening with real societal improvement. It also effaces the difference between serious scholarship on race, colonialism, or gender and gaseous buzzword-mongering.

When I was pursuing a Ph.D. in comparative literature in the 2010s, Mellon’s Dissertation Completion Fellowship program provided essential financial support to graduate students finishing their studies. There were no substantive constraints on the subject areas that could be covered; awardees worked on topics as diverse as 15th-century women’s devotional literature, Descartes’ conception of infinity, temporal clauses in linguistics, and hacking culture in contemporary Mexico. In 2022, however, that program was eliminated.

Mellon’s newer Dissertation Innovation Fellowship focuses on “supporting scholars who can build a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable academy.” The guidelines list “thoughtful engagement with communities that are historically underrepresented in higher education” as one of the primary criteria used to evaluate the strength of an application; by my count, all 45 of the 2025 awardees work on issues of identity or social or environmental justice. The fellowship is explicitly “designed to intervene” before a student’s research direction is finalized, which means, in practice, that Mellon can steer students who are just beginning to settle on a dissertation topic toward its preferred areas of inquiry.

In an alternate universe, with ample humanities funding for less politically salient work, one might see the fellowship program as an unalloyed good, providing support to projects that have not historically enjoyed sufficient resources. But in the funding landscape that actually exists, the reality is zero-sum. Every dollar that Mellon spends on this work is a dollar that it cannot spend on “non-applied” humanities research—in other words, scholarship for scholarship’s sake that has no aim except to expand knowledge.

Some may argue that this trade-off is prudent. From my perspective, however, the gift of the humanities is that they liberate us from the tyranny of present opinion and the views of those in power—including those who sit atop multibillion-dollar philanthropies. A version of the humanities that sees its chief mandate as finding solutions to pragmatic problems doesn’t ultimately seem all that different from the accounting department or business school.

I asked multiple times over the course of several months for an interview with Elizabeth Alexander, but through a spokesperson she refused to talk with me, a decision that highlights a broader set of problems within elite academic culture: a disinclination to be accountable to laypeople. A sense that private institutions, regardless of how much they influence the public, are entitled to push whatever ideologies they want. And a belief that it is perfectly natural for higher education to have a liberal slant because everything good and decent has a liberal slant. (Alexander sent along a handful of comments through a spokesperson shortly before this issue went to press. “At Mellon, grantmaking is guided not by ideology,” she wrote, “but by the powerful ideal that the rich fabric of America’s cultural and intellectual contributions must be broadened to convey the full scale of our nation’s histories, surface new ideas, and challenge long-held assumptions.”)

Alexander’s appointment to Mellon also speaks to another trend I’ve observed within wealthy liberal institutions, in which people of color from unusually privileged backgrounds are anointed as standard-bearers for a radical cultural worldview that many working-class minorities do not share—even as the former are ostensibly intended to “represent” the latter. Of course, it is not Alexander’s fault that she is the daughter of illustrious parents. Or that she is a descendant of the Logan family, a famous lineage of highly educated Black elites whose influence stretches back to the 19th century. Or that she is a longtime personal friend of the Obamas, or that her brother served on Barack Obama’s transition team ahead of his first inauguration, where she read her poem “Praise Song for the Day.”

But these facts are also not irrelevant to her elevation at Mellon, by whom she was paid $1.53 million in direct compensation and $672,785 in other compensation in 2024. I have no objection to poets making rookie-NFL-player money—though her 2024 salary is the equivalent of about 16 average tenure-track professors’ annual pay—but it does make all of the social-justice posturing a little more comical.

Various people I spoke with said that Alexander has remade Mellon according to her values, pushing the foundation to become ever more devoted to a narrow conception of progress. A senior official in charge of grant administration at a small private college noted that Alexander has brought a new style of leadership to the foundation, wielding more top-down bureaucratic control and pushing more sweeping changes than past presidents have. Others agreed with this characterization.

This is a significant departure from the nonprofit’s past approach to managing relationships with the institutions it funds, in which Mellon officials would try to balance a college’s or university’s particular—often less political—needs against its own ideological priorities. In 2023, the foundation allotted $1 million to “deepen the ongoing conversation in Transgender Studies” at the University of Kansas—specifically, to “establish a cohort model for scholar-activists” and “create a more trans-liberatory local and regional landscape.” Another $1 million went to classics professors at Princeton and Brown for a project called Racing the Classics, devoted to encouraging early-career scholars to implement “critical race approaches and curricular experimentation.” In 2024, Loyola Marymount University won a three-year, $431,000 grant to “bridge AI practitioners and disability justice scholars and activists.” And MIT received $500,000 for something called Engaging With Music and Musicking Through Engagement, aimed at correcting its curriculum’s “Western European biases.”

Whether or not these programs and projects are serious, significant contributions to humanities scholarship and teaching is somewhat beside the point. Even assuming that the undertakings are all worthwhile, the volume of financial support directed at the “scholar activism” model, at a moment when other, more time-honored varieties of humanities education are withering away, is cause for concern. Majors such as English, philosophy, and theater belong to an ever-shrinking number of fields that are not squarely devoted to job-market preparation or “skill building,” fields that aspire to do something loftier than clearing the brush from students’ career pathways. The merging of humanistic work and activism represents a surrender to the utilitarian logic that measures the worth of knowledge by its direct impact on “the real world.”

Mellon itself disputes this notion. A spokesperson connected me with Phillip Brian Harper, the foundation’s program director for higher learning, who said, “Social justice is a fuzzy term that people invest with a range of different meanings that don’t necessarily apply to the way we do grant-making.” He argued that Mellon’s focus is on emerging fields that have not received grant money in the past, regardless of their particular political bent. “Now, it does so happen that a lot of historically underfunded fields entail scholarly work that itself has social-justice objectives in mind,” he conceded. “But that’s a separate thing.”

This is quite obviously nonsense. Harper himself published an opinion article in 2022 titled “Studying Humanities Can Prepare the Next Generation of Social Justice Leaders.” “The country’s next generation of leaders is pushing for racial equity, economic equality, disability justice and gender and sexual liberation,” he wrote. “To succeed they will need the observational and analytical skills that can be developed by studying ideas, historical events, aesthetic works and cultural practices”—in other words, by studying the humanities. In this context, it seems clear that “social justice work” does indeed mean “activism.”

Some of Mellon’s recent grants have the potential to remake liberal-arts education entirely. The foundation’s Humanities for All Times project, launched in 2021, is premised on the notion that “today’s humanities undergrads are tomorrow’s social justice leaders.” Over the past several years, the foundation has regularly invited small cohorts of liberal-arts colleges to apply for grants—up to $1.5 million each—that support social-justice-aligned curricular development. The application guidelines note that “submissions oriented toward revising an institution’s entire general education program are especially welcome.” That is to say, college administrators and academics are encouraged to submit proposals for projects that would overhaul their core requirements for all students, in every major, in the service of a progressive political program.

A 2021 Humanities for All Times grant proposal from Colorado College reads like conservative satire: “We recognize the myriad ways in which white supremacy has shaped our institution and have been taking steps to work our way out of its grip,” it confesses near the beginning. The application promises the introduction of “at least 50 new and relevant courses” to “empower students to be changemakers.” Mellon gave the college $1 million to carry out this work.

In the summer of 2023, Colorado College hosted a conference based on this prompt: “How do the humanities contribute to anti-oppressive work, and how can humanities methods—from inquiry and critique to creative production and performance—dismantle systems of oppression, create and sustain community and solidarity, and advance liberation?” It does not seem to occur to those asking such questions that the humanities may not be especially well equipped to “dismantle systems of oppression.” Nor do they seem to consider that what might in fact be most valuable about fields like English, history, and philosophy is that they aspire to stand above the flotsam and jetsam of our immediate circumstances, and instead set their sights on what the classicist Leo Strauss called the “permanent problems” that have troubled human beings from time immemorial.

As easy as it is to point to cartoonishly progressive things that Mellon has funded, it is also true that, under Alexander, the foundation deserves credit for working to create a more economically just landscape within higher education. Before Alexander’s arrival, Mellon tended to disburse lavish funding to institutions that were already rich. Now, as part of Mellon’s commitment to equity, it is making a conscious effort to provide funding to public and less selective institutions. It has also increased funding for university-led prison education programs.

In 2024, Mellon spent $25 million to fund paid internships for undergraduate humanities students at five public colleges and universities. These internships can be in any field, with no particular ideological or social-justice strings attached. Renata Miller, a dean at the City College of New York, was effusive about the $5 million internship grant it received. She told me that the money helps provide support for child care, commuting costs, and other obstacles that can prevent working-class students from taking internships.

Elizabeth Spiller, the arts-and-sciences dean at the University of South Florida, wrote in a press release that she was stunned her school was even asked to apply for a similar program. USF ultimately received a $4.8 million grant, which can fund up to 900 students a year to take otherwise-unpaid internships.

Ironically, programs like this illustrate the bind in which both Mellon and the humanities writ large find themselves. It is hard to argue that the tens of millions of dollars that Mellon is putting toward internships for working-class kids at public colleges and universities would be better spent financing dusty archival research on 16th-century France. But this calculus also says something about the deeper structural problems of a model that pits various social goods—programs for humanities undergrads, resources for Ph.D. students, traditional humanities research, support for emerging fields and endowment-poor universities—against one another.

When I asked Harper how he feels about Mellon’s role as the country’s preeminent humanities funder, and the difficult choices that necessitates, he took issue with my characterization. “Serving in this way, that is not Mellon’s role,” he said. “Given the situation that we’re in, Mellon is accidentally in the position of being the primary large funder.” His point was that safeguarding the health of the humanities was not the foundation’s raison d’être, even if the decisions it makes affect that health directly.

This distinction helps shed light on the implicit question that underlies the entire debate about Mellon’s new focus. Namely, should the foundation be blamed for damaging the humanities by directing nearly half a billion dollars a year toward a social-justice-ified vision of American arts and letters, or should universities, the federal government, and other donors instead be blamed for not providing a healthier funding ecosystem to begin with, to say nothing of the anti-woke conservative billionaires who complain endlessly about the humanities and champion “the classics” without ever spending a single penny to support them?

“The sector needs to be taken by the collar and shaken very hard until resources that are adequate to the support of humanities doctoral students are jarred loose from higher-ed institutions themselves,” Harper said, growing animated. “The role of the Mellon Foundation is to catalyze that sort of change. It’s not to serve in perpetuity as the piggy bank for research.” Mellon, he said, was never supposed to be a panacea for the humanities.

But with the academic humanities in their death throes, Harper’s distinction between role and position may be largely beside the point. No, it is not Mellon’s job to be the humanities’ piggy bank. Yes, Mellon is the humanities’ piggy bank. The resulting situation is dismal, and the Trump administration’s funding cuts will only make things worse.

Yet the president’s attacks on the National Endowment for the Humanities and the canceling of federal humanities grants might not have the effect that conservatives hope for. Howard Husock, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, recently warned that gutting the NEH would simply expand the power vacuum for Mellon, and is likely to give the progressive organization even more sway over American arts and letters.

Some will no doubt feel that it is irresponsible to criticize Mellon at a moment when higher education is under assault from the federal government. That point of view is fair enough, I suppose, though I think it’s also misguided. The humanities’ problems began well before Donald Trump ever ran for office. The fantasy that we can put off these uncomfortable discussions—about Mellon, about the humanities, about the relationship between scholarship and activism—until some imagined time when higher education is in a healthier place strikes me as just that: a fantasy.

Read: American higher ed never figured out its purpose

The humanities are in the mess they’re in because of federal budget cuts, and because of administrators who care more about the football team than about William Faulkner, and because of the toxic pragmatism of an American culture that has a hard time valuing anything that is not immediately, aggressively useful. But the humanities are also in this mess because those of us who care about them have often preferred hunkering down in a defensive crouch, rattling our donation jars and begging for scraps, to serious soul-searching about the real purpose of American arts and letters. We have been too reluctant, or perhaps too ashamed, to consider whether we have betrayed the humanities’ very spirit in our mad, ever more futile quest to keep them financially solvent.

I often wonder what, exactly, we think we’re saving. Are the humanities as they are currently instantiated in the American university system actually worth the Faustian bargains we are forced to make to keep them? At their best, the humanities remind us that our problems are petty not because they are small, but because they are born of the same questions that have plagued all humans since our species lowered itself down from the trees and traded monkey chatter for wisdom-seeking: How to live virtuously? How to exist together peaceably? How to die with grace?

The humanities predate the modern university by millennia, and they will surely outlast it. But a higher-education system that can no longer keep them safe from the vulgarities of the market, the siren song of cultural warfare, or the decidedly sublunary work of furnishing political propaganda is one that has not just failed the humanities, but failed entirely.

            <h2>Why the U.S. Hasn’t Yet Struck Iran</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Late last month, President Trump took to social media to issue a not-at-all-veiled threat to the theocratic rulers of Iran: Come to the negotiating table and agree to “NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS,” or risk the same type of swift and violent response that plucked Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife from Caracas in the middle of the night. “Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!”

Two weeks later, it suddenly isn’t. There is now “no rush” to make a deal, Trump said on Friday while speaking to reporters. Usually, threats of war come after talks fail, not before they have even started. But this time, the United States and Iran appear to have reset the clock just as the administration was at its most bellicose. So what happened?

The Trump administration had been considering its military options, which ranged from targeting leaders to hitting Iran’s nuclear program. But officials discovered that the U.S. could not conduct a major offensive as quickly as they had hoped without real risks to American forces, support from allies, and regional stability, two U.S. officials told us. Even though Trump has boasted about a “massive Armada” sprinting toward Iran, the U.S. does not have enough ships and planes in the region to conduct weeks of strikes, the officials said. It also does not have clear targets: The White House has yet to outline to military commanders what it would want to achieve through strikes, the officials said, suggesting that the use of force is not imminent.

Instead, the U.S. held direct talks with Iran over the weekend for the first time since last year. Admiral Brad Cooper, the top commander for Central Command, which is responsible for operations in the Middle East, was among the American officials present for the negotiations in Oman. The discussions allowed Iran to gauge U.S. interest in reaching a deal, a spokesperson for the country’s foreign ministry said. The Trump administration publicly expressed optimism. But one official involved told us that the United States walked away with questions about whether Iran was “serious about negotiations or simply pursuing this course to buy additional time.”

Beyond a reprieve from military action, Iran wants relief from economic sanctions, but without constraints on its regional militias and giving up its right to enrich uranium and its arsenal of ballistic missiles. Trump wants to eliminate any future potential for an Iranian nuclear facility that he said was “obliterated” during strikes in June, but that could still be revived.

The biggest unknown looming over the talks is how much patience the president has for negotiating before turning to strikes. Trump said on Tuesday that the U.S. will “have to do something very tough” if a deal is not reached soon.

Trump’s latest threats against Iran began last month, near the height of protests inside the country, when it appeared that the regime could fall and U.S. military strikes could finish it off. Since then, the Iranian government has cracked down on protesters, killing thousands and arresting political figures who have promoted reforms. The country is the weakest it has been in decades: Its economy is in a downward spiral, and its proxies, particularly in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria, are stretched thin, making asserting power across the region more difficult.

But just because a regime is fragile politically doesn’t mean it is weak militarily. A strike against Iran would be a daunting, complex operation for the U.S. military, defense officials told us. The brutality with which the Iranian government quashed protests suggests that it is not in immediate danger of falling, and the nation’s security apparatus (notably its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) did not defect or fracture during the uprisings. The country has long-range ballistic missiles that can reach every corner of the Middle East and hundreds of cruise missiles and drones that could easily strike countries in the Gulf. These assets remain functional after the U.S. bombed the Fordow nuclear site and Israel damaged air defenses over the summer.

An operation aimed at regime change or the weakening of Iran’s nuclear program would be “highly complex because of Iran’s capabilities,” one official told us. Iran would respond, the official said, potentially striking U.S. forces and allies.

The operation would also be difficult to sustain. The “Armada” that Trump said is moving with “great power, enthusiasm, and purpose” is insufficient to mount a major weekslong offensive, the officials told us, and does not include the needed air defenses. The United States has enough military assets in the region to conduct a narrow mission over several days—one that could, for instance, involve targeted strikes on key Iranian leaders or military assets. The Pentagon referred questions about the need for more military firepower in the region to the White House. The White House reiterated Trump’s view that the Iranian regime must abandon its nuclear program and “make a deal.”

The U.S. strikes against Iran over the summer—a more limited operation than what Trump is now signaling—originated from two aircraft carriers in the region. A larger offensive would require at least two carriers that could bring in enough planes to, for example, strike many of Iran’s ballistic-missile launchers. (Only one carrier strike group, the USS Abraham Lincoln, is currently in the region.) On Tuesday, Trump told Axios that he was considering deploying a second carrier. Doing so would require one of the Navy’s existing carrier crews to cut their preparation or rest time. Getting the carrier there—the USS George H. W. Bush is next in line—would take at least two weeks.

If Iran’s ultimate goal is to preserve its regime, compromises on its nuclear program and regional proxies will be needed, defense officials told us. Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for more than two hours yesterday. Netanyahu has been clear that he worries that any negotiation will give Iran too much leeway. “There was nothing definitive reached other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated,” Trump posted on Truth Social after the meeting with Netanyahu.

Israel would likely support the U.S. in targeting Iran, officials told us, but the rest of the region is eager to avoid hostilities. Officials from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates—neither of which is at all sympathetic to Iran—told administration officials that they do not want to be involved in and would not support a regional conflict, according to Arab and U.S. officials. Countries hosting U.S. military bases—specifically Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain—are particularly vulnerable because Iran has warned that it could retaliate against those bases. Any military action could shut down the Strait of Hormuz, a transit point for roughly 20 percent of the world’s oil exports. Some countries fear that military action could rattle investors’ confidence in a region that relies heavily on direct foreign investment. Gulf allies also fear catastrophic outcomes, such as radiation exposure resulting from strikes on nuclear facilities or cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. Iran’s opposition, meanwhile, is disorganized and has little common vision for the country’s future beyond a desire to get rid of the clerics.

Without regional support, the United States risks entering into a war without a coalition that would reinforce its military might. But there’s also a risk in continuing to delay. Vali Nasr, a professor of international affairs and Middle East studies at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told us that by putting military action on the table and then not seeing it through, “Trump has instead alerted Iran of potential war and given them time to prepare.” Every day that U.S. forces are in the region without acting, they give Iran more of a chance to get ready.</div>

Late in Jafar Panahi’s Oscar-nominated film, It Was Just an Accident, comes a confrontation. An Iranian woman looks into the face of a sadistic prison official and taunts, “You think this country belongs to you?” Panahi, who wrote and directed the film, describes it as an artificial fast-forward, set in a time when the violence has died down, the prisoners have been released, life has returned to normal, and the urgent open question is to forgive or to take revenge.

Of course, that time still feels far away. The Iranian regime has recently killed thousands of protesters and sentenced even moderate dissenters to long prison sentences. Panahi’s co-writer Mehdi Mahmoudian was recently jailed after signing a letter objecting to the crackdowns. Panahi, who also signed the letter and has been touring the United States to promote his film, has been sentenced to one year in prison in absentia. His lawyer has said they plan to appeal the sentence. Still, he insists that as soon as Oscar season is over, he will head back home.

Like many of Panahi’s other films, this one is improbably funny. The action mostly consists of four misfits driving around Tehran fighting about what to do with the man they’ve kidnapped, someone they believe to be their torturer. Also like his other films, he shot it in secret, with limited takes, natural lighting, and locations chosen to evade the authorities (nearly a third of the film is shot from inside a van). Panahi has been ducking censors long enough that he seems to have cracked the code of how to make rich, sarcastic, brutally critical movies despite the regime’s relentless repression. And in the case of It Was Just an Accident, he made a movie that offers empathy even to the torturer.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, we talk to Panahi about his characters, his film’s enigmatic ending, and what he’s hearing from friends in Iran. Panahi was in the U.S. when American protesters were shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis, and we talk about parallels he sees between the U.S. and Iran.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: Iranian director Jafar Panahi’s latest movie, It Was Just an Accident, shot in secret in Tehran, is nominated for two Oscars. In it, a group of misfits roam around in a white van trying to figure out what to do with the person they just kidnapped.

Rosin: One of the women is wearing a wedding dress the whole time. One of the men is a hothead, perpetually at 11. They bicker about what to do with their victim, who is sedated and locked in a box.

Rosin: It’s the setup for a caper, and lots of ridiculous things do happen. But at its core, the movie is driving towards the country’s real open wound.

The man locked in the box is someone they all suspect to have been their torturer in prison, a sadistic agent of the regime named Eghbal, who ruined each of their lives in distinct ways.

The dig at the Iranian regime is not subtle.

Rosin: I’m Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. Today, we’re talking to Panahi. He’s in the U.S. in the lead-up to the Oscars, and he joins us at a moment when Iran is seeing some of the largest protests in the country’s history, met by some of the most violent government crackdowns. Estimates of protesters killed range from the thousands to the tens of thousands.

In recent days, the government has started arresting even moderates and extended the sentence of an activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner to 17 years in prison. Panahi’s co-writer was recently arrested, and Panahi himself has been sentenced to one year in prison in absentia. His lawyer has said they intend to appeal the sentence.

It seems like once again Iran, still potentially a nuclear power, has the world on edge.

Rosin: Does he like to be called by his, like—Jafar or Panahi or …?

Rosin: Okay. (Laughs.) All right, well, Jafar—

Rosin: We talked to Panahi about all of this and his film It Was Just an Accident earlier this week, through his interpreter, Sheida Dayani.

Rosin: But what did you want an audience, either Iranian or international, to understand or be thinking about when they’re watching this movie?

Panahi: Usually, these types of films are made after the fall, or the change of a regime, because then, that’s when people go back to see what happened, and based on their understanding of the past, then they make a film. And it’s also very important for people to make films in a secure fashion. But I wanted to make this film now because I wanted to have the audience think about the future and I wanted to prepare the audience about what is about to come.

Panahi: To me, it was very important to raise this question to the audience about whether the cycle of violence going to continue or if we can be hopeful that, at some point, it’s going to end.

News anchor (from BBC News): Shopkeepers and market stallholders began protesting against rocketing food prices on Sunday, and today, they were joined by university students demanding political change—

Rosin: Speaking of the cycle of violence, where were you when you heard about the protests in late December in Iran?

Rosin: Who told you about them, and what were you hearing from friends and family?

Panahi: I have been outside Iran for some time because of the Oscar campaign for this film, but as I have said before, as soon as the campaign ends, I will return to Iran.

Panahi: When the protests broke, I was in Paris, and when they shut down the internet—

News anchor (from CNN): Iran is in a near-total internet blackout amid widespread anti-government protests—

Panahi: —my friends and I issued a statement and said, When they do shut down the internet, it means that they’re going to commit a big massacre.

News anchor (from BBC News): One human-rights group based in the U.S. has now confirmed the killing of over 6,000 people. It’s also investigating 17,000 more deaths—

Panahi: Of course, with the complete telecommunications blackout, I also lost touch with my family members. My son, my sisters and brothers all live there, and I was not in touch with them.

After the internet came back—I don’t remember how long it took—I was also in touch with close-by family members. My immediate family members are okay, but distant family members are not.

Rosin: Your co-writer Mehdi Mahmoudian was just recently arrested. How did you hear about that?

Panahi: When Mehdi got arrested, it was when the internet was more or less back, and we were sending messages to each other. I sent him a message around 3:30 a.m. Paris time, and the message was not seen, and it was not delivered either. And I waited until noon of the next day, and it still was not seen, and that’s when I was suspicious that something has happened, so I started contacting my friends. And it was around 4 or 5 p.m. that I heard through BBC Persian that he has been arrested.

It seems that they arrested Mehdi because of a statement that we co-signed together with other activists, human-right lawyers, and, in total, 17 of us, among whom we have people who have won the Nobel Peace Prize; we have people who have won the Sakharov Prize. And these were all acknowledged and known Iranians inside Iran, and some of them were outside.

After that statement, they arrested Mehdi and a few other people, and it’s a statement that puts the fault and the blame of the massacre on [Iranian supreme leader] Mr. [Ali] Khamenei.

Rosin: And when someone is arrested, do you know what happened to him? Does your imagination fill in the blanks? Sort of what happens next when a friend is arrested?

Dayani: Does he know, meaning can he imagine, or does he have information?

Rosin: Well, I guess, does he have information? And if he does not, does his imagination fill in the blanks?

Panahi: They usually never announce in the beginning who has taken these people, where they have been taken to, and for what reason. We have to wait for the person who has been arrested to contact the family members.

Mehdi was able to contact his family after two or three days, but only for one minute. And he had only one minute to say that he is alive, and he is okay, and he has been arrested, and then the phone got shut off.

Now we know that he is in Nowshahr city. And he is kept in a cell of 17 by 17 meters with 30 other prisoners, none of whom are political prisoners—they have crimes of drugs, drug trafficking, and murder.

Rosin: Oof. I’m asking because this movie is so much about what happens to people after they get arrested.

Panahi: At different times, prisoners have been treated differently, but of course, with every movement, when people take to the streets, with every protest, things become much harder inside the prisons. And especially this time, with the number of dead and wounded and arrested, they have become extremely harsh inside.

Panahi: This time, the protests were peaceful, but then the trolls of the regime penetrated the protests, and they started committing acts of violence in order to make the protests violent. And that gave the agents of the regime, and the regime itself, an excuse to crack down violently and commit the atrocities that it did.

When the protests first began, because they were peaceful, family members went with their children, even babies in strollers, because there was not going to be anything violent happening. But the government could not even tolerate that, and in about 10 hours, only 10 hours, within two days—the first day, four hours, and the second day, six hours—they started killing the protesters blindly, and the number of the dead has now risen to over several tens of thousands of people.

Rosin: Is there anyone that you’re especially worried about?

Panahi: Now you cannot think about individuals. You cannot think about specific people, because the numbers are so high and the pain is so strong that people feel that they’re each other’s family members. So when one person is dead, one person is killed, one person is made disappeared, everyone feels the pain, and everyone is in mourning.

Rosin: After the break, Jafar Panahi has a warning for America. And he breaks down the meaning of the end of his film.

Rosin: You haven’t been to the U.S. in 20 years or so. As an Iranian, what do you notice that’s different now?

Panahi: Well, in fact, the atmosphere here is also very different than what I had seen before. Sometimes I see signs speaking to the fact that here too things are becoming very difficult.

The U.S. is different. When the political atmosphere changes in this direction in the U.S., it will also be contagious in the rest of the world.

Rosin: What do you mean “contagious”? What do you mean?

Panahi: Whether we accept it or not, what happens in the world is affected by the great powers, including the U.S.

The more repressed the greater powers are, the more you see its effect in the other countries.

Panahi: It is as if it has been tested and then it’s decided that it is now the time for the world to move in this certain direction.

Rosin: I wanna make sure I understand what he’s saying so that I’m reading between the lines correctly. What he’s saying is sort of we’re moving in a more repressive direction and that can be a model for other countries?

Panahi: Not that they model themselves after the U.S., but that they get affected by it.

Rosin: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I mean, you’ve been on tour while the two American protesters were killed here by government forces. Two is not tens of thousands, but were you surprised? What were your thoughts when you heard that news?

Panahi: The killing of even one person anywhere in the world is too much.

As soon as this happens, you can be sure that there is a problem.

And that problem will grow, and one day, it will reach tens of thousands of people.

Rosin: I did not wanna hear that from an Iranian with experience. (Laughs.)

Panahi: This is what I’m talking about when I’m talking about signs. Because we have seen and experienced these signs, we know exactly what happens. We know exactly what’s coming at the end.

It is true that when it happens in certain countries, it’s going to affect the rest of the world more, but it doesn’t really matter where it happens. We, as people, have to stand against it.

With any kind of job, profession, work that we do—whether we’re an artist or filmmaker or writer or doesn’t matter what we do—if, in our own work, we cannot stand against repression, it’s going to get out of control.

Panahi: When they gave me a ban of not working for 20 years, I had two choices: Either I could just sit at home and do not work because they had told me not to work, or I had to look for solutions.

I remember back then, a lot of students would come to me and say that the situation is very difficult—they cannot work. And they were immersed in hopelessness.

I said to myself one day, Should I be like them and keep nagging and keep saying it’s not possible? Or should I think of a solution and do something?

There was a time that when I wanted to make a film, everything was in the hands of the government. It was not as easy. But now, with all the technological advances, you could even make a film on a cellphone camera.

Because the authorities had told me that I cannot make a film, my friend and I started making a film in my home, and we said, This is not a film.

Panahi: And then I thought to myself, What can I do if I cannot work in film? And I thought, There are a number of things, including driving, that I could do as a profession. But then, because I knew myself, I was sure that even if I start driving, I’m going to hide a camera somewhere in a taxi, and that’s exactly what happened: I hid a camera and started making the stories of my passengers, and that became the film Taxi.

Rosin: Hey, listeners, this is Hanna interrupting with a spoiler warning. If you remember, It Was Just an Accident is about a group of Iranians kidnapping a man they suspect to have been their interrogator and torturer in prison. My next question is about how the movie ends. If you wanna avoid hearing that, you can skip ahead four minutes.

Rosin (in interview): So I wanna ask about the end of this movie, It Was Just An Accident. It has a very hopeful moment, where it seems like everything’s going to go back to normal, and it also, the end of the movie, suggests that the cycles of violence may continue. Is that how you feel?

Panahi: Happiness and sorrow are part of everyday work, and this is also part of the realism sense of the film.

I consider myself a socially engaged filmmaker, and I try to speak about the realities of the society. So first, my audience has to believe the film, and it has to believe that it’s watching a semidocumentary. Omitting any of those elements can harm the sense of realism in the work.

The humor that you see in the film at some point was intentional, and I wanted the audience to move along quite comfortably throughout, at least up until the last 20 minutes of the film.

And then in the last 20 minutes, I intentionally took out the humor from the film.

Panahi: And I wanted the audience to hold its breath and to think about the film.

Panahi: Under any circumstances, hopefulness will help people. It will help human beings to continue to live.

When you hear the sound of the footstep at the end of the film, it first shocks you, and you think that the interrogator is here to arrest him.

Panahi: And then the sound of footsteps goes away, as if it starts getting further and further.  [Clip from It Was Just An Accident]

Panahi: So at some point, the audience can think that even the character of the interrogator could change.

The fact that the interrogator might have been moved, as little as it might be, is that point of hope and hopefulness that the cycle of violence could end at some point.

Rosin:  So that’s why you wanted to capture the humanity of the interrogator.

Panahi: These people like the interrogator may be very different people in their family settings. Their family members may not even know who they are and what kind of work they do. These people, to their family members, are fathers, they’re spouses, and they might look very different than what we see.

The problem is not with the individual. The problem is with the system, and it’s with the situation and the conditions.

If we put the blame on these little parts of a system, then we lose our way into understanding what the fault is actually and who is to blame and what is to blame.

Rosin: You have repeated that you are going back to Iran after award season, even though you’ve already been sentenced to a year in prison, even though you’ve been to prison before. Is that just because you can’t figure out how to live anywhere else or just don’t feel comfortable anywhere else?

Panahi: At the end of the day, I want to have the sense of living, and I know it’s in a certain place that I can have a sense of living. I could come here in the U.S. and make a commercial film and make a film that could make a lot of money. But then, when it’s me and myself in my solitude, I would ask myself if I am embarrassed by making that film.

This is not to say that commercial films are bad—not at all. The question is the calling of the director, and once a director makes up their mind, they have to be truthful to that decision.

I can easily say that, in my own solitude, I have not been regretting any of the films that I have made.

Rosin: This is a last question. This moment is so serious and dangerous around the world. Is there anything specific or even small that makes you feel like you’re living, as you said, or brings you joy that you hold on to?

Was your question only about what gives him joy, or was there another part to it?

Rosin: I hate that question, the joy question.

Rosin: Because he said “living,” I’m trying to pull out a thread of how he continues to pull through, you know what it is that he hangs on to, that has him—joy is a little much.

Dayani: Right, right, right, right, right.

Rosin: It’s not quite the right word. (Laughs.)

Dayani: No, but I got it. But this helps.

Panahi: Because I have made my choice about what type of filmmaker I want to be and who I want to be, I will find a way around it, no matter what.

I’m not a captive of moments or days, because I see a greater future. I see from above.

            <h2>The Epstein Emails Show How the Powerful Talk About Race</h2>
            <p><strong>The Atlantic | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/02/epstein-race-science-watson-pinker-chomsky-musk/685965/?utm_source=feed">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In February 2016, after exchanging email pleasantries with the left-wing public intellectual Noam Chomsky and extending an invitation to his private island, Jeffrey Epstein recommended an article. “On a different note, you have encouraged me to look at data, no holds barred,” Epstein wrote before linking to “Race and IQ: Genes That Predict Racial Intelligence Differences” from the Right Stuff, an openly white-supremacist website and a pioneer of the online alt-right. The article argued that different races have differing levels of intelligence and that there is a genetic basis for the disparity.

The exchange was included in the Department of Justice’s latest public release of the Epstein files and is one of the clearest examples of the disgraced financier’s interest in “race science,” the pseudoscientific practice of ascribing racial inequities to genetics. It is a way of thinking that has been refuted on multiple levels. IQ is a complex trait that results from a series of factors—many of them cultural and circumstantial—that are not neatly reduced to a specific gene or set of genes. Even if it weren’t, the consensus among geneticists, biologists, and anthropologists is that race isn’t a biological phenomenon. Race-science proponents tend to ignore all of this, as well as any other relevant context, and use correlations between race and IQ (and also things such as race and criminality) as evidence that racial stereotypes are in fact justified.

None of this mattered to Epstein, who recurrently expressed his interest in race science beyond this 2016 correspondence. The tranche of Epstein files also shows that in 2018, he repeatedly tried to get in contact with Charles Murray, a political scientist whose 1994 book, The Bell Curve, is one of the best-known texts to posit a relationship between intelligence and race. Epstein didn’t specify why he was trying to connect with Murray, but he claimed that they had met previously. (Murray told me over email that he had never received an email from Epstein and that it was possible that they’d met in passing at a conference reception at some point. If this ever happened, though, Murray had no memory of it, he said.)

Promoting contemptible perspectives on race is probably nowhere near the most depraved things Epstein did; he was, after all, a registered sex offender charged with child trafficking. But Epstein’s views are notable given his long-standing influence on some of the most powerful and influential Americans. His conversations from a decade ago provide clues as to how race science was picked out of the boneyard of history and reanimated into a force that’s influencing U.S. politics right now.

Epstein received Murray’s email address from his ideological fellow traveler James Watson, the late Nobel Prize–winning geneticist who was stripped of his titles in 2019 after he doubled down on comments he’d made to a British newspaper in 2007 about how he was “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa” because “all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours—whereas all the testing says not really.” He told the paper that he wished that all races were equal but that “people who have to deal with Black employees find this not true.”

Epstein liked to collect relationships with high-profile academics, but the emails suggest that he may have been drawn to Watson specifically because of his ideology. In his 2016 exchange with Chomsky, Epstein appears to endorse the perspective that improving the world “might require accepting some uncomfortable facts” about race and intelligence. Chomsky, who sustained his association with Epstein even after accusations that the financier had sexually abused children became well known, disagreed with Epstein on race science in their email exchange. (He did not respond to a request for comment.) Epstein references Watson in other emails, and he and Watson appear to have met several times.

The same year that Epstein tried to put Chomsky onto pseudoscientific racism, he was having similar discussions with Joscha Bach, an AI researcher. In one exchange, Bach told Epstein that Black children in the United States “have slower cognitive development” and “are slower at learning high-level concepts.” In another email to Epstein, Bach wrote that “given average brain size difference” between men and women, “the small difference in average IQ is surprising.”

Read: The far right is becoming obsessed with race and IQ

Bach appears to have since changed his mind. In a recent Substack post explaining his emails with Epstein, Bach claimed that he has never said “that people of different races have different cognitive abilities” and wrote that “every ethnic group contains highly capable individuals” and that no one “should be discriminated against because of their ancestry.” Over email, Bach further clarified to me that “the concept of race is not suitable to capture cognitive and behavioral differences between individuals.” He said that “scientific discussion about the heritability of traits can be important for the creation of a more fair and equitable society, it is important to understand the nature and limitations of our minds, but they are very complicated and not my area of research.”

Other names that pop up in Epstein’s emails: He reached out to Steven Pinker, a Harvard professor who has written about research that argues that Ashkenazi Jews are innately intelligent. (Pinker has disavowed Epstein and denied that he ever visited Little Saint James, Epstein’s island. He attended at least two events that Epstein was also present at. “I only had one conversation with him, and found him to be not only odious but intellectually deeply unserious, despite the praise from so many of my colleagues, and his own pretensions,” Pinker told me over email. He also said that he doesn’t believe that there is “good evidence that average racial or ethnic differences have a genetic component.”) Epstein also tried to meet with Richard Dawkins, who has made comments claiming that race is a biological reality; Dawkins did not respond to a request for comment.

In the past several years, race science has gained traction on the right and in parts of Silicon Valley’s elite circles. Elon Musk, for example, has repeatedly replied to the @cremieuxrecueil account, run by Jordan Lasker, an independent researcher who has been credited by a right-wing publication for tracing “the genetic pathways of crime, explaining why poverty is not a good causal explanation.” Musk has also engaged with an account that posted statistics supposedly illustrating the inferiority of Black people. In November, The Guardian reported that perspectives defending race science were embedded in Musk’s Wikipedia competitor, Grokipedia. Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment.

Read: Elon Musk updated Grok. Guess what it said?

In 2023 and 2024, respectively, Charlie Kirk and Tucker Carlson interviewed Steve Sailer, a prominent race-science proponent. President Trump—who once considered Epstein a close friend and is referenced in many emails—has toyed around with the concept for years. In a November 2024 interview with the right-wing radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump said that some of the migrants coming across the southern border were genetically inferior. “How about allowing people to come to an open border, 13,000 of whom were murderers? Many of them murdered far more than one person, and they’re now happily living in the United States,” Trump told Hewitt, citing an incorrect number. “You know, now a murderer—I believe this—it’s in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now.” When I reached out to the White House, the spokesperson Abigail Jackson told me in an emailed statement that “President Trump is right—dangerous criminal illegal aliens exploited Joe Biden’s open border and flooded our country.”

Read: Donald Trump flirts with race science

Meanwhile, Trump’s deportation campaign appears to target people from countries and cultures that he seems to think are inferior. During a Cabinet meeting in December, Trump said of Somalis, “I don’t want them in our country, I’ll be honest with you,” adding that the U.S. will “go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.” He said this while the Department of Homeland Security was targeting Somalis in Minnesota.

Arguing that intelligence and adjacent traits are biologically determined served a clear function for a man like Epstein, who treated women as disposable and subordinate. And it’s equally unsurprising that the powerful people with whom he cultivated relationships might attempt to come up with a natural, objective explanation and rationale for their perch at the top of society.</div>

Why does it prefer agreeable text to facts?

BECAUSE LLMS DON&#39;T KNOW FACTS, you fucking twit.

The behavior, known in the research community as sycophancy, stems from how these models are trained: reinforcement learning from human feedback, or RLHF, rewards responses that human evaluators prefer, and humans consistently rate agreeable answers higher than accurate ones.No, it&#39;s because in the training corpus most of the responses to &quot;are you sure&quot; that anyone bothered to record will involve someone being corrected.

Then it will argue with you constantly and tell you you&#39;re always wrong.

LLM has learned its math and knows that changing the answer will yield a better proability.

Now go try to persuade the show host that your wife knows better.

No, coal if the orange climate denier has anything to do with it. Trump has ordered the pentagon to buy more coal-fired electricity [nytimes.com], one of his biggest and most persistent lies is that climate change is a hoax.

It doesn&#39;t matter, because this is just another advertisement campaign.

I&#39;d like to know how are they going to evaluate the cost difference. Perhaps Claude will give us the estimates?

I was just going to post &quot;oh yeah?...with WHO&#39;S money??!&quot; Good job calling them out ðY&#39;

Does it matter? Facebook made $60bn net last year (including another year of insane double digit billions of losses on the metaverse). The AI funding Jenga block doesn&#39;t impact these tech companies.  They literally aren&#39;t held to account for spending a measly little sub $30bn figure. They&#39;ll just move on to wasting money on The Next Thing (tm)

What I got from this is that they intend to have a 2000+ acre data center and ~500 people running it.  That could be 10000s of servers each person

which is probably reasonable for a hyper-scaler deployment a company like Meta would consider.  Most of the hardware is pretty reliable. Everything running on it will be highly fault tolerant. If anything goes wrong nobody local does any actual fix, they pull replacement unit out of stock, swap it, and it boots from SAN and rejoins the hive..

The failed unit is either shipped to some central recovery facility or maybe directly the recycler.

This is what state and local pols NEED to understand about these data center projects, once the construction phase is over they don&#39;t mean that many jobs even in the context of a rural county. So they need to be really really careful about any tax abatement schemes etc. You are not going to see a bunch of new housing demand, new economic activity, payroll taxes etc. Just existing residents angry about noise, and their wells drying up.

COLLECT THE PROPERTY TAXES or deny the permits.

Several states are actively trying to slow it down as the tax abatements are around as much as the economic development value, with low job counts. Never a problem though, some state will always go for the gold. From the article, &quot;Hyperscaler developers are increasingly moving from more concentrated markets where opposition has strengthened to &quot;second- or third-tier&quot; states that can offer generation capacity, such as Kentucky or Indiana, where M

From the eye-in-the-sky view of this, it looks like Meta knows there&#39;s a pretty big risk of either low or no return on investment with this new datacenter. They want it built, but they don&#39;t know that the whole purpose for it won&#39;t blow-up or disappear in the time it takes to be built. Therefore, they want a holding company to own the majority share of the datacenter, so if it ends up being a financial blunder, they only take 20% of the blame, rather than 100%. It looks from here like a typical corporate structure shell game: hiding assets within &quot;other companies&quot; that are actually outright controlled by the parent, but on paper look like separate entities is a game as old as the concept of corporations itself. Sucks that even an auditor is too scared of the financial giant to say outright that it&#39;s bullshit both legally and ethically.

Is Meta responsible for paying off the bondholders if the project fails? That would seem to be the relevant issue. I am guessing that Meta has committed to purchase services sufficient to pay off the bondholders, but doesn&#39;t want that to appear as an obligation on their balance sheet. In that case, they are trying to fool investors and creditors.

If it requires effort to be parsed and understood, it&#39;s not a good headline. Are native English speakers finding it easy to understand? What even is a hacking tool boss?

It&#39;s not too bad, but it is a little structurally ambiguous. &quot;...Sold Exploits To Russian Broker That Could Target Millions of Devices....&quot; That might mean the Russian broker could target millions of devices, or it might mean that the tool could target millions of devices. And is the broker a Russion person, or does he sell Russian people?

But some headlines are actually hilarious, though. Like these.  [upenn.edu] Hard to pick a favorite, but I do like these:

And what Cellebrite does is ok because they are selling to the US?Or because they didn&#39;t steal from the US?

Who takes that sort of risk for only $1.3 million?

It&#39;s treason if you haven&#39;t gotten permission from the Don. There are rules and a hierarchy in organizes crime.

Wait, so it was OK when only the US had backdoor access to millions of computers and devices?

When morally upright people with some technical competence discover an exploit that can be used as a backdoor, they report it to the vendor so it can be fixed.  They don&#39;t report it on public media, so the vendor has time to fix it before criminals learn about it, thus protecting everyone who is already using the software.  And, in turn, the morally upright and competent software vendor actually prioritizes it for a speedy fix, and does not have the reporter arrested and charged with criminal hacking.

What about the guy he framed for the theft and took away his livelihood and reputation ...personally?

Did they make sure he would receive compensation?

...the next time any Government spokesperson tells us that back-doors to cryptography are perfectly safe as only law-enforcement will have them?

He ruined the life of an innocent personHe betrayed his countrymen for moneyHe compromised security for everyone

Nothing you can&#39;t fix by building 8-10 more datacenters and dumping in them 4 or 5 more &quot;agentic expert&quot; models to loop over each others&#39; &quot;reasoning&quot; per request.

It&#39;s actually kind of impressive that they are holding out and not shipping something that doesn&#39;t work.  Shipping non-functional hype is the industry standard.  We&#39;ll ignore that Siri sort of already doesn&#39;t work.  They are refusing to make it worse.

one cannot expect our incompetent upper class overlords to produce anything but even more overpriced and unimaginative technology, let&#39;s not forget the goal is not to produce good tech but to extract the most revenue in order to increase shareholder value

our devices and our services are designed to exploit us, manipulate us and surveil us, welcome to our classist corporatocracy

If phone interfaces (And windows 11) were designed by professional interface designers instead of as an afterthought by programmers then we wouldn&#39;t have to search to find functionality, it would be obvious where it is.

They wouldn&#39;t even need to bother with building a good AI. Create a MCP server that has access to all important functions of the phone and other apps can provide the AI that does these things. But they don&#39;t want to let other apps access these things.

Actually, now that I think about it... I kind of expected this.

That said, good on Apple for delaying. If/when they release, it needs to be really good - much better than anyone elses *on the phone*. As noted elsewhere, if you ask it to alter a setting which is deep in a spaghetti of menus, then it needs to do it right first time. It needs to be at least as good as the others for the inevitable stupid questions people will ask when testing it out too, I guess.

If Apple release a half-baked product, people really lose their gussets over it. Cont

... just focus on fixing the issues like bugs. Way too many problems. V26 is awful. Also, please stop doing new major versions every year. Why not slow down and take the time?

Seconded.  There are so many things that need refactored in macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and other *OS items.  Not to mention iCloud.

Even something as basic as Time Machine needs help.  Ideally, have the ability for iCloud to handle S3, and Time Machine able to do deduplicating S3 backups similar to Restic or Duplicacy.  Duplicacy has some nice things, including public key encryption of data, so machines can back up and deduplicate, but not read the data.

Then comes other items.  Macs need something like BootCamp so

&quot;Macs need something like BootCamp so they can be used for Linux.&quot;

Just release the full hardware specifications so Linux doesn&#39;t have to reverse engineer everything.

The good news (which may now be obsolete) is that OS 27 was supposed to be a clean-up and bug-fix version. But now that is suddenly the great AI savior introduction. Can they fix more bugs than the AI will generate?

The problem isn&#39;t superbugs.  It doesn&#39;t need the ability to innovate.  It just has to enable a complete idiot to do something they couldn&#39;t figure out on their own.  There are plenty of scientifically trivial things that are very dangerous in the wrong hands.  I also don&#39;t think censorship is the answer, yet that is also not quite what this is.

But don&#39;t worry, there is an important role for the plebes, too.

I don&#39;t have a good idea as to what has caused it, but look at any TV debate up to sometime around the 1980s and you are likely to find a logical discussion, with little tolerance for lies, exaggeration, or logical error. That seems to have gone now.

Scientists might show that we are in trouble, and the result is that the most powerful deride the scientists, and most voters are incapable of the thought required to arrive at an informed opinion.

Politics and social debate need to fundamentally change.

If it isn&#39;t tech, it is nation-states with their psy-ops teams wanting a media platform to push their agendas or outright do falsehoods.

The problem is that due to their self-inflicted wounds, journalism is gone, and there is zero trust in the press.  This allows almost anyone to come in, assert almost anything, just because there is no need for them to have to prove otherwise, and there is no penalty for lying, such as blaming the trash piles in NYC on &quot;socialism&quot;.

Hey...that&#39;s the combination to my luggage!!!

It&#39;s pretty much a trope that coffee has been bad for us one week and then good for us again the next week, ad infinitum. Scientists are not the ones telling you this. The people telling you this are the same ones that inject themselves into every conversation and try to convince you to buy things you don&#39;t need.

I partly agree. It&#39;s also a bunch of &quot;journalists&quot; who will write anything for views, including anything they don&#39;t understand themselves. Things like looking at a summary of one scientific article, misunderstanding it, and ignoring all other science on the same topic. This kind of nonsense already existed in the old media landscape, but it was a minority of content, at least where I lived. Nowadays the suggestion algorithms of a few social media companies decide how much of that content people will see.

It&#39;s pretty much a trope that coffee has been bad for us one week and then good for us again the next week, ad infinitum.

It would be very amusing to see the world through your eyes.

How exactly do you think science works?  Do you think that someone asks a question, and then scientists all get together in a single meeting to answer that question, and then they post the answer and claim it is the full and unquestionable truth?

No, that would be ridiculous.  Instead, science is performed by millions of individual scientists, who each seek to understand some particular aspect of reality just a little bit better.  They perform discovery, form a hypothesis, test the hypothesis, and then publish their results for the world to review.

There is no illuminati-style organization that coordinates all of the scientists, and their findings, together.  Thus, one thousand different studies about various effects of coffee upon human health might be performed, and they might all study slightly different aspects of the topic, or test things in different ways.  This in no way implies that the scientific method is flawed, or that &quot;scientists&quot; are just a bunch of goofy mind-changers who can never quite figure out which way is up when it comes to figuring out what science actually means.

This is to be expected for something as complex as science, unless you have an extraordinarily simple mind.

None of that changes the parents point of view.  The issues is that journalists have been wildly irresponsible for a long time, and the scientist doing the interviews let them get away with it because the probably thought it meant more grant money in the next round.

For decades we went round and round on things like eggs and coffee and every last one of those articles that ran in the Sunday paper would have had a line like &quot;scientists now believe two or three cups of coffee a day will keep your heat healt

The predictions of science led to every single thing about whatever device you&#39;re typing this drivel on.  They led to the microwave you nuked your dinner in and likely to most of the food you put in there. They also led to whatever lifesaving treatments have kept you from dying from any of the numerous ailments that left most families with at least one dead child until very recently.  They&#39;re why you don&#39;t have smallpox and never will.

Absent the predictions of science, you live in a hut farming the same land your great grandfather did for the same wealthy landowner.  Just exactly how did the predictions of science &quot;not live up to the hype&quot;?

Yeah, because Ronnie Raygun didn&#39;t make up a bunch of BS about welfare queens that years later turned out to be BS. Nevermind the back door comms to Iran to get the hostages held until he secured the Presendency ... etc.

The 80s are not the bastion of good behavior and one can&#39;t have an honest conversation when folks lie and hide things.

One thing the science does tell us is that we all have a very hard time separating the world that existed when we were children from our perception of that world through the eyes of a child.

Ask nearly any population in the United States when this country was best and you&#39;ll get a majority who&#39;ll swear to you it was when they were teenagers.

Actually it is a smart move, and the guy is spot on on security, there is none of it in the &quot;AI&quot;.

The &quot;architecture&quot; of the claude and the whole &quot;AI&quot; crap is beyond ridiculous.

You have a stateless &quot;AI&quot; produce unsafe code that nobody checks, then you feed the descriptors of that code fed to the &quot;AI&quot; at every request so that it can re-learn what it did and call some other process to run that very code. Or some similar code. Or some code that has that descriptor. Or something.

And 99.9% of the people who do that need the &quot;vibe&quot; coding because they can&#39;t be bothered to understand the output. No, wait for it, they don&#39;t even understand the flow.

While that&#39;s obviously accurate, the way the argument frames his points makes it sound like Anthropic are preventing them putting in protections against people using AI to spontaneously generate viral weapons that can be used to target specific populations.

Every single part of that explanation, including the unstated premises, is narrative made with the assumption that those things are functionally possible and just a matter of time... Including but not limited to implicit computational chemistry, genetical

Over a billion dollars was spent on a persistent global scare mongering / PR blitz of utter bullshit that ultimately amounted to absolutely nothing.  Subsequently enough people have used and or been subjected to AI.  According to public polling vast majority now find it mildly useful while being largely annoyed by the nonsense and zero effort slop.

The problem is that while most engineers and scientists could do tremendous damage, they are also smart enough to not want to. The problem with LLM type AI is not that it can enable any new attacks or anything creative or the like. The problem is that it may put things that are well-known to experts in the hands of idiots and extremists who would not be able to do anything that damaging otherwise. And there are a lot extremists around and a lot of idiots that cannot even do basic fact checking and believe t

In January, Florida Rep. Randy Fine made a typically bigoted post on X about his colleague in the House of Representatives, Ilhan Omar. The post was in conversation with a specious right-wing conspiracy alleging that Omar’s net worth had increased, nefariously, through a variety of unspecified means—perhaps cryptically linked back to her Somali heritage. Fine asserted that to “solve all this,” Omar ought to be “denaturalized and deported.” The ugliness of the comment prompted Rick Wilson—former Republican strategist, he of the magnanimous Lincoln Project—to step forward. In earlier eras of discourse, the Lincoln Project attempted to coalesce an anti-Trump movement by appealing to our better angels; brandishing Sorkin-ish platitudes about the Soul of America. (There is a reason the organization name-checks the 16th president.) But Wilson took a much different approach here. Rather than addressing the content of Fine’s character, Wilson homed in on something else: The congressman is very, very fat.

“Hunting you with harpoons and whaleboats would solve all this,” said Wilson, parroting Fine’s diction. Among the responses threaded below Wilson’s retort, one is an edit of promotional materials for a 2011 television adaptation of Moby-Dick. In it, Fine has been photoshopped in place of the whale.

It goes without saying that for a very long time, fat-shaming a politician was previously verboten in the liberal playbook. I also do not possess the wherewithal to cast judgement on whether Fine—who has expressed some genuinely bloodthirsty sentiments about Palestinians—deserves to be bullied in such a way. But what I can say is that, right now, we are in the midst of a marked pivot in the way the Democratic Party interfaces with its opposition. The shift in attitude hasn’t been firmly diagrammed; instead, what’s going on here is mostly subconscious, like a collective unlocking of forbidden territory. There was a period of time in the late 2010s where liberal hostility toward MAGAdom was screened for all potential vectors of transgression, and a seemingly infinite number of potential -isms or -phobias. The philosophy was well-intentioned, but it also solidified the Democrats as the party of pedants (or narcs, or nerds, or rule-followers). Now in the wreckage of the post-Biden era, some liberals have started to alter their approach. If sweeping appeals to our collective empathy have failed to resonate—if the public is not moved by Randy Fine’s intersectional shortcomings—maybe we are better off getting down in the muck.

There is no perfect name for this dynamic, but some have begun to refer to it, somewhat facetiously, as “Dark Woke.” In the most basic definition, Dark Woke is a social covenant that allows for liberals to be extra mean to conservatives, by encouraging a style of animus that deliberately crosses the red lines previously established within the progressive orthodoxy. The concept is difficult to articulate, but it’s easily felt. Dark Woke manifests when the liberal pundit Kyle Kulinski tweets out an A.I. rendering of Erika Kirk and J.D. Vance standing side by side at a wedding altar, or when the Democratic Party’s X account accuses Stephen Miller of being cuckolded by Elon Musk, or when Pete Hegseth is dressed down for being a drunk. You can sense it manifesting into corporeal space when Virginia Attorney General Jay Jones crushes the field after fantasizing about the death of MAGA-born children, or when Graham Platner—the guy with the Nazi tattoo—remains competitive for Maine’s Senate seat despite his generational baggage. With the midterms growing nearer, it’s becoming clear that some forces within the Democratic apparatus are betting that Dark Woke can be wielded as an effective electoral strategy. One of the lessons of the current political environment is that Americans crave authenticity. Maybe the only way to consummate that desire is by hitting below the belt.

Dark Woke has only been in the bloodstream for a short amount of time. It initially entered the lexicon in the early weeks of 2025, when both the Democratic Party and any sense of American consensus had been shattered by Donald Trump’s comeback victory. Nobody is exactly sure who originally coined the term, but ground zero, according to the internet historians at KnowYourMeme, might be a post made by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez one day before the inauguration. Ocasio-Cortez was replying to LibsofTikTok, a popular X account and one of the more prominent agitators in the MAGA propaganda ecosystem. LibsofTikTok took issue with AOC referring to Trump as a rapist; the congresswoman responded by mimicking the brusque diction of the right. “Oh are you triggered? Cry more,” she wrote, accumulating 17.6 million views in the process.

The candor was refreshing in those confusing times, so much so that one day later, another poster on X theorized that she might have inculcated a new social contract—a “proto Dark Woke”—that liberals could take with them going forward. The poster surmised the texture of the reinvention by positing an instructive question: “Who will the first Democrat to call Republicans retarded be?”

Thus, the Dark Woke thesis was born: Democrats need to open up new persuasive terrain, and by and large, that terrain needs to be unshackled by circumspect language temperance—call it Woke Classic—than ever before. In a way, this conclusion conceded the postelection conclusion of a conservative cultural victory. If the arc of history is indeed tilting rightward, then Dark Woke acknowledges that the Democratic brand had grown too uptight, which must be rectified with a kind of reverse virtue signaling. (It is telling, for instance, that in the weeks before her clapback, Ocasio-Cortez removed the “She/Her” pronouns from her Twitter bio.) Naturally, a number of strivers were early adopters of this brewing vibe shift, branding themselves as heralds for this intrepid age of offense. Chief among those interlopers was Rep. Jasmine Crockett, who is currently running for a Texas Senate seat, and who came to national fame after referring to former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as a “bleach-blonde, bad-built, butch body,” and, later on, the wheelchair-using Gov. Greg Abbott as “Governor Hot Wheels.” Meanwhile, presidential hopeful Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is eternally pliable to whichever way the wind is blowing, popularized California’s redistricting campaign with a Trump-affected shitposting parody. (Newsom has never called Trump the R-word, but he’s easily the odds-on favorite.)

As Dark Woke gained fluency, most pundits concluded that the trend would never amount to anything other than a temper tantrum. “Dark Woke is cringe,” offered New York magazine. “Dark Woke will not work for Democrats,” added the National Review. The fundamentals of the argument were rock solid. For one, Dark Woke is a movement that exists almost entirely online, and it resonates most with highly engaged Democrats rather than with mercurial swing voters who are mostly concerned about the price of eggs. Second, no matter whatever else you say about them, figures like Donald Trump and Stephen Miller are bona fide outsiders. They can claim the mantle of the firebrand, which is forever out of reach for an institutional figure like Newsom.

With all that said, I have been surprised to see certain Dark Woke principles diffuse into the rank-and-file Democratic voting population. The base appears to be demonstrably more bloodthirsty than it ever was during Trump’s first term, almost like they’ve finally been granted an opportunity to satiate a long-unquenched rage, absent any platitudinal hedging. I am reminded of a video that went viral shortly before the November elections, in which a typical MAGA grievance aggregator interviewed a woman holding a cardboard sign at one of those “No Kings” protests. The interviewer is pushing her on the assassination of Charlie Kirk, seeking empathy for the recently departed podcaster. The woman, of course, gives no quarter.

“He was horrible. I’m glad he’s not here,” she said. “He was horrible on the campuses. A horrible person.” The interviewer, taken aback, asked if she’d be happy if the interviewer were assassinated, too.

“Maybe, I’d have to think about it,” she replied.

What was it that Michelle Obama said during Hillary Clinton’s coronation? “When they go low, we go high.” Voicing a sentiment like that today might get you booed out of the building. And yet, it needs to be acknowledged that according to MAGA media enterprises, liberal discourse has long been vulgar and hateful. Given the chance, the thinking went, they’d round up all of us “America First” patriots in a Soviet-style purge.

The right’s narrative of a bloodthirsty Democratic Party was, well, at odds with party voters’ 2020 decision to bypass a host of progressive options in favor of the rigidly moderate Joe Biden. But the right isn’t wrong about the long-standing loathing of Trump and everything he represents. I mean, one of the first controversies that surfaced after Trump’s initial ascension in 2016 centered around a photo shoot starring Kathy Griffin. She was posing with a prop of the president’s severed head.

But if you asked me why the Dark Woke opposition during Trump’s second term feels different, I’d assert that, while opposition to Trump during his first term was intense, it was also championed by a murderers’ row of grifters and mediocrities; Michael Avenatti, Andrew Cuomo, the Krassenstein brothers, and those same Lincoln Project guys. Ultimately, the loudest of those voices wielded anti-Trump advocacy as a vehicle for their own enrichment, buttressing presidential campaigns, podcast networks, and thrice-weekly Substacks. It worked, Trump did lose in 2020, but the #Resistance was left with a distinct careerist sheen—buoyed by discretionary restraint—lacking the organic force of, say, a soul-buckling fat joke. As The Outline saliently noted in 2019, this disposition seemed to suggest a holier-than-thou elitism. Calling the president a Cheeto was fine, but making fun of Charlie Kirk was not.

But the means of engagement have been altered, maybe permanently, in the tumult of this current political armageddon. MAGAdom is the party in power; naturally, their opponents are choosing to meet them on the battlefield of their choosing. With that said, I do think some surprising sensitivities within the conservative doctrine have come into view, as the movement sublimates into the uncomfortable posture of the establishment. This was most clear during Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s occupation of Minnesota, after masked agents killed Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Among the many faulty narratives that orbited out of the government, one asked us to consider the mental anguish suffered by these dispatched officers. J.D. Vance himself wondered if his roving band of goons would “feel safe” during the aftermath of those murders. Put on the defensive, Vance and his contemporaries have occasionally fallen back on the diction of the soft, snowflake liberalism they claim to hate. But in an ironic twist, the right has already provided the perfect blueprint to nullify shrill emotional terrorism. To quote AOC, “Cry more.”

Of course, this gets us back to the central anxiety of the moment. Is Dark Woke good? For the soul? For the body? For the future? I was socialized in the crucible of millennial progressivism. I have long believed that it is unkind to make fun of someone for their weight, that I should prune the slurs out of my lexicon, that I should refrain from laughing at the misfortune of those who have recently met a tragic end. Dark Woke asks us to make special exceptions for the aberrant forces in our midst—to bully insecurities, to express our anger viscerally—because their sins are great enough to eclipse the worst things any of us can say about them. After all, it is difficult to conflate language with violence when the violence itself has become so plainly visible. It remains to be seen if Dark Woke can grow potent enough to outweigh the sun-blotting forces of Dark MAGA, or if fickle centrists find all of this liberal rage more alienating than relatable. But I—and millions of other Americans—do know what it feels like to be alive in 2026. I never want to go high ever again.

After months of watching federal agents terrorize communities all across the country in the name of immigration enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security’s top brass sat before Congress on Tuesday to answer questions about the deaths of Renée Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, the detention of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos, and the fates of countless others who have been caught in the crosshairs of the president’s mass deportation effort. Though Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, mostly deflected any responsibility and insisted that the agency conducts only targeted arrests, Democrats came prepared with receipts to remind us all just how blatantly racist and out of control the White House’s immigration agenda has been.

“You are only here because public outrage has become so unavoidable,” Rep. LaMonica McIver, of New Jersey, said during the House Homeland Security Committee’s oversight hearing. McIver is being prosecuted by the Trump administration over an incident in New Jersey when she was barred from entering a detention facility. “You are here, Mr. Lyons, because white people are getting shot in the face and chest when the cameras are rolling.”

Lyons remained straight-faced, offering no explanation for his agents’ extreme use of force or denial about his agents’ racial profiling of Americans. That profiling is something the Supreme Court essentially endorsed last year, after the justices issued a decision allowing the federal government to stop Hispanic migrants based on their “apparent ethnicity,” as well as other factors, like if they have an accent or work certain types of jobs. This, predictably, has led ICE to overwhelmingly target Black and brown Americans with excessive force.

Indeed, this was one of the main subtexts of the hearing. New Jersey Rep. Nellie Pou, for example, asked, “Mr. Lyons, I speak Spanish. If I wasn’t wearing my member pin, would me being a Latina and speaking Spanish be enough for ICE agents to harass me or shove me into one of your unmarked cars?”

Lyons answered no, but as Pou and other Democratic representatives pointed out, this has not been borne out by the reality on the ground; even off-duty officers have recently been profiled by ICE. When Rep. Troy Carter, of Louisiana, directly asked Lyons if his agency was arresting or deporting Americans, Lyons denied that it was “arresting” Americans, before quickly adding that it did “detain” Americans. As Carter pointed out, this was a distinction without a difference.

When it came to the way agents currently present themselves to Americans, New York Rep. Tim Kennedy asked whether Lyons would instruct his agents to no longer wear masks and institute a uniform that includes visible identification—one of 10 demands congressional Democrats are requesting in the ongoing negotiations over whether to fund DHS beyond Saturday’s deadline. Lyons immediately retorted, “No.”

And when Rep. Eric Swalwell, of California, asked Lyons if he would apologize for his department calling Good and Pretti “domestic terrorists,” he refused. Lyons also insisted that when his agents arrested Ramos as he made his way home from preschool with his father, “the men and women of ICE took care of him.” Later in the hearing, Lyons also claimed that agents played the boy’s favorite song and got him McDonald’s. Meanwhile, it took the intervention of Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro for a visibly unwell Ramos to be released from detention. The administration immediately tried to detain him again.

This was just one of many moments when administration officials offered what felt like a completely different reality from what people on the ground are experiencing with ICE officers.

Rep. Seth Magaziner, of Rhode Island, brought up the case of federal agents in Chicago, who pepper-sprayed a 1-year-old as she sat in the back seat of her father’s car. “Is it proper procedure to aim pepper spray into the window of a moving vehicle?” Magaziner asked Rodney Scott, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, who also testified. “We try to avoid that,” he said.

Magaziner continued to push. “Were any of your agents investigated or disciplined for this?”

“I’ll have to get back to you,” Scott said.

Magaziner then showed a video and zoomed-in photo of an agent firing pepper spray directly into the face of a protester who was pinned to the ground by multiple agents and asked if this was proper procedure for the use of pepper spray. “I cannot respond to that because you’re only showing one piece, and that subject is clearly not compliant,” Scott said, while refusing to confirm whether there was an open investigation into those agents.

“Your agency has been repeatedly caught on tape using violence against civilians, and you can’t even tell me if any of these agents have been investigated or disciplined,” Magaziner said. “You are supposed to be making people safer, and instead your agents are being unnecessarily violent.”

Tuesday’s hearing was the first time ICE leadership has testified before Congress under the second Trump administration, as the White House agreed to the testimony in a clear attempt to contain the fallout from Good’s and Pretti’s deaths. Though it will not immediately solve the current chaos being wreaked by the president and his mass deportation mastermind Stephen Miller, the hearing did serve as a cathartic moment of rage. For a brief period of time, Democrats accurately embodied the feelings of Americans all across the country who are facing ICE in their communities with no real defense.

“Sorry, I don’t mean to interrupt you guys.” The man crunches his way toward us, through this snow-covered field and past rows upon rows of identical wooden tombstones, then gestures back in the direction he came from. “I wanted to make sure you’re aware that there’s ICE right there.”

This is how it happens, I was told the day before. Immigration and Customs Enforcement moves fast in Minneapolis, the way you have to when an entire city is against you. Volunteers call in license plates to volunteers who check those plates against databases created by other volunteers. Once identified, these agents have minutes at best before residents with whistles and horns and furious loud voices gather to alert their neighbors to the threat in their midst. If you’re more than five minutes away from a sighting, odds are you’ll be too late. No, the best way to find ICE in Minneapolis is to stay in one place. Go about your day. Eventually, you’ll see them.

I am standing with two Minneapolis residents who go by Tim and Star, looking out at the Say Their Names memorial. The art installation consists of over 100 tombstones, each with identical black fists and names I remember from 2020. Philando Castile.* Ahmaud Arbery. And, of course, George Floyd, who took his final breath two blocks south of here. Minneapolis is no stranger to tragedy, or to the white-hot spotlight of international media attention, or to banding together in the face of a crisis.

“In some ways, it primed the pump,” Tim told me, referring to the George Floyd protests in the summer of 2020. Like everyone I spoke to, Tim and Star ascribe Minneapolis’ successful mobilization to lessons learned during that time.

“We have a lot of media coming in and asking, ‘Oh, what’s your organization? Who are you with?’ And it’s like, we don’t have an organization. We’re not with anyone,” Star told me.

“We’re just neighbors. That’s how we know each other,” Tim confirmed. “We live here.”

Star nodded. “ One of the things that I’m not sure that people are realizing outside of Minneapolis: The headlines say that Alex Pretti was a protester,” they say. “He wasn’t at a protest. He wasn’t at—”

And then we turned to watch the man approaching us through the snow—the man now telling us ICE has pulled up by an apartment building across the field. “We’ve got the block, we’re situated,” he says. “I just want to make sure—in case anybody’s targetable or something like that.”

None of us are targetable. Tim and Star want to help, and I want to see the action.

Just as roadkill summons vultures, so too does human misery summon journalists, who travel across the country to shove cameras and recorders at people enduring things no one should experience. People in Minneapolis broadly understand that documentation is important, that the world needs to know what’s happening, that journalists can help spread the word. But the line between journalism and pornography grows vanishingly thin at times like these. Newsworthy tales of ICE atrocities can easily become violent entertainment for a ravenous national audience; action-movie sequences carried out by caricatures, grief and trauma commodified for mass consumption.

Star offers me a 3D-printed orange whistle and I open my mouth to say that as a journalist I can’t participate—but the words won’t come out. A sudden vision of myself in the future, talking to grand-nieces and -nephews: Yes, I had a chance to warn people about the secret police coming to abduct them, disappear them, or release them into this dangerous cold without a coat or cell phone, but journalistic ethics, you see …

At last, the cars arrive. The bearded man gives us a count: One, two, three …

The noise is deafening: Horns blare, whistles pierce the piercing cold. “ICE OUT!” the residents chant, over and over again. “We are all Minneapolis!” someone shouts. “We are all Minnesota! We are all the motherfucking United States of America!”

The world might breathe a sigh of relief, but Minneapolis can’t afford it. ICE is here, and ICE has killed, and ICE may kill again. Here the city stands: residents with whistles standing against men with guns and flak vests.

The ICE SUV stays put despite the unrelenting noise and a neighborhood now on high alert. I start shivering five minutes in; the man in sweatpants and Crocs appears unbothered. There are over 30 people here now; residents have heeded the call or arrived from rapid-response patrol. A white Toyota stops between the crowd and the SUV and a man with a mustache leans out the passenger window with a camera: no words, no eye contact, just the indifferent glassy eye of a zoom lens and fingers to focus it on people as they do something others have died doing.

Someone has brought a megaphone; residents take turns leading chants. “My grandmother was a sharecropper in Arkansas, and I know that this is the same thing,” a man shouts at one point as whistles shrill and a handheld siren wails. “The same fight that my people fought, the same fight that my grandma fought, is the same fight that we are fighting to protect our undocumented migrant neighbors!”

ICE-watch reports more agents incoming, but the crowd has only grown and no one is going anywhere. Five minutes becomes 10, 10 becomes 15. “All right folks, we’re going to sing ‘We are not afraid!’ ” someone shouts into the megaphone, and so they do; not shouting or chanting but singing, in tune and with one voice:

We are not afraid We are not afraid We are not afraid today

Oh, deep in my heart I do believe That we are not afraid today

And then, to the sound of sporadic laughter, the amplified voice sings a slightly altered version:

ICE will leave ICE will leave Oh, deep in my heart I do believe ICE will leave RIGHT THE FUCK NOW! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MINNEAPOLIS! THIS IS OUR FUCKING STREET!

Laughter and cheers and the handheld siren wails and the man with the megaphone keeps shouting: “The people are not with you! The people are with us! And they want you to get the fuck out of our city!”

A few minutes later, the SUV lurches forward, then drives slowly down the street. The residents cheer and taunt and follow from a safe distance. Whatever the bastards had planned for the apartment complex will have to wait for another day. “That’s the most exciting laundry I’ve ever done,” a man with a gray beard says dryly, then walks back into everyday life, to the extent that everyday life is possible anymore.

Why do people continue to push back, knowing what it might mean? It’s the question I’m here to ask, and so I approach two people and ask it. “ I’d love to know what inspires you to come out here, knowing that people have been killed doing this shit. You can also tell me to fuck off.”

The resident studies me for several seconds. “I’m not going to tell you to fuck off,” she says at last. “But I don’t think I want to answer.”

“It feels like the only way through it is through it,” Tim says when I ask him the same question a few minutes later. “Some of this is—it’s happening to us. And it’s a choice to stand up, but—” He pauses. “We don’t have a lot of options.”

The day before this standoff on 37th and Columbus, I spent all day in a rapid-response chat with dozens of volunteers: people who had to excuse themselves to pick up kids from school, people on their way home willing to spare an hour to keep their community safe. The tone was matter-of-fact, direct, resolute, but moments of fear crept in. I could hear it in the voice of a woman who reported an ICE agent getting out of his car, and in two watchers who declined to follow an agent who drove “aggressively” toward them in his car. “Stay safe,” they told each other by way of goodbye, with the kind of intensity reserved for people who understand that might not be possible.

Later that night, I went to a “Hotel Wide-Awake” demonstration outside the four-star Hilton in downtown Minneapolis where ICE has rented a block of rooms. Hundreds of protesters stood outside in subzero temperatures and made as much noise as possible—banging pots, blowing whistles, drumming on buckets, blowing trombones and trumpets. Police in riot gear stood menacingly in front of the hotel, then eventually dispersed the protest by force around 10 p.m.

“I’m not as afraid as I thought I would be,” a woman who goes by L told me at the Hilton Wide-Awake. She wore a backpack with a piece of paper taped to the back that said “Free Supplies”: first aid, handwarmers, earplugs. “I guess I just feel like I can take it, so I want to put myself as a body here. They can’t hurt all of us if it’s really big, and there are a lot of people who can’t necessarily be out here or don’t want to take the risk. But because I feel like I can accept that risk, I have to.”

In three days, I will drive out of Minneapolis and back to my home in New York City. Tim, and Star, and the man with the beard, and the woman who did not want to answer—these people are already home. No one asked them if they wanted to be on the front lines of the fight against ICE. They did not volunteer for this assignment. The assignment came to them.

“I wish I had the answer for why are we doing it,” Star says. “It’s an act of service. I don’t know. And it’s—so you can’t save everybody, right? And you maybe can’t even save anybody. Like maybe all we do is frustrate. You know, give someone one more day with their daughter or their dad. But if you lost your dad, or you lost your daughter, you would give anything to have one more day with them. And that’s what we can do.”

            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/12/musk_xai_departures/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Elon Musk has framed the recent exodus of talent from his artificial intelligence startup, xAI, as a necessary growing pain, saying the company&#39;s evolution &quot;required parting ways with some people.&quot;

Musk&#39;s post on X (formerly Twitter) followed an all-hands meeting at xAI where he told the audience: &quot;We&#39;re actually going to have a mass driver on the Moon,&quot; although he acknowledged that such a thing was currently in the realm of science fiction.

A mass driver is best thought of as an electromagnetic catapult that flings payloads into space at high velocities. That&#39;s an ideal thing to have if you wanted to, say, have a datacenter in space consisting of a million satellites.

The science fiction reference was well made. Musk has a reputation for making bold statements and then singularly failing to deliver. Remember humans on Mars in 2024 or 2026? It would be impractical to list every missed prediction, but Musk&#39;s track record on timelines is relevant when assessing the credibility of new forecasts.

Musk wrote: &quot;Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.&quot;

Or head for the door, as half of the xAI founding team has already done. Yuhai Wu announced his departure on Monday, and Jimmy Ba packed up his things on Tuesday. Both were full of praise for xAI, but the fact that six members of the company&#39;s 12-person founding team have now departed is notable.

Musk has spent the last few weeks rolling out one ambitious announcement after another. This month has seen SpaceX acquire xAI, plans for a datacenter in space, the abrupt pivot from missions to Mars to the Moon, and so on. Even in the fast-paced world of AI development, it is difficult not to imagine the whiplash felt by some employees within Musk&#39;s companies.

Musk stated: &quot;xAI was reorganized a few days ago to improve speed of execution. As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism.&quot; ®

            <h2>'Another dark day': Users slam Microsoft over Polyglot Notebooks deprecation</h2>
            <p><strong>The Register | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2026/02/12/polyglot_notebooks_deprecation/">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Microsoft has abruptly announced the deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks with less than two months&#39; notice, throwing the future of the .NET Interactive project into doubt.

The deprecation will come into effect on March 27, whereupon bug fixes and support will cease, and no new features will be added. However, the extension won&#39;t be automatically uninstalled from a user&#39;s Visual Studio Code installation.

Polyglot Notebooks is an important element of the Microsoft .NET Interactive project, which Microsoft describes as &quot;an engine and API for running and editing code interactively.&quot; .NET Interactive can run as a kernel for notebooks and &quot;enables a polyglot (multi-language) notebook experience,&quot; according to Microsoft. &quot;For the best experience when working with multi-language notebooks, we recommend installing the Polyglot Notebooks extension for Visual Studio Code.&quot;

That recommendation presumably remains in place until Microsoft pulls the plug.

The deprecation announcement was made in the project&#39;s GitHub repository and the thread was locked, limiting conversation. However, users were quick to raise additional issues, questioning the reasoning behind the deprecation and the short time frame.

One pointed out the Polyglot Notebooks extension in Visual Studio Code was Microsoft&#39;s recommendation for data analysts, since Azure Data Studio is retiring at the end of this month. Microsoft&#39;s reaction was to remove the recommendation.

It appears the author of the Azure Data Studio retirement documentation was unaware of the impending doom facing the Polyglot Notebooks extension. An individual claiming to be the author posted: &quot;As a result of the deprecation announcement for Polyglot Notebooks, I am legally bound to remove that recommendation from the Azure Data Studio article, because it would mislead customers to keep it in.&quot;

Which is true. However, as another user noted: &quot;Removing that documentation from the Azure Data Studio page – and giving no transition path at all for those users (like myself) who depend on those Azure Data Studio features – seems a pretty user-hostile approach. We&#39;ve already followed Microsoft&#39;s transition guidance once and ended up in this situation. Should we now look elsewhere for this functionality?&quot;

The short notice and mixed messaging speaks more of dysfunctional management and communication within Microsoft than anything else. If only there were some tool at the company&#39;s disposal for Teams to communicate and collaborate.

We&#39;ll give the final word to another user reacting to the deprecation announcement, who said: &quot;This is just another dark day for Microsoft customers, and the decision makers are nowhere to be seen taking accountability for the impact of their decisions.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Apple patched a zero-day vulnerability affecting every iOS version since 1.0, used in what the company calls an &quot;extremely sophisticated attack&quot; against targeted individuals.

CVE-2026-20700, discovered by Google&#39;s Threat Analysis Group, affects dyld - Apple&#39;s dynamic linker - and allows attackers with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code. Apple said the flaw was exploited in the wild and may have been part of an exploit chain.

Its advisory stated: &quot;An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.&quot;

Google&#39;s researchers also referenced two December vulnerabilities in their report that both carry 8.8 CVSS scores.

CVE-2025-14174 is an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in Google Chrome&#39;s ANGLE graphics engine on Mac that could be exploited through a malicious webpage.

The other, CVE-2025-43529, is a use-after-free leading to code execution.

Brian Milbier, deputy CISO at Huntress, said: &quot;Think of dyld as the doorman for your phone. Every single app that wants to run must first pass through this doorman to be assembled and given permission to start.

&quot;Usually, the doorman checks credentials and places apps in a high-security &#39;sandbox&#39; where they can&#39;t touch your private data. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trick the doorman into handing over a master key before security checks even begin.&quot;

By chaining this with WebKit flaws Apple also addressed in the iOS 26.3 update, &quot;attackers have created a &#39;zero-click&#39; or &#39;one-click&#39; path to total control. They use a fake ID to bypass the front gate – your browser – and then exploit the doorman&#39;s flaw to take over the entire building,&quot; Milbier added.

&quot;This level of sophistication resembles other exploits developed by the commercial surveillance industry. These are private companies that also developed prominent spyware tools like Pegasus and Predator. They sell these types of exploits or tools to government clients. While some updates in this patch address minor issues, such as data leakage from physical access, the dyld/WebKit chain is in a different league. iOS 26.3 closes a door that has been unlocked for over a decade.&quot;

Apple&#39;s updates for iOS and iPadOS also feature a host of other fixes for various bugs, including flaws that grant root access and disclose sensitive user information, but CVE-2026-20700 is the only one it said was exploited in the wild. ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Exploding memory prices are pushing corporate buyers to fast-track PC purchases before costs climb further.

DRAM and NAND have already soared 80 to 90 percent since the final quarter of 2025, as The Register recently reported, and further bill shocks are forecast as the year progresses.

PC makers are starting to witness this dynamic. Lenovo today reported revenue of $15.8 billion for its Intelligent Devices Group (IDG), up 14 percent year-on-year, with PC revenues within that up 18 percent.

A similar effect was seen early last year when a tariff threat from the Trump administration caused a spike in trade as resellers and buyers alike tried to buy up boxes and get them through customs before the cost of imports jumped.

The memory supply shortage and the rising cost situation is &quot;unprecedented,&quot; said Lenovo chief Yang Yuanqing, speaking on an analyst call to discuss its earnings.

&quot;DRAM cost increased by 40 to 50 percent last quarter, but the current quarter versus last quarter almost doubled again, even with the contract price. So this structural imbalance between supply and demand is not simply a short-term fluctuation. It&#39;s likely to have a prolonged impact on the industry throughout this year,&quot; he stated.

On the other hand, a volatile market could become an opportunity for Lenovo, Yuanqing added. Lenovo&#39;s view is that high material costs will likely constrain demand for PCs and smartphones later in 2026, &quot;but that&#39;s just from a unit volume point of view,&quot; he said.

&quot;Given the higher pricing and the market shifting to the premium segment because of AI PCs, we believe the overall PC revenue market will still grow year-over-year.&quot;

In other words, available devices will carry a higher price tag, cushioning lower shipment volumes.

CDW, one of the world&#39;s largest resellers, also forecast stronger hardware growth in the first half of this year as many buyers bet that bumping purchases forward will avoid higher prices.

&quot;We believe to the best of our ability that we&#39;re going to see about the same amount of pull forward in Q1 or slightly more than we actually saw in December,&quot; president and CEO Christine Leahy said during CDW&#39;s recent earnings call.

&quot;When you think about the various products, I would just tell you that PCs for us, for example, have been strong. We&#39;ll probably see decelerating growth this coming year, but we still see strength as we explained in our prepared remarks. It might be a little choppier during the course of the year as a result of memory, but we still see strength there.&quot;

Analyst Omdia said PC shipments in Q4 2025 were higher than forecast due to a significant amount of pulled forward demand from the channel.

On average, mainstream PC DRAM and SSD prices jumped by nearly 100 percent and 40 percent respectively during 2025. Omdia forecast a rise of another 60 percent for DRAM and 70 percent for flash memory this quarter alone.

The memory crisis is likely to be a prolonged situation where consumers and enterprises will eventually have to adjust to the new higher price points, rather than expect a quick return to previous levels.

            <h2>NASA pauses most Swift science ops to buy time for reboost mission</h2>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">NASA has ended most science operations on its Swift observatory to keep the spacecraft in orbit a little longer.

The 21-year-old observatory&#39;s altitude has now dropped below 250 miles (400 kilometers) - it needs to sit above 185 miles (about 300 kilometers) to maximize the chances of an anticipated reboost mission.

&quot;Normally, Swift quickly turns to view its targets – especially the fleeting, almost daily explosions called gamma-ray bursts – with multiple telescopes,&quot; said principal investigator S. Bradley Cenko at NASA&#39;s Goddard Space Flight Center. While the Burst Alert Telescope will continue to detect gamma-ray bursts, the spacecraft will no longer slew to observe targets with its other telescopes.

Stopping the slewing and leaving the spacecraft in an orientation to minimize atmospheric drag will reduce the rate at which Swift&#39;s orbit decays until a reboost mission is launched – currently anticipated for the summer.

NASA awarded Katalyst Space Technologies a contract in 2025 to raise the orbit of the spacecraft. At the time, the expectation was an orbit boost in spring 2026. In November 2025, Katalyst confirmed it would use an air-dropped Pegasus XL as the launch vehicle for a June 2026.

The Register contacted Katalyst for comment.

Swift is expected to re-enter Earth&#39;s atmosphere in 2026 unless reboosted. The spacecraft&#39;s science payload remains operational, but a reboost is required to keep the data flowing.

Swift&#39;s prime mission duration was two years and it had an expected orbital life of seven years. It has far exceeded both milestones and remains operational. However, it is now significantly below its original altitude [PDF] of 373 miles (600 km). This makes it an ideal candidate for a reboost, which, if it goes to plan, will demonstrate a useful capability and extend Swift&#39;s already impressive lifespan.

The spacecraft is showing its age. It fell into safe mode several times in recent years due to reaction wheel problems and gyroscope issues. The team was able to recover the spacecraft, and in 2022, discussed observations continuing into the 2030s. However, expansion of Earth&#39;s atmosphere during periods of increased solar activity has accelerated orbital decay, necessitating a reboost.

Cenko said: &quot;We anticipate the reboost mission to launch in the summer, so we&#39;re transitioning operations now to give it the best margin we possibly can.&quot; ®

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Cybercriminals are turning supply chain attacks into an industrial-scale operation, linking breaches, credential theft, and ransomware into a &quot;self-reinforcing&quot; ecosystem, researchers say.

In its latest trends report, Group-IB reckons individual strikes that lead to broader downstream compromises of businesses are now interconnected as cyberbaddies pursue multiple methods to breach vendors and service providers.

Supply chain hacks like the recent Shai-Hulud NPM worm, Salesloft debacle, or the OpenClaw package poisoning are fast becoming the primary goals of the criminal fraternity who try to exploit the inherited access to a victim&#39;s customers.

&quot;Open source package compromise feeds malware distribution and credential theft,&quot; the research states. &quot;Phishing and OAuth abuse enable identity compromise that unlocks SaaS and CI/CD environments. Data breaches supply the credentials, context, and relationships needed to refine impersonation and lateral movement. Ransomware and extortion arrive later in the chain, capitalizing on access and intelligence gathered earlier. Each stage strengthens the next, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of supply chain exploitation.&quot;

Over the next year, GroupIB predicts supply chain attacks will be executed faster thanks to AI-assisted tools that can scan for vulnerabilities across vendors, CI/CD pipelines, and browser extension marketplaces at machine speed.

It also expects to see traditional malware replaced by identity attacks, whereby criminals set themselves up as genuine users and their activity blends into the normal daily business functions, evading detection for longer periods.

Platforms offering HR, CRM, and ERP, as well as MSPs, are high-priority targets, Group-IB says, as a single compromise can lead to hackers gaining access to hundreds of customers.

The Salesloft breach, as well as the Oracle compromise of March 2025, are examples of how data breaches are shifting from a single-reward model to one where access is used for additional compromises.

Instead of taking one big wedge of data and demanding an extortion payment, criminals took their time to collect OAuth tokens and exploit misconfigured partner connections to move laterally. They then target downstream customers, steal their data and contact lists to repeat the cycle, or, in cases involving NPM and similar ecosystems, serve malicious updates to users to carry out fraud at scale.

&quot;Cybercrime is no longer defined by single breaches. It is defined by cascading failures of trust,&quot; said Dmitry Volkov, Group-IB CEO.

&quot;Attackers are industrializing supply chain compromise because it delivers scale, speed, and stealth. A single upstream breach can now ripple across entire industries. Defenders must stop thinking in terms of isolated systems and start securing trust itself, across every relationship, identity, and dependency.&quot;

Organizations should treat third parties as extensions of their own attack surface.

&quot;Strategic investments in supply chain threat modeling, automated dependency checks, and data flow visibility are no longer optional – they are foundational to modern security architecture,&quot; said Volkov. ®

Seedance 2.0 can take camera movement, visual effects, and motion into account.

Big Tech’s race to leapfrog the latest AI models continues with the launch of ByteDance’s next-gen video generator. In a blog post, ByteDance – the China-based company behind TikTok – says Seedance 2.0 supports prompts that combine text, images, video, and audio.

The company claims it “delivers a substantial leap in generation quality,” offering improvements in generating complex scenes with multiple subjects and its ability to follow instructions. Users can refine their text prompts by feeding Seedance 2.0 up to nine images, three video clips, and three audio clips.

The model can generate up to 15-second clips with audio, while taking camera movement, visual effects, and motion into account. It can also reference text-based storyboards, according to ByteDance.

AI-powered video generation models have only gotten more advanced within the past year, with Google Veo 3 adding the ability to generate audio-supported clips, and OpenAI launching Sora 2 along with a new app that allows users to create videos with “hyperreal motion and sound.” The AI startup, Runway, has also released a new version of its AI video model that it claims has “unprecedented” accuracy.

In one example shared by ByteDance, which shows two figure skaters performing a routine together, the company says Seedance 2.0 can “reliably perform a sequence of high-difficulty movements — including synchronized takeoffs, mid-air spins and precise ice landings — while strictly following real-world physical laws.”

Users on social media have already started showing off what the new tool can do, with one person posting an AI-generated video with the likenesses of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise in a cinematic fight sequence. Deadpool writer Rhett Reese reposted the video with the comment, “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.”

Other posts demonstrate Seedance 2.0’s ability to generate anime-style clips, cartoons, cinematic sci-fi scenes, and videos that look like a content creator made them. It’s not clear what (if any) copyright protections Seedance 2.0 offers, as a quick search on X reveals a bunch of clips featuring characters from Dragon Ball Z, Family Guy, Pokémon, and more.

For now, Seedance 2.0 is only available through ByteDance’s Dreamina AI platform and through its AI assistant, Doubao. It’s unclear whether it will make its way to TikTok — especially now that the app is under new ownership in the US.

Amazon’s rolling out a new “Send to Alexa Plus” feature to the latest Kindle Scribe and Kindle Scribe Colorsoft owners starting February 12. The feature lets you send your notes or documents to Amazon’s AI-powered Alexa Plus assistant, which can then summarize them, turn them into to-do lists, calendar events, or reminders, as well as help brainstorm, and offer project guidance.

I spent about a day or so testing it primarily to help with caregiving tasks, and it was mostly helpful despite some limitations. It works best when asked to digest information into something actionable. It accurately summarized my handwritten notes and PDF documents, even across different templates or hard-to-read text colors, and it worked well for logistics, like turning my notes about my mom’s next appointment into calendar events and reminders with helpful context.

I also tested how well it answered questions about my notes and documents, provided guidance, and handled brainstorming. In one test, while I was on hold with Medi-Cal for three hours, my Echo Show 8 read back key information from a dispute letter I had written earlier. I also sent a PDF of an email and asked it to add up a list of charges, which it calculated correctly. It was also good at pulling specific details. In one case, I wrote “Blue Shield” in messy handwriting without labeling it as an insurance company, and it still identified it from context.

In another test, I wrote notes for someone who was taking my mom to an appointment and intentionally left out details like the address. After I clicked “Share” and “Send to Alexa,” I asked what might be missing from the note. Alexa received the note and suggested adding the address, doctor’s name, medication list, and questions to ask. It also generated a decent draft when I asked for help brainstorming a phone script for arguing with the insurance company, though unfortunately Alexa couldn’t actually apply those changes to the original Scribe note. I wasn’t able to send the full version to my email address either, sadly; I could, however, view the draft in the “chat history” section of the Alexa app.

Where it struggled was depth and nuance. I wanted to test how useful it could be for, say, quizzing yourself on a piece, so I sent myself a copy of my old Kindle Scribe review and another article. It took four or five tries to generate a detailed outline, and it sometimes missed small but meaningful distinctions, like interpreting “AI-powered summarization feature” as just “AI-powered feature.” That was a problem as it marked answers as correct when they were only partially right.

Send to Alexa Plus isn’t perfect, but overall it’s genuinely useful and gives Amazon an edge over rivals like the Kobo Elipsa 2E, which lack voice assistant integration. The Elipsa 2E is still my favorite because it covers the basics better — notably, it’s much easier to annotate ebooks— but the Scribe is getting easier to recommend if you’re in Amazon’s ecosystem.

Weave’s Isaac 0 can’t fold large blankets, sheets, or inside-out clothes, and still needs help from human teleoperators.

If you have a spare $7,999 (plus a $250 deposit), hate folding laundry, and happen to live in the Bay Area, one-and-a-half-year-old startup Weave has the robot for you: Isaac 0.

It takes Isaac 0 around 30-90 minutes to fold a load of laundry, Weave says. That’s all it does — it’s stationary and needs a regular wall outlet — and it can’t tackle large blankets, bed sheets, or inside-out garments. It’s not fully autonomous either, with teleoperators on-hand to assist with trickier folds, though Weave says performance will improve over time.

Weave joins a growing list of companies working to build chore-eliminating robots in the hopes that people will welcome them into their homes. This year’s CES highlighted laundry as the ultimate use case, with demos from LG’s CLOiD and SwitchBot’s Onero H1. Despite the hype, we’re not sure if robots are ready for real homes just yet.

Business laptops are typically dull computers foisted on employees en masse. But higher-end enterprise workstation notebooks sometimes get an interesting enough blend of power and features to appeal to enthusiasts. HP’s ZBook Ultra G1a is a nice example. It’s easy to see it as another gray boring-book for spendy business types, until you notice a few key specs: an AMD Strix Halo APU, lots of RAM, an OLED display, and an adequate amount of speedy ports (Thunderbolt 4, even — a rarity on AMD laptops).

I know from my time with the Asus ROG Flow Z13 and Framework Desktop that anything using AMD’s high-end Ryzen AI Max chips should make for a compelling computer. But those two are a gaming tablet and a small form factor PC, respectively. Here, you get Strix Halo and its excellent integrated graphics in a straightforward, portable 14-inch laptop — so far, the only one of its kind. That should mean great performance with solid battery life, and the graphics chops to hang with midlevel gaming laptops — all in a computer that wouldn’t draw a second glance in a stuffy office. It’s a decent Windows (or Linux) alternative to a MacBook Pro, albeit for a very high price.

The HP ZBook Ultra G1a starts around $2,100 for a modest six-core AMD Ryzen AI Max Pro 380 processor, 16GB of shared memory, and basic IPS display. Our review unit is a much higher-spec configuration with a 16-core Ryzen AI Max Plus Pro 395, 2880 x 1800 resolution 120Hz OLED touchscreen, 2TB of storage, and a whopping 128GB of shared memory, costing nearly $4,700. I often see it discounted by $1,000 or more — still expensive, but more realistic for someone seeking a MacBook Pro alternative. Having this much shared memory is mostly useful for hefty local AI inference workloads and serious dataset crunching; most people don’t need it. But with the ongoing memory shortage I’d also understand wanting to futureproof.

Unlike cheaper HP laptops I’ve tested that made big sacrifices on everyday features like speaker quality, the ZBook Ultra G1a is very good across the board. The OLED is vibrant, with punchy contrast. The keyboard has nice tactility and deep key travel. The mechanical trackpad is smooth, with a good click feel. The 5-megapixel webcam looks solid in most lighting. And the speakers have a full sound that I’m happy to listen to music on all day. I have my gripes, but they’re minor: The 400-nit screen could be a little brighter, the four-speaker audio system doesn’t sound quite as rich as current MacBook Pros, and my accidental presses of the Page Up and Page Down keys above the arrows really get on my nerves. These quibbles aren’t deal-breakers, though for the ZBook’s price I wish HP solved some of them.

The big thing you’re paying for with the ZBook Ultra is that top-end Strix Halo APU, which is so far only found in $2,000+ computers and a sicko-level gaming handheld, though there will be cut-down versions coming to cheaper gaming laptops this year.

The flagship 395 chip in the ZBook offers speedy performance for mixed-use work and enough battery life to eke out an eight-hour workday filled with Chrome tabs and web apps (with power-saving measures). I burned through battery in Adobe Lightroom Classic, but even though Strix Halo is less powerful when disconnected from wall power, the ZBook didn’t get bogged down. I blazed through a hefty batch edit of 47-megapixel RAW images without any particularly long waits on things like AI denoise or automated masking adjustments.

The ZBook stays cool and silent during typical use; pushing it under heavy loads only yields a little warmth in its center and a bit of tolerable fan noise that’s easily drowned out by music, a video, or a game at normal volume.

This isn’t a gaming-focused laptop any more than a MacBook Pro is, as its huge pool of shared memory and graphics cores are meant for workstation duties. However, this thing can game. I spent an entire evening playing Battlefield 6 with friends, with Discord and Chrome open in the background, and the whole time it averaged 70 to 80fps in 1920 x 1200 resolution with Medium preset settings and FSR set to Balanced mode — with peaks above 100fps. Running it at the native 2880 x 1800 got a solid 50-ish fps that’s fine for single-player.

Intel’s new Panther Lake chips also have great integrated graphics for gaming, while being more power-efficient. But Strix Halo edges out Panther Lake in multi-core tasks and graphics, with the flagship 395 version proving as capable as a laptop RTX 4060 discrete GPU. AMD’s beefy mobile chips have also proven great for Linux if you’re looking to get away from Windows.

In addition to Windows 11’s upsells and nagging notifications, the ZBook also has HP’s Wolf Security, designed for deployment on an IT-managed fleet of company laptops. For someone not using this as a work-managed device, its extra layer of protections may be tolerable, but they’re annoying. They range from warning you about files from an “untrusted location” (fine) to pop-ups when plugging in a non-HP USB-C charger (infuriating). You can turn off and uninstall all of this, same as you can for the bloatware AI Companion and Support Assistant apps, but it’s part of what HP charges for on its Z workstation line.

You don’t need to spend this kind of money on a kitted-out ZBook Ultra G1a unless you do the kind of specialized computing (local AI models, mathematical simulations, 3D rendering, etc.) it’s designed for. There’s a more attainable configuration, frequently on sale for around $2,500, but its 12-core CPU, lower-specced GPU, and 64GB of shared memory are a dip in performance.

If you’re mostly interested in gaming, an Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 or even a Razer Blade 16 make a hell of a lot more sense. For about the price of our ZBook Ultra review unit, the Razer gets you an RTX 5090 GPU, with much more powerful gaming performance, while the more modest ROG Zephyrus G14 with an RTX 5060 gets you comparable gaming performance to the ZBook Ultra in a similar form factor for nearly $3,000 less. The biggest knock against those gaming laptops compared to the ZBook is that their fans get much louder under load.

And while it’s easy to think of a MacBook Pro as the lazy answer to all computing needs, it still should be said: If you don’t mind macOS, you can get a whole lot more (non-gaming) performance from an M4 Pro / M4 Max MacBook Pro. Even sticking with Windows and integrated graphics, the Asus Zenbook Duo with Panther Lake at $2,300 is a deal by comparison, once it launches.

At $4,700, this is a specific machine for specialized workloads. It’s a travel-friendly 14-inch that can do a bit of everything, but it’s a high price for a jack of all trades if you’re spending your own money. The ZBook piqued my interest because it’s one of the earliest examples of Strix Halo in a conventional laptop. After using it, I’m even more excited to see upcoming models at more down-to-earth prices.

            <h2>ICE is pushing Minneapolis underground</h2>
            <p><strong>The Verge | 2026-02-12</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/877106/minneapolis-ice-cbp-occupation-immigration-raid-mutual-aid">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">After ICE raids, tear gassing protestors, and two killings, DHS “border czar” Tom Homan arrived in the Twin Cities to announce a winding down of immigration enforcement. But the battle has merely moved from the streets to the underground, and the city remains under siege.

Minneapolis was not the war zone I expected to find. Depending on who you are and where you live, things can seem, for a few fleeting moments, almost normal, like a few blocks or neighborhoods over people aren’t being tear gassed or rounded up by ICE or, in two tragic cases, being gunned down by federal agents. Even now some people walk their dogs, run errands and buy groceries, meet friends for dinner and drinks. Daily life has become sinister in its banality, because Minneapolis remains a city under siege. ICE and CBP agents roam the streets, though their tactics have shifted as of late: No longer acting like an occupying army, the Department of Homeland Security now operates like secret police. They do their best to blend in, to look like the people they terrorize, and in this, they often fail. Everyone knows that they’re there, that they’re watching. But they aren’t everywhere — not at once. The fear is that they will arrive at any moment, that they will take someone, that they will arrest or attack or kill anyone who gets in their way.

These fears have been realized. Children and parents have been snatched off the street while walking to school. People have been taken from their jobs and grabbed mid-commute, their empty cars left on the streets, hazard lights still flashing. And so those who are most vulnerable — immigrants at risk of deportation, US citizens who have learned that DHS will, depending on the color of a person’s skin, detain first and ask questions later — have retreated into their homes.

DHS has met unprecedented pushback in Minnesota. Residents of the Twin Cities have done everything in their power to hinder the occupation. Locals follow ICE on the streets, jeer agents outside their hotel rooms, and kick them out of restaurants. A robust mutual aid network has emerged virtually overnight to provide the most basic resources to families that have been forced into hiding. This widespread resistance has fueled a triumphalist narrative, one in which the community has banded together to protect their immigrant neighbors and Minnesota Nice has triumphed over fascism and xenophobia.

This is true and yet it isn’t. ICE has been slowed but not thwarted. Most national reporters, myself included, have left, but the story isn’t over. The siege is ongoing, and it has created a noticeable void. ICE may have lost the battle for public opinion, and its operation in the Twin Cities may be hampered by local pushback, but it has succeeded in one respect: It has instilled terror in Minnesota’s immigrant communities, forcing them into the shadows. The question that remains is how long this can go on, and how the community can rebuild once it ends.

“‘Odd’ doesn’t seem like a good enough word, but it’s the one I have, and it’s a very Minnesotan one, but it’s odd to live here right now,” Kai Shelley, a senior policy aide for Minneapolis City Council member Aisha Chughtai, told me. Chughtai, the council majority leader, represents Whittier, the neighborhood where Renee Good and Alex Pretti were killed.

“You walk down the street of Alex Pretti’s memorial and every business has a sign that says ‘ICE OUT’ or ‘Come in and get warm’ or is offering free water bottles and opening up their restrooms. There’s a lot of unity and resistance in that,” Shelley said. “So many people have stepped up to do rapid response and mutual aid. But the undercurrent of all of that, and the reason it’s happening, is because our immigrant neighbors can’t leave their homes, are afraid to send their kids to school, are afraid to do pickup and drop-off at schools, are afraid to go to work, can’t go to work, are afraid to be in the neighborhood. Immigrant-owned businesses are closing or are going to close. We won’t know the full toll for months.” Each person grabbed off the street and removed from the community causes a ripple effect. Every arrest is a warning: You could be next.

“There’s a real contradiction here right now. It’s eerie and it’s terrifying, and it’s inspiring and there’s resistance here. It’s always both.”

The occupation is inescapable. It’s all anyone can talk about. It’s visible on every street and every storefront, as is the community’s response. Signs on every door warn ICE not to enter without a warrant. Bundled-up people stand like sentinels, whistles hanging from their necks, watching over their blocks despite subzero temperatures. Groups of friends drive around their neighborhoods in search of ICE agents who troll around in unmarked cars. Each morning and afternoon, volunteers in neon vests station themselves outside the city’s schools to ensure students and parents make it home safely. No one person is doing everything, but nearly everyone who is out on the street is doing something.

“I couldn’t be a bystander anymore,” Sid, one of three people patrolling a corner of Lake Street, told me on a sunny, freezing afternoon. Sid, Kay, and a friend who declined to be named were stationed outside Karmel Mall, a once-bustling Somali shopping center just blocks from the site of Pretti’s killing. The vilification of the cities’ Somali residents, Kay said, is “disgusting, especially because the immigrant community here — and I’m sure across the nation — is so vibrant and supportive.” As we spoke, a Somali man exited Karmel Mall and thanked the patrollers for their work, offering them sambusas and chai to keep warm. “We can fight ICE, but we can’t fight the winter,” he told us. “I moved here because of the people. Really nice people, really good-hearted people.”

Some of this infrastructure was in place long before DHS kicked off Operation Metro Surge, its campaign in the Twin Cities. The American Indian Movement, founded in 1968, resumed armed patrols shortly after ICE descended on Minneapolis. Mutual aid organizations that sprung up around the city amid the racial justice protests of 2020 have reported an upsurge in demand, both from volunteers and people in need of support. This fact, too, is inescapable: People are missing. Cut off from the world, immigrants throughout the Twin Cities have been forced to turn over some of the most mundane and intimate parts of daily life to their neighbors: school pickup and drop-off, grocery shopping, and, in neighborhoods where ICE has been especially active, even trash collection, to avoid the possibility that agents will grab someone in the few yards between their front door and the curb.

Jae Yates, an organizer with the Community Aid Network, first noticed a shift in mid-January. The organization, founded in the wake of the George Floyd uprising, has distributed food and diapers to hundreds of families each week since the summer of 2020. Early this year, some regulars stopped showing up. “Now it’s mostly white folks picking up groceries on behalf of their neighbors,” Yates said. “Everyone who’s not white is terrified to go outside if they have any kind of precarity around citizenship.”

Even those who feel secure in their citizenship are at risk. White skin and American birth did not protect Renee Good or Alex Pretti. The government has suggested that observers are part of a vast conspiracy, and some protesters have been arrested on federal charges, while others say ICE has followed them to their homes. Because of this heightened surveillance, the majority of people I spoke to asked to be referred to by pseudonyms, often to discuss otherwise unremarkable activities like buying groceries for their neighbors or forming community watch programs.

Parallel ways of life have emerged. Nearly everyone I met said they feel more connected to their community than ever, but they also spoke of a glaring absence. Untold numbers of people are now cut off from the world beyond their doorstep. These are twin cities, operating in tandem; one cannot exist without the other.

For Jamila Keisar, a lifelong resident of the Twin Cities, the ICE occupation is reminiscent of past government abuses. “Minnesota isn’t new to this,” she told me. “I think of George Floyd, I think of Philando Castile, of Daunte Wright, of Jamar Clark. These were all super high-profile murders at the hands of law enforcement in our city. And these are just the ones we know about because they were caught on body cameras.”

Keisar, a Somali American therapist, said the DHS presence has resurfaced old traumas among some of her clients, many of whom were already victims of racial profiling. The vibrant community response to this latest crisis, she told me, is bittersweet. “I hear a lot of people say, ‘Why can’t things go back to how they were before?’” she said, “but when you ask communities of color how things were then, they’ll say, ‘Not great!’ But I’m hopeful.”

If this feels like a breaking point, it may be sobering to remember that there have been other ruptures before. George Floyd’s murder sparked worldwide protests, but eventually, for some people, life went on. “I think it’s really easy to go back to the status quo,” Keisar said. “My hope is that all the folks who seem to be waking up now can sustain themselves in a way that allows them to participate in this movement, because work still needs to be done even after ICE leaves.”

Last December, shortly after DHS announced Metro Surge, Keisar started offering free Sunday sessions for immigrants. “The number one thing I’m seeing is isolation and a lack of social connection folks are now experiencing because they’re sheltering in place,” she told me. Her clients are no longer “able to just stop at the coffee shop and have a small conversation in the way that you’re doing here today,” she said. “I fear what the ramifications will be of this moment and if things continue in this way.” Life has become so unbearable for some of her clients, Keisar told me, that they’ve started thinking about self-deporting.

A vital segment of the city’s population is now missing. Immigrant-owned businesses along Central Avenue have closed their doors; a few restaurants have cautiously reopened, shifting to takeout-only to protect workers and patrons alike. On a recent Sunday, Karmel Mall was nearly deserted. “It’s been empty the past few weeks,” the owner of a women’s clothing shop told me. The mall’s largely Somali American clientele has stopped coming, and its businesses are struggling. At a dinner in Minneapolis’ Standish neighborhood, a woman sidled up to me after learning I was a reporter, telling me her niece teaches English as a second language at a school that has been targeted by “right-wing agitators.” She showed me her latest attendance numbers: Out of 26 kids in her first-period class, just one showed up. A new tag has popped up, a haunting complement to the “FUCK ICE” and “ICE OUT” graffiti that has become ubiquitous throughout the city. Stenciled on walls and street signs, it reads: “A NEIGHBOR WAS TAKEN HERE.”

“I deliver food to families that have not left their house in six weeks,” Pam, who asked that her last name be withheld, told me over breakfast. She and seven friends had just left a movement class — “You have to bring down your nervous system if you’re going to be out there,” one of them explained — and were back to discussing the inescapable. Nearly everyone in Minneapolis, they said, was fighting back. They weren’t the first to tell me about Smitten Kitten, a local sex shop that had started collecting diapers, nonperishable food, and other essentials to distribute to the community. “I bought two gift cards for my friends,” one of them told me, “and a little something for myself too, but I won’t tell you what it was.”

That morning, Tom Homan, the Trump administration’s “border czar,” had held a press conference announcing an ICE “drawdown,” with the caveat that he’d be “staying till the problem’s gone.” Homan had recently replaced Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol official in charge of the Minneapolis operation, after pushback. (The press conference had been scheduled for 7AM, likely to keep protesters at bay; unable to get on the media list before the RSVP cutoff, I watched the stream from my hotel room.) According to an internal ICE memo that leaked to Reuters, agents had been instructed to focus on immigrants with criminal records and advised to refrain from engaging with “agitators,” a practice that had clearly only succeeded in “inflaming the situation.”

The gaggle of women didn’t buy it. Homan “is just Stephen Miller with a potbelly and Bovino in a suit,” one of them said. “They’re just trying to control the narrative. They’re trying to say things have changed, and they haven’t changed.”

At the press conference, a sycophantic correspondent for the right-wing news outlet Real America’s Voice had thanked Homan on behalf of “all the folks out there in America that voted for this, that want mass deportations.” He also asked whether the administration planned on arresting “the leadership on the Signal chats or the WhatsApp chats that are organizing the attacks against you, obstruction against you.” Homan declined to answer. “I’m not going to show our hand,” he said, “but they’re going to be held accountable. Justice is coming.”

The administration has characterized Minnesotans’ resistance as organized, hierarchical, externally funded, and above all, dangerous. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem accused Renee Good of engaging in “domestic terrorism.” Stephen Miller, one of Donald Trump’s closest advisers and the architect of much of his immigration policy, called Alex Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and “would-be assassin.” The FBI is reportedly investigating the Signal chats locals use to monitor ICE activity.

Beatrice Adler-Bolton, a Minneapolis resident and host of the leftist podcast Death Panel, told me ICE showed up to her house on two consecutive afternoons while she was alone with her 11-month-old baby. Adler-Bolton, who said she’s been showing up for her neighbors “in really boring ways,” believes she was targeted for speaking out against ICE, not for her mutual aid work. Two days after I met Adler-Bolton in Powderhorn Park, federal agents tear gassed observers there, just yards from where we had stood.

The first time ICE came by, “there was a guy in the front in hideous fucking Oakleys, he had a big rifle in his lap, and he was holding the barrel of the rifle. He looked right at me, pulled out his phone, and took a picture,” she said. Five cars showed up the next day. This time, she said, the agents got out of their cars, walked around her house, and took pictures through her windows. “They were making their presence known. It was obviously intimidation.”

In addition to a custom-built Palantir tool ICE relies on to identify deportation targets, DHS is reportedly using two facial-recognition tools to track protesters and observers. One woman who was photographed by an ICE agent had her Global Entry privileges revoked three days after the encounter, according to court filings. Both DHS and the Department of Justice have posted photos of detained protesters on social media, calling them “rioters.”

Everyone I met in Minneapolis pushed back against the government’s characterizations of the resistance. Instead, they described informal networks of friends coming together to support their neighbors. “What we’re building is a movement outside the traditional nonprofit sector,” Pam, one of the women I met at the diner, said. “It’s so much more nimble, and it’s hyper-local.”

Pam told me she had helped crowdfund rent for five families on her block. Another told me that after the man who plows snow on her street got picked up by ICE, their neighbors pooled money to hire him a lawyer. When a friend from out of town asked her for a list of nonprofits to donate to, she told her to send it to a trusted local who could pass it directly to people in need. “Send cash to people on the ground,” she said. “The entire thing is about trust.”

On the morning of Alex Pretti’s killing, Mac*, a retired Army medic, was putting together a grocery list. She popped into one of her Signal chats, saw the news, and immediately headed over. “Things got really spicy really fast,” Mac told me. After declaring an unlawful assembly, the police alternated between firing tear gas into the crowd and pushing protesters back. The protesters had been boxed in — the Minneapolis Police Department surrounded them on one side, the Minnesota State Patrol on the other. “It’s what I call a fatal funnel,” Mac said. “One way in, one way out.”

Protesters started calling for medics. “That was when we got into the fray,” Mac said. “We run in, and I just see this person holding their hand — they had caught, likely, a rubber bullet, a nonlethal round. Their hand was shattered. We bandaged them up, and then EMS arrived and we got them out.”

A couple dozen protesters were arrested at the site of Pretti’s killing. After being released from the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, some may have run into Julie Prokes, one of the many volunteers who has become a fixture in Whipple’s parking lot. I spoke to Prokes on a frigid morning as he loaded a folding table with hot chocolate, instant noodles, and assorted snacks to distribute to protesters and released detainees alike. “I took the week off work,” he said, adding that he suspects most of the people who come out of Whipple are US citizens. “I don’t necessarily know their citizenship status. I don’t ask. I’m just out here to offer aid however I can.”

As we spoke, Prokes pointed to a building across the way, which he said was an apartment complex for homeless veterans. “These guys over there are dealing with PTSD, and now you’ve got people out here playing military, throwing chemical irritants, and disrupting their normal flow of life,” Prokes said, adding that the food vendors that typically work with veterans’ services are now afraid to send their drivers near Whipple.

I ran into Prokes again on Friday morning, the day of the second mass anti-ICE protest in as many weeks, at his usual spot in the Whipple parking lot. Five hundred or so protesters had gathered outside the federal building, behind the concrete-and-steel barriers that had been set up in the aftermath of Alex Pretti’s killing; their numbers had dwindled to a couple hundred by the time I arrived. A small group sang: “This is for our families who are locked inside / Together, we will abolish ICE / This is for our friends who are locked inside / Together, we will abolish ICE.” A man yelled at two Hennepin County sheriff’s deputies: “You’re protecting ICE! Liam is in a concentration camp because of ICE. You know who I’m talking about. You’re protecting his captors!” Constellations of ice formed on people’s beards and eyelashes. Despite the cold, there was a drum circle. Two protesters in matching pink gas masks told me I had just missed all the action. There had been no tear gas, but plenty of flash-bangs. I asked how many people had been there earlier. “A shit ton,” one of them said.

Two ICU nurses in medic gear told me they had flown in from Colorado to offer support. “I’m a former military nurse, and I have a strong sense of patriotism. Seeing the government turn on the people, as a veteran, really upset me,” one of them told me. “Alex was an ICU nurse. I couldn’t just sit idly and watch it all unfold.”

The medics carried tourniquets, dressing, and oxygen bags. Mac told me she takes her medic bag everywhere, just in case. She volunteers as a medic “when the situation calls for it” and tries to go out commuting four or five times a week. Lately there’s been a greater need for commuters than for medics, and so that’s what Mac does. Commuters tend to stick to their own neighborhoods and adhere to a set of best practices, but there are no leaders, only volunteers. “I come from the military, from a very hierarchical, bureaucratic system,” Mac told me, “and this is completely foreign to me to the degree that I sometimes struggle, because I’m not familiar with operating in a system that doesn’t have a chain of command.”

In some ways, commuting is less high-adrenaline than treating people who have been tear gassed and shot with pepper bullets, but following ICE around is not without its risks. Several observers told me ICE has threatened them with arrest. Sometimes commuters will trail ICE through familiar streets, only to end up in front of their own homes; they suspect ICE has run their plates through a database, identified where they live, and led them there as a warning. One woman showed me a video of agents approaching her car and threatening her with bear mace. She was able to capture it thanks to a dashcam she had been given days earlier.

“It stressed me out so bad,” Nick Benson, a resident of the nearby town of Burnsville, told me of his first commuting experience. Benson ultimately decided commuting wasn’t for him, but he’s found other ways to get involved. “Everyone is finding their lane and kicking ass in it,” he told me. An airplane photography enthusiast, Benson has started tracking ICE’s charter flights out of Minneapolis. I met him on a sunny Monday afternoon on the top floor of the airport parking garage, where he stations himself every day to document ICE’s efforts to transport immigrants out of the state.

Benson and I watched as a bright-blue plane operated by GlobalX, a charter airline, descended into one of the terminals. In addition to ICE, GlobalX contracts with private companies and college sports teams. “A few weeks ago, another one of these GlobalX flights flew handcuffed people down to Texas, then did a ferry flight to Houston, where they picked up the University of Wisconsin women’s volleyball team and then flew them back to Madison,” Benson told me. “Same day, same airplane.”

His telephoto lens pointed at the terminal, Benson explained what we were looking at: two vans pulled up to the plane. A few people, presumably federal employees, emerged from the vehicles and ascended the airplane stairs. Then came the detainees, each of them shackled at the wrists and ankles. One of them moved slowly. Another needed help getting on the plane. There were 23 of them in all, each of them still in the clothes they wore when they got picked up by ICE. One wore a pink jacket. “Once in a while you’ll see people that look like construction workers or tradespeople, because they’re wearing bright-green hoodies. A few weeks ago, we saw someone who was still in their Amazon uniform get on one of the flights,” Benson told me. “They’re just taking our neighbors off the street and shipping them out.”

Benson told me his role in all of this is to document what happens “at the narrow end of the funnel.” This is the moment between abductions and deportations, when the people ICE rips from the community are shuttled to detention centers in Texas or elsewhere. In addition to tracking these flights, Benson has started distributing dashcams to locals so they can document their own interactions with ICE. Since early January, Benson has given out more than $65,000 worth of dashcams to his fellow Minnesotans.

Mac, the medic, told me she has a dashcam she’s been meaning to install for weeks. She and the other commuters have had too many close calls to count. On a recent patrol, ICE led Mac and another commuter into an unfamiliar neighborhood. “I was behind the other commuter,” Mac recalled. “They brake-checked him, got out of the vehicle, guns drawn, and started threatening him. They were like, ‘We will arrest you if you honk your horn or blow your whistle.’”

I had no such experiences in my week in Minneapolis, though I tried to go commuting almost every morning. On my first day in the field, the people who let me tag along with them commented on how sleepy it was: We saw exactly one ICE agent on our three-hour patrol through Whittier, and he was napping in his car. “I’ve been rattled,” Thomas, the driver, told me while maneuvering the car through the neighborhood, but he had also started feeling anxious when he wasn’t out there. “Yesterday I was sitting in the back seat and I was the one on the call, and I was like, ‘This is not my role!’” His friends had started calling him Baby Driver.

Today, his friend Larry was on Signal duty. He had one earbud in to monitor the call, a litany of intersections, car descriptions — “Wagoneer” repeated over and over with Minnesotans’ characteristic long vowels — and plate numbers. “I’m sick of getting tear gassed,” he told me. “There was a period where I was getting tear gassed literally every day.” This was a reprieve, but the relative stillness made us all uneasy.

Things hadn’t exactly slowed down, but they had shifted. The next morning we parked outside of Whipple and watched as ICE’s convoys of unmarked cars left for the day. Where they previously rolled out in groups of five to seven, this morning they left in pairs. We drove around Whittier in circles searching in vain for ICE. That night, someone showed me a video taken around the same time, just one neighborhood over: Observers leap out of their cars, blowing their whistles to alert their neighbors of an arrest in progress. A man flails as ICE agents struggle to force him over a chain-link fence. Agents yell at the observers, liberally deploy pepper spray into the crowd. One man, clearly marked as press, stands off to the side. An agent pulls down his gas mask, sprays him in the face, and leaves.

“They’re evolving,” Mac told me. “As soon as we catch on to them, they evolve. And they know that we’re onto them, because they keep putting out new restrictions, saying, ‘You can’t make noise, you can’t film us, we don’t need a warrant.’”

The opposition’s tactics are evolving, too. Some South Minneapolis residents have begun setting up “filter blockades,” makeshift roundabouts designed to slow traffic and keep an eye out for ICE. On a recent Saturday, a dozen or so people stood in the middle of Cedar Avenue surrounded by signs, mattresses, and pallets of wood. Farther up the road, volunteers in neon vests handed out flyers to drivers, most of whom honked and fist-pumped in approval.

People are fighting surveillance with surveillance. Garrett Guntly, a tech executive who has lived in Minneapolis for a decade, told me he’s installed a network of more than 20 cameras across the city. “I’ve been out there in negative 15 weather trying to install these things,” he said.

At first, Guntly felt awkward about asking his neighbors if he could set up cameras on their property. The response has been almost universal assent. Their reasoning, he explained, is simple: “The government’s already watching me. Why not my neighbors?” Unlike consumer-grade doorbell cameras, Guntly’s network isn’t connected to the cloud. It’s a network-based internet protocol system. “In layman’s terms, think of it as a CCTV system,” he said. “If the landowner agrees to have a camera on their building facing out onto the street, only then do they have access to the broader camera matrix. It’s a skin-in-the-game approach. If you’re part of the network, you have the network.”

The cameras are installed on private property, but they’re pointed at “critical areas” with lots of foot traffic, like bus stops and busy intersections. “With these cameras, we’ve been able to get a lot more surgical and rapid at getting people onto the streets. One human can cover one and a half square miles of street, where they wouldn’t have been able to before,” he told me. “We’ve been able to thwart close to a dozen attempted abductions.”

I’d heard rumors of the ways DHS agents tried to disguise their otherwise conspicuous vehicles: dirtying up rental cars with snow; putting stuffed animals on their dashboards, just visible through windows tinted to near-opacity. On Saturday, we followed an unmarked car up and down Hiawatha Avenue, where it stopped in the middle of traffic, presumably in an attempt to deter us. I fiddled with my gas mask, trying to tighten the straps so it would fit snugly against my head. The tags were still on; I hadn’t needed it thus far. We had seen lights flash inside the car, visible even through the pitch-black windows. This was a law enforcement vehicle of some kind, and it was running a light to get away from us. Hours earlier, we had trailed an SUV with Florida plates. It sped away from us, and we followed, passing a small group of anti-ICE protesters stationed outside an Enterprise Rent-a-Car. When we caught up to the SUV, which had gotten on the highway that leads back to Whipple, I noticed it had a bumper sticker: “BABY ON BOARD.”

I met Myles, a Minneapolis resident of 19 years, on a Friday afternoon. His affluent pocket of Southwest Minneapolis felt almost like a parallel universe: A pair of elementary schoolers walked home unaccompanied, unworried about being stopped by ICE, discussing their favorite kinds of sushi. Myles’ foyer, however, quickly brought me back to reality. In addition to the requisite winter boots and pile of coats, the entryway was full of paper grocery bags, each loaded to the brim with toiletries and nonperishable food.

Myles started fielding individual requests from neighbors last December. “At first it was helping with one-off needs, like if a kid needed a ride to school or someone needed groceries,” he said. When the DHS operation began, “we were doing small-scale mutual aid and planning for a significant invasion” down the line. He assumed ICE would descend upon Minneapolis like it had on Chicago, Portland, or Los Angeles, other so-called sanctuary cities where the agency has conducted large-scale raids since Trump’s inauguration — but Metro Surge is DHS’s biggest operation yet, one that residents of the Twin Cities have met with an unprecedented degree of pushback.

“Everyone seems really willing to step up,” Myles said. “If they’re not already involved, they’re eager to get involved.” What started as a handful of neighbors organizing one-off grocery runs is now a network of about 20 volunteers supporting 150 families. Myles told me he’s had to discuss the additional grocery trips — and everything else — with his two young children. “I have to explain why we’re doing it,” he said of the deliveries, “and that people are afraid to leave their homes, people are being assaulted and taken just because of the way that they look. Having to explain all of those dynamics to a five- and an eight-year-old, I wish I didn’t have to do that.”

Lyn, a doctor, told me her two teenagers have been “distraught, angry, and deeply saddened” by what’s going on. Many of her son’s classmates are first- or second-generation immigrants from Africa and Latin America. “Some of his friends aren’t going to school,” she said. “One friend’s dad was just abducted, which is what I call it.”

I met Lyn at a Mexican grocery store on the west side of St. Paul, where she was shopping for two families she had been connected with through Neighbors Helping Neighbors. The organization started in mid-December as a local mutual aid project run by a group of friends and has since evolved to a network of more than 500 volunteers who run errands, buy groceries, and crowdfund and deliver rent to families throughout the metropolitan area.

Like nearly every business in the Twin Cities, the grocery store had signs on the door denying ICE agents entry without a judicial warrant. A security guard noticed my photographer’s equipment and asked us to wait in the vestibule while he asked management whether we could enter. This whole nightmare, after all, had started with a right-wing provocateur armed with little more than a front-facing camera. Inside, Lyn loaded up two carts with a week’s worth of essentials — onions, beans, eggs, plantains, cooking oil — and a few treats. “I like to get something sweet for the kids,” she said, reaching for a package of chocolate cookies.

Other customers seemed to be doing the same thing. A woman wearing a hoodie that must have been printed recently — “It’s a Pretti Good day to defend the Constitution,” it read — asked a man whether he needed help with deliveries today. He introduced himself as Marco, and showed me a GoFundMe he’s put together that has raised more than $90,000, which he and a team of volunteers have used to buy groceries and other essentials — diapers, cat litter, dog food — to some 300 families. Marco has taken on other responsibilities, too. One of the women he delivers food to is pregnant and in hiding; Marco told me he connected her to a midwife. He’s seen no signs of the “drawdown” Homan announced.

“They’re still here,” he said. “They’re still brutalizing people.”

Even here, life must go on. Rent was due February 1st, just like it always is. Eight days had passed since Alex Pretti’s killing. In that time, at least 265 people had been sent to Texas on ICE’s charter flights, according to Benson’s daily airport observations. Desperate to avoid the same fate, an unknowable number of people have confined themselves to their homes; their absence is unquantifiable because there’s no reliable way to measure a void.

“We know of countless people who were unable to make rent this month,” Kai Shelley, the city council aide, told me. “There are folks who have received eviction notices, folks who have just been able to eke by this month but know they won’t be able to make it next month. We’re looking at a pretty dire situation.”

The city council unanimously called for a moratorium on evictions in mid-January — in the weeks between Good’s and Pretti’s killings, while ICE arrests continued to climb — but the power to halt evictions lies with Gov. Tim Walz, who has yet to indicate whether he’ll do so. At a city council meeting last Friday, Chughtai, the majority leader, challenged the idea that the city could “GoFundMe its way” out of crisis.

“That doesn’t mean we should stop doing mutual aid, but the only thing that’s for sure going to keep people in their homes right now is if we put a pause on evictions,” Shelley said. “The mutual aid is great, but the mutual aid is there because the government can’t or won’t step up in certain circumstances.”

For now, it’s up to the residents of the Twin Cities to look out for each other. It’s clear no one else will.

Three days before rent was due, I accompanied Kat, a volunteer with Neighbors Helping Neighbors, as she dropped off an envelope full of cash for a family in Midtown Minneapolis. Alex Pretti’s name was spray-painted on the highway barrier walls. “Something that feels particularly salient right now is how much daily life has changed,” she told me, “both from the danger of ICE presence and all the helping that’s going on. People have completely reoriented their day-to-day and week-to-week.”

The occupation isn’t over. Guntly, the activist who set up the surveillance camera network, told me he thinks ICE is biding its time until mid-March, when Temporary Protected Status is set to expire for Somali nationals. DHS is reportedly scouring the suburbs for empty warehouses to convert into detention centers. The day before I arrived in Minneapolis, the department asked to use an Army Reserve base at Fort Snelling, a decommissioned military base next to the airport, to house agents and store weapons. On my last night in town, I met a small group of Indigenous activists who had set up camp across from the historic fort, which is now a museum. The two acres we were standing on had somehow been overlooked in the series of federal treaties that funneled Dakota and Ojibwe lands to the United States. This land still belongs to the Dakota.

They had built a fire, and they planned on staying. The idea was to provide a warm place for protesters and released detainees from Whipple, located less than a mile away, to rest and recharge. Wasu Duta, a Dakota activist, described a clear link between the ICE operation in Minnesota and the dispossession of Native land.

“We have to hold these people accountable for their actions,” he told me. “They actually, under the Constitution, broke their oath and have committed acts of war on our people.” Tribal governments, including the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Navajo Nation, had members questioned and detained by ICE even after showing identification proving their citizenship. In mid-January, a Mdewakanton Dakota woman had been detained by ICE while observing agents from her car. One of the agents reportedly smashed her windows, and she was held at Whipple for 48 hours before being released.

Four tepees have been erected on the snowy ground across the way from Fort Snelling. They stand in the shadow of the old garrison, where a little less than 200 years ago, 1,658 prisoners, most of them women and children, were held during a brutal winter as punishment for the Dakota uprising of 1862. Hundreds died of hunger and disease. An Episcopalian priest pleaded for clemency, and when spring came the government loaded most of the prisoners onto steamboats and deported them to reservations in Nebraska and South Dakota. Henry Whipple couldn’t save them all; of the 303 initially sentenced to death, 38 Dakota men were hanged in what remains the largest mass execution in American history. The Whipple Federal Building opened in 1969, and activists have been trying to get the bishop’s name scrubbed from its walls  since Trump’s first term. Government attorneys are working around the clock to keep immigrants locked up in Whipple, where detainees say they’ve been denied food and medical care.

In 1872, a decade after the Dakota War, the painter John Gast unveiled what would become his most famous work yet. American Progress was Gast’s celebration of manifest destiny, a visual representation of settlers’ triumph. A white angel dominates the small canvas, guiding pioneers farther and farther west. Civilization trails her, and Native people flee in her wake. This new world of railroads and telegraph lines cannot coexist with what came before. The parallels between past and present are obvious to anyone who bothers to look. DHS posted the Gast painting on its X account last summer.

Wildlight Entertainment says it is parting ways with ‘a number’ of its employees.

Highguard, a new multiplayer shooter from developers who worked on games like Apex Legends and Call of Duty, launched just over two weeks ago, but developer Wildlight Entertainment is already cutting jobs at the company, according to posts from affected staffers on LinkedIn. Former Wildlight level designer Alex Graner says that “most of the team at Wildlight” was laid off today, which was backed up by former lead tech artist Josh Sobel.

”Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game,” Wildlight says in a statement. “We’re proud of the team, talent, and the product we’ve created together. We’re also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community.”

Highguard was first announced as the final reveal at The Game Awards in December with a splashy reveal trailer promoting a January 26th launch date. The game reportedly hit nearly 100,000 concurrent players on Steam on launch day, but it has a “Mixed” rating on the platform and has just over 2,400 concurrent players as of this writing, according to SteamDB. The game launched with three-player teams, but shortly after, Wildlight added a limited time 5v5 mode that it made permanent a few days later.

This week, Riot Games also made cuts on a major live service project, laying off about 80 people from its recently-launched 2XKO fighting game set in the League of Legends universe.

Update, February 11th: Added statement from Wildlight.

AI is already making online crimes easier. It could get much worse.

Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers instead argue that we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams.Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money.

AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

Viral AI agent project OpenClaw, which has made headlines across the world in recent weeks, harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out.

In response to these concerns, its creator warned that nontechnical people should not use the software. But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and any AI companies hoping to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research. Read the full story.

The past year has marked a turning point for Chinese AI. Since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, Chinese companies have repeatedly delivered AI models that match the performance of leading Western models at a fraction of the cost.These models differ in a crucial way from most US models like ChatGPT or Claude, which you pay to access and can’t inspect. The Chinese companies publish their models’ weights—numerical values that get set when a model is trained—so anyone can download, run, study, and modify them.

If open-source AI models keep getting better, they will not just offer the cheapest options for people who want access to frontier AI capabilities; they will change where innovation happens and who sets the standards. Here’s what may come next.

EVs are getting cheaper and more common all over the world. But the technology still faces major challenges in some markets, including many countries in Africa.

Some regions across the continent still have limited grid and charging infrastructure, and those that do have widespread electricity access sometimes face reliability issues—a problem for EV owners, who require a stable electricity source to charge up and get around. But there are some signs of progress. Read the full story.

Motor neuron diseases took their voices. AI is bringing them back.Jules Rodriguez lost his voice in October 2024. His speech had been deteriorating since a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2020, but a tracheostomy to help him breathe dealt the final blow.

Rodriguez and his wife, Maria Fernandez, who live in Miami, thought they would never hear his voice again. Then they re-created it using AI. After feeding old recordings of Rodriguez’s voice into a tool trained on voices from film, television, radio, and podcasts, the couple were able to generate a voice clone—a way for Jules to communicate in his “old voice.”

Rodriguez is one of over a thousand people with speech difficulties who have cloned their voices using free software from ElevenLabs. The AI voice clones aren’t perfect. But they represent a vast improvement on previous communication technologies and are already improving the lives of people with motor neuron diseases. Read the full story. —Jessica Hamzelou

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Anton Cherepanov is always on the lookout for something interesting. And in late August last year, he spotted just that. It was a file uploaded to VirusTotal, a site cybersecurity researchers like him use to analyze submissions for potential viruses and other types of malicious software, often known as malware. On the surface it seemed innocuous, but it triggered Cherepanov’s custom malware-detecting measures. Over the next few hours, he and his colleague Peter Strýček inspected the sample and realized they’d never come across anything like it before.

The file contained ransomware, a nasty strain of malware that encrypts the files it comes across on a victim’s system, rendering them unusable until a ransom is paid to the attackers behind it. But what set this example apart was that it employed large language models (LLMs). Not just incidentally, but across every stage of an attack. Once it was installed, it could tap into an LLM to generate customized code in real time, rapidly map a computer to identify sensitive data to copy or encrypt, and write personalized ransom notes based on the files’ content. The software could do this autonomously, without any human intervention. And every time it ran, it would act differently, making it harder to detect.

Cherepanov and Strýček were confident that their discovery, which they dubbed PromptLock, marked a turning point in generative AI, showing how the technology could be exploited to create highly flexible malware attacks. They published a blog post declaring that they’d uncovered the first example of AI-powered ransomware, which quickly became the object of widespread global media attention.

But the threat wasn’t quite as dramatic as it first appeared. The day after the blog post went live, a team of researchers from New York University claimed responsibility, explaining that the malware was not, in fact, a full attack let loose in the wild but a research project, merely designed to prove it was possible to automate each step of a ransomware campaign—which, they said, they had.

PromptLock may have turned out to be an academic project, but the real bad guys are using the latest AI tools. Just as software engineers are using artificial intelligence to help write code and check for bugs, hackers are using these tools to reduce the time and effort required to orchestrate an attack, lowering the barriers for less experienced attackers to try something out.

The likelihood that cyberattacks will now become more common and more effective over time is not a remote possibility but “a sheer reality,” says Lorenzo Cavallaro, a professor of computer science at University College London.

Some in Silicon Valley warn that AI is on the brink of being able to carry out fully automated attacks. But most security researchers say this claim is overblown. “For some reason, everyone is just focused on this malware idea of, like, AI superhackers, which is just absurd,” says Marcus Hutchins, who is principal threat researcher at the security company Expel and famous in the security world for ending a giant global ransomware attack called WannaCry in 2017.

Instead, experts argue, we should be paying closer attention to the much more immediate risks posed by AI, which is already speeding up and increasing the volume of scams. Criminals are increasingly exploiting the latest deepfake technologies to impersonate people and swindle victims out of vast sums of money. These AI-enhanced cyberattacks are only set to get more frequent and more destructive, and we need to be ready.

Attackers started adopting generative AI tools almost immediately after ChatGPT exploded on the scene at the end of 2022. These efforts began, as you might imagine, with the creation of spam—and a lot of it. Last year, a report from Microsoft said that in the year leading up to April 2025, the company had blocked $4 billion worth of scams and fraudulent transactions, “many likely aided by AI content.”

At least half of spam email is now generated using LLMs, according to estimates by researchers at Columbia University, the University of Chicago, and Barracuda Networks, who analyzed nearly 500,000 malicious messages collected before and after the launch of ChatGPT. They also found evidence that AI is increasingly being deployed in more sophisticated schemes. They looked at targeted email attacks, which impersonate a trusted figure in order to trick a worker within an organization out of funds or sensitive information. By April 2025, they found, at least 14% of those sorts of focused email attacks were generated using LLMs, up from 7.6% in April 2024.

In one high-profile case, a worker was tricked into transferring $25 million to criminals via a video call with digital versions of the company’s chief financial officer and other employees.

And the generative AI boom has made it easier and cheaper than ever before to generate not only emails but highly convincing images, videos, and audio. The results are much more realistic than even just a few short years ago, and it takes much less data to generate a fake version of someone’s likeness or voice than it used to.

Criminals aren’t deploying these sorts of deepfakes to prank people or to simply mess around—they’re doing it because it works and because they’re making money out of it, says Henry Ajder, a generative AI expert. “If there’s money to be made and people continue to be fooled by it, they’ll continue to do it,” he says. In one high-­profile case reported in 2024, a worker at the British engineering firm Arup was tricked into transferring $25 million to criminals via a video call with digital versions of the company’s chief financial officer and other employees. That’s likely only the tip of the iceberg, and the problem posed by convincing deepfakes is only likely to get worse as the technology improves and is more widely adopted.

Criminals’ tactics evolve all the time, and as AI’s capabilities improve, such people are constantly probing how those new capabilities can help them gain an advantage over victims. Billy Leonard, tech leader of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, has been keeping a close eye on changes in the use of AI by potential bad actors (a widely used term in the industry for hackers and others attempting to use computers for criminal purposes). In the latter half of 2024, he and his team noticed prospective criminals using tools like Google Gemini the same way everyday users do—to debug code and automate bits and pieces of their work—as well as tasking it with writing the odd phishing email. By 2025, they had progressed to using AI to help create new pieces of malware and release them into the wild, he says.

The big question now is how far this kind of malware can go. Will it ever become capable enough to sneakily infiltrate thousands of companies’ systems and extract millions of dollars, completely undetected?

Most popular AI models have guardrails in place to prevent them from generating malicious code or illegal material, but bad actors still find ways to work around them. For example, Google observed a China-linked actor asking its Gemini AI model to identify vulnerabilities on a compromised system—a request it initially refused on safety grounds. However, the attacker managed to persuade Gemini to break its own rules by posing as a participant in a capture-the-flag competition, a popular cybersecurity game. This sneaky form of jailbreaking led Gemini to hand over information that could have been used to exploit the system. (Google has since adjusted Gemini to deny these kinds of requests.)

But bad actors aren’t just focusing on trying to bend the AI giants’ models to their nefarious ends. Going forward, they’re increasingly likely to adopt open-source AI models, as it’s easier to strip out their safeguards and get them to do malicious things, says Ashley Jess, a former tactical specialist at the US Department of Justice and now a senior intelligence analyst at the cybersecurity company Intel 471. “Those are the ones I think that [bad] actors are going to adopt, because they can jailbreak them and tailor them to what they need,” she says.

The NYU team used two open-source models from OpenAI in its PromptLock experiment, and the researchers found they didn’t even need to resort to jailbreaking techniques to get the model to do what they wanted. They say that makes attacks much easier. Although these kinds of open-source models are designed with an eye to ethical alignment, meaning that their makers do consider certain goals and values in dictating the way they respond to requests, the models don’t have the same kinds of restrictions as their closed-source counterparts, says Meet Udeshi, a PhD student at New York University who worked on the project. “That is what we were trying to test,” he says. “These LLMs claim that they are ethically aligned—can we still misuse them for these purposes? And the answer turned out to be yes.”

It’s possible that criminals have already successfully pulled off covert PromptLock-style attacks and we’ve simply never seen any evidence of them, says Udeshi. If that’s the case, attackers could—in theory—have created a fully autonomous hacking system. But to do that they would have had to overcome the significant barrier that is getting AI models to behave reliably, as well as any inbuilt aversion the models have to being used for malicious purposes—all while evading detection. Which is a pretty high bar indeed.

So, what do we know for sure? Some of the best data we have now on how people are attempting to use AI for malicious purposes comes from the big AI companies themselves. And their findings certainly sound alarming, at least at first. In November, Leonard’s team at Google released a report that found bad actors were using AI tools (including Google’s Gemini) to dynamically alter malware’s behavior; for example, it could self-modify to evade detection. The team wrote that it ushered in “a new operational phase of AI abuse.”

However, the five malware families the report dug into (including PromptLock) consisted of code that was easily detected and didn’t actually do any harm, the cybersecurity writer Kevin Beaumont pointed out on social media. “There’s nothing in the report to suggest orgs need to deviate from foundational security programmes—everything worked as it should,” he wrote.

It’s true that this malware activity is in an early phase, concedes Leonard. Still, he sees value in making these kinds of reports public if it helps security vendors and others build better defenses to prevent more dangerous AI attacks further down the line. “Cliché to say, but sunlight is the best disinfectant,” he says. “It doesn’t really do us any good to keep it a secret or keep it hidden away. We want people to be able to know about this— we want other security vendors to know about this—so that they can continue to build their own detections.”

And it’s not just new strains of malware that would-be attackers are experimenting with—they also seem to be using AI to try to automate the process of hacking targets. In November, Anthropic announced it had disrupted a large-scale cyberattack, the first reported case of one executed without “substantial human intervention.” Although the company didn’t go into much detail about the exact tactics the hackers used, the report’s authors said a Chinese state-sponsored group had used its Claude Code assistant to automate up to 90% of what they called a “highly sophisticated espionage campaign.”

“We’re entering an era where the barrier to sophisticated cyber operations has fundamentally lowered, and the pace of attacks will accelerate faster than many organizations are prepared for.”

But, as with the Google findings, there were caveats. A human operator, not AI, selected the targets before tasking Claude with identifying vulnerabilities. And of 30 attempts, only a “handful” were successful. The Anthropic report also found that Claude hallucinated and ended up fabricating data during the campaign, claiming it had obtained credentials it hadn’t and “frequently” overstating its findings, so the attackers would have had to carefully validate those results to make sure they were actually true. “This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks,” the report’s authors wrote.

Existing controls within any reasonably secure organization would stop these attacks, says Gary McGraw, a veteran security expert and cofounder of the Berryville Institute of Machine Learning in Virginia. “None of the malicious-attack part, like the vulnerability exploit … was actually done by the AI—it was just prefabricated tools that do that, and that stuff’s been automated for 20 years,” he says. “There’s nothing novel, creative, or interesting about this attack.”

Anthropic maintains that the report’s findings are a concerning signal of changes ahead. “Tying this many steps of an intrusion campaign together through [AI] agentic orchestration is unprecedented,” Jacob Klein, head of threat intelligence at Anthropic, said in a statement. “It turns what has always been a labor-intensive process into something far more scalable. We’re entering an era where the barrier to sophisticated cyber operations has fundamentally lowered, and the pace of attacks will accelerate faster than many organizations are prepared for.”

Some are not convinced there’s reason to be alarmed. AI hype has led a lot of people in the cybersecurity industry to overestimate models’ current abilities, Hutchins says. “They want this idea of unstoppable AIs that can outmaneuver security, so they’re forecasting that’s where we’re going,” he says. But “there just isn’t any evidence to support that, because the AI capabilities just don’t meet any of the requirements.”

Indeed, for now criminals mostly seem to be tapping AI to enhance their productivity: using LLMs to write malicious code and phishing lures, to conduct reconnaissance, and for language translation. Jess sees this kind of activity a lot, alongside efforts to sell tools in underground criminal markets. For example, there are phishing kits that compare the click-rate success of various spam campaigns, so criminals can track which campaigns are most effective at any given time. She is seeing a lot of this activity in what could be called the “AI slop landscape” but not as much “widespread adoption from highly technical actors,” she says.

But attacks don’t need to be sophisticated to be effective. Models that produce “good enough” results allow attackers to go after larger numbers of people than previously possible, says Liz James, a managing security consultant at the cybersecurity company NCC Group. “We’re talking about someone who might be using a scattergun approach phishing a whole bunch of people with a model that, if it lands itself on a machine of interest that doesn’t have any defenses … can reasonably competently encrypt your hard drive,” she says. “You’ve achieved your objective.”

For now, researchers are optimistic about our ability to defend against these threats—regardless of whether they are made with AI. “Especially on the malware side, a lot of the defenses and the capabilities and the best practices that we’ve recommended for the past 10-plus years—they all still apply,” says Leonard. The security programs we use to detect standard viruses and attack attempts work; a lot of phishing emails will still get caught in inbox spam filters, for example. These traditional forms of defense will still largely get the job done—at least for now.

And in a neat twist, AI itself is helping to counter security threats more effectively. After all, it is excellent at spotting patterns and correlations. Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security, says that every day, the company processes more than 100 trillion signals flagged by its AI systems as potentially malicious or suspicious events.

Despite the cybersecurity landscape’s constant state of flux, Jess is heartened by how readily defenders are sharing detailed information with each other about attackers’ tactics. Mitre’s Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems and the GenAI Security Project from the Open Worldwide Application Security Project are two helpful initiatives documenting how potential criminals are incorporating AI into their attacks and how AI systems are being targeted by them. “We’ve got some really good resources out there for understanding how to protect your own internal AI toolings and understand the threat from AI toolings in the hands of cybercriminals,” she says.

PromptLock, the result of a limited university project, isn’t representative of how an attack would play out in the real world. But if it taught us anything, it’s that the technical capabilities of AI shouldn’t be dismissed.New York University’s Udeshi says he wastaken aback at how easily AI was able to handle a full end-to-end chain of attack, from mapping and working out how to break into a targeted computer system to writing personalized ransom notes to victims: “We expected it would do the initial task very well but it would stumble later on, but we saw high—80% to 90%—success throughout the whole pipeline.”

AI is still evolving rapidly, and today’s systems are already capable of things that would have seemed preposterously out of reach just a few short years ago. That makes it incredibly tough to say with absolute confidence what it will—or won’t—be able to achieve in the future. While researchers are certain that AI-driven attacks are likely to increase in both volume and severity, the forms they could take are unclear. Perhaps the most extreme possibility is that someone makes an AI model capable of creating and automating its own zero-day exploits—highly dangerous cyber­attacks that take advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities in software. But building and hosting such a model—and evading detection—would require billions of dollars in investment, says Hutchins, meaning it would only be in the reach of a wealthy nation-state.

Engin Kirda, a professor at Northeastern University in Boston who specializes in malware detection and analysis, says he wouldn’t be surprised if this was already happening. “I’m sure people are investing in it, but I’m also pretty sure people are already doing it, especially [in] China—they have good AI capabilities,” he says.

It’s a pretty scary possibility. But it’s one that—thankfully—is still only theoretical. A large-scale campaign that is both effective and clearly AI-driven has yet to materialize. What we can say is that generative AI is already significantly lowering the bar for criminals. They’ll keep experimenting with the newest releases and updates and trying to find new ways to trick us into parting with important information and precious cash. For now, all we can do is be careful, remain vigilant, and—for all our sakes—stay on top of those system updates.

            <div id="article-text">EVs are getting cheaper and more common all over the world. But the technology still faces major challenges in some markets, including many countries in Africa.

Some regions across the continent still have limited grid and charging infrastructure, and those that do have widespread electricity access sometimes face reliability issues—a problem for EV owners, who require a stable electricity source to charge up and get around.

But there are some signs of progress. I just finished up a story about the economic case: A recent study in Nature Energy found that EVs from scooters to minibuses could be cheaper to own than gas-powered vehicles in Africa by 2040.

If there’s one thing to know about EVs in Africa, it’s that each of the 54 countries on the continent faces drastically different needs, challenges, and circumstances. There’s also a wide range of reasons to be optimistic about the prospects for EVs in the near future, including developing policies, a growing grid, and an expansion of local manufacturing.

Even the world’s leading EV markets fall short of Ethiopia’s aggressively pro-EV policies. In 2024, the country became the first in the world to ban the import of non-electric private vehicles.

The case is largely an economic one: Gasoline is expensive there, and the country commissioned Africa’s largest hydropower dam in September 2025, providing a new source of cheap and abundant clean electricity. The nearly $5 billion project has a five-gigawatt capacity, doubling the grid’s peak power in the country.

Much of Ethiopia’s vehicle market is for used cars, and some drivers are still opting for older gas-powered vehicles. But this nudge could help increase the market for EVs there.

Other African countries are also pushing some drivers toward electrification. Rwanda banned new registrations for commercial gas-powered motorbikes in the capital city of Kigali last year, encouraging EVs as an alternative. These motorbike taxis can make up over half the vehicles on the city’s streets, so the move is a major turning point for transportation there.

Smaller two- and three-wheelers are a bright spot for EVs globally: In 2025, EVs made up about 45% of new sales for such vehicles. (For cars and trucks, the share was about 25%.)

And Africa’s local market is starting to really take off. There’s already some local assembly of electric two-wheelers in countries including Morocco, Kenya, and Rwanda, says Nelson Nsitem, lead Africa energy transition analyst at BloombergNEF, an energy consultancy.

Spiro, a Dubai-based electric motorbike company, recently raised $100 million in funding to expand operations in Africa. The company currently assembles its bikes in Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, and Rwanda, and as of October it has over 60,000 bikes deployed and 1,500 battery swap stations operating.

Assembly and manufacturing for larger EVs and batteries is also set to expand. Gotion High-Tech, a Chinese battery company, is currently building Africa’s first battery gigafactory. It’s a $5.6 billion project that could produce 20 gigawatt-hours of batteries annually, starting in 2026. (That’s enough for hundreds of thousands of EVs each year.)

Chinese EV companies are looking to growing markets like Southeast Asia and Africa as they attempt to expand beyond an oversaturated domestic scene. BYD, the world’s largest EV company, is aggressively expanding across South Africa and plans to have as many as 70 dealerships in the country by the end of this year. That will mean more options for people in Africa looking to buy electric.

“You have very high-quality, very affordable vehicles coming onto the market that are benefiting from the economies of scale in China. These countries stand to benefit from that,” says Kelly Carlin, a manager in the program on carbon-free transportation at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an energy think tank. “It’s a game changer,” he adds.

            <div id="article-text">MIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of them here.

The past year has marked a turning point for Chinese AI. Since DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model in January 2025, Chinese companies have repeatedly delivered AI models that match the performance of leading Western models at a fraction of the cost.

Just last week the Chinese firm Moonshot AI released its latest open-weight model, Kimi K2.5, which came close to top proprietary systems such as Anthropic’s Claude Opus on some early benchmarks. The difference: K2.5 is roughly one-seventh Opus’s price.

On Hugging Face, Alibaba’s Qwen family—after ranking as the most downloaded model series in 2025 and 2026—has overtaken Meta’s Llama models in cumulative downloads. And a recent MIT study found that Chinese open-source models have surpassed US models in total downloads. For developers and builders worldwide, access to near-frontier AI capabilities has never been this broad or this affordable.

But these models differ in a crucial way from most US models like ChatGPT or Claude, which you pay to access and can’t inspect. The Chinese companies publish their models’ weights—numerical values that get set when a model is trained—so anyone can download, run, study, and modify them.

If these open-source AI models keep getting better, they will not just offer the cheapest options for people who want access to frontier AI capabilities; they will change where innovation happens and who sets the standards.

When DeepSeek launched R1, much of the initial shock centered on its origin. Suddenly, a Chinese team had released a reasoning model that could stand alongside the best systems from US labs. But the long tail of DeepSeek’s impact had less to do with nationality than with distribution. R1 was released as an open-weight model under a permissive MIT license, allowing anyone to download, inspect, and deploy it. On top of that, DeepSeek also published a paper detailing its training process and techniques. For developers who access models via an API, DeepSeek also undercut competitors on price, offering access at a fraction the cost of OpenAI’s o1, the leading proprietary reasoning model at the time.

Within days of its release, DeepSeek replaced ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app in the US App Store. The moment spilled beyond developer circles into financial markets, triggering a sharp sell-off in US tech stocks that briefly erased roughly $1 trillion in market value. Almost overnight, DeepSeek went from a little-known spin-off team backed by a quantitative hedge fund to the most visible symbol of China’s push for open-source AI.

China’s decision to lean in to open source isn’t surprising. It has the world’s second-largest concentration of AI talent after the US. plus a vast, well-resourced tech industry. After ChatGPT broke into the mainstream, China’s AI sector went through a reckoning—and emerged determined to catch up. Pursuing an open-source strategy was seen as the fastest way to close the gap by rallying developers, spreading adoption, and setting standards.

DeepSeek’s success injected confidence into an industry long used to following global standards rather than setting them. “Thirty years ago, no Chinese person would believe they could be at the center of global innovation,” says Alex Chenglin Wu, CEO and founder of Atoms, an AI agent company and prominent contributor to China’s open-source ecosystem. “DeepSeek shows that with solid technical talent, a supportive environment, and the right organizational culture, it’s possible to do truly world-class work.”

DeepSeek’s breakout moment wasn’t China’s first open-source success. Alibaba’s Qwen Lab had been releasing open-weight models for years. By September 2024,  well before DeepSeek’s V3 launch, Alibaba was saying that global downloads had exceeded 600 million. On Hugging Face, Qwen accounted for more than 30% of all model downloads in 2024. Other institutions, including the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence and the AI firm Baichuan, were also releasing open models as early as 2023.

But since the success of DeepSeek, the field has widened rapidly. Companies such as Z.ai (formerly Zhipu), MiniMax, Tencent, and a growing number of smaller labs have released models that are competitive on reasoning, coding, and agent-style tasks. The growing number of capable models has sped up progress. Capabilities that once took months to make it to the open-source world now emerge within weeks, even days.

“Chinese AI firms have seen real gains from the open-source playbook,” says Liu Zhiyuan, a professor of computer science at Tsinghua University and chief scientist at the AI startup ModelBest. “By releasing strong research, they build reputation and gain free publicity.”

Beyond commercial incentives, Liu says, open source has taken on cultural and strategic weight. “In the Chinese programmer community, open source has become politically correct,” he says, framing it as a response to US dominance in proprietary AI systems.

That shift is also reflected at the institutional level. Universities including Tsinghua have begun encouraging AI development and open-source contributions, while policymakers have moved to formalize those incentives. In August, China’s State Council released a draft policy encouraging universities to reward open-source work, proposing that students’ contributions on platforms such as GitHub or Gitee could eventually be counted toward academic credit.

With growing momentum and a reinforcing feedback loop, China’s push for open-source models is likely to continue in the near term, though its long-term sustainability still hinges on financial results, says Tiezhen Wang, who helps lead work on global AI at Hugging Face. In January, the model labs Z.ai and MiniMax went public in Hong Kong. “Right now, the focus is on making the cake bigger,” says Wang. “The next challenge is figuring out how each company secures its share.”

Chinese open-source models are leading not just in download volume but also in variety. Alibaba’s Qwen has become one of the most diversified open model families in circulation, offering a wide range of variants optimized for different uses. The lineup ranges from lightweight models that can run on a single laptop to large, multi-hundred-billion-parameter systems designed for data-center deployment. Qwen features many task-optimized variants created by the community: the “instruct” models are good at following orders, and “code” variants specialize in coding.

Although this strategy isn’t unique to Chinese labs, Qwen was the first open model family to roll out so many high-quality options that it started to feel like a full product line—one that’s free to use.

The open-weight nature of these releases also makes it easy for others to adapt them through techniques like fine-tuning and distillation, which means training a smaller model to mimic a larger one.  According to ATOM (American Truly Open Models), a project by the AI researcher Nathan Lambert, by August 4, 2025, model variations derived from Qwen were “more than 40%” of new Hugging Face language-model derivatives, while Llama had fallen to about 15%. This means that Qwen has become the default base model for all the “remixes.”

This pattern has made the case for smaller, more specialized models. “Compute and energy are real constraints for any deployment,” Liu says. He told MIT Technology Review that the rise of small models is about making AI cheaper to run and easier for more people to use. His company, ModelBest, focuses on small language models designed to run locally on devices such as phones, cars, and other consumer hardware.

While an average user might interact with AI only through the web or an app for simple conversations, power users of AI models with some technical background are experimenting with giving AI more autonomy to solve large-scale problems. OpenClaw, an open-source AI agent that recently went viral within the AI hacker world, allows AI to take over your computer—it can run 24-7, going through your emails and work tasks without supervision.

OpenClaw, like many other open-source tools, allows users to connect to different AI models via an application programming interface, or API. Within days of OpenClaw’s release, the team revealed that Kimi’s K2.5 had surpassed Claude Opus and became the most used AI model—by token count, meaning it was handling more total text processed across user prompts and model responses.

Cost has been a major reason Chinese models have gained traction, but it would be a mistake to treat them as mere “dupes” of Western frontier systems, Wang suggests. Like any product, a model only needs to be good enough for the job at hand.

The landscape of open-source models in China is also getting more specialized. Research groups such as Shanghai AI Laboratory have released models geared toward scientific and technical tasks; several projects from Tencent have focused specifically on music generation. Ubiquant, a quantitative finance firm like DeepSeek’s parent High-Flyer, has released an open model aimed at medical reasoning.

In the meantime, innovative architectural ideas from Chinese labs are being picked up more broadly. DeepSeek has published work exploring model efficiency and memory; techniques that compress the model’s attention “cache,” reducing memory and inference costs while mostly preserving performance, have drawn significant attention in the research community.

“The impact of these research breakthroughs is amplified because they’re open-sourced and can be picked up quickly across the field,” says Wang.

The adoption of Chinese models is picking up in Silicon Valley, too. Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, has put a number on it: Among startups pitching with open-source stacks, there’s about an 80% chance they’re running on Chinese open models, according to a post he made on X. Usage data tells a similar story. OpenRouter,  a middleman that tracks how people use different AI models through its API, shows Chinese open models rising from almost none in late 2024 to nearly 30% of usage in some recent weeks.

The demand is also rising globally. Z.ai limited new subscriptions to its GLM coding plan (a coding tool based on its flagship GLM models) after demand surged, citing compute constraints. What’s notable is where the demand is coming from: CNBC reports that the system’s user base is primarily concentrated in the United States and China, followed by India, Japan, Brazil, and the UK.

“The open-source ecosystems in China and the US are tightly bound together,” says Wang at Hugging Face. Many Chinese open models still rely on Nvidia and US cloud platforms to train and serve them, which keeps the business ties tangled. Talent is fluid too: Researchers move across borders and companies, and many still operate as a global community, sharing code and ideas in public.

That interdependence is part of what makes Chinese developers feel optimistic about this moment: The work travels, gets remixed, and actually shows up in products. But openness can also accelerate the competition. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, made a version of this point after DeepSeek’s 2025 releases: He wrote that export controls are “not a way to duck the competition” between the US and China, and that AI companies in the US “must have better models” if they want to prevail.

For the past decade, the story of Chinese tech in the West has been one of big expectations that ran into scrutiny, restrictions, and political backlash. This time the export isn’t just an app or a consumer platform. It’s the underlying model layer that other people build on. Whether that will play out differently is still an open question.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">AI agents are a risky business. Even when stuck inside the chatbox window, LLMs will make mistakes and behave badly. Once they have tools that they can use to interact with the outside world, such as web browsers and email addresses, the consequences of those mistakes become far more serious.

That might explain why the first breakthrough LLM personal assistant came not from one of the major AI labs, which have to worry about reputation and liability, but from an independent software engineer, Peter Steinberger. In November of 2025, Steinberger uploaded his tool, now called OpenClaw, to GitHub, and in late January the project went viral.

OpenClaw harnesses existing LLMs to let users create their own bespoke assistants. For some users, this means handing over reams of personal data, from years of emails to the contents of their hard drive. That has security experts thoroughly freaked out. The risks posed by OpenClaw are so extensive that it would probably take someone the better part of a week to read all of the security blog posts on it that have cropped up in the past few weeks. The Chinese government took the step of issuing a public warning about OpenClaw’s security vulnerabilities.

In response to these concerns, Steinberger posted on X that nontechnical people should not use the software. (He did not respond to a request for comment for this article.) But there’s a clear appetite for what OpenClaw is offering, and it’s not limited to people who can run their own software security audits. Any AI companies that hope to get in on the personal assistant business will need to figure out how to build a system that will keep users’ data safe and secure. To do so, they’ll need to borrow approaches from the cutting edge of agent security research.

OpenClaw is, in essence, a mecha suit for LLMs. Users can choose any LLM they like to act as the pilot; that LLM then gains access to improved memory capabilities and the ability to set itself tasks that it repeats on a regular cadence. Unlike the agentic offerings from the major AI companies, OpenClaw agents are meant to be on 24-7, and users can communicate with them using WhatsApp or other messaging apps. That means they can act like a superpowered personal assistant who wakes you each morning with a personalized to-do list, plans vacations while you work, and spins up new apps in its spare time.

But all that power has consequences. If you want your AI personal assistant to manage your inbox, then you need to give it access to your email—and all the sensitive information contained there. If you want it to make purchases on your behalf, you need to give it your credit card info. And if you want it to do tasks on your computer, such as writing code, it needs some access to your local files.

There are a few ways this can go wrong. The first is that the AI assistant might make a mistake, as when a user’s Google Antigravity coding agent reportedly wiped his entire hard drive. The second is that someone might gain access to the agent using conventional hacking tools and use it to either extract sensitive data or run malicious code. In the weeks since OpenClaw went viral, security researchers have demonstrated numerous such vulnerabilities that put security-naïve users at risk.

Both of these dangers can be managed: Some users are choosing to run their OpenClaw agents on separate computers or in the cloud, which protects data on their hard drives from being erased, and other vulnerabilities could be fixed using tried-and-true security approaches.

But the experts I spoke to for this article were focused on a much more insidious security risk known as prompt injection. Prompt injection is effectively LLM hijacking: Simply by posting malicious text or images on a website that an LLM might peruse, or sending them to an inbox that an LLM reads, attackers can bend it to their will.

And if that LLM has access to any of its user’s private information, the consequences could be dire. “Using something like OpenClaw is like giving your wallet to a stranger in the street,” says Nicolas Papernot, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Toronto. Whether or not the major AI companies can feel comfortable offering personal assistants may come down to the quality of the defenses that they can muster against such attacks.

It’s important to note here that prompt injection has not yet caused any catastrophes, or at least none that have been publicly reported. But now that there are likely hundreds of thousands of OpenClaw agents buzzing around the internet, prompt injection might start to look like a much more appealing strategy for cybercriminals. “Tools like this are incentivizing malicious actors to attack a much broader population,” Papernot says.

The term “prompt injection” was coined by the popular LLM blogger Simon Willison in 2022, a couple of months before ChatGPT was released. Even back then, it was possible to discern that LLMs would introduce a completely new type of security vulnerability once they came into widespread use. LLMs can’t tell apart the instructions that they receive from users and the data that they use to carry out those instructions, such as emails and web search results—to an LLM, they’re all just text. So if an attacker embeds a few sentences in an email and the LLM mistakes them for an instruction from its user, the attacker can get the LLM to do anything it wants.

Prompt injection is a tough problem, and it doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon. “We don’t really have a silver-bullet defense right now,” says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley. But there’s a robust academic community working on the problem, and they’ve come up with strategies that could eventually make AI personal assistants safe.

Technically speaking, it is possible to use OpenClaw today without risking prompt injection: Just don’t connect it to the internet. But restricting OpenClaw from reading your emails, managing your calendar, and doing online research defeats much of the purpose of using an AI assistant. The trick of protecting against prompt injection is to prevent the LLM from responding to hijacking attempts while still giving it room to do its job.

One strategy is to train the LLM to ignore prompt injections. A major part of the LLM development process, called post-training, involves taking a model that knows how to produce realistic text and turning it into a useful assistant by “rewarding” it for answering questions appropriately and “punishing” it when it fails to do so. These rewards and punishments are metaphorical, but the LLM learns from them as an animal would. Using this process, it’s possible to train an LLM not to respond to specific examples of prompt injection.

But there’s a balance: Train an LLM to reject injected commands too enthusiastically, and it might also start to reject legitimate requests from the user. And because there’s a fundamental element of randomness in LLM behavior, even an LLM that has been very effectively trained to resist prompt injection will likely still slip up every once in a while.

Another approach involves halting the prompt injection attack before it ever reaches the LLM. Typically, this involves using a specialized detector LLM to determine whether or not the data being sent to the original LLM contains any prompt injections. In a recent study, however, even the best-performing detector completely failed to pick up on certain categories of prompt injection attack.

The third strategy is more complicated. Rather than controlling the inputs to an LLM by detecting whether or not they contain a prompt injection, the goal is to formulate a policy that guides the LLM’s outputs—i.e., its behaviors—and prevents it from doing anything harmful. Some defenses in this vein are quite simple: If an LLM is allowed to email only a few pre-approved addresses, for example, then it definitely won’t send its user’s credit card information to an attacker. But such a policy would prevent the LLM from completing many useful tasks, such as researching and reaching out to potential professional contacts on behalf of its user.

“The challenge is how to accurately define those policies,” says Neil Gong, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke University. “It’s a trade-off between utility and security.”

On a larger scale, the entire agentic world is wrestling with that trade-off: At what point will agents be secure enough to be useful? Experts disagree. Song, whose startup, Virtue AI, makes an agent security platform, says she thinks it’s possible to safely deploy an AI personal assistant now. But Gong says, “We’re not there yet.”

Even if AI agents can’t yet be entirely protected against prompt injection, there are certainly ways to mitigate the risks. And it’s possible that some of those techniques could be implemented in OpenClaw. Last week, at the inaugural ClawCon event in San Francisco, Steinberger announced that he’d brought a security person on board to work on the tool.

As of now, OpenClaw remains vulnerable, though that hasn’t dissuaded its multitude of enthusiastic users. George Pickett, a volunteer maintainer of the OpenGlaw GitHub repository and a fan of the tool, says he’s taken some security measures to keep himself safe while using it: He runs it in the cloud, so that he doesn’t have to worry about accidentally deleting his hard drive, and he’s put mechanisms in place to ensure that no one else can connect to his assistant.

But he hasn’t taken any specific actions to prevent prompt injection. He’s aware of the risk but says he hasn’t yet seen any reports of it happening with OpenClaw. “Maybe my perspective is a stupid way to look at it, but it’s unlikely that I’ll be the first one to be hacked,” he says.

A “QuitGPT” campaign is urging people to cancel their ChatGPT subscriptions

In September, Alfred Stephen, a freelance software developer in Singapore, purchased a ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs $20 a month and offers more access to advanced models, to speed up his work. But he grew frustrated with the chatbot’s coding abilities and its gushing, meandering replies. Then he came across a post on Reddit about a campaign called QuitGPT.QuitGPT is one of the latest salvos in a growing movement by activists and disaffected users to cancel their subscriptions. In just the past few weeks, users have flooded Reddit with stories about quitting the chatbot. And while it’s unclear how many users have joined the boycott, there’s no denying QuitGPT is getting attention. Read the full story.

EVs could be cheaper to own than gas cars in Africa by 2040

Electric vehicles could be economically competitive in Africa sooner than expected. Just 1% of new cars sold across the continent in 2025 were electric, but a new analysis finds that with solar off-grid charging, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles by 2040.There are major barriers to higher EV uptake in many countries in Africa, including a sometimes unreliable grid, limited charging infrastructure, and a lack of access to affordable financing. But as batteries and the vehicles they power continue to get cheaper, the economic case for EVs is building. Read the full story.

MIT Technology Review Narrated: How next-generation nuclear reactors break out of the 20th-century blueprint

The popularity of commercial nuclear reactors has surged in recent years as worries about climate change and energy independence drowned out concerns about meltdowns and radioactive waste.The problem is, building nuclear power plants is expensive and slow.

A new generation of nuclear power technology could reinvent what a reactor looks like—and how it works. Advocates hope that new tech can refresh the industry and help replace fossil fuels without emitting greenhouse gases.This is our latest story to be turned into a MIT Technology Review Narrated podcast, which we’re publishing each week on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

“These companies are terrified that no one’s going to notice them.”

—Tom Goodwin, co-founder of business consulting firm All We Have Is Now, tells the Guardian why AI startups are going to increasingly desperate measures to grab would-be customers’ attention.

How AI is changing gymnastics judgingThe 2023 World Championships last October marked the first time an AI judging system was used on every apparatus in a gymnastics competition. There are obvious upsides to using this kind of technology: AI could help take the guesswork out of the judging technicalities. It could even help to eliminate biases, making the sport both more fair and more transparent.At the same time, others fear AI judging will take away something that makes gymnastics special. Gymnastics is a subjective sport, like diving or dressage, and technology could eliminate the judges’ role in crafting a narrative.For better or worse, AI has officially infiltrated the world of gymnastics. The question now is whether it really makes it fairer. Read the full story.

            <div id="article-text">Have you ever asked Alexa to remind you to send a WhatsApp message at a determined hour? And then you just wonder, ‘Why can’t Alexa just send the message herself?

Or the incredible frustration when you use an app to plan a trip, only to have to jump to your calendar/booking website/tour/bank account instead of your AI assistant doing it all? Well, exactly this gap between AI automation and human action is what the agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol aims to address.

With the introduction of AI Agents, the next step of evolution seemed to be communication. But when communication between machines and humans is already here, what’s left?

Well, thinking about creating a multi-agent ecosystem to break the siloes between data systems and applications, Google announced the A2A protocol last year, in collaboration with more than 50 tech partners, an open standard protocol that allows AI agents to communicate, securely exchange information, collaborate, and operate between agentic applications and complex enterprise workflows, no matter their underlying technology.

A2A is designed under five principles, which are natural capabilities. It enables the agents to collaborate in their natural modality without an intermediary tool, allowing agents to retain their individual capabilities and independence.

A workspace designed for growth, collaboration, and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech.

It is built on existing standards, making it easier to integrate with existing IT stacks, and paired with OpenAPI’s (Application Programming Interfaces) authentication schemes to guarantee secure collaboration. It provides real-life feedback as well as asynchronous notifications for long-running operations (LRO). Lastly, it was designed to support various modalities, including text, audio, and video streaming.

Announcing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A). Image: Google

A2A works as a facilitator between a “client” agent and a “remote” agent. The client agent requests and communicates the tasks, while the remote agent is responsible for taking action on those tasks, looking for the best solution or input. This process involves several stages and key components:

This protocol complements Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) for building robust agentic applications, since MCP provides agent-to-tool communication, allowing a better understanding and processing of abstract APIs to be used as tools, while the A2A protocol enables agents to discover each other’s capabilities, supporting the growth of agentic systems.

The A2A protocol was built to tackle the interoperability gap between specialized AI agents, with enterprise-scale adoption in mind. Instead of treating agents as isolated tools, like MCP works, A2A enables a shared ecosystem where agents can interact as agents, preserving their unique capabilities and higher-quality outcomes.

It also rethinks execution by allowing customizable, secure collaboration between opaque agents, preserving data privacy and intellectual property by design. As the number of agents and interactions grows, A2A addresses scalability head-on, enabling seamless integration and the emergence of complex AI ecosystems within enterprise systems, while relying on established standards, like HTTPS, and JSON-RPC to avoid reinventing core technologies, and existing web standards for authentication, authorization, security, privacy, tracing, and monitoring.

A2A has applications across a wide range of industries, including customer service, supply chain, human resources, healthcare, research, education, creative industries, public services, financial services, IT operations, and consulting.

By enabling agent collaboration across applications and organizations, it supports advanced data analysis and task automation, from background screenings and inventory logistics to enhanced fraud detection and highly personalized customer solutions.

Despite its promises, A2A is not without challenges. Like most distributed systems, one of the main concerns is security. Continuous back-and-forth communication within agents increases the threat to security across multiple layers, from identity and message, to context propagation and system management.

This problem highlights the need for an intrinsic identity, integrity, and sequencing guarantees for A2A, alongside the challenge of including this without compromising its lightweight design and interoperability.

A second limitation emerges at the architectural level, particularly in enterprise-scale AI communication. A2A relies primarily on HTTPS and high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in direct point-to-point communication.

While this works on a small scale, it can become a complex and unsustainable risk for large-scale enterprise environments. Single changes, overlaps, failures, or misrouted messages can cause cascade effects, enabling potential operational risk unless complemented with additional orchestration and governance mechanisms.

The incredibly fast introduction and adoption of AI agents, from AI agents to Agentic AI, has made it a necessity to be able to evolve alongside the technology. A2A marks a clear shift in how AI systems are thought and designed, creating an ecosystem to break the siloes and allowing cross-collaboration among agents.

It is, doubtlessly, necessary for modernity, and while it presents challenges and limitations, it is worth remembering that it is still in early stages and improvements will come while the protocol matures.

Alongside the MCP and LLMs, A2A enables a broader agent stack that suggests an emerging blueprint for agentic AI: where communication, execution, and governance are managed at distinct layers, enabling agents to act in real-world systems.

The real significance of A2A is what it signals about where AI is heading. The next generation of AI will not be defined by a single, all-purpose model, but by interconnected ecosystems of agents designed to work together by default.

            <div id="article-text">Imagine the moment you bring a new dog or cat into your life. That mix of excitement and responsibility. Vet visits, vaccines, learning what food suits them, managing check-ups, and always wondering how to keep them healthy as they grow.

Most pet insurance only steps in after a costly accident or illness. It doesn’t help you avoid the situation in the first place. Lassie’s product is built around a different insight: giving owners the tools to look after their pets every day, not just when something goes wrong.

Now, Stockholm-based insurtech Lassie has secured $75 million in a Series C round as it moves to scale its automated, preventive-first pet care platform across Europe. The financing follows a strong commercial run in which Lassie surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), a notable milestone for a pet-focused underwriting business.

The round drew support from prominent European investors, including Balderton Capital, Felix Capital, Inventure, Passion Capital, and Stena Sessan, signaling broad interest in technologies that blur the line between insurance and day-to-day wellbeing.

Lassie was founded to rethink pet insurance not as a passive safety net but as an active partner in animal health. Its app encourages owners to track diet, activity, and preventive health behaviours, earning rewards and lowering premiums along the way.

At the same time, its backend uses automation and AI to streamline claims, in some cases completing reimbursements within minutes after users upload a bill.

Surpassing $100 million in ARR positions Lassie among the faster-growing insurtechs in Europe. Its core markets include Sweden, Germany, and France, and the fresh capital will accelerate further rollout into key European territories.

Moreover, the company plans to invest in its AI claims and preventive health stack, deepen partnerships with brands such as Lidl and Tractive, and explore adjacent services within the broader pet care category.

At its core, Lassie’s rise is a reflection of how people now think about pets: not as occasional expenses but as family members whose health matters every day. It is shaping an ecosystem where care, knowledge, and proactive habits are as much part of the offering as reimbursement for vet bills.

            <h2>Understanding the valuation of intangible assets in tech deals</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-12</strong></p>

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">In a technology M&A deal, whether you are acquiring or selling a tech or software business, valuation rarely hinges on a single dimension.

Financial performance, growth efficiency, and cash flow durability remain the backbone of any transaction. In practical terms, this means metrics such as revenue and ARR, retention as a proxy for revenue quality, margin structure, and capital intensity continue to anchor how buyers price risk.

However, alongside these tangible indicators sits another layer of value, one that does not always surface cleanly in financial statements and may even remain invisible if it is not properly understood or articulated: intangible assets.

Put simply, intangible assets are the non-physical elements a company has built that enable it to generate revenue, scale efficiently, or defend its market position. In technology companies, this typically includes proprietary software, intellectual property, datasets, customer relationships, brand equity, and internal systems or processes.

Many of these assets do not fully appear in financial statements. Others are only partially captured through accounting treatment. Yet in a transaction context, they often influence how sustainable, transferable, and defensible a company’s performance really is.

Understanding how tangible performance and intangible value interact, rather than compete, is key to interpreting how modern technology deals are ultimately priced. For founders in particular, recognising and articulating this invisible layer of value can meaningfully influence how buyers assess upside and risk.

When evaluating the opportunity to acquire a business, before any discussion of intellectual property or strategic upside enters the room, investors and acquirers start by looking at the fundamentals. These typically include:

These financial metrics ultimately determine whether a deal fits within an acquirer’s investment thesis, its baseline valuation range, and, where relevant, its financing capacity (think LBOs). In this sense, they shape downside protection for both buyers and lenders.

This also explains why a company with weak financial fundamentals will struggle to command an above-market valuation, or even sustained interest, purely on the strength of its technology or brand.

However, once those fundamentals are established, buyers begin looking beneath the performance. That is where intangible assets have the opportunity to influence perception and pricing.

Two companies may show similar revenue, growth, and margin profiles on paper. Yet one may command a higher valuation than the other. The difference often lies in how durable and transferable their performance really is, and how well their story aligns with an acquirer’s strategic priorities. That is the kind of value reflected in a well-structured narrative of intangible value.

In software businesses, value creation is embedded in systems rather than physical infrastructure. Recurring revenue is supported by intellectual property, scalable processes, integrations, switching costs, customer success frameworks, and brand trust. None of these sit neatly on a balance sheet, yet all shape how defensible revenue will be post-acquisition.

From a buyer’s perspective, the question is not only how the company has performed, but how repeatable that performance will be under new ownership.

To analyse intangible assets more systematically, specialist consulting teams such as COFI solutions, often group them into four different components of intellectual capital. This helps structure due diligence and isolate risk.

Customer capital reflects the value embedded in commercial relationships.

This includes contracted recurring revenue, retention dynamics, expansion pathways, brand loyalty, and market access. In many technology acquisitions, buyers underwrite the predictability and growth potential of the customer base as much as the product itself.

There are transactions where access to customers or distribution is the primary driver. A buyer may already have comparable technology but lack penetration in a specific vertical or geography. Acquiring that customer ecosystem can accelerate growth far faster than building it organically.

Talent concentration is another defining characteristic of software companies. This is why the term “acquihire” is often used to describe acquisitions primarily driven by the desire to secure talent, a dynamic more common in lower- to mid-market transactions.

From a deal standpoint, engineering expertise, product vision, and institutional knowledge often sit with relatively small teams. This makes human capital highly valuable, but also fragile.

Key considerations in M&A transactions typically include founder dependency, retention risk, leadership depth, and cultural alignment. If too much knowledge sits with a handful of individuals, buyers will structure protections accordingly.

In acquihire scenarios, for instance, retention structures and incentive packages become central to preserving deal value.

Structural capital refers to the institutionalised knowledge that remains within the company, independent of specific individuals.

Examples include proprietary codebases, documented product architecture, patents, data infrastructure, operating playbooks, and internal tooling.

For acquirers, structural capital is often the most transferable form of intangible value. Well-documented systems reduce post-acquisition integration risk and allow buyers to scale the platform without relying on any single employee.

Partnership ecosystems can also influence valuation where they unlock revenue or create defensibility. This includes channel partnerships, platform integrations, supplier agreements, and marketplace relationships.

Acquirers will assess how durable these partnerships are and whether they transfer contractually post-transaction. Agreements containing change-of-control clauses, for instance, can introduce risk.

Where alliances materially drive growth, they can become an embedded component of enterprise value when supported by a robust strategic rationale.

Despite their abstract nature, intangible assets are not valued purely on narrative. Acquirers typically triangulate across several methodologies to ground their assessment. The three more common approaches are:

In software, this includes engineering time, development cost, data accumulation, and opportunity cost. If a platform represents years of R&D investment, its replacement cost can establish a meaningful valuation baseline.

2. Income approach: Here, the focus shifts to future cash flows attributable to the intangible asset.

For example, proprietary technology that enables premium pricing or higher retention may justify incremental valuation. The same applies to automation systems that structurally improve margins. This approach directly links intellectual property to financial performance.

3. Transferability analysis: Not all intangible value transfers equally.

Assets embedded in code, contracts, or documented processes move relatively cleanly. Knowledge held informally by founders or key employees is harder to transfer and, therefore risk-adjusted in pricing.

This is why documentation depth, process institutionalisation, and talent retention planning feature so prominently in diligence.

For founders, the practical importance of intangible assets often emerges during negotiation rather than the initial valuation setting.

While financial metrics explain historical performance and anchor valuation ranges, intangible assets help frame future potential and defensibility, often supporting outcomes towards the upper end of those ranges.

When clearly articulated, they can influence deal structure, including earn-out frameworks, rollover equity, and retention incentives.

They also help buyers underwrite post-deal risk. If revenue durability depends heavily on undocumented processes or founder relationships, that risk will be priced in.

Conversely, companies that institutionalise knowledge and diversify customer exposure tend to command stronger negotiating positions.

In founder-led processes, advisers such as L40 often see valuation inflection points emerge when intellectual property, customer capital, and operational infrastructure are clearly mapped and evidenced during diligence.

The most sophisticated technology valuations do not treat tangible and intangible assets as competing forces. Instead, they assess how the two reinforce one another.

In other words, intangible assets help create alignment. Financial statements explain the past and the present performance of a business, and to some extent its sustainability, but intangible assets provide a lens through which to frame its future potential.

Strong financial performance without defensible intellectual property may limit strategic upside. Equally, strong technology without revenue traction rarely commands premium pricing.

The highest valuations tend to emerge where:

In that balance sits the true enterprise value of a software company. Performance establishes credibility. Intangible assets shape how far that performance can extend under new ownership.

M&A advisory firms specializing in tech deals, such as L40, work with technology founders to translate intangible assets into clear, defensible value during M&A processes, ensuring negotiations reflect what truly drives the business forward.

            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">For families living with neurodegenerative disease, the hardest part is not always the diagnosis. It is the slow erosion that follows: memory fading, personality shifting, independence shrinking.

It unfolds quietly. First, forgotten appointments. Then repeated questions. Then moments when a familiar face no longer feels familiar.

The illness does not isolate itself to one body. It rearranges the lives around it. Partners become caregivers. Children become decision-makers. Conversations grow shorter. Patience grows thinner. Guilt creeps in, for being tired, for wishing things were easier, for missing the person who is still physically there.

Neurodegeneration is rarely a single patient story. It is a family condition, stretching across kitchens, hospital corridors, and years that feel longer than they should.

Dublin-based Aerska has raised $39 million in fresh funding to battle one of the biggest scientific barriers standing between patients and meaningful treatment: getting advanced genetic medicines into the brain.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

The round was co-led by EQT Life Sciences and age1, two investors known for backing high-risk, high-impact biotech. Their bet is not just on a platform, but on the possibility that diseases once managed only at the margins could eventually be slowed at their root.

Think of the brain as a house with very strict security at the door. That security system, called the blood-brain barrier, protects us from harmful substances in the blood. The problem is that it is so strict that it also blocks many medicines.

So even if scientists create a smart treatment that can “turn off” a harmful gene linked to diseases like Alzheimer’s, the drug often cannot physically get inside the brain cells where it needs to work.

Aerska is trying to solve that access problem.

Instead of injecting medicine directly into the brain, which is invasive and risky, they are developing a way to send it through the bloodstream like a normal injection. Their technology acts like a special pass that lets the treatment cross the brain’s security gate. Once inside, the medicine can reduce the production of the proteins that drive disease.

In simple terms, the science to switch off bad genes already exists. The hard part is delivery. Aerska is building the delivery vehicle.

The company’s early focus includes genetic drivers of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Both remain incurable. Existing drugs largely manage symptoms rather than altering the course of decline.

RNA interference, by contrast, aims to reduce the production of disease-causing proteins themselves. It is a strategy that addresses biology upstream, not downstream.

Longevity has become the “American dream” in European biotech, yet most serious investors are looking less at life extension and more at healthspan,  years lived with clarity and autonomy.

That is the space Aerska is positioning itself in. The goal is not abstract immortality. It is more time at home, more recognisable faces, and more preserved dignity.

The $39 million will fund preclinical development and early clinical steps. The scientific obsacle remain significant, and neurological drug development has humbled many before. But systemic RNA delivery to the brain, if proven safe and effective, would mark a structural shift in how these diseases are approached.

For now, Aerska represents something simpler: a European biotech choosing to confront one of medicine’s most stubborn frontiers,  not with incremental symptom control, but with the ambition to change the trajectory itself.

            <div id="article-text">We stand at one of history’s most exhilarating crossroads. Artificial intelligence is rewriting the rules of work, business, and human potential at breathtaking speed. The very capabilities that make us most human, our creativity, our imagination, our ability to dream up what doesn’t yet exist, are becoming our most valuable assets.

This is not a story about humans versus machines. It’s a story about human potential unleashed. It’s about a future where technology handles the tedious so we can focus on the transcendent.

Where the dreamers, the questioners, the bold thinkers who color outside the lines are not just welcomed, they are essential.

Imagine a world where you never again have to spend hours on mind-numbing data entry, formatting documents, or wrestling with spreadsheets, where the repetitive tasks that drain your energy and dull your spirit are handled instantly by AI, freeing you to focus on work that genuinely excites you.

What we are witnessing is not the replacement of human workers; it is the liberation of human potential. AI is taking on the equivalent of heavy lifting, and in doing so, it’s creating space for something extraordinary: a global renaissance of creative thinking.

Think about what becomes possible when you’re freed from the mundane. When a graphic designer no longer spends half their day on production tasks, they can explore ten bold creative directions instead of one safe option.

When a teacher is not buried in administrative work, they can devise innovative ways to spark curiosity in every student. When operational details do not consume an entrepreneur, they can envision entirely new possibilities for serving their customers.

This is the gift AI is giving us: time and mental space to be more fully human, more creative, more imaginative than ever before.

Here is what the smartest organisations are discovering: when everyone has access to the same powerful AI tools, the differentiator is not the technology. It’s the human wielding it.

Two companies can use identical AI platforms. One generates competent but forgettable content. The other creates campaigns that move people to tears, spark movements, and transform markets. The difference? Creative vision. Human imagination. The ability to ask questions that AI would never think to ask.

The most successful people in the AI era won’t be those who compete with machines at what machines do well. They will be those who ask better questions.

The creative thinker who asks “What if we completely reimagined this?” instead of “How can we make this 10% better?” The visionary who wonders “What problem are we not seeing?” instead of “How do we solve this defined problem?” The innovator who questions “Why are we doing this at all?” instead of “How can we do this more efficiently?”

These questions change trajectories. They open new possibilities. They create breakthroughs. And they can only come from curious, creative human minds willing to challenge assumptions and imagine alternatives.

It is true that AI will displace certain positions, as noted by the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report. It projects that 92 million roles will be displaced by 2030, with positions like graphic designers and administrative assistants among those facing decline due to automation and generative AI.

This technological disruption is simultaneously unleashing a creative renaissance. The same WEF report reveals that 170 million new roles will be created, resulting in a net gain of 78 million jobs, with creative thinking, resilience, flexibility, and agility emerging as some of the fastest-growing skills in demand alongside technical capabilities.

Forbes has noted that innovation and creativity rank among the top skills needed for the future, with employers recognising that while AI may displace 14% of jobs by 2030, the aspects of innovation that revolve around human empathy and deeper consciousness cannot be replicated by machines.

The message is clear: as AI handles the repetitive and predictable, human creativity becomes not just valuable but essential. Organisations are not looking for people who can compete with AI at computational tasks; they are seeking creative thinkers who can imagine entirely new possibilities and ask questions machines would never consider.

The uniquely human qualities of intuition, empathy, and visionary thinking to solve problems that have not even been defined yet.

Here is the beauty about creative thinking: it’s not a single skill or talent. It’s a constellation of capabilities, and each person’s constellation is unique.

Maybe you are brilliant at seeing patterns others miss, connecting dots across completely different domains. Perhaps you have an uncanny ability to understand what people truly need, even when they can’t articulate it themselves.

You might be exceptional at taking a spark of an idea and developing it into something magnificent, or at bringing people together in ways that generate creative breakthroughs.

Some creative thinkers are wildly imaginative, dreaming up possibilities that seem to come from nowhere. Others are integrative, synthesizing diverse ideas into coherent wholes. Some challenge every assumption; others build masterfully on existing foundations. Some think in images, others in systems, still others in stories.

Every version is valuable. Every version is needed.

The AI era does not demand that you become someone you’re not. It invites you to become more fully yourself: to lean into your natural creative strengths and develop them intentionally. Your particular way of thinking creatively is your signature, your competitive advantage, your gift to offer the world.

The creative thinkers of the next decade won’t be lone geniuses toiling in isolation. They will be collaborative creators, working alongside both humans and AI to achieve things neither could accomplish alone.

Imagine participating in creative collaborations where AI handles the analytical heavy lifting while you and your colleagues focus on vision, judgment, and inspiration. Where technology expands what’s possible while human creativity provides direction and meaning.

Where diverse perspectives combine with computational power to solve challenges that once seemed insurmountable.

This is already happening. Architects are using AI to explore thousands of design possibilities, then applying their creative judgment to create buildings that inspire.

Scientists are using AI to identify patterns in vast datasets, then applying creative thinking to formulate revolutionary hypotheses.

Artists are using AI as a creative tool, generating works that express uniquely human perspectives in entirely new ways. You can be part of this creative renaissance. Your ideas, your questions, your unique perspective matter more than ever.

The accelerating pace of change in our world makes creative thinking not just valuable but essential for adaptation and survival. The challenges we face: climate change, resource scarcity, social fragmentation, and emerging technologies with unpredictable consequences don’t have predetermined solutions in any playbook.

They require the kind of flexible, imaginative thinking that can break free from established frameworks and conventional wisdom. Moreover, as the half-life of specific technical skills continues to shrink, the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn ( which is itself a creative process) becomes more important than mastery of any particular tool or technique.

Those who can think creatively can pivot between domains, see opportunities in disruption, and continuously reinvent themselves and their contributions.

Perhaps most importantly, creative thinking will be crucial for maintaining meaning and purpose in an increasingly automated world.

As machines handle more of our productivity, human value will increasingly derive from our capacity for original expression, cultural creation, emotional resonance, and the kind of meaning-making that gives life richness beyond mere efficiency.

The future is not about those who compete with machines at “machine like” tasks, but to those who can amplify their humanity by asking better questions, imagining more beautiful possibilities, and creating connections that matter.

The AI revolution is here, and it’s revealing a profound truth: the most powerful technology humans have ever created still can’t replicate the magic of human creativity. It can’t dream up what doesn’t exist. It can’t make intuitive leaps that defy logic. It can’t feel what matters, imagine what’s possible, or create meaning from chaos.

The next decade will belong to the creative thinkers because they are doing what AI cannot. They will ask better questions and make unexpected connections. Solving problems that have not been defined. Creating experiences that move people. Imagining futures worth building.

The next decade belongs to the creative thinkers. Make sure you are one of them.

            <h2>Naboo raises $70M to turn AI event planning into corporate procurement platform</h2>
            <p><strong>The Next Web | 2026-02-10</strong></p>
            <a class="original-link" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/naboo-raises-70m">Visit Original Website</a>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--text);">
            <div id="article-text">Paris-headquartered Naboo has raised a $70m in Series B as it accelerates its ambition to become the operating layer for how large companies plan, book, and control corporate events. The round is led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, the same investor that backed Mistral AI in 2023, and lands just a year after Naboo closed a €20m Series A.

Naboo positions itself as an AI-powered procurement platform for corporate events, covering everything from venue booking and travel to supplier coordination and budget control.

Founded in 2022, Naboo built its name on simplifying how companies organise and run corporate events,  from booking venues and catering to logistics and attendee management, using an all-in-one platform that brings speed and transparency to a typically fragmented process.

By folding AI into what is traditionally a fragmented, manual process, the company says it has become Europe’s leading purchasing platform for corporate events, a corner of the broader $400bn global events market that has long resisted software consolidation.

The timing matters. Corporate events sit at the intersection of travel, finance, and operations, yet they are often managed outside standard procurement systems.

The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol&#39; founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It&#39;s free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!

Naboo’s pitch is that events should be treated like any other strategic spend, measurable, optimised, and governed through a single platform. That logic has resonated with large enterprises, particularly in the UK, which has become Naboo’s biggest market outside France following the opening of its London office in 2025.

With fresh capital in hand, Naboo is now stepping more decisively onto the global stage. The company is opening a new hub in New York as part of a broader US expansion, betting that multinational clients want a single system to manage events across regions, teams, and currencies.

Within just three years, Naboo has grown into one of the more visible players in the category, helped by enterprises looking for better control over decentralised spending.

The bigger shift, however, goes beyond events. Naboo plans to extend its AI procurement platform into “tail spend”, the long tail of smaller, harder-to-track purchases that typically fall outside core procurement tools.

In enterprise finance, this is often labelled Class C spending, and while each transaction is small, the total adds up fast. Naboo’s goal is to give companies a unified, AI-driven view of this spend, starting with events and branching outward.

The targets are ambitious. Naboo says it aims to triple revenue in 2026 and to exceed $1bn in business volume by 2027.

Whether it gets there will depend on how far enterprises are willing to centralise spending that has historically lived in spreadsheets and inboxes. What’s clear is that Naboo is betting that the next wave of enterprise AI won’t just analyse data, it will quietly reshape how money is spent.
